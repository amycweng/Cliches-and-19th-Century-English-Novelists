because be member of embassy in london have brought back news that vignerolles held high place in huguenot colony that lived in fine old house at hampstead be generally liked respected among great

amused a much a did utter disregard of ceremony lively way merry unrestrained laughter amuse far away cousin baron who might have be offended by paid attention to what be going on around presence acted rather a damper upon visitor high spirit when alone with girl mother be free to say do what liked felt life be now anxious one brightened by visit when peter vignerolles be appointed to command of newly captured schooner captain of tartar said to a senior midshipman must in case have given command of alert know that will be specially pleased to be in command of now there can be question that position of friend at chteau be most precarious one baron must be mad to compel family to run frightful risk if like to throw away own life well good have no right to expose family to such frightful danger have not excuse of ignorance for score of noble lady have be murdered by bloodthirsty mob may be at last moment there will be chance for to escape if can in way assist to do so without running too much risk think that will be justified in acting authorise to take action because know nothing of circumstance general instruction always have be to give shelter to french royalist to carry to nearest port where can be landed with safety to certainly must not myself hesitate to send boat ashore to take off know first time that paid visit after came out here brought baroness two daughter to see frigate feel therefore personally interested in will be glad to hear that have made escape so that if get message saying that will come down to shore will be more than justified in sending boat for even in running certain amount of risk however must leave matter to discretion thank sir be afraid that baron will take step for own safety permit to leave chteau without still will do anything that possibly can to look after will send young harding with boatswain mate if capture prize have best turn crew adrift in own boat with couple of oar want to cumber with prisoner have better keep prize with until come across again in case five men must be enough to man one of while if be to send down to gibraltar must want petty officer eight ten men cumber with worthless prize burn sink small craft of course if get hold of ship returning full of good from one of colony must be worth convoying there at once so peter vignerolles have sailed away in alert crew being a pleased a be at prospect of expedition on own account away from frigate be disgusting be peter harding who be two year junior to vignerolles said after too have taken look at chteau through glass to think that friend be there

farther west anyhow want to let know that be here will be ready to take off if necessary if want to speak to will tell girl to hang out red curtain from window if want to come off be to hang out white one can make out plainly enough with glass from here of course can not guarantee that will be here when be most needed for doubt gunboat from cette marseille will be patrolling coast besides may be hundred mile away in pursuit of prize however will be satisfaction for to know have done be possible may be comfort to to know that if can find way down to shore signal from there when see will have chance of escape will go in disguise yes took two three suit of clothes from that fishing boat that overhauled yesterday did so on purpose see if one be going on business among what might call civilised people must go in uniform for then if be caught must not be shot a spy among ruffian uniform must be protection for will therefore go in one of fisherman suit see speak french a well a

want to see to come on board with mother know that be hopeless to expect father to accompany there be hope of said since king murder have be worse than ever do think that be going out of mind nothing must induce to fly have armed servant declares that will defend chteau till last be most unfortunate julie for only one end can come of place be not defensible for moment suppose that there be hope of persuading mother to come at once not in least must not ask elder girl replied be de vignerolles too if father think right to remain here will certainly do so can die a hundred of other noble lady have done well a long a father be here suppose can not leave if beds come there be reason why mother must not fly throwing away life will benefit france house when chteau be once taken father prisoner there must be no common sense in hesitating about making escape if there be opportunity of doing so no then must escape if must once in hand of beds there will be little chance of well must be business at rate want to arrange signal can see window of room from sea will be cruising backwards forward sometimes may be away for two three day because have to attend to duty at rate want to hang out red curtain when see come along if wish to see to hang out white curtain a signal that scoundrel be approaching chteau have taken if see white curtain will be pretty sure that will already be

shrubbery at side of house fixed upon spot within forty fifty pace of trunk of large tree will bury thing here do at night melanie certainly will come down a have done now when house be asleep will get shovel during day hide in readiness wo forget signal of course will not want to see unless be not likely father consent to leave country with fear be hopeless indeed melanie still there be

coffee made be sure that must want terribly steward will bring to a soon a have drunk go to bed will have plenty of time to talk in morning so saying left at once went up on deck seeing be so shaken that must break down altogether unless left to anchor be at once got up sail hoisted schooner made way out to sea wind be very light peter said have have hard work lad must do little more must get well off shore before morning even if have not heard gun at marseille of fellow will soon be there with news will be sending couple of gunboat after in so light wind will be more than match for so must tow out ten men who have be on board will man one of boat ten of other after couple of hour other twenty will take place let wounded man be among first ten must look to see who be fit for service

gun asked think gun be heavier than ours have better wait till be sure that be well within range there be sail ahead sir man at mast head shouted down think be frigate thank god for harding might tackle one of gunboat think that must have much chance with two of expect carry double number of men that do frigate have changed course sir harding said be heading straight for now must have heard gun look a if be bringing down breeze with hope that gunboat will not get sight of until be too late for to escape fear be too good to be even hoped for feel sure can manage to keep at bay until come

taste of quality must lay gun on same craft for if can cripple one can fight out with other first shot passed through gunboat sail second be received with loud cheer by crew of alert for striking

shot be fired with le success at last one struck foremast just above deck brought down put out of harding say that if cut gear away at once rowed with oar on side must not go faster through water than be doing must cause delay a doubt think other fellow strong enough to do work alone be likely enough that will set to work to get up jury mast before do anything else other gunboat be now fast closing up jamieson have knocked two three hole in bow must see by confusion caused that two of shot at least swept whole length of deck one of gun having be dismounted several men killed to peter satisfaction saw from course that gunboat be taking that commander intended to fight broadside to broadside before endeavouring to board a came nearly abreast oar be laid in for hour two craft lay to

at stern window that enemy will be aiming at end of half hour during furious cannonade continued vessel have suffered good deal gunboat cannon being of heavier metal than of schooner at close quarter advantage be not very great be more than counterbalanced by much greater speed with english sailor handled gun side of vessel be torn splintered there be yawning hole in bulwark sail dropping idly for wind have entirely failed be riddled with hole gaff of gunboat mainsail have be shot asunder foremast have be so badly wounded that must certainly be carried away directly breeze filled sail schooner bowsprit have be carried away gaff halliard of mainsail cut asunder execution among french crew be very much heavier than among british a there be so many more of on deck became evident at last that frenchman be getting worst of duel for fire suddenly slackened sweep be run out again clap charge of grape in over shot peter shouted be easy matter for frenchman to get alongside owing to vessel being so close together at first rowed on side power of helm be not sufficient to bring suddenly round instead of coming alongside crossed schooner bow gun of larboard side of alert be trained a far forward a possible poured content into gunboat a swept across while a soon a with greatest difficulty lugger brought head round in order to board on starboard side gun here swept deck killing great number of men at sweep at last after suffering very heavy loss french captain brought craft alongside moment that did so peter crew leapt on board with loud cheer french be already greatly disheartened at terrible loss that have suffered although greatly superior in number gave way foot by foot when captain who have fought gallantly got bullet through head threw down arm rushed below

heavy loss to mob of course have general order to give shelter to royalist trying to make escape from france admiralty might not perhaps approve of quite such dangerous expedition a that undertook

open place in front of be flooded by glorious splendour of full moon what strange scene be upon eye lit even a heard sweetheart murmur god be praised at least be not slain yet strange scene indeed though with ludicrous side to one might have made laugh maybe at other time if have not be concerned deeply in be doing for there be brave courageous servitor man who have be wandering sailor a well a soldier also faithful follower of hardly treated race standing up manfully against swordsman who be making swift pass at fighting across body of third who lay prone prostrate with giles foot upon body that last be fact must have made laugh in other circumstance for swiftly recalled how in day of childhood very giles have taken to see barton in one of mr sotherne beautiful tragedy at theatre in lincoln inn field how when actor struck villain down exactly in middle of stage have placed foot upon chest waved triumphant sword over fallen one recalled too how giles have applauded have said o master adrian master adrian be way to conquer to subdue villain illustration fighting across body of third who lay prone prostrate with giles foot upon body now poor faithful honest fool have struck villain down with foot upon villain chest in splendid tragic theatrical manner be a like to strike one down ere long for even a tore open little door rushed out followed by damaris disarmed other fighter lunged at missing heart yet brought to knee while drew back sword once more to plunge through other body stop rang out princess voice clear imperious stop man command adrian forbid be prince whispered in ear recognised voice easily in garden why asked hot excited now why stop why must midnight assassin be spared 't be csaba tell said be prince if be slain there can never be lowered voice more deeply still union betwixt england spain hold weapon giles cried understanding in moment what must convey in honest truth not deeming contemptible prince life worth cost of broken union 'twixt englishman spanish girl who loved other hold up be still say obedient to command perhaps obedient also to earlier haughtier command uttered in girl clear tone giles did hold yet muttering while doing so that must have be through other lung in moment so monseigneur sweetheart said addressing masked prince who now rose from off knee on to have be beaten be content to play part of murderer be on serving man for shame wore master cloak deep muffled voice said until master appeared just now at side thought be fighting with therefore confederate glanced at dead man at foot sought to murder wherefore ay wherefore repeated damaris because loved loved nay said softly did not love then think did though in honesty will say deemed brightest most worthy pleasant man have ever known now now came from pair of lip from csaba from mine now love other man will ever have heart for moment there be silence amongst though stole hand towards that of damaris finding held fast yet little later csaba muttered be impossible be beneath now though have heard sweet word of girl only moment before latter one angered drove beside for be weary of hearing so often that englishman be unworthy to be mate of one matter how high that one might be placed wherefore furious stepping up to man prince who skulked about in night with secret murder in heart said bending face forward so that be very near to doing so with desire to give weight to word hark have heard word before now unless be arrant cur such a assassin always be will retract will cram down throat for if say that not only also englishman high low gentle simple be not equal of foreigner even though be prince of austria of spain then lie say lie do hear lie while even a started staggered back clutching cloak convulsively with hand held fold together continued now if there be fight left in after defeat have received at hand of simple honest english peasant take sword in hand let see whether will justify word swallow mine then turning to giles said pick up fellow weapon give to exclaimed damaris while looking round a giles did a bade saw standing by pale like statue yet with beautiful eye ablaze will not fight with adrian prince a be ala of land be unworthy to cross sword with a for said addressing csaba begone begone from off place belongs to hotel be mine let never see face again go said stamping foot on rough cobblestone go say yet still did not move instead stood there looking like great black statue in long cloak mask with head bent towards ground so concluded knew not what to do in pride rage be determined not to quit ground at order seeing a told afterwards understanding very well tempest must be raging in heart said come adrian since will not go must wherefore went back to house followed by giles leaving prince of csaba miranda vitoria still standing in open space before little door now story be done done be unless must desire to tell what doubtless can very well imagine namely that be not long before princess became man wife yet hard enough that marriage be in making can assure one thought must never be completed for although girl having once acknowledged that loved be a willing to be wife a be eager to have form ceremony have to go through to get what giles called triced up be enough to irritate one of damaris own saint for there be consul of spain consul of by hated philip v to be invoked english ambassador to be consulted who since represented king george be not agreeable to permission of archbishop of lyon primate of france to be obtained permission sent over from england from archbishop of canterbury head of church went through kind of ceremony be half married week before be finally allowed to consider man wife while became very irritable through damaris muttered kind of strange little expletive in spanish through pretty teeth scarlet lip told afterwards must not have sounded so nicely in english also must not forget to say that giles signed countless paper parchment a witness looked very important over whispered line of love ballad to at interval to cheer up ate enormously at opportunity offered however done be at last be wedded although wife must not take to of great possession because must not set foot in spain while philip ruled must not take to home in staffordshire where trent rise because of political principle be very well content since be young hopeful so settled down in old paris house of carbajals in marais have up to now lived happy ever after a chapbooks say happiness may be very sure be not ruffled when heard that prince of csaba miranda vitoria have married princess of ancient house of ponte casoria be allied to greater house of bourbon who be extremely rich a wizened a monkey a wife told who report declared led csaba terrible life outlaw fortune by w c whistler forest dweller outlaw may be master cork said must have remember be honest man before be driven here honest man be still though must need be in hiding for speaking up for weaker side honest men slay king deer sneered cork seems to that have run into fair noose by time for fine talk seeing that deer slaying be hanging matter for king be king whether choose to own not hungry men can not stay to think of answered shortly knew that be right must need with honest door closed to go on sinking in mire a be hungry forsooth said gold to be have to night for picking up come with say forest will know no longer listen yonder fall more bedizened noble with good gold noble in purse moreover to prove nobility have heard plainly enough cold wind of maytime set from far off hexham level to where be standing under shadow of blockhill not for first time day heavy sound of cannon came down like yet unlike thunder there be battle on hand between white rose red margaret of anjou be making one more struggle for herself son husband against edward of york outlaw fallen a be said bitterly will have share in robbing dead then thought of what ruffian have proposed to came over in horror that must prowl over field of battle when night fell seek for rich among quiet slain shrank from whereat grinned evilly that turned contempt to wrath so that hand went to hilt of broad forester hanger that wore away with said will have more of well well be not so hasty pray did jest stammered giving back pace two knew better true man jest with such thing told so once more bidding begone well will go growled mind there be reward for who brings deer slayer to justice can do a like about earning that answered seems one to how get wealth so that come easily so went looking back now then to see suppose if be in earnest took bow from tree where have set plucked arrow from slain deer at foot at hastened to put a many tree trunk between a possible lost sight of fell to brittling deer quickly when be gone for be by mean so sure that must not set sheriff on a have hinted did not think likely that quiet old worthy must trouble about with battle raging at very door a one might say so far have heard nothing of must come go into town pretty freely when must though chance of yorkist from own country seeing be ever present danger kept out of sight a much a possible if did go still there be thing needed must be bought there now then must be hard to have place closed to now thought just a well to get deer have killed to cave in case have to go into hiding be glad that old distrust of man cork have kept from telling of when first knew be about two year ago when have to fly from yorkshire with price on head a lancastrian while who have come to take lighted way north across moor by burning own stronghold little peel tower of have be a proud a of old name of barvill dared own no longer behind have taken part in strife of rose having enough fighting from time to time with scot raider who have slain father six year ago have always be brought up to reverence king henry made secret thereof be quite enough to ruin in day when york first have upper hand meant to keep so at last have wandered to hexham moorland where none knew where game be in plenty on hillside in forest whence ranger lord have gone by reason of war here too have found by chance cave of have spoken under slope of blockhill close to brook run in valley be so warm dry so easily hidden that bided in first winter of outlawry taking kindly to forest life a strong man of twenty two who love open have none to think for will here have bided for second winter ranging country widely in summer even a far a scottish border gathering thereby knowledge of by path be to be useful to others besides in time maybe must have joined company of border knight at last for good spear be always welcome without question there be to be service for a will be seen there be other men outlaw also whom must meet in forest being barvill proud have nought much to do with be men ruined by war like more be robber at best outlawed for misdeed kept away from town laying wait for harmless traveller packman in wild pass there be other way of making what money one needed wherewith to buy bread arrowhead wine clothing than by robbery herein master cork saw chance of profit if not in very honest way be small householder on outskirt of town must buy stolen deerskin game at own price sell at distant market doubtless to great advantage therefore be useful to saw often enough though a say always distrusted to day wood be full of deer have killed nearer home than usual for suppose that great battle of hedgley of have heard have driven hither in terror now with fresh battle on hand wood must be deserted by therefore have taken first chance came thus cork have stumbled across first on way to find associate for night work have told that be not whom be seeking specially made great show of friendship in telling plan after have gone got venison to cave cooked for supper then sat on stream bank watched bird beast for while before slept sound of battle have long ceased mind heard cuckoo evening for first time that year be late even for north then went into cave built up mouth in way have found best troubled more about anything suppose that be hour after have gone to sleep with darkness when dog growled woke roused at once quieted then went to little opening left for fresh air in stone with closed cave listened at first heard nothing though night be clear still there be wind coming however for cloud be racing across sky under bright moon dog be not wont to rouse for nothing be sure that there must be somewhat to find out then a waited there came far off shout then clear through air woman scream then more shouting silence if have be shouting only must have thought little of for knew that pursuit of flying might pas way woman voice roused without staying to think armed hurried away towards place whence noise seemed to come ancient trackway worn by age of timber hauling lay in direction be likely that fugitive who have taken a road away from pursuer might have fallen in with of robber outlaw at least might be able to help side have woman to protect if thing went badly for went very quickly knowing wood so well heard nothing more until reached little rise overlooked hollow in old lane ran then voice a of men quarrelling be plain enough now then to left a stood still to listen woman voice be not to be heard among however began to think that there be need for to trouble about business still waited for few minute then dog warned that one be at hand turned woman be coming straight towards across little glade leading with boy whose foot seemed to fail for weariness surely thought for moment a moonlight glinted on rich dress showed tall stately seeming unafraid that saw vision of lady so wondrous looked one a neared unfaltering for indeed have now escaped from hand of men have heard to meet with armed wild looking a be with unkempt lock beard of forest life might well have be fresh cause for fear to two such helpless one yet woman never stayed though must have seen plainly a saw cloud passed over moon for moment when light came again be close on then saw that dress be torn disordered that have indeed be in gentle hand for must do naught doff steel cap before for be most queenly woman have ever seen illustration be son of king charge with care then spoke to low quickly drawing slender handsome boy before towards friend be margaret queen be son of king charge with care see that be worthy of such honour then a stared at in amazement stepping back pace added hide in forest till danger be past hereafter palace will be free to baron of england will be if will see be fitting that prince of wale must wander with attendant be on one knee before by time needing thinking of promise of reward honour be enough that be asked for help by who have be to yet be highest in land heart ached that must have to seek for succour from such a on life be queen margaret stammered will give life for willingly then a dog growled fiercely at fresh burst of noise came from road making young prince shrink from leapt up rousing to danger close at hand for queen must be sought for directly follow pray madam said be not far to safe place come prince be weary fear not good hound let carry aye friend be aweary said with little smile be sorely heavy for be armed moreover weight of slight boy of twelve be nothing took up laughing to reassure queen followed without word went back to place by way have come surely strangest saddest little company in england marvel how queen kept up in rough walk until cave be reached never faltered once pressed on boar spear that carried that might use a staff must not have never so much a put out hand to arm when stumbled over root jutting rock be rough road for dared take path lest must be more easily followed way listened for voice of men who hunted heard none so came to cave without mischance be safe set half sleeping prince on heather covered bank while pulled away stone of entrance queen stood by watching thought how other woman have surely sunk down to rest after weary flight seemed tireless in a in else that took in hand when way be clear prayed to enter took hand of prince led in without word while followed hanging great wild bull skin used a curtain across a yet unblocked doorway that light might betray place fire still smouldered in far corner where fathomless cleft in rock took smoke far into heart of hill lost there stirred to blaze have long ago so screened with stone wall from doorway might use safely for have mind to be in comfort when spent winter here indeed to at least cave seemed homelike enough there be couch of springy heather skin covered warmly blanketed flat topped stone be seat table be set in order deerskin be on also bow quiver spare arm be on wall with antlered skull two be used to bare stone wall in old tower in bygone day yet a watched weary face of queen knew how wretched must seem to be fit place for madam said be safe when daylight come again people will be searching for will meet bring to will be well fled from even now said in cold voice here even know name of friend who have come by chance to name be richard barvill madam said be good to own honest old name once more will say even before queen have cause to be ashamed of being forest dweller only because of trouble added lest thought of being in hand of wrong doer might cause trouble presently when left passed beyond sight one must not tell what fear of treachery might come into mind because of trouble repeated softly say that be main cause of yet have share in bearing for sake looked towards young prince who be now asleep in earnest on couch where have thrown at once when came in made answer for be beyond though did think that now perhaps for first time queen understood rightly plight of many whom war have ruined instead of replying busied in bringing out setting on table best food have in place then stood to wait pleasure there be cold venison good wheaten bread one flask of red wine if platter be wooden cup of pewter be bad meal for one who be hungry with forest hunger when queen saw that be ready rose up from seat have taken beside fire thanked a roused prince then served a best knew how presently queen spoke to of what might do next now be outlaw forester even a friend said with wan smile for once have plan in mind for be helpless here tell what can do now have be thinking of even a crossed forest there be one two thing must know so begged leave to ask somewhat gave then learnt how have fled from battle with few attendant of rank carrying with of crown jewel other treasure meaning to make for scotch border in old lane servant have fled at first attack prince have be dragged from horse roughly handled for sake of jewel then captor have forgotten in quarrel over treasure in waggon have be able to slip away with prince then friend met with thought of robber queen learns to read face there be that in yours told that must trust so be here in safety day will know margaret of anjou doe not forget friend queen margaret said there be many thing to be seen before deserve such name from will try to earn then because did not rightly know what else to say asked if plunderer be yorkists outlaw rather answered decidedly york men have not let escape for to take have be worth more than treasure to be there one who wore badge of white rose name of leader called cork will not forget so man must have followed treasure if not queen from field if knew there might be trouble in store saw that if ever red rose bloomed again cork case must be hard one at least yorkists be not scouring wood in search of queen be good hearing probably be only man who knew that be in unless cork guessed that woman who have slipped through hand be if did so however must be likely to keep knowledge to in order to have credit of what must expect to be easy capture presently madam said think that there will be no great search for a yet yorkists will believe to have escaped servant will take word that be prisoner will be long day before mistake be found out army of york will pas on people will scatter go north in little party will meet with here be safe may sleep in peace even be to hear voice of men searching for close at hand for secret of cave be mine only now must go pray to be content until return with news in morning must close cave carefully thereafter answer call save that of name barvill for be known here to none save then knelt kissed hand be going asked very kindly friend barvill what of have taken place for sake again be homeless have other hiding place if need answered now have work to do for sake prince went out of cave built up doorway a be wont when left for long time with queen word of thanks in ear more than else might bind to be that not so much a by look did show one sign of distrust of of word when work be done so that even from yard two away one might not tell that cave be there went away left dog in hollow tree be one of hiding place to be used then took way to hexham to learn what might be close on midnight when came there yet town be alive with men a if be fair time house be lighted up great fire round be gathered group of noisy men burned in market place in wider street one must have thought that army be gathered there to drink after victory be only straggler for camp be on battlefield mile to southward of men wore badge of white rose however in form other to mix with must do likewise when found that out have not far to seek for what needed man lay in dark doorway sleeping after overmuch ale borrowed from did not so much a stir when took twisted scrap of rag stood for proud rose of york from arm pinned to own so marked went boldly to market place followed press of men into chief inn of place in order to get can of ale might be welcome at one of fire where must best hear what be to be told inside tavern be confusion good old host tapster being hard put to with noisy crowd thronging for ale must not be drawn fast enough knew old man by repute well knew orphan niece fair mistress annot whose face when stayed at mill where be welcome made feel loneliness overmuch at time for did not scorn forest man with whom cousin miller have friendly dealing so a throng shouted pushed round thought of girl terror with wild mob in house came over must hing for presently got can of ale went out across to big fire sat down in place left vacant when man rose none heeded for there be constant coming going there be many thing be not of revelry after victory saw a sat listened one two house have be wrecked of known lancastrian a one must think one be burning out fired early in day many time saw party bringing in wounded men more than once hush fell on who

frightened said can not rightly understand be sent for ay sent of answered soldier promptly miller must not come in time like quickly mistress will catch will go with said be cold must find cloak there be time for now barred door be splintering a men swung bench against that sight decided bade lead hurried out into lane away down in direction opposite to in market place lay across end of lane crowd that scuffle have attracted be gathering thickly for reason perhaps lane be empty knew that must not be long before outsider must take part in wrecking tavern then rush must be made to back of course outside gate soldier halted more lass in house asked have gone annot answered uncle man be who stayed when cannon began morning rest left thy uncle eh poor lass poor lass come away said on where do take comrade out of town to mill mile more eastward down river will be safe going enough for can get away by by lane so went on hastily meeting few people at hour in dark alley of town be soon across breach in old useless wall in quiet meadow along tyne side annot walked quickly firmly enough though be hard put to not to weep now then have hardly gone breadth of two meadow beyond last cottage when trumpet call rang sharply through night soldier pricked up ear ho comrade be wanted must get back call be for guard changing name be never missing on roll call said good luck go with be safe now forgive pretty lass if told bad news over roughly just now can ken worst once with nodded to be off turned to call once more name of john sykes of birkbeck company bring word how fare there

of peel in old day so kept remembrance of name a be master peel said be true that soldier said true be mistress annot fear presently will go back find out for certain sobbed little hurried on be not long before saw mill heard rush of water through sluice a one might have expected there be light to be seen about house when came to door found that open seemed strange to at least of ill omen at time of trouble annot who knew way of place went into dark entry called softly there be answer came out to again suppose that miller have gone to see to sluice leaving door open a often will will be back anon will go up to wife room wake that may not be frightened then added think have much to thank for master peel must not stay now tried to say that thanks be needed be gone into darkness of stairway must not call after lingered for did not like silence open door at be right in doing so for in few minute be back calling to with fear in voice have found lantern in accustomed place have lighted in dim light saw that be more terrified than even in town master peel cried breathlessly house be empty in disorder what can be wrong what will do illustration master peel cried house be empty in disorder be plain to then that poor folk have fled from raid of yorkist troop possibly house have be searched for fugitive miller arrested with unfortunate found on place a sympathiser must not say so at once let make certain said maybe be in mill went round building called there be answer anywhere while be thinking what must do now for poor girl who be thus dependent on perhaps have other friend in town if lived in broad street dared not take back through mob whose way must not grow quieter a night went on if have other refuge outside town be well have not be there house to dared go in hexham now have to ask directly for be plain that mill be deserted will say that met trouble bravely will bide here said mayhap will come back now that be quiet at first plan seemed good then remembered that first place where purveyor for army must seek for forage of sort must be in miller store there must be real refuge here for more than few hour of darkness left then of course a thought of keeping guard here remembrance of what cave held came back to plainly can not say that have ever be forgotten trouble have seemed passing one now that found more than that other duty came forward again even a realised that owed to queen first saw what might do for annot girl have trusted must trust entirely for with a attendant queen must at least feel captivity le annot said there be one place to can take where will be safe till be quiet again there will be with lady who be fugitive like from people looked at eagerly answered at once take there pray master peel trust to in thing ay now trust must be altogether on side for if take to lady be putting greatest of secret in charge if poor lady be hiding alone let go to answered then may feel that own trouble have brought help to truly have trusted good friend for from moment came here knew that must not have be sent for a soldier said will answer with trust for trust said come will borrow cloak blanket from mill that may go warmly then went in place have not be plundered gathered thing must be of use to queen also be glad of chance of thus getting food other comfort without having to ask for so perhaps drawing suspicion on at last asked annot if miller have wine by chance plenty said wondering must not take that may need said lady will need more be one to whom nothing must be refused almost do speak a if be queen be speaking of queen said plainly be alone girl said with wide sad eye oh have asked to go to even from uncle house must have gone then too gathered thing hurried at last be on way to cave a went told how have met with queen gave many instruction a to care of hiding like might have le to say in queen presence be long way day be breaking when came there queen answered from within to call of own name now how two met can hardly say for told queen whom have brought a opened cave mouth when saw look of thanks gave saw annot fall on knee kiss hand turned away with sort of lump in throat for even night alone in place be home to have brought look to face of margaret of anjou be terrible so went aside little way sat down until annot called then went back spoke long with queen that said need not be set down how queen mourned over news must need give end of be be to seek out sire de brez leader of angevin levy bring here must be patient now with annot to cheer therefore went day among outlaw hearing what knew of flight at last heard of de brez a foreigner who have passed through forest then saw march of yorkist army from hexham towards coast heart grew lighter for going none have seen cork day so have not be scouring wood presently went to place where queen have be robbed waggon be yet in lane empty cork men must have gone away with plunder went into hexham at place be in confusion wretchedness there be many who have be plundered of learnt without going to market place that annot uncle be indeed slain tavern have be wrecked worse though told that several men have lost life in riot before provost marshal have ended too late now a passed down lane on way back to forest came suddenly on two men who sat under hedge heard word two of talk before saw be not speaking english at once hoped that have found of de brez men so gave good night using password that queen have taught word that spoke of hope to cause of red rose if man knew made in trouble like two year ago good even friend one have wished for brighter sunset ay morn may be redder one answered in good english enough red morning be sign of storm said passing on storm be needed to clear air replied then rose may bloom once more with two leapt up followed when caught up passed word two for certainty then spoke freely enough then learnt that have met with none other than de brez squire varennes who have come back to seek lost queen leaving few follower in nook of hill to wait return what joy be when heard have to tell how met queen be beyond writing have heavy news for poor annot filled thought now that care of queen seemed to be shifted from shoulder for little bore very bravely having made up mind for worst told that now must bide with queen a long a have need of have promised same to de brez for must guide flight across moor well so be content for must be at hand to help annot if be while doubtless queen must find place in great house in scotland be asked now varennes went to men presently be planned well so that in grey of next morning rode safely northward joining presently duke of exeter other noble with men thus making strong party against attack even a thought that be well there rose one shadow to dim content though hardly knew why across moor rode toward one man who hastened to put stretch of boggy land between before met be natural enough in place time so that paid heed to a passed nearer knew be cork thought a reined up stared after that recognised queen a captive that what have found in waggon have told whom have lost said nothing however for have time to waste in chasing must not see what harm must do since ride a hard a might must not bring force on in time to stay passing border yet a say brought feeling a of ill omen be uneasy until must see no longer thought that lingered a if watching though indeed one might have wondered if man did not do so now journey be safe unhindered well be thanked for guidance thought must be dismissed when reached scotland queen herself asked if must not remain in service taking place a barvill must among gentleman at arm for must prove that be not ungrateful for what have done for prince one may suppose that gladly did so more willingly must be near annot if truth be told thus for good ill fortune be cast in with margaret of anjou thought that trouble be over maybe one may say that be for trouble to come yet be queen though have part in be different matter to being outlaw on one own account outlaw a be in truth poor mistress be yet in sharing distress be truest honour for sooner be over border than learnt that that queen must hope for be to be unnoticed at most surrender of berwick must have made scotland lasting friend have be forgotten in new treaty made with york be warned that might even be given up to so rode westward along border until came to kirkcudbright where queen have be in hiding before there bided in poor lodging enough a nothing more than noble lancastrian lady with household none knew to be queen even be to be recognised supposed that scot king must hear no more than knew already of whereabouts so resting there passed quiet week then one day a wandered on town quay watching vessel alongside remembrance of cork be brought back to by walk bearing of man who be boarding small trading bus back be towards seemed to be seaman altogether suppose because thought of cork be always unpleasant to asked who yon man might be be told that be master of bus given name also so be somewhat angry with for letting ruffian a former acquaintance trouble mind at thought more of that evening went in attendance on de brez beyond town to house of friend of cause in order to learn whether there be better tidings for queen from edinburgh there be none walked back to town by same road have passed in going be thing that outlaw learns not to do for plain reason enough be not very dark road be not lonely a came near town for two men struck from by path remained fifty yard behind talking laughing freely so that thought lively company just where street down passed come to quay grows narrow at corner house three men be quarrelling in half drunken sort of way however stumbled aside a came near lest must oblige leader to pas too close to dropped back pace two went quickly then one of men seemed to push sent falling right across de brez foot causing to stumble heavily sprang forward to save from fall in moment be down also with weight of several men on two men have run up from behind have thrown shouted tried to reach dagger be pinioned gagged quickly de brez be being treated in same way then men set on foot first man eye lit on be cork did not know because half face be covered with thick cloth besides that longer wore wild hair beard of forest then knew that be indeed whom have seen morning now be in hand helpless a men dragged across quay to vessel place be deserted for townsfolk did not love late hour took on board bus half threw into small ill smelling fore peak under high forecastle through low door under break of deck down three step bound a be stumbled must not save so fell headlong with de brez on head came heavily against timber be knew for time when came round be free so far a bond be concerned be in same place de brez be beside in dark vessel be certainly at sea making way against light head wind for though be steady went about rolled against comrade whereat asked pardon why be well answered in low voice for sens have suffered hurt thought neck might be broken for when have managed to wrench own bond off free never stirred now what may mean put to sea directly after be taken have be out of harbour for two hour so illustration shouted tried to reach dagger told what knew of cork then seemed plain to that have trapped for sake of price be on head that for de brez taking being very great a one might suppose must therefore be on way to england be pleasant thought considering fate of so many of queen best follower think likely that be taken for varennes who be far more valuable a one might say than why then said de brez will come presently offer freedom if will promise to behave then may see if anything can be done to make bargain not on one side a have use of hand already saw what meant began to plan many way of surprising captor seemed a well to be slain in making bold try for liberty a to be given up to york to be beheaded must wait for daylight so tried to sleep in turn though know if of did so presently sun rose light streamed through chink of bulkhead closed break of deck crept to one of looked aft there be three men to be seen one of whom be cork helmsman on high poop cork third man be on main deck leaning against rail be bulwark went round waist be armed how many more men there might be must not tell vessel be small thought that five who have taken might be whole crew de brez came peered out also so far there be only two to one said for helmsman can not leave place if can settle with two with rush rest come easily enough where will find weapon must see be sweep of vessel twenty foot oar rested on chock amidships be not lashed pointed out saying that one might handle well a one us border spear at de brez made up mind thought so well bound that door be only latched said with chuckle be ready at word answered well then go first take oar from right side of mast make for right hand man do take left then will clear one turned up long sleeve shook hand with be out through low door in moment with at heel have long oar in hand be charging two men before knew that be not of own crew then cork shouted drew sword making for just a comrade levelled weapon struck man fairly in chest so that doubled up with howl be hurled under rail into sea perhaps sudden shifting of deck a helmsman threw vessel head into wind put out for missed cork in moment be inside guard have hard work for time to keep away from sword using oar a quarter staff then got fair blow at from aloft ended score between in good time for de brez be fighting two more men who have come on deck from forward hatch have sword of first man have set on one might see that be master of weapon two to one be unfair however thought that helmsman might take part so swept one of two overboard with lucky swing of oar de brez ended matter with other at once whereon helmsman cried for quarter be plain that there be more men on board then a de brez looked at one door of cabin under high poop opened in frightened pale stood annot gave little cry of relief when saw sprang towards illustration got fair blow at from aloft what be richard said using name for first time thus how be here answered before of have replied stately figure crossed rough threshold of cabin queen herself be before looking on body of slain with disdainful eye in be fear for field of battle be not new to there be ever hope for red rose while have such arm to strike for said a de brez knelt before in wonder then learnt almost a soon a be taken queen prince have be decoyed from house by crafty message purporting to come from dying lancastrian who must fain see before passed varennes have gone to edinburgh to seek for tidings of king so taking only annot with queen have gone out only to be seized hurried on board bus have at once put to sea doubtless cork have meant to take captive to england for sake of great reward must be if foreboding concerning be justified have met desert at hand then made helmsman put about be soon back in harbour with light breeze have kept vessel in sight of land in favour now in few day varennes returned be plain that help must be looked for from scotland be known where king be for many long day then must wander from place to place in hiding always until at last on short sea passage on east coast stress of storm took to flanders then came end of trouble for though duke of burgundy be foe be noble one sent queen home to own people in anger in honour at last here annot wife serve yet

week month past of being dogged at step by secret treachery sleepless murder slowly surely entangled in ever tightening net of silent viewless implacable hatred in truth there be sorer trial of nerve

molest englishman must pay dearly for insolence mean be ready to hand for garrison have just be strongly reinforced being of last importance in disturbed state of whole country to secure so important post a huttee ghur so long a english held must be effectual curb on surrounding population old soldier eye sparkled with stern approval a saw filing into fort three four squadron of rajput horse than whom there be better rider harder fighter in india several company of rohilla foot men whom greatest leader have rightly declared to be best of sepoys at cold steel with such men at back colonel must have faced whole native army lost time in scouring jungle in quest of skulking foe style of campaigning must have sorely displeased learned gentleman who sitting at home in england over book diagram

thought of of men deserting worse still deserting to join gang of hindu robber soon have something else to think of for a summer be drawing to close little freddy fell suddenly ill then be seen change such a fort have never known since british redcoat first garrisoned more song laughter more coarse joke boisterous oath rough soldier went to fro a silently a shadow officer sat over evening cigar without uttering word man who crossed barrack square after dark ever failed to look up instinctively at light burned in upper room of colonel quarter showing where life death be contending for bright eyed boy whom knew loved a if to sweep away last hope heat of memorable summer endured longer than oldest man must recollect even night be a sultry a day slowly surely poor little life withered away though kind hearted doctor who have always be special friend of little favourite wore to shadow in striving to save stern father never quitted for instant save when duty called sick bed on lay that have left to love a if there war men enough 'ere to die plenty a must be better spared growled big soldier one evening then to go pick out 'im hold yer jaw ca yer broke in second man savagely sha die

if in presence of superior rough fellow said in voice that vainly tried to steady o god jist let off once do what like with of amen amen echoed comrade with one voice having offered up that strange supplication poor fellow actually felt somewhat le despondent without knowing why just then colonel hardman tall form be seen to issue from door of quarter come straight toward 'ere come said one of men eagerly will go ax how little 'un be be crazy jim cried man beside catching by arm be fool lad if be tiger in or'nary way what d s'pose will be now care said jim barlow desperately here go stepping right up to dreaded commandant saluted said huskily beg pardon sir be better white rigid face looked vacantly at for moment like one just aroused from sleep hardly understanding yet what be said to then grim man replied in low weak voice thank man for asking be better jim went back to comrade in lowest stage of depression be afeared be up boy said old blue beard never have spoke to so civil in truth during last few day stricken father misery be such that even who hated most deeply might well have pitied for torture on earth can compare with unendurable torment of being forced to witness suffering of helpless child when powerless to alleviate in way have seen strong men die in agony with none to help at least knew what be in store for faced like men pitying asking pity from others child can not tell why suffers why suffering can not be removed look instinctively to for relief unable to conceive that be not powerful enough to help have seen sight only too often pray god may never see like again now a if iron man be doomed to feel in turn full bitterness of pain that merciless harshness have so often inflicted upon others poor little sufferer ceaseless cry be for dear old bob burton very man whom listening father ill judged severity have driven forth into jungle to herd with thief murderer perhaps to die like beast perish bob dear bob do put hand on head cool doe burn so doctor ca do anything said colonel in fierce whisper seizing other wrist in convulsive clutch made very joint crackle be always fond of ca help somehow god know must if must replied doctor despairingly be beyond there be only one man in india who must deal with case even know where be just now night day went by brought end nearer still overwrought doctor who be on point of breaking down crept out about nightfall for breath of fresh air that so much needed ere have be gone five minute came hurrying back with face so startlingly changed that colonel sprang up from place by sick bed caught by hand though question that must have asked died upon lip god be thanked said doctor there be chance for yet have just got word that friend skilman whom spoke of yesterday a only man here must deal with case have suddenly arrived at kalipur must send off swift messenger for at once will go said hardman stepping towards door began dismayed doctor through whose mind flashed instantly possible consequence of commandant absence from post just when might be attacked at moment colonel put aside strong man like infant said in tone though barely above whisper be terribly distinct talk to be

jo hookum be order gone without murmur to certain death from first to last that match against time with death be like one of wild feverish dream in be for ever rushing at full speed over boundless waste without advancing single foot nearer to goal on on mile after mile passing with bewildering suddenness from darkness to moonlight from moonlight into darkness again now splashing through swollen stream now plunging down into gloomy hollow now bursting with crash through mass of tangled creeper now checking horse barely in time on brink of yawning chasm once light waved by hindu made kind of broken rainbow on scaly bulk of monstrous snake coiled round tree above thrust out huge flat head with angry hiss only to draw back in affright at sudden glare farther on two flaming eye broke gloom

that experience narrated be absolutely authentic have certainly be through kind of adventure that ingenuity of humorous destiny must have invented at expense adventure with lion with elephant with matabele warrior peril by water by land in word kind of experience likely to interest enthral listener have be though perhaps listener of age of bruce be most delighted by tale pleased almost equally listener of age for bore stamp of truth be natural therefore that young bruce soon began to look upon sturdy old stranger a hero of first water king among men person to be admired loved imitated if opportunity must ever arise mental condition on part of bruce be confirmed by new story of triumph over lion other beast of barely escaped capture by matabele other bad character be while in midst of exciting tale of night spent in bare veldt within hundred two pace of entire matabele impi during whole of time dared not sleep scarcely allowed to breathe lest must hear of how at critical moment

straighter harder farther in case be wanted come how doe one steer what about horse be obviously useless to waste argument upon old fellow mind be made up be quickly decided to let have way more so since a matter of fact be convenient enough that must go rather than gerston whose place be undoubtedly at side of wife daughter at head of who must assist to defend life property so uncle ben be duly instructed a to road to thomson farm now became evident that description intended to direct ride of twenty five mile over veldt be apt to bewilder a much a to enlighten that old fellow mind have be considerably mixed by instruction a to way must go on reaching belt of jungle that kopje 'd better let go with father said persistent bruce cleverest veldt traveller might lose way between here thomson will surely be right with uncle ben can give revolver in case of accident can bet last sovereign nothing will happen to while old ben caldecott breath be in body added old fellow if be going to be hurt then be dead first mind mashona beggar wo catch napping may bet besides lad must run quite a much risk at home to day a riding over veldt seeing a how ai going to be let alone to sleep comfortably in bed presently after little opposition from weeping mother hotly combated by bruce almost a hotly by kittie who be for giving bruce chance of showing spirit distinguishing lad be allowed to get ready for departure preparation be in full swing for defence of house a adventurous pair rode out upon dangerous enterprise scrap of cover within one hundred fifty yard of house be being cut down removed in order that nigger when came must advance over open area well watched easily swept by bullet of defender besides barbed wire be stretched here there across open space tightly fastened to peg about one foot in height in order to trip up enemy in case of rush when in confusion of overthrow defender must have opportunity to fire several time into brown a gerston expressed before must have recovered within house everything be made a secure a possible against assault battery rifle shot gun including two magazine rifle be loaded placed in position laid down for only three window being left unshuttered for use of sharpshooter have be intended to run up kind of earthwork surmounted by barbed wire one hundred yard from house a first line of defence when native labourer be summoned to help in work not one of be to be found significant fact caused gerston to look very grave rascal have have news of rising then said messenger must have arrived almost a soon a ours eh botley botley be last arrival who have brought disconcerting news of danger threatening before probably replied must wonder if be one of beauty that treated to little hole in shoulder on way to join murderous band fellow will presently bring down here to knock head off in gratitude for benefit conferred set of scurvy thankless godless black devil that be without native labourer be quite impossible to undertake anything requiring so much expenditure in time hard labour a earth defence scheme have therefore to be abandoned meanwhile may leave gerston little group of brave english heart to defend home life a best can against overwhelming force might be brought against good british spirit will not quail may assure though must fight against odds might well appal heart le easily daunted than therefore leave with confidence to enterprise while follow step of oddly assorted pair to whose share have fallen duty of riding out into unknown danger maybe to unavoidable disaster death in order to carry message of coming peril to unsuspecting compatriot twenty five mile away rather than allow neighbour to be surprised perhaps fallen upon ruthlessly murdered for want of word of warning be late in afternoon when two set out upon journey well armed with rifle revolver mounted upon two fastest horse that gerston stable must supply young bruce be wild with delight scarcely perhaps realising full peril of enterprise in have be so eager to take part spoke little during first hour ride being anxious to push on a fast a possible during waning daylight bruce led way rode so rapidly that after while companion bade pull up bit be bad policy youngster whispered to box strength away in first round look at beast be badly blown be case horse be not accustomed to present headlong

there may be said other well wait till there be then see if funk before insult replied bruce in indignation spoke more for next five minute though uncle ben said be likely lad attempted to conciliate with other similar compliment descended however from lofty pedestal of offended dignity when uncle ben suddenly stopped in middle of sentence stood silent listening what be what d'you hear asked bruce forgetting dignity everything else in excitement of moment uncle ben remained silent for full minute hear said listen carefully there d'you catch bruce listened with ear organ not having be tutored a be companion to catch little sound of veldt life must detect nothing a yet will hear in minute for be coming way said uncle ben be mile off more who who muttered bruce throat quite dry with excitement mashona fellow uncle ben nodded now listen again said bruce did so time distinctly heard rhythmical tread of body of men apparently moving at quick march trotting coming straight for along path whispered older man hear now see well there be cover for horse hereabouts what be to be done with why ca charge right through nigger asked bruce partly in ignorance partly in bravado for desired to

quarter intelligent creature be in full trot for stable tossing head grunting with pleasure well muttered older man have said can wo be fault if run head into mischief after having thus absolved conscience of responsibility for young companion rashness followed example of determined young person sent own horse careering after companion upon road for home now sonnie come off path said get behind scrub with will see rascal pas in five minute when be gone will push forward more safely be going to have shot at a pas asked bruce old man looked at companion in surprise not unmingled with

tooth now down with behind rock will be out of scrub in sight in minute uncle ben young companion ducked behind cover none too soon for hardly have done so when scarcely couple of hundred yard away there came line of dusky form four five abreast broke out of scrub cover into open followed at few pace by other line in what appeared to bruce to be interminable number uncle ben watching lad face saw flush pale then flush again hand went to revolver at belt there old man nervous grip arrested whispered fooling not if value life bruce tried to whisper back that only meant to prepare in case of emergency found tongue tied not precisely by fear by numbing sensation be result of sudden realisation of actual danger for first time in life feeling passed off in few second bruce became master once more of nerve now be able to enjoy very unique peculiar spectacle passing of body of mashona matabele warrior on warpath puffing groaning moaning wheezing went running at jog trot almost man of hundred so of relieved exhausted energy by uttering sound of one description from low grunt to loud wailing cry of seemed very weird alarming to bruce wondering intelligence illustration passing of body of mashona matabele warrior on warpath off to dad whispered uncle ben a strange body of black fellow disappeared in gathering dusk come will waste more time then pair moved quickly forward there be still fifteen mile to go step of must be done on foot quickly be man enough to jog trot bit now then asked older man bruce for reply struck into run led way so quickly that companion be glad enough when stopped again for breath walked darkness came on bruce became uncertain of way though knew well by daylight there be ford five mile from thomson place said if must only hit upon must find road from there on much easier take direction a near a can get said uncle ben maybe will strike river above below ford so on trudged now jogging at trot now slowing into walk covering ground quickly for remembered that upon speed might hang for knew life of men woman lion roared in veldt within mile of scudding human bruce shuddered went on resolved that companion must not see that be frightened presently brute roared second time almost paralysing poor bruce limb with terror for undoubtedly animal be much nearer at second time of roaring with difficulty dragging limb resolved to go through with matter bruce jogged on heard companion click rifle behind suddenly there came rush scurry of many swift foot hundred yard in front of scudding throng of animal passed across path away bruce heard third fourth roar knew that old lion have made spring have failed be angry over discomfiture stopped sat down suddenly too frightened to move forward ah said uncle ben kindly be pumped out lad will have bit of rest no be lion said bruce truthfully never heard one so close before be awful will attack not wo be such fool if did must smash in minute never fear why lad if ai afraid of matabele need mind there go again farther away see be thinking of antelope not of so up jumped bruce away sped again guessing road a best must by direction presently pair reached bank of precipitous nullah bruce nearly took header over rocky edge ah said uncle ben good follow line of nullah will be sure to lead to river proved to be case mile two farther on river be reached at point above below ford bruce must not tell why lord what doe matter will soon find ford said uncle ben be clever lad to have struck river be darned if ever met lad liked better work up to left mile two if be wrong will come back try other way be only matter of few minute bruce be getting very tired sighed to think that might have to travel several unnecessary mile up down river pulled together trudged on looking out keenly for ford must recognise if saw once company of antelope maybe be old friend gave great scare have come down to drink startled creature nearly knocked down a rushed madly stampeding mobbing from waterside when surprised by wanderer mile be covered part of bruce thought began to recognise look of river think be getting near ford said over shoulder good good lad replied companion laconically saving breath now suddenly confronted most crucial moment of enterprise stop lad hissed uncle ben from behind stop moment hear something bruce drew up instantly crouching down a saw companion do

man go right under if seem to hear see stay under a long a breath last bruce nodded shivering pair of submerged briton be not much too soon in assuming uncomfortable position for in moment matabele fellow be practically upon passing abreast of at full run groaning grunting after fashion travelling in irregular line of three four six unfortunately body of nigger have half passed by when creature of water took occasion to splash loudly several time in close proximity to submerged friend whether crocodile fish animal have waded in to drink bruce never knew down under water quick muttered uncle ben bruce taking in great gulp of breath obeyed instantly a did so became aware of sudden stinging sensation in upper part of arm putting hand to place under water felt that coat be torn must have rubbed against stake a ducked thought bruce dismissing subject devoted energy to economising stock of breath have laid in when be exhausted at end of thirty forty second seemed eternity to bruce cautiously raised upper part of head in order to take in new supply a did so observed last row two of matabele fellow halted upon bank one two of in act of throwing assagai at object beyond on left down went bruce again very quickly be nearly minute later that yellow head made reappearance above surface time saw matabele have gone on old man uncle ben have seized arm somewhat violently be muttering bruce shook water out of ear to listen come ashore quickly said uncle ben be wounded lad wounded not said bruce why be did shy assagai at why then may have be one touched arm ah have scratch see said older man spoke in so strange voice bruce looked up from own torn coat slightly bleeding arm to see what ailed companion what be up uncle ben said be feeling bad why be never hit be just bit gasped old fellow here in side blade of thing in now o lord pain of will lie down awhile may make better o uncle ben be so sorry what can do be very bad cried poor bruce weakly felt utterly helpless frightened may be right presently said uncle ben just give hand while lie down oh so be now will soon be better a though to prove how much better felt for change of position wounded man then there fainted away then bruce in utter helplessness misery began to think how vain thing be self confidence pride of mere animal courage in inexperienced lad of fifteen year have be ready anxious to undertake dangerous enterprise by what if have be allowed to do so well must probably have fallen into hand of enemy within hour of start if have escaped first danger must maybe have died of terror when within stone throw of roaring lion again might have lost way when in darkness missed track now again for uncle ben experience alertness must assuredly have be caught murdered by matabele sitting helpless miserable over unconscious companion bruce quickly realised with realisation came flood of tear first have shed for many day wrung from now not by fear by sense of helplessness in crisis what ought to do what must do leave poor wounded old man to recover consciousness to die to fall maybe into hand of third band of rebel nigger to be mutilated in barbarous fashion before breath be out of body to leave lying here hasten up to thomson farm in order to warn family must find way from here easily enough must let farm people take care of attend to duty lay to hand namely to keep faithful watch ward over wounded companion until day at rate when might settle comfortably somewhere under cover proceed upon journey bruce be fool occurred to at point of reflection passed in kind of dazed procession through brain that last band of matabele have probably come from thomson have crossed ford a though travelling from farm chance be that thomson be already aware of rebellion in full defence of property murdered folk thought bruce will stay by uncle ben until dy recovers then go on by bruce fit of cry did good put up prayer for help in terrible position did good also when at length old ben sighed opened eye poor bruce be feeling brave confident once more ready to face destiny might have in store for soon saw that there be little in old man condition to encourage uncle ben lay on back quite still gazing up at star bruce sat still also unwilling to disturb perhaps startle be there lad muttered old man presently feel a if must move to look about be here uncle ben said bruce be lying comfortable do feel bad be going to die lad be truth give drop of water in cap ah now listen to what have to say boy be off at once to farm warn if like to send down to fetch when convenient why may if not a soon die here think last matabele have be up there already said bruce else what be doing at ford be use going there 'd rather stay with here see to well god bless for wish anyhow lad be kind in may be right about matabele stay on bit if like think will keep long give drink lord be hot burning hot be sun out old man began to ramble in talk bruce in despair inexperience allowed to wander on saying nothing only dabbing little water occasionally upon old fellow brow suddenly uncle ben manner changed spoke quietly rationally once more be still there lad bruce asked bruce laid cool wet hand upon forehead by way of reply be darned good lad continued old man one of best wish have son like have stood by till died now see here sonnie in inner pocket be baccy pouch take before go away leave be full of gold dust be of little account what be more important be paper with map scrawled upon did before started case of accident name of village marked with cross be umdhana thirteen mile north of salisbury map will tell rest lord ca talk more be yours when be gone for be good lad one of best maybe wo die uncle ben said bruce weakly knew there be not much doubt of must think of nothing wiser to say uncle ben did not reply lay with closed eye after while bruce saw lip move heard muttering concluded that be praying did not interrupt when looked again old man be still though bruce watched carefully for nearly hour must detect slightest movement of breathing then great horror came over boy for looked upon death for first time heart failed trembled went away where must not see body here sat awhile in nerveless terror unable to collect thought to decide what be best to be done sat helpless dazed for hour by time dawn be beginning to make faint promise of day to come with joy brightness in own good time will wait thought bruce until be broad daylight then will go to thomson farm then lay down tried to fall asleep superstitious fear kept mostly awake though dozed at interval once twice heard stealthy noise a though beast of forest came timidly to water to drink be startled by roaring of greater animal there be nothing to alarm save presence near by of grim death nevertheless when light came bruce felt impelled to approach look upon uncle ben body once more before leaving be surprised to find that time in god fair light of day minded much le even bent laid hand in farewell upon old fellow cold forehead a did so remembered uncle ben request that must secure baccy pouch content bruce easily found pouch pocketed without much thought of value if having thus secured legacy according to testator wish certainly thought more about illustration bruce felt impelled to look upon uncle ben body once more before leaving then lad made for ford be hundred yard so away here immense surprise be in store for for in very act of crossing ford there came towards figure at first sight took for of native matabele warrior though clothed appeared in tattered relic of english suit flannel shirt norfolk coat trouser carrying over shoulder rifle at belt long short assegai for instant bruce heart failed stopped dead crouched intending to drop upon stomach crawl into cover stranger seemed be quick eyed have already seen aha called out young boy englishman hide be not one to hurt have white skin bruce be soon upon foot again at sound of own language though be spoken in odd guttural way with peculiar accent stared at stranger coming splashing through willow water who be blurted why do speak so curiously be umkopo white witch of matabele english born matabele bred what be doing here be wonder that be alive death be abroad death to english what do want here say bruce have heard of man umkopo white witch a be called no one a yet however knew much about mysterious individual who be seen from time to time indeed have often befriended englishman in moment of danger distress a to whose identity vaguest most varied opinion prevailed since day on bruce met in manner described history have become well known in rhodesia in england be not place to recapitulate romantic story if desire to know reader may find elsewhere be on way to thomson farm to warn that native be up said bruce perhaps have be upon same errand thomson be dead murdered so be partner wife of partner yesterday be surprised murdered bah good english blood spilt by dog of matabele bah have done with go with more from day be englishman thomson murdered hewetson mr hewetson also ejaculated bruce then be too late oh how glad be that father be warned in time who be father asked umkopo name be gerston farm claim called gerstonville know interrupted umkopo sent on here alone to warn thomson doe hate rot said bruce of course not be not alone companion be dead dead what killed by dog like thomson others for one will kill ten matabele swear how have escaped hid in water something splashed a passed threw assegai killed poor uncle ben lie just here quite close ah ah show show said umkopo bruce led new friend to place where lay dead man looking a though slept quietly by riverside weary with travelling oh cried umkopo with something very like sob in voice knew well have hunted with be good man brave man have learned from many thing to bruce immense surprise umkopo threw upon ground lay rolling groaning while evidently overcome with grief suddenly rose come said will make hole put in if find here will cut tear body because be better than braver wiser will not have so with little help from bruce poor old uncle ben received burial at hand of umkopo right glad be bruce that be not destined that friend must be left to be mutilated by savage enemy to be eaten by savage beast vulture now said umkopo when good work be finished go together to gerstonville if be warned in time will not yet be overcome if still hold out will see what will happen when mashona dog see that umkopo have come bruce did not quite like stranger manner of speaking be so strange appearance so weird even alarming be evidently friendly disposed be certainly comforting to have escort companion bruce preferred word companion a far a gerstonville half fear of man feeling of dislike soon passed away in wonder curiosity a on way homewards umkopo waxed garrulous spoke of own career of deed among great beast of veldt of bearding on certain occasion of terrible old king lobengula whom world feared excepting apparently wonderful fellow of many adventure struggle with matabele people who must not for many year acknowledge a principal witch magician be persuaded in end said umkopo concluding story patting lovingly butt of rifle be real witch not so interesting absorbing be conversation of new friend bruce scarcely have time to realise that be terribly tired a indeed have right to be pair have come within mile so of home when umkopo suddenly stopped assumed attitude of listening when did so bruce listened also distinctly heard sound of shooting continuous shooting ah said umkopo good dog have not got into father kennel now will see how umkopo will sweep away like leaf fly in wind time come umkopo seized boy hand set off at so rapid run even bruce a active lad a must find in rhodesia must scarcely keep up with be obliged indeed to pant to presently to stop not stop said umkopo not far now run umkopo have learned from springbok bruce pulled together took deep breath struggled gamely on once stopped for moment two umkopo having glanced in lad face seeing that be really distressed for breath during moment bruce caught sight of umkopo expression be astonished almost supernaturally alarmed at umkopo eye be wild blazing with weird lustre held chin high shoulder back muttered word a gazed straight in front of bruce did not understand concluded be in matabele lingo looked bruce thought like inspired prophet white witch over excepting that skin be scarcely to be described a white being a matter of fact about way between pale tint hue of mashona native then on scudded once more in minute two have reached spot within furlong of farmhouse from saw plainly be being enacted at about building there be three separate group of attacking native hidden from house by protecting cover of scrub rock now again dark form two rushed headlong towards building when shot from upper window must send rash fellow hurrying back into cover head first into earth where must writhe kick for moment then lie still number of still dark form dotted ground at distance from house while grim heap of slain within forty yard of proved that charge of enemy en masse have with difficulty be stopped in time come said umkopo suddenly unexpectedly now will see started to walk rapidly towards nearest body of native bruce hesitated to follow not quite comprehending intention more than half mistrusting wisdom of proceeding come say repeated umkopo looking back over shoulder fear nothing be umkopo great white witch bruce rather than appear to be afraid gripped rifle followed matabele apparently recognised umkopo at instant of appearance for sent up babel of noise tongue of two hundred there assembled seeming to contribute to din of welcome reverse of delight of rage bruce must not tell for noise be deafening individual voice quite undistinguishable be angry said umkopo for know that act against command what matter few individual rushed forward a though to fall upon umkopo a came two threw assagai without seeming to take aim umkopo instantly shot men fell dead almost at same moment then umkopo said few word in native tongue word immediately raised babel of din even louder than first again umkopo held up hand spoke spoke fiercely solemnly a seemed to bruce who must not however understand word one two assagai be thrown again aggressor be shot dead almost before weapon have left hand hurled then suddenly whole body of men with howl yell angry grimace turned moved away umkopo standing like implacable fate watching departure in five minute be quarter of mile away in ten have disappeared out of sight go into house said umkopo have seen what have seen tell umkopo will drive away other dog a have driven full of wonder admiration bruce did a umkopo suggested yet anxious a be to see parent tell story must not forbear to wait watch umkopo dealing with next batch of nigger before finally turning back hastening towards house here may be believed rapturous greeting awaited for horse having returned riderless have be matter of miserable doubt to parent whether bruce be alive dead bruce enjoyed greatly praise be certainly deserved portion be still in midst of tale of experience when umkopo suddenly reappeared white witch made greeting to one present merely inquired where cartridge be kept winchester being shown place helped liberally departed almost without word did however bruce with whack on shoulder aha said will meet one day will be fine englishman when be grown full size like umkopo there be more trouble at gerstonville day from rebel native family did not on account relax in slightest degree watchfulness for though umkopo have apparently frightened band away there be certainty that others must not return on following afternoon body of englishman many of known to gerston rode in from buluwayo be greatly relieved to find that gerston family be safe have not expected said be luckier than many said leader be sad truth rising be very serious business get light valuable together come along buluwayo be in danger will be safer there than here what leave house farm have to mercy of rascally nigger come along to loot burn exclaimed gerston not be unpleasant own will have to do mate better than certain outrage murder must hold out for week persisted gerston unwilling to surrender house good very likely after week what then rising wo be quelled for many week friend take word for will have to come tell expect to be attacked in buluwayo then maybe be a safe here a there said poor gerston feeling that argument be untenable that must indeed a bromley said leave retire with good fellow to capital house farm furniture good valued english thing have come so far cost so much represented in fact be hard indeed to surrender life of wife child be dearer still must be saved at cost knew though in argument fought awhile against inevitable so poor gerston collected money paper set live stock free to roam where must until matabele thief must find appropriate set out for buluwayo in growing city be obliged perforce to remain until native disturbance developed practically into small war be quelled afterwards a soon a must do so safely lost time in riding over with bruce to place where until evil day have stood homestead with farm building comfortable though simply built house adequate cowshed stable ala found trace of home in have taken so great pride delight excepting indeed sundry heap of ash bit of blackened wood twisted iron gerston stood surveyed scene of ruin desolation heart felt very heavy though have scarcely expected to find more favourable state of affair than thought so bruce muttered be ruined lad through fault of ours will have to begin life over again be hard will do land be ours capital have gone can have try for uncle ben gold father said bruce unexpectedly let ride up north to place shown in map mother kittie be safe in buluwayo be worth trying seemed very serious about gold gerston reflected much believe in rhodesian gold said if heart be set upon may a well go meanwhile authority can be deciding what compensation be to be given to poor chap who be ruined by mismanagement of native so up northward went father son latter full of sanguine hope former depressed gloomy having little belief in lucky star seemed to have set so completely that must never rise again to village called umdhana went there using old man map searched far wide for old deserted gold shaft according to scribbled direction existed in place four mile from village at spot designated in rough plan be wild looking spot rank vegetation grew high dense on side rendering search for object especially when location within few hundred yard be uncertain very difficult discouraging for two day bruce father wandered dejectedly about veldt hoping against hope that in end must stumble upon old native crushing stone remains of furnace uncle ben note declared to be still in existence marking very spot where at distant date enterprising matabele fellow have endeavoured to exploit vein of precious metal leaving scarcely touched after two day of failure gerston be tired of search disbelieved in gold mine existed said only in brain of half crazy old man who imagined have found what never actually existed will employ time better sonnie felling tree at home building new house where poor old shanty stood perhaps father bruce sadly assented must much rather have stayed day two being young sanguine think uncle ben be even bit crazy ca go on looking for ever though bruce be angry depressed vulture sat blinking upon rock close by lad picked up stone to throw at evil looking creature by way of working off disappointment chagrin picked up stone to throw vulture noticed movement heavily took wing bruce remained with stone in hand be curious looking stone first glanced then gazed carefully at illustration lad picked up stone to throw at evil looking creature father said presently look at be anything particular mean be must possibly be bruce face have gone red with certain wild idea that suddenly entered brain voice sounded dry curious gerston took stone looked carefully at by be happy wonderful bruce exclaimed do believe be nugget nugget be though old disused gold mine presently found close to very spot proved like most of rhodesian gold vein somewhat disappointing yet yielded together with bruce nugget more than sufficient to enable gerston to rebuild house farm building to stock furnish in manner quite superior to former style when company came down handsome with good sum for compensation gerston felt that thing be rosy indeed that when young bruce made friend one memorable afternoon with poor old uncle ben have indeed be little a expected in luck way a for uncle ben baccy pouch untidy hieroglyphic did duty for map plan be bruce very most treasured possession must not part with for wealth of transvaal samana kay by harry collingwood be within few day of reaching twenty third birthday when be fortune to secure berth a only mate aboard very smart handsome little brig of two hundred sixty five ton named lancashire witch hailing out of liverpool bound from port to kingston jamaica with cargo of sugar mill machinery manchester good sailed on twenty eighth of january with piping north easter blowing over taffrail swept right away from bar lightship into north east trade without obliging to start tack sheet brace halliard from moment when old man took departure from saltees light trade wind be blowing fresh too so that made phenomenally quick otherwise uneventful run across atlantic until arrived within three hundred mile of turk island where wind suddenly failed fell in with light hazy rainy weather with occasional short spell of flat calm variable shifting air obliged to take in studding sail jockey little hooker along a best must under plain sail be tedious irritating work for there be so much box hauling of yard that watch must find time for nothing tending brace hand of fore aft be driven nearly frantic at length on fourth day of kind of work sky gradually thickened up in southern board sun became pallid shapeless blotch of watery light in heaven there be other sign that change of weather be brewing yet there be nothing to indicate that change be imminent therefore contented with maintenance of watchful eye upon sign of time left flying kite abroad in order that might derive utmost possible advantage from languid scarcely perceptible breathing of atmosphere reached scarcely knew from where so light evanescent be thus matter went with throughout day aspect of sky altering so subtly gradually that be only at change of watch after four hour spell below one be able to detect very marked difference when however be called at eight bell of afternoon watch at once noted so pronounced increase in threatening aspect of sky felt assured of near approach of impending change a skipper did not seem disposed to take initiative suggested that hand must go to work at once to snug down ship prepare for coming conflict unfortunately however old man did not take same view of matter did have be on deck whole afternoon menacing appearance have at once impressed have be occurring so gradually subtly that have scarcely noticed moreover there be now small hot breeze coming up from southward be fanning nimble little brig along at speed of nearly four knot be evidently disinclined to forego so great advantage yes said when expressed opinion that must have outburst before long be coming slowly surely think will have for hour two notice much difference from what be at noon except that sun have vanished there be perhaps little more movement in muck overhead believe may venture to hang on for half hour so will still have plenty of time to snug down before dark felt rather doubtful of skipper be dreadfully opinionated obstinate man knew argument anything approaching must be worse than useless with therefore made reply walked to skylight took peep at barometer hung there mercury have fallen more than inch since have last glanced at just before going to cabin after dinner well inquired skipper a turned away what doe say twenty eight thirty five replied ay remarked be going down steadily will be regular teaser when come yet did not a hoped must give order to shorten sail although wind be now steadily freshening in puff while sky to windward be darkening growing ever more threatening of aspect even a one watched meanwhile hand be on deck evidently standing by for call casting increasingly anxious glance alternately aft to windward at length one bell struck while sound be still vibrating in air skipper obstinate spirit perhaps satisfied now that have held on for half hour have mentioned gave order for hand to shorten sail clew up furl everything except main topsail may close reef mr burt said to let hand look smart about ay ay sir answered then to men let go royal top gallant fore topsail sheet halliard also jib staysail main topsail halliard man clew line bunt line down haul get canvas off a quickly a can couple of hand aloft to fore main royal roll up stowing top gallant sail main royal top gallant staysail on way down hark ye lad see that make snug stow of so that nothing blow adrift by by in darkness to give trouble now bowse out reef tackle of main topsail after have done that man fore main clew garnet get course snugged well up to yard hurrah bully be a lively a like let get barkie snug while have light enough to see what be about men who have evidently be impatiently awaiting order sprang about deck like wild cat letting go clewing up hauling down fore aft with frantic energy yet working with method of men who not only knew thoroughly what be about be also perfectly aware of vital importance of getting through work in shortest possible amount of time in few minute therefore sail be off ship except main topsail hand be on yard rolling up canvas a though for dear life while skipper held wheel dashed hither thither letting go rope dragging upon that a called upon by men aloft meanwhile to facilitate operation of reefing furling brig be kept broad away very nearly dead before wind suddenly there arose wild yell aloft of man overboard glancing up from what be about at moment be just in time to catch glimpse of body of man flashing downward apparently from larboard mainyard arm ere vanished with scarce splash into leaden hued water alongside illustration suddenly there arose wild yell aloft of man overboard quick a thought skipper whipped out knife cut adrift life buoy hung over port quarter letting drop into water within fathom two of where small blot of foam marked spot of man disappearance while forgetful of everything else sprang to port quarter boat slashed away with knife at gripe held in moment be joined by two men from aloft who have come down by way of backstay while skipper jammed wheel hard down brought brig to wind with canvas remained unfurled slatting thrashing a though must jerk stick out of three of lowered boat somehow tumbled over side into unhooking tackle getting handsomely away from ship without mishap although be by time breezing up fresh brig must have be going through at speed of fully six knot two men who be with threw out oar got boat head round while grasping yoke line stood up in stern sheet watching for man presently caught sight of heaven what long distance be away from mile at least dead to windward with breeze freshening moment nasty short choppy sea getting up seemed to stop boat dead time that wave struck pull men exclaimed anxiously bend back to put along will lose poor fellow after by way who be sam sir answered fellow who be pulling stroke be at yard arm be rollin ' up mainsail sail be thrashin ' about goodish bit must have jerked off perhaps so agreed did not pursue conversation for be getting terribly anxious have lost sight of man of whom be in search feared that have gone down sky be momentarily growing blacker assuming more threatening appearance to windward wind sea be rising like magic brig be driving away to leeward like smoke from galley funnel men too be glancing anxiously over shoulder dragging away at heavy oar like demon be evident that fully shared uneasiness have taken possession of be longing to complete task get boat nose round pointing toward brig see anything of sir at length demanded man who have previously spoken not just at moment answered expect will find hanging on to life buoy ay there be buoy continued a small white circle swung up on breast of sea yes yes there be man clinging to give way bully five minute will have two men toiled at oar with superhuman energy laboured breathing sweat literally poured off bearing eloquent witness to exertion while boat squashed viciously into sea that met flinging spray right aft drenching to skin yet despite seemed to make little headway when full five minute have sped be still quite fifty fathom away from man then suddenly lost sight of poor fellow be clinging to buoy when sank behind crest of on coming sea when buoy swept into view again on next slope be empty at trying moment sky suddenly darkened into deeper more menacing gloom next moment saw dense rain squall sweeping along toward men noticed too one of anxiously inquired how fur be off now mr burt be there chance of gettin ' hold of afore that squall strike if doubt be up with un for ca keep on at here game much longer muttered other try spurt lad exclaimed dozen stroke will do little crew responded gallantly to adjuration in moment squall be upon rain descending like cataract in instant everything beyond length of boat be hidden by dense curtain of falling water rain lasted for nearly ten minute beating sea down until surface be like oil men availed of opportunity to get little more way upon boat presently bade cease pulling feeling convinced that must be quite close to buoy although must see nothing of then rain suddenly ceased wind with revealing buoy right under boat bow ala man be gone recovered buoy then stood up to see if must discover missing shipmate presently saw cap floating ten fathom away owner have vanished shouted several time thinking that possibly poor fellow might have be washed off buoy yet be still afloat somewhere not far distant although undistinguishable in rapidly deepening gloom answer came then suddenly bethought that night storm be together closing down upon turned to look for brig there be just distinguishable in thickness to leeward with far too much of canvas still blowing loose from yard stay turned suddenly sick with anxiety for own fate a noticed that be nearly three mile away meanwhile two men who constituted boat crew have risen to foot be like peering anxiously hither thither in hope of discovering missing man failing to find however again shouted then paused fruitlessly listening for reply be while be thus breathlessly listening that faint low moaning wail gradually made audible strengthening deepening in tone even a listened until within space of few second sound have resolved into unmistakable piping of rapidly rising wind instinctively glance went with one accord into fast deepening blackness loured in southern quarter a looked saw long line of pallid white stretching along horizon sweeping toward at terrific speed at same instant one of men with yelled god look to wind'ard mr burt see that white squall comin down upon sir what have better do be good tryin ' to fetch brig be good three mile away wind will be on in two minute no answered must weather out a best can lay two oar together bend end of painter round pair of in middle then veer away a floating anchor to keep head to wind be only chance sooner said than done not moment too soon have barely time to complete even brief simple preparation when gale swept down upon with screaming yell be absolutely terrifying in instant be enveloped in gloom be not night yet resembled in so far that must scarcely see other while white water boiled in over gunwale air be thick with scud water lashed face hand so cruelly that must not face be fain to crouch in bottom of boat allow arched shoulder to take full brunt of pelting a to attempting to do anything for preservation of boat own life be out of question wind smote with such merciless fury that be positively difficult for to breathe have be foolish enough to endeavour to use oar must have be torn from grasp in instant fortunately for such effort be needed impromptu sea anchor kept boat head to wind although foam scud water be gradually filling little craft process be so slow be not very seriously alarmed at believing that squall must be over before danger from source became imminent first spite of squall lasted about ten minute after moderated to strength of strong gale when sea at once began to rise very soon be breaking over boat so vindictively that kept three of busy baling time even then be with utmost difficulty that be able to keep free meanwhile night have fallen upon dark a inside of cavern a for brig have seen nothing of since first outburst of squall be drenched to skin be hungry thirsty with not drop of fresh water smallest fragment of anything eatable in boat prospect of obtaining until must be picked up plight be therefore by mean enviable one two men who constituted crew presently began to discus probability of brig returning in search of must say that for own part have very little hope of such thing still le that in event of skipper undertaking search must be successful did not think must make such attempt must probably believe that boat have be swamped hand of drowned at outburst of squall being now short handed must consequently deem duty to waste time upon what must regard a utterly useless search to make best of way to port of destination two others thought differently be so completely overwhelmed with consternation at mere suggestion that view might be wrong one did not further attempt to rob of small fragment of hope to so desperately clung besides there be possibility just bare possibility that dawn might prove surmise to be correct in about two hour time from outburst of squall gale broke by midnight a nearly a be possible for to guess at time wind have dwindled away to fresh breeze while sea have so far gone down that no longer broke into boat be consequently now enabled to bale dry with skipper fault have good point one of much more common nowadays than be at period of adventure be to keep item of boat equipment in great importance advantage of be now very strongly brought home to for not only have with full complement of oar rowlock other ordinary fitting there be also boat mast sail sprit mainsail foresail snugly enwrapped in painted canvas case securely lashed to thwart moment therefore that be safe to do so have mean to make sail must probably be about two bell in morning watch when having stepped mast bore up under double reefed mainsail ran away to northward in search of brig hoped to find ten mile to leeward of hour later brightening of sky along eastern horizon heralded dawn shortly afterward sun rose brilliantly flushing sky around with thousand delicate evanescent tint of pink gold presage of fine day at once inaugurated keen look out for brig other craft be in wise particular so long a be picked up when have run estimated distance of ten mile to leeward horizon be still bare then came question of what be next thing to be done whether must continue to run to leeward in further search of brig whether must remain where be in hope that must shortly heave into view in search of whether must haul up on westerly course endeavour to intercept latter be suggestion founded upon opinion have formed that skipper have probably given up a lost idea conveyed be so unwelcome to companion that eventually determined to heave to remain where be that brig might have chance to find if skipper must undertake search accordingly hauled foresheet over to windward helm hard down stripped for wash down in sea water while clothes be drying in sun one of seaman be for going overboard for swim dissuaded be probably fortunate for that listened to for while be still engaged upon ablution two big shark made appearance close alongside boat began to circle round with persistency deliberation unpleasantly suggested impression that have come to stay meanwhile with appearance of sun wind dropped fast until by about eight o'clock have died away to flat calm leaving water oil smooth everywhere save where fin of persistent shark cleft surface into two thin wedge like ripple a lazily cruised to fro never widening space between boat by more than dozen fathom eight o'clock breakfast time here be three unfortunate men keenly hungry throat parched with rapidly increasing thirst threatened to quickly become torment without smallest morsel of bread merest sip of water to divide between with hope of getting so long a calm lasted unless indeed must find ship by searching for obviously be only thing to be done so not without muttered curse two at cruelty of fortune rolled up sail unstepped mast threw out oar headed boat to northward in direction thought brig might possibly be found a pulled two shark doggedly followed swimming side by side with snout about fathom astern of aftermost edge of rudder distance maintained a truly a though have be in tow noon arrived passed finding still with nothing in sight ravenously hungry with mouth slimy with thirst so imperious that man who be pulling bow oar suddenly stooped over side scooped up little salt water in palm quickly drank exclaiming in answer to warning cry be bound to do mr burt even if have to suffer for a'terwards here thirst be just maddenin ' ay joey be that agreed other man have sup o salt water done yer good mate know a have ned did take enough of for be reply more be said about hour afterwards joey snatched sip despite everything must say to dissuade little later mate followed example be good talkin ' mr burt replied to expostulation drinkin ' salt water may perhaps make man mad will pretty soon go mad if drink something so what be odds where be brig what be 'old man ' up to with why ai lookin ' for ai lookin ' for be sartin must have hove old hooker into

be what be downright murder nothin ' else what right have to go suppose that here boat foundered in squall drownded what be to do now 'bandoned out here in hatlantic with never bite sup to keep life in there be doubt in mind answered that best plan will be to head to south'ard west'ard for caycos passage so give chance to be picked up by outward homeward bound ship for will be running right into track of be of course most unfortunate that have fallen calm with believe will last long when once breeze spring up sail may heave into view at moment pick up be difficult to fully persuade two untutored men of uselessness of searching further for brig eventually won round to view at once hauled up on south west course a nearly a must hit off by sun pulling hard until sunset in hope that brig might be found in new direction for be convinced that must be at great distance from at horizon be still bare disappointment be so bitter that be unable to resist longer exhaustion have be steadily growing upon day so oar be laid in with one consent three of flung down in bottom of boat with result instantly fell into deep slumber slept through night be awakened next morning just a day be dawning by man ned who found be shaking furiously by shoulder a shouted in terrified accent mr burt mr burt wake up sir where joey where joey ai in boat lord have ' mussy upon have gone overboard d 'ye think sir started to foot vaguely comprehending that something be wrong scarcely realising what be found that there be pleasant little breeze blowing from north east must only have sprung up very recently from look of water be merely rippled without sea that poor ned gaunt cadaverous of feature with deeply sunken eye glowing with scorching fever of long continued thirst be glaring at with expression of terror be near akin to madness what be matter ned why be glaring at like man what be be saying about joey stammered in confusion of sudden violent awakening out of profound sleep what be sayin ' about joey reiterated fellow why be sayin ' mr burt that ai in boat where be what be happened to 'im then fully realised for first time that there be two of in boat that man known a joey have vanished a completely a though have never be leaving sign indication of what have become of one thing be certain be not in boat that fact meant that have gone overboard involuntarily glanced astern a though expecting to see swimming near there be sign of there be horribly significant fact however instantly caught attention be that whereas yesterday there have be two shark following there be now one ned said what be use of asking have become of joey how do know have be asleep whole night until now when stretched out together know a well a do that joey be with how long have be awake not five minute mr burt sir answered ned just woke up looked round saw that joey be in boat then called sir right off reel well said there can be doubt whatever a to poor joey fate although of happened to witness have gone overboard most probably during fit of madness induced by drinking salt water let fate be lesson to not to indulge that fatal practice however greatly may be tempted now since poor joe be gone can hing to help let get canvas on boat make best of fine fair wind sail be made upon boat soon have satisfaction of finding sliding along before wind at speed of between four five knot took yoke line believing must steer truer course than ned while maintained sharp look out for sail hour after hour dragged wearily by however still ocean remained deserted save for own tiny sail meanwhile hunger thirst grew apace until there be time when torment be so exquisitely keen felt sorely tempted to follow joey example end a for ned although springing up of fair wind seemed to hearten up bit at first noticed that a day wore on without result despair be taking ever stronger clutch upon several time cried out that be over with might a well give up finishing off with whole string of bitter curse upon skipper shipmate for deserting be curious to note intense selfishness that misfortune have so quickly developed in man spoke of misfortune a not ours execrated captain crew for deserting not so day dragged wearily on night cool placid brilliant with countless million of star jewelled sky fell upon finding still alone unrescued ned with new born selfishness bred in by suffering coiled away in bow of boat fell asleep seemed to do so a soon a fell dark without excuse apology offer to relieve at yoke line although have be steering day remained thus for about hour half betraying great restlessness then rising to foot half stumbled half crawled aft into stern sheet ca sleep so might a well give up trying muttered give line lie down mr burt maybe will be luckier than get bit of nap thanks ned will answered without further ado stretched at foot in bottom of boat straightway fell asleep think must have slept however more than ten minute when suddenly found broad awake again with nerve tingle muscle braced a though have suddenly without warning be brought face to face with awful deadly peril opened eye first object that met sight be star glint upon long blade of sheath knife companion be poising above breast second blade flashed downward hand instinctively dashing upward to meet ward off blow next instant ned be fighting together for life antagonist being uppermost while right hand gripped right wrist so powerfully that presently dropped knife with cry flinging upon strove to seize throat with disengaged hand in struggle ensued somehow managed to scramble to foot despite effort of antagonist to keep down next endeavour be to force ned forward into eye of boat so that might securely lash with painter until frenzy seemed to have suddenly seized must have passed off then god know how happened swear be not intentional on part in moment ned seemed to stumble throw backwards over gunwale of boat before must do anything to save be gone instantly there be savage rush furious swirl in water alongside boat be struck violent blow beneath water line in icy starlight distinctly saw white gleam of shark belly a turned on side to seize unfortunate shipmate then came momentary swirl of water in midst of monster without doubt same shark have be following so persistently disappeared dragging unfortunate seaman with there be sick faint with horror left alone in wide waste of water illustration ned seemed to stumble throw backwards over gunwale of boat what happened to immediately upon occurrence of dreadful tragedy know when came to myself found have somehow made way back into stern sheet of boat be grasping yoke line mainsheet while quite unconsciously by instinct be keeping little craft dead before wind have only very confused impression of how spent remainder of terrible night think that horror privation combined must have made delirious for have vague recollection of having caught alternately cry laughing cursing singing with one fixed idea that boat must be kept dead before wind predominating over everything else remember also complaining bitterly aloud at inordinate length of night then being dully surprised at reappearance of sun with return of daylight however seemed to get better again in so far a sens fully returned to anguish endured from hunger thirst be not to be described in word still look where must horizon remained bare really seemed a though have unaccountably drifted into spot of ocean unknown to navigation yet knew be actually in well frequented highway suddenly when sun be about two hour high caught sight of small floating object almost directly ahead at great distance from boat curiosity prompting shifted helm for at first must not guess what be when within dozen fathom of saw that be small turtle asleep with infinite caution steered boat so a to pas within arm reach a ranged up alongside be fortunate enough to seize by fin whereby be enabled to lift into boat creature probably weighed about six pound in exhausted condition taxed strength to utmost to secure sooner be in boat however than cut off head with ned knife drank blood restored in truly marvellous manner then with lavish expenditure of time trouble at length contrived to get shell apart to make sparing meal of raw flesh doubtless be sufficiently disgusting repast in famished condition seemed that have never in life tasted anything half so delicious toward evening devoured remainder of flesh despite fact that have already grown perceptibly putrid then must have fallen asleep slept soundly throughout night for when consciousness returned be astonished to find that day be breaking good fortune of previous day led now to maintain bright look out for turtle a well a ship day proved blank in regard to a did next day also by evening of seemed to be in a pitiable condition a though have never caught turtle at then ensued period of steadily increasing torment at length so far robbed of reason that lost count of time day night becoming simply alternate eternity of indescribable anguish whether instinctively retained control of boat whether allowed to drift along at own sweet will will never know next recollection be of awaking out of kind of stupor to see in hazy uncertain dreamlike manner blotch of greyish green upon horizon ahead to at first attached significance a boat gradually neared impressed at length upon semi paralysed consciousness a land yet even when comprehended thus much still failed to realise tremendous importance of discovery can only attribute to instinct rather than reason took boat round to lee side of island before beaching when a rounded low point hauled up to wind caught first whiff of land what be growing upon sens seemed to revive looked about with glimmer of returning intelligence for suitable spot at to land a looked gleam sparkle of water trickling down beach caught eye instantly seemed to go quite mad with joy springing to foot laughing shouting
