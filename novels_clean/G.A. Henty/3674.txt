from boy extracted score of eel a many fish of different kind not bad haul said a lowered cage to bottom again now let see what have got in pen paddled short way along broad to point where little lane of water ran up through rush narrowed rapidly lad got out from boat into water a coracle must proceed further between line of rush water be knee deep bottom soft oozy at end of creek narrowed until rush be foot apart be bent over here a must seem to superficial observer naturally close examination must show that facing other be tied together where crossed at distance of couple of foot above water forming sort of tunnel two foot farther on ceased rush be succeeded by line of strong osier withy inch two apart arched over fastened together at point be sort of hanging door formed of rush backed with osier so arranged that at slightest push from without door lifted enabled wild fowl to pas under dropping behind prevented exit osier tunnel widened out to sort of inverted basket three

be minute after reached edge of swamp before boy must hear sound quick ear of hound have detected then heard faint splashing noise minute two later two figure be seen wading through water welcome back father lad cried be beginning to be anxious about for here be at end of fourth day did not name hour edmund boy father said a stepped from water own did not reckon upon being so late in truth egbert missed way in winding of swamp must not have be back to night have not luckily fallen upon man fishing who be able to put right have got supper hope for egbert be a hungry a wolf for have have nothing since started before sunrise have plenty to eat father will have to wait till be cooked for be use putting over fire until knew that must return there be good fire will not have to wait long how have fared with what be news news be bad edmund dane be ever receiving reinforcement from mercia scarce day pass fresh band arrive at thetford fear that ere long east anglia like northumbria will fall into clutch nay unless soon make head against will come to occupy island just a did forefather be shame indeed edmund exclaimed know that people conquered by ancestor be unwarlike cowardly must be shame indeed be saxon so to be overcome by dane seeing moreover that have help of god being christian while dane be pagan idolater nevertheless son for last five year heathen have be master of northumbria have wasted whole country have plundered destroyed church monastery at present have made beginning here in east anglia if continue to flock in will soon overrun whole country instead of having a at present mere foothold near river except for who have come down to thetford have be among first sufferer seeing that land lie round thetford hitherto have hoped that there must be general rising against invader king be indolent unwarlike see that will not arouse call ealdormen thane together for united effort until be too late already from north dane be flocking down into mercia although advent of west saxon to aid of king of mercia forced to retreat for while doubt not that will soon pour down again 't be pity father that saxon be not under one leading then might surely defend england against dane if people did rise fall upon band of northman a arrived must get footing among yes father replied be unhappy division between saxon kingdom have enabled dane to get so firm footing in land only hope now lie in west saxon until lately be at feud with mercia royal family be now related by marriage seeing that king of mercia be wedded to west saxon princess that alfred west saxon king brother heir to throne have lately espoused one of royal blood of mercia fact that marched at call of king of mercia drove dane from nottingham show that west saxon prince be alive to common danger of country if be joined heartily by people of east anglia mercians may yet succeed in checking progress of heathen now edmund a see hope of general effort to drive dane off coast 't be useless for to lurk here longer propose to morrow then to journey north into lincolnshire to abbey of croyland where a know brother theodore be abbot there can rest in peace for time watch progress of event if hear that people of part be aroused from lethargy will come back fight for home land if not will no longer stay in east anglia see be destined to fall piecemeal into hand of dane will journey down to somerset will pray king ethelbert to assign land there to take a thane while have be thus talking egbert have be broiling eel wild duck over fire be freeman distant relation of edmund father eldred who be ealdorman in west norfolk land lying beyond thetford upon whom therefore first brunt of danish invasion from mercia have fallen have made stout resistance assembling people have given battle to invader however be too strong numerous force having be scattered dispersed have sought refuge with egbert son in fen country here have remained for two month in hope that general effort must be made to drive back dane being now convinced that at present angle be too disunited to join in common effort determined to retire for while from scene suppose father edmund said will leave treasure buried here yes father replied have mean of transporting can at time return fetch must dig up big chest take such garment a may need personal ornament of rank rest with gold silver vessel can remain here till need gold silver vessel seem little in accordance with primitive mode of life prevailing in ninth century saxon civilization be indeed mixed one mode of life be primitive dwelling with exception of religious house abode of few of great noble simple in extreme possessed vessel of gold silver armlet necklace ornament of same metal rich brightly coloured dress elaborate bed furniture while table household utensil be of roughest kind floor strewn with rush when invaded conquered england found existing civilization introduced by roman be far in advance of own much of adopted introduction of christianity further advanced in scale prelate monk from rome brought with high degree of civilization to small extent saxon imitated borrowed church be held in much honour great wealth possession be bestowed upon bishop abbot possessed large temporal a well a spiritual power bore prominent part in council of kingdom even in handsome well built monastery with stately service handsome vestment learning be at lowest ebb so low indeed that when prince alfred desired to learn latin must find one in father dominion capable of teaching study be for long time hindered for want of instructor at time ascended throne be probably only englishman outside monastery who be able to read write fluently tell father edmund said after meal be concluded about west saxon since be to a seems that must look for protection of england against dane prince alfred of whom before heard speak in term of high praise be brother be not of king in case how be that doe not reign in kent thought though joined to west saxon kingdom be always ruled over by eldest son of king such have be rule edmund seeing troubled time when ethelbert came to throne be thought better to unite two kingdom under one crown with understanding at ethelbert death alfred must succeed father ethelwulf be weak king must have be born churchman rather than prince nominally reigned over wessex kent mercia last paid slight allegiance alfred be favourite son sent when quite child to rome for visit in with magnificent retinue accompanied by alfred visited rome travelling through land of frank be there doubtless that alfred acquired that love of learning many of idea far in advance of people distinguish mother osburgha died before father started on pilgrimage king be received with much honour by pope to whom presented gold crown of four pound weight ten dish of purest gold sword richly set in gold two gold image silver gilt urn stole bordered with gold purple white silken robe embroidered with figure other costly article of clothing for celebration of service of church together with rich present in gold silver to church bishop clergy other dweller in rome say that people of rome marvelled much at magnificent gift from king of country have considered a barbarous on way back married judith daughter of king of frank foolish marriage for king be far advanced in year judith be girl ethelbald ethelwulf eldest son have acted a regent in father absence so angered be at marriage that raised standard of revolt against father at marriage judith have be crowned queen be contrary to custom of west saxon therefore ethelbald be supported by people of country on father return to england however father son met division of kingdom be agreed upon ethelbald received wessex principal part of kingdom ethelwulf took kent have already ruled over in time of father egbert ethelwulf died few month afterwards leaving kent to ethelbert second surviving son following year to horror indignation of people of country ethelbald married stepmother judith two year afterwards died ethelbert king of kent again united wessex to own dominion consisted of kent surrey sussex ethelbert reigned short time at death ethelred next brother ascended throne last year alfred youngest brother married elswitha daughter of ethelred mucil earl of gaini in lincolnshire whose mother be one of royal family of mercia be short time after marriage that dane poured into mercia from north messenger be sent to ask assistance of west saxon at once obeyed summons joining mercians marched against dane who shut up in strong city of nottingham be there for time besieged place be strong winter at hand time of soldier service nearly expired treaty be accordingly made by dane be allowed to depart unharmed to north side of humber west saxon returned to kingdom such be situation at present may be sure that dane will not long remain quiet will soon gather for invasion ere long too may expect of great fleet to arrive somewhere off coast saxon who can bear arm have need take field to fight for country faith against heathen invader hitherto edmund a know have deeply mourned death of mother of sister who died in infancy now feel that be for best for terrible time be before men can take refuge in swamp forest must have be hard for delicate woman men be best off who stand alone be able to give thought energy to defence of country 't be well that be now approaching age when saxon youth be wont to take place in rank of battle have spared pain with training in arm though assuredly lack strength yet to cope in hand to hand conflict with fierce dane may yet take part in battle with on one side of egbert on other have thought over many thing of late seems to that saxon have done harm in holding people of country a serf why father edmund exclaimed in astonishment surely must not have men free equal idea seems strange to doubt edmund appears only natural that men must be born to rule others to labour might be so even without serfdom since a know poorer freeman labour just a do serf only receive somewhat larger guerdon for toil have two race mixed more closely together have serfdom be abolished men be free capable of bearing arm must have be able to show far better front to dane seeing that serf be a three to one to freeman serf be cowardly spiritless edmund said be not of fighting race fell almost without resistance before ancestor when landed here race be doubt inferior to own edmund father said seeing that be so tall so strong a saxon of old be not deficient in bravery for fought a stoutly against roman a did own hardy ancestor after having be for hundred of year subject to roman yoke having occasion to use arm lost manly virtue when roman left be easy prey for first comer father must not foresee that time must come when too in turn must be invaded have done so methinks must not have set up so broad line of separation between briton must have admitted latter to right of citizenship in case intermarriage must have taken place freely whole people must have become amalgamated briton accustomed to free institution taking part in war between various saxon kingdom must have recovered warlike virtue must be a one people that must resist dane a be serf who form by far largest part of population be apathetic cowardly view struggle with indifference for what signifies to whether dane saxon conquer have interest in struggle nothing to lose to gain be change of master edmund be silent very possibility of state of thing in there must be serf when men must be free equal have never occurred to have deep respect for father who bore indeed reputation of being one of wisest most clear headed of noble of east anglia seemed to that strange novel doctrine contained much truth in still idea be a strange to a must have be to son of southern planter in america century ago existence of slave seemed a much matter of course a of horse dog although have be accustomed to see from time to time freedom bestowed upon favourite serf a special reward for service thought of general liberation of slave be strange almost bewildering lay awake puzzling over problem long after father kinsman have fallen asleep chapter ii battle of kesteven following morning early little party started great chest be dug up from place of concealment resumed ordinary dress ealdorman attired in white tunic with broad purple band round lower edge with short cloak of green cloth be fastened with gold brooch at neck necklet of same metal several gold bracelet completed costume except that wore flat cap sandal edmund have green tunic cloak of deep red colour while egbert be dressed in yellow with green cloak saxon being extremely fond of bright colour wore dagger whose sheath be incrusted in silver in belt ealdorman kinsman carried short broad bladed sword while edmund have boar spear eldred placed in pouch hung at side bag containing number of silver cube cut from long bar roughly stamped chest be then buried again in place of concealment among bush near hut edmund placed bow arrow in boat not that in edmund have fished much larger heavier craft eldred egbert have used then party with hound took place in ealdorman egbert be provided with long pole with sent little boat rapidly through water after poling way for eight hour reached town of norwich to dane have not yet penetrated here procuring what article needed proceeded on journey to croyland making great circuit to avoid dane at thetford country be for most part covered with thick forest where wild boar deer roamed undisturbed by man where many wolf still lurked although number in country have be greatly diminished by energetic measure king egbert have taken for destruction of beast halting place be for most part at religious house then served purpose of inn for traveller being freely opened to whom necessity pleasure might cause to journey everywhere found monk in state of alarm at progress of dane who wherever went destroyed church religious house slew monk eldred be everywhere received with marked honour being known a wise valiant noble opinion on chance of situation be eagerly listened to found monk at halting place prepared if need be to take up arm fight pagan invader a of mercia wessex have done in preceding autumn traveller on arriving at croyland be warmly welcomed heard brother abbot said that have bravely fought against dane near thetford have be sorely anxious since news came of dispersal of force have be in hiding eldred said hoping that general effort must be made against invader own power be broken since land be in hand people of east anglia foolishly seem to suppose so long a dane remain quiet time have not come for action will repent lethargy day for a dane gather in strength will burst out over surrounding country a dammed up river break bank brother regard east anglia a lost so far a depends upon only hope be in men of kent wessex whom must now look upon a champion who may yet stem tide of invasion drive back dane abbey of yours stand in perilous position being not far removed from humber where so many of dane find entrance to england be not without danger eldred men of fen be numerous hardy brave will offer tough resistance to who may venture to march hitherward if a hope will stay with will undertake command may yet for long time keep dane from door for week time passed quietly edmund spent most of time in hunting being generally accompanied by egbert saxon be exceedingly tall powerful man slow scanty of speech who have earned for title of egbert silent be devoted to kinsman regarded a special guardian of edmund have instructed in use of arm always accompanied when went out to hunt boar standing ever by side to aid to receive rush of wounded furious beast more than once when edmund have be borne down by onslaught must have be severely wounded if not killed sweeping blow of egbert sword have rid of assailant sometimes edmund made excursion in fen where with net snare caught fish swarmed in sluggish water having covered boat with leafy bower until resembled floating bush drifted close to flock of wild fowl with bow arrow obtained many plump wild duck smaller bird be caught in snare trap with bird lime smeared on twig eldred seldom joined son in hunting excursion a be busied with brother abbot in concerting measure of defence in organizing band of messenger who on first warning of danger must be despatched throughout fen to call in fisher population to defence of abbey be on th of september that messenger arrived at abbey craved instant speech with prior latter who be closeted with brother ordered man to be admitted come said from algar ealdorman bid tell that great danish host have landed from humber at rich monastery of bardenay have be pillaged burned algar be assembling inhabitant of marsh land to give battle prays to send what help can spare for assuredly will march hither must be defeated return to ealdorman abbot said tell that lay brother monk who can bear arm will march hence to join under command of lay brother toley whose deed of arm against dane in mercia be well known to brother here eldred will head inhabitant of marsh of neighbourhood with brother of abbey in a reckon nigh four hundred men will to morrow march to join algar messenger be at once sent off through surrounding country bidding man assemble on morrow morning at croyland soon after daybreak began to arrive be armed with sword with long sickle used in cutting rush tied to pole have fastened long piece of iron to oar to serve a pike be rough somewhat ragged throng eldred saw with satisfaction that be hard sturdy set of men accustomed to fatigue likely to stand firm in hour of battle most of carried shield made of platted osier covered with armoury of abbey be well supplied sword ax be distributed among worst armed of fenmen then with little order regularity with firm cheerful countenance a men determined to win die band moved off under eldred command followed by contingent of abbey eighty strong under lay brother toley sturdy band be monk well fed vigorous knew that have mercy to expect from dane regarding a pagan enemy of religion a well a of country must be trusted to do utmost late that evening joined algar at place have appointed found that large number of people of marsh have gathered round banner dane have not moved a yet from bardenay algar determined to wait for day two before advancing in order to give time to others farther from scene of action to arrive next day came contingent from several other priory abbey sight of considerable force gathered together gave heart confidence to algar eldred other leader morcar osgot harding moved about among host encouraging with cheering word warning to be in way intimidated by fierce appearance of dane to hold steadfast firm in rank to yield foot of ground to onslaught of enemy many priest have accompanied contingent from religious house added exhortation to of leader telling men that god must assuredly fight on side against heathen bidding man remember that defeat meant destruction of church altar overthrow of whole religion restored worship of pagan god edmund went about among gathering taking great interest in wild scene for marsh men differed much in appearance from settled inhabitant of father land scene in camp be indeed varied in character here there be harper with group of listener gathered round a sung exploit of father animated hearer to fresh fire energy by relating legend of cruelty of merciless dane other group there be surrounding priest who be appealing to religious feeling a well a to patriotism men sat about sharpening weapon fixing on more firmly handle of shield adjusting arrow to bowstring preparing in other way for coming fight from of fire round marsh men be sitting came snatch of boisterous song while here there apart from crowd priest be hearing confession shriving penitent next morning early one of scout who have be sent to observe movement of dane reported that be issuing from camp advancing into country algar marwilled host part under leader moved to meet near kesteven army came in sight of other after advancing until short distance apart halted to marshal rank anew eldred with men of marsh near croyland contingent from abbey have post in central division be commanded by algar edmund took post by father egbert stood beside edmund have never before seen dane must not admit that appearance be enough to shake stoutest heart carried great shield covering from head to foot be composed of wood bark leather painted embossed in case of chief plated with gold silver so large be that in naval encounter if fear of falling into enemy hand forced to throw into sea must float on shield after death in battle soldier be carried to grave on buckler a stood facing saxon locked shield together so a to form barrier well nigh impregnable against arrow wore helmet common men of leather leader of iron copper while many in addition wore coat of mail carried sword battle axe bow arrow of sword be short curled like scimitar others be long straight be wielded with hand wore hair long hanging down shoulder for most part shaved cheek chin wore moustache very long be for most tall lithe sinewy men physically in way superior to saxon from whom differed very widely in complexion saxon being fair while dane be very dark a much so a modern gypsy indeed saxon historian speak of a black pagan upon other hand many of northman being scandinavian be a fair a saxon dane began battle in front shouting fiercely striking sword on shield with clashing noise while rank behind shot shower of arrow among saxon at once replied combat be not continued long at distance for dane with mighty shout rushed upon saxon stood ground firmly desperate conflict ensued saxon chief vied with other in act of bravery singling out leader of dane engaged with in hand to hand conflict algar have placed swordsman in front line armed with spear in second a swordsman battled with dane spearmen when saw shield uplifted to guard head thrust under with weapon slew many edmund seeing that with sword must have little chance against fierce soldier fell little behind father kinsman a be engaged with enemy from time to time when saw opportunity rushed in delivered thrust with spear at unguarded point saxon shout rose louder louder a dane in vain endeavoured to break through line monk fought stoutly many fierce norseman fell before blow dane who have not expected so firm resistance began to hesitate algar giving word saxon took offensive line pressed forward step by step archer poured arrow in storm among danish rank fell back before onslaught already three of king many of principal leader have fallen at last finding unable to withstand impetuous onslaught of saxon turned fled in confusion towards camp saxon with exulting shout pursued great number be slaughtered dane have however a be custom fortified camp before advancing algar drew off troop deeming that must be better to defer attack on position until following day there be high feasting in saxon camp that evening be brought to abrupt conclusion by arrival of scout who reported that great danish army marching from humber be approaching camp of compatriot news be too true king guthorn bergsecg oskytal halfdene amund jarls frene hingwar hubba two sidrocs with follower have marched down from yorkshire to join invader who have just landed news of immense reinforcement spread consternation among angle in vain leader went about among exhorted to courage promising victory a decisive a that have won that day entreaty be in vain for when morning dawned be found that three fourth of number have left camp during night have made off to marsh fastness council of chief be held chance of conflict appeared hopeless so vastly be out numbered by dane algar however declared that must die rather than retreat if fly now said east anglia will fall into hand of heathen even must fight fall example of what handful of brave men can do against invader will surely animate angle to further resistance while if conquer so great blow will be dealt to renown of dane that england will rise against on hearing word chief came to determination to win die a stood eldred took edmund aside after determination have be arrived at son said allowed yesterday to stand by side in battle well worthily did bear to day must withdraw fight be well nigh hopeless believe that who take part in be doomed to perish must not that house must altogether disappear will die more cheerfully in hope that day will avenge upon heathen therefore edmund bid take station at distance behind battle so that when see day go against may escape in time will urge faithful egbert to endeavour when see that be lost to make way from fight rejoin to journey with to wessex there present to king for if battle be lost will die rather than fly such be resolution of algar other brave chief eldred ealdorman must not be only one of leader to run from fray edmund be deeply touched at father word parental rule be so strict in day that did not even enter mind to protest against be decision a morning went on dane be engaged in funeral ceremony of dead king while saxon quiet resolute received holy sacrament prepared for fight algar chose position on rising ground with eldred commanded centre toley morcar led right wing osgot harding left of wing contained about five hundred men algar centre be little withdrawn from wing contained about of best warrior be designed a reserve with if need be must move to assistance of of wing might be sorely pressed in danger saxon formed in solid mass with buckler linked together danish array issued out from camp be vastly superior in number be commanded by four king eight jarls earl while two king four earl remained in charge of camp of great crowd of prisoner for most part woman child whom have brought with with dane who have come down from yorkshire be large body of horseman who charged furiously down upon saxon maintained so firm array with lance spear projecting outward that dane failed to break through after making repeated effort suffering heavy loss drew back then danish archer slinger poured in storm of missile effected little harm a saxon stooped little behind closely packed line of buckler be stout enough to keep out shower of arrow day struggle continued again again dane strove to break solid saxon array with sword battle axe attempted to hew down hedge of spear in vain at last leader convinced that must not overcome obstinacy of resistance ordered follower to feign retreat a dane turned to fly saxon set up triumphant shout breaking up solid phalanx rushed after in complete disorder in vain algar osgot toley eldred other leader shouted to to stand firm weary of long inactivity convinced that dane be routed saxon pursued across plain suddenly danish horse who after failing to break through rank have remained apart at short distance from conflict dashed down upon disordered saxon while flying infantry turning round also fell upon with exulting shout taken wholly by surprise confused disordered saxon must offer effectual opposition to charge danish horse rode among hewing slaying sword battle ax of footman completed work in few minute of saxon band have for so many hour successfully resisted onslaught of dane not one survived save few fleet footed young men who throwing away arm succeeded in making escape little group consisting of algar toley eldred other leader who have gathered together when men broke rank have taken up position on knoll of ground rising above plain here for long time resisted effort of whole of dane surrounding with heap of slain at length one by one succumbed to danish onslaught fighting valiantly to last from position at distance edmund watched last desperate struggle with streaming eye heart torn by anxiety for father must see danish foe swarming round little band who defended crest be lost from sight only flashing of sword showed where struggle be still going on in centre of confused mass edmund have be on knee for time now rose come old boy said to hound who lay beside watching distant conflict occasionally uttering deep angry growl must obey father last command let away took one more glance at distant conflict before turning be plain that be nearly finished sword have well nigh ceased to rise fall when saw sudden movement in throng of dane suddenly man burst out from started at headlong speed towards pursued by number of dane even at distance edmund thought that recognized tall figure of kinsman have time to assure of at once accompanied by hound set off at top of speed from field of battle have fully quarter of mile start being active hardy accustomed to exercise from childhood have fear that dane must overtake still ran hardest looking over shoulder from time to time saw that at first dane who be pursuing fugitive be gaining upon also after time again increased distance while being unencumbered with shield heavy weapon fugitive kept advantage have at first gained three mile from battle field edmund reached edge of wide spreading wood looking round a entered shelter saw that flying saxon be still about quarter of mile behind that dane despairing of over taking have ceased pursuit edmund therefore checked footstep awaited arrival of fugitive who now felt certain be kinsman in few minute egbert came up having slackened speed considerably when saw that be no longer pursued be bleeding from several wound now that necessity for exertion have passed walked feebly along without word flung on ground by edmund buried face in arm lad must see by shaking of broad shoulder that be weeping bitterly great hound walked up to prostrate figure gave vent to long piteous howl then lying down by egbert side placed head on shoulder chapter iii massacre at croyland edmund wept sorely for time for knew that kinsman agitation must be only caused by death of father at last approached egbert brave kinsman said need ask question for know too well that dear father have fallen rouse pray let bandage wound bleed fast for will want strength must need pursue way well into forest for with to morrow dawn dane will scatter over whole country yes egbert said turning round sitting up must not in grief forget mission in truth be faint with loss of blood be well dane stopped when did for felt strength failing must have held out little further yes edmund continued a lad tearing strip from garment proceeded to bandage wound father be dead nobly indeed did fight nobly did die with circle of dead dane around algar toley be last four to resist back to back stood many be dane who fell before blow toley fell first then algar dane closed closer around still fought on till father be beaten to knee then cried to 'fly egbert to son ' then flung upon dane like wild boar upon dog with suddenness of rush heavy blow of battle axe cut way for through be well nigh miracle must scarce believe when be free flung away shield helmet a soon a have well begun to run for felt blood gushing out from dozen wound knew must want strength soon caught sight of running ahead of have found be gaining upon must have turned off made way to lead dane aside soon saw that be holding own so followed straight on knee trembled felt strength be well nigh gone when looking round found dane have desisted from pursuit grieve edmund must have left battle alive when others have died bravely for save few fleet footed youth believe that not single saxon have escaped fight father have laid command upon be forced to obey though god know must rather have died with hero on field 't be well for that did not good egbert edmund said drying eye for what must have done in troubled land without one protector be thought of egbert said that seemed to give strength a dashed at dane now methinks be strong enough to walk again let make way far into forest then must rest for night few hour sleep will make fresh man of to morrow morning will go to croyland see what good abbot uncle proposes to do then will to hut where dwelt before coming hither will dig up chest take out such valuable a can carry then make for wessex after day work have no longer hope that east anglia will successfully oppose dane yet angle fought well for one of who have fallen in two day fighting at least four dane must have perished have food edmund for in

long a there be remotest chance of victory be duty of leader to set example of valour to follower when be lost must think of country what though brave thane slew score of dane before died death have left countryman without leader by one battle dane have made master of north of east anglia better far have when day be lost retreated to gather people together when better opportunity presented again to make head against invader be heathen rather than christian warfare thus to throw away life rather than to retreat wait for god time to come again to stake on one throw if lost loses whole people seems to act of gamester trust must time ever come a be too much to be feared will ere long that dane invade brother kingdom of wessex will not be found wanting in courage assuredly when defeated in battle must not throw away life for belongs to people rather than to myself must retire to refuge until must again gather saxon around attack invader like face of young ealdorman doubt not that will

to edmund be accompanied by officer of royal household who be to inform freeman serf of estate by king pleasure edmund have be appointed ealdorman of land found on arrival that house have be newly built be large comfortable thane of district speedily came in to pay respect to new ealdorman although surprised to find so young be pleased with bearing manner knowing that came of good fighting blood doubted not that in time must make valiant leader who came be hospitably entertained for many day there be high feasting so far removed be part of england from district dane have invaded that at present slight alarm have be caused by edmund kinsman lost time in impressing upon greatness of coming danger may be sure said that ere long will see galley on coast when have eaten up mercia anglia will assuredly come hither will have to fight for life unless be prepared will go hard with after have be at new residence for month edmund sent out messenger to thane in district requesting to assemble at council then formally laid matter before be above thing said necessary that must have place where can place woman child in case of invasion where can ourselves retire in extreme necessity therefore propose that will build fort of sufficient size to contain inhabitant of district with many flock herd cousin egbert have ridden far over country recommends that roman fortification at moorcaster will be utilized be large in extent have double circle of earthen bank differ from be wont to build since saxon always fill up ground so a to be flat with top of earthen bank while roman left theirs hollow however space be so large that must take vast labour to fill up therefore propose that must merely thicken bank must in saxon custom build wall with turret upon sloping bank alone must be small protection against onslaught of dane stone wall be matter must only be carried after long siege if fall in with view will of send serf to carry out work will do same will moreover pay fifty freeman who may do squaring of stone proper laying of proposal led to long discussion a thought that there be occasion a yet to take measure thane finally agreed to carry out edmund proposal chapter iv invasion of wessex edmund egbert devoted most of time to building of new fort living very simply expended whole of revenue of land on payment of freeman mason engaged upon work roman fort be parallelogram side being about yard long end half that length be surrounded by two earthen bank with wide ditch be deepened considerably slope be cut down more sharply inner bank be widened until be foot across top on wall be built be faced on side with square stone space between filled up with rubble cement total thickness being foot height of wall be foot at interval of yard apart tower be raised foot above one of being placed at side of entrance here bank be cut away solid buttress of masonry supported high gate opening in outer bank be not opposite to gate in inner being fifty yard away so that who entered by must have for distance to follow ditch between two bank exposed to missile of on wall before arriving at inner gate five hundred men laboured incessantly at work stone for wall be fortunately found close at hand notwithstanding work took nearly six month to execute deep well be sunk in centre of fort by mean ample supply of water be secured however large might be number within very short time after commencement of work news arrived that king edmund of east anglia have gathered force together have met dane in great battle near thetford on th of november have be totally defeated by edmund having be taken prisoner captive king after having be for long time cruelly tortured by dane be shot to death with arrow be not long after news came that whole of east anglia have fallen into hand of dane early in month of february just a wall of fort have begun to rise messenger arrived from king bidding edmund assemble men in earlship march at once to join near devizes a news have come that great danish fleet have sailed up thames have already captured royal town of reading messenger be sent out in direction early next morning men having assembled edmund kinsman marched away with towards devizes upon arrival at town found king brother with men following day army moved east towards reading have not marched many mile before messenger arrived saying that two of danish jarls with great following have gone out to plunder country that have be encountered by aethelwulf earl of berkshire with men at englefield fierce battle have taken place saxon have gained victory great number of dane have be slain sidroc one of jarls being among fallen three day later royal army arrived in sight of reading being joined on march by aethelwulf men dane have thrown up great rampart between thames kennet many be still at work on fortification be speedily slain by saxon success be short one main body of invader swarmed out from city desperate engagement took place saxon fought valiantly led by king prince alfred being wholly undisciplined unaccustomed to war be unable to withstand onslaught of dane who fought in better order keeping together in rank after four hour hard fighting saxon be compelled to fall back rallied again few mile from reading ethelred alfred went among bidding be of good cheer for time when fought in better order must gain victory that loss have not be greater than dane only that unhappily valiant ealdorman aethelwulf have be slain fresh messenger be sent throughout country bidding men of wessex to rally round king on fourth morning after defeat ethelred found at head of larger force than have fought with in last battle dane have moved out from reading have taken post at ashdown a saxon army approached be seen to be divided into two body one of be commanded by two king other by two jarls saxon therefore made similar division of army king commanding one division prince alfred other edmund with men of sherborne be in division of alfred dane advanced to attack fell with fury upon have be arranged that division must not advance to attack until commanded by king be also put in motion for time alfred men supported assault of dane then being hardly pressed prince sent messenger to brother to urge that movement must be made saxon be impatient at standing on defensive alfred saw that must either allow to charge enemy must retreat presently messenger returned saying that king be in tent hearing mass that have given order that man must move must disturb until mass be concluded alfred hesitated no longer formed men into solid body then raising battle cry rushed upon dane battle be furious one dane be upon higher ground standard being planted by side of single thorn tree grew on slope of hill towards alfred with men fought way lesson of previous battle have not be lost saxon kept together in solid body made way with irresistible weight through rank of dane still latter closed in on side fight be doubtful until king having finished devotion led division into battle for long time desperate strife continued great number on side be killed saxon animated at once by love of country hatred of invader by humiliation at previous defeat fought with such fury that dane began to give way then saxon pressed still more hotly invader presently lost heart fled in confusion pursued in direction by exulting saxon danish king bergsecg five jarls two sidrocs osbearn frene hareld be slain many thousand of follower great spoil of arm armour fell into hand of victor edmund have fought bravely in battle at head of men egbert have kept beside twice when lad have be smitten to knee by enemy covered with shield beat off foe be over young for such fight a edmund said when dane have taken to flight will need four five year over head before can stand in battle against fierce northman break down guard by sheer weight bore gallantly doubt not will yet be a famous warrior a be brave father edmund did not join in pursuit being too much bruised exhausted to do so egbert with men of sherborne followed flying dane until nightfall have done well young ealdorman prince alfred said to lad after battle have be wishing much that must be with during past month heard that be building strong fort deemed better to let continue work undisturbed when be finished trust will have often near fear that for time will have little space for peaceful pursuit for dane be coming a hear in great troop westward will have many battle to fight ere clear land of in day defeat however severe have not same decisive effect a have in modern warfare there be cannon to lose great store to fall into hand of victor army be simply dispersed component part reassembled in course of day two ready when reinforcement arrived to renew fight thus decisive a be victory of ashdown prince alfred saw that many such victory must be won prolonged exhausting struggle carried on before tide of invasion must be finally hurled back from wessex next few day be spent in making fair distribution of spoil arm among conqueror of thane then returned home with people remainder on king entreaty agreed to march with against dane who after battle have fallen back to basing where have be joined by others coming from coast royal army advanced against fourteen day after battle of ashdown struggle be renewed fight lasted for many hour towards nightfall saxon be compelled to retreat moving off field however in good order so that spoil fell into hand of dane check be great disappointment to saxon who after late victory have hoped that must speedily clear kingdom of dane indeed taught prudence by manner in west saxon have fought for while refrained from plundering excursion two month later saxon be again called to arm somerled danish chieftain have again advanced to reading have captured burned town king marched against two army met at merton here desperate battle took place during first part of day saxon be victorious over division of danish army in afternoon latter received reinforcement renewed fight saxon believing that victory have be won have fallen into disorder be finally driven from field great number be slain on side bishop edmund many saxon noble be killed king ethelred so severely wounded that expired few day later april rd having reigned for five year be buried at wimbourne minster prince alfred ascended throne ethelred be much regretted by people accession of alfred increased hope of battling successfully against dane although wise brave king ethelred have be scarcely monarch for warlike people in troubled time religious exercise occupied too large share of thought rule be kindly rather than strong authority be weak over noble from prince alfred saxon hoped better thing from boyhood have be regarded with special interest affection by people a father have led to regard a future king fact that have be personally consecrated by pope appeared to invest with special authority immense superiority in learning over people greatly impressed though gentle be firm resolute prompt in action daring in field thus then although people regretted king ethelred there be general feeling of hope joy when alfred took place on throne have succeeded to crown month when dane again advanced in great number want of success have attended in last two battle have damped spirit of people be with very small force only that alfred be able to advance against army met near wilton where dane in vastly superior number be posted on hill king alfred led force forward fell upon dane so bravely did saxon fight that for time day went favourably for gradually dane be driven from post of vantage after hour fighting turned to fly a at merton kesteven impetuosity of saxon proved ruin breaking compact rank scattered in pursuit of dane seeing how small be number of pursuer rallied turned upon saxon be driven from field have so bravely won unless brave saxon learn order discipline king said to edmund of noble who gathered round on evening after defeat cause be assuredly lost have proved now in battle that be superior man to man to dane throw away fruit of victory by impetuosity great caesar who wrote account of battle have read in latin described order discipline with roman troop fought be always in heavy mass even after battle heavy armed soldier kept rank did not scatter in pursuit of enemy leaving task to more lightly armed troop must that have three four year before to teach men discipline order ala there be time for dane have fallen in great number in fight be ever receiving reinforcement come on in fresh wave of invasion while saxon finding that effort valour seem to avail nothing be beginning fast to lose heart see how small number assembled round standard yesterday yet war be beginning truly look out be bad for england king made strenuous effort again to raise army people did not respond to call in addition to battle have be spoken of several others have be fought in different part of wessex by ealdormen follower against body of invading dane in space of one year saxon have engaged in eight pitched battle in many skirmish great number have be slain on side dane ever received fresh accession of strength seemed to grow stronger more numerous after battle while saxon be dwindling rapidly wide tract of country have be devastated men slaughtered woman child taken captive people utterly dispirited depressed no longer listened to voice of leader refused again to peril life in strife seemed hopeless alfred therefore called ealdormen together proposed to that since people must no longer fight sole mean remained to escape destruction be to offer to buy off dane proposal be agreed to for although none of have hope that dane must long keep treaty might make yet even little respite might give heart spirit to saxon again accordingly negotiation be entered into with dane in consideration of large money payment agreed to retire from wessex money be paid dane retired from reading have used a headquarters marched to london king burhred feeble king of mercia must hing to oppose too agreed to pay large annual tribute from end of till autumn of country be comparatively quiet alfred ruled wisely tried to repair terrible damage war have made edmund looked after earldom grew into powerful young man of nineteen year old king alfred have not deceived for moment a to future dane said be still in england east anglia northumbria swarm with have army after being bought off by brother of mercia sailed across sea landed in france there must have be hope for restless nature will not allow to stay long in part have conquered in anglia king guthrum have divided land among jarls there seem disposed to settle down elsewhere care not for land preferring to leave in hand of former owner to till after to wring from cultivator fruit of harvest then a country becomes thoroughly impoverished must move elsewhere mercia can overrun whensoever choose after there be nothing for to do to sweep down again upon wessex with rest of england at foot be hopeless to think that alone can withstand united power then what think must be end of edmund asked 't be difficult to see end alfred replied must seem that only hope of release from be that when have utterly eaten up ravaged england may turn thought elsewhere already be harrying northern coast of france there be richer prize on mediterranean shore may be that when england be longer worth plundering may sail away to spain italy have acted foolishly in way have fought when first began to arrive upon coast must have laboured hard to build great fleet so that must go forth meet on sea indeed might have escaped watch landed fleet must have cut off reinforcement coming to thus who reached shore must have be overwhelmed even now think that something might be done way purpose to build fleet may when again invade take station near mouth of thames fall upon vessel bringing store reinforcement must give much encouragement to people whose hopelessness desperation be caused principally by fact that seems to be of use killing enemy since so many be ready constantly to take place will gladly undertake to build one ship edmund said fort be now finished with revenue of land must at once commence ship if dane give time when be finished must build will more gladly do since seems to that if dane entirely overrun country must take to sea so in turn become plunderer with view will have ship built large strong so that may keep sea in weather be home if be driven out of england there must be plenty of port in france many quiet nook inlet round england where one can put in to refit when necessary must pick up many prize of danish ship returning laden with booty with ship must carry strong crew with trusty egbert best of fighting men must be able to hold own even if attacked by two three of danish galley idea be good one edmund king said must must carry into effect be thousand time better to live free life on sea even if certain at last to be overpowered by danish fleet than to lurk hunted fugitive in wood can not do so long a live must remain among people ready to snatch chance may offer of striking blow against invader for be different must not of course do edmund said until be lost here mean to defend fort to extremity still must be that dane conquer land be well to have refuge edmund talked matter over with egbert who warmly entered into plan so long a have life will fight against dane in ship at least can fight manfully till end must not build on sea coast before time when need may be destroyed by dane will build on parrot water be deep enough far up from sea to float when empty if choose spot where river run among wood might hide so that may to last escape attention of dane must get men crafty in ship building from one of port sending down body of own serf to do rough work will go to exeter first there choose craftsman most skilled in building ship will take council with a to best form size must be good to sail yet able to row fast with strong crew must have room to house goodly number of rowing fighting men edmund might before start consult king alfred must have seen at rome other port on mediterranean ship in use there be doubtless far in advance of own for know from holy bible that thousand year ago st paul made long voyage in ship doubtless have learned much since day edmund thought idea good one asked king to make drawing of vessel in use in mediterranean king alfred readily did egbert edmund then journeyed to exeter where finding out man most noted for skill in building ship told object have in view showed drawing king have made there be two of one long galley rowed with double bank of oar other heavy trading ship must be useless to shipwright said laying second drawing aside must not be fast enough either to overtake to fly other galley must methinks suit well have seen drawing of such ship before be war galley such a be used by genoese in fight against african pirate be fast roomy have plenty of accommodation for crew one of well manned handled must be match for six at least of danish galley be much lower in water smaller in way will cost good deal of money to build ship will devote revenue of land to until be finished edmund said will place hundred serf at service will leave to to hire a many craftsman a may be needed intend to build in quiet place in deep wood on river parrot so that may escape eye of dane will require seasoned timber shipwright urged will buy edmund replied a will direct can have brought up river to spot being so large heavy shipwright said will be difficult to launch methinks be best to dig hole dock at little distance from river then when be finished way can be cut to river wide enough for to pas out when water be turned in will float up level to surface a will not draw more than two foot of water cut need not be more than three foot deep will be best plan by far edmund agreed for can make hole so deep that can build entirely below level of ground then can if need be fill up hole altogether with bush cover up so that must not be seen by danish galley rowing up river even by of enemy who might enter wood unless made special search for there must lie until chose to embark shipwright at once set to work to draw out plan week later sent to edmund messenger with account of quantity size of wood must require be purchased at once edmund egbert with serf journeyed to spot have chosen be met there by shipwright who brought with twenty craftsman from exeter wood be brought up river while craftsman began to cut up into fitting serf applied to dig deep dock in vessel be to be built chapter v disciplined band construction of ship went on steadily king alfred who be building several war vessel of ordinary size took great interest in edmund craft paid several visit to while be in progress will be fine ship said one day a vessel be approaching completion much larger than in sea reminds edmund not indeed in size shape in purpose of ark noah built before deluge covered whole earth built a know to escape with family from destruction too be building against time when deluge of danish invasion will sweep over land trust that success will equal that of patriarch will be better off than noah be edmund said for have nothing to do save to shut up window wait till flood abated while will go out seek enemy on sea respite purchased by king from dane be short one in autumn of band be again swarming around border of wessex constant irruption took place edmund received summons to gather tenant found that longer replied willingly to call several of chief men met represented to general feeling prevailed men say spokesman explained that be useless to fight against dane in there be ten pitched battle vast number of dane be slain vast number also of saxon dane be already far more numerous than before for fresh horde continue to arrive on shore more than fill up place of who be killed place of saxon be empty fighting force be far smaller than be last year if again go out again fight many battle even if be victorious can hardly hope to be same thing will happen many thousand will be slain following year will in vain try to put army in field can match of dane who will again have filled up rank be a numerous a ever so long a continue to fight so long dane will slay burn destroy wheresoever march until there will remain of few fugitive hidden in wood must be far better off did cease to resist dane become master a have become master of northumbria mercia anglia there be true have plundered church thane house have stolen be worth carrying away when have taken that there be to take leave people alone unmolested to till ground to gain livelihood slay for pleasure of slaying grievous a be condition of angle wife child be free from massacre be allowed to gain living west saxon have showed that be coward have defeated northman over over again when far outnumbering be dishonour to yield now when rest of england have yielded when further fighting will only bring ruin upon wife child edmund must find reply to argument knew that even king despaired of ultimately resisting danish invasion after listening to that thane have to say retired with egbert apart what say egbert there be reason in argument that use have wife child risk only own life can well understand that who have so much to lose be chary of further effort what say think will be fair to press further egbert answered methinks that might raise band consisting of youth unmarried men in earldom might train carefully keep always together seeing that land will still be cultivated able to pay assessment may even add to since exempt from service band must train practise until must rely upon to defeat far larger force of enemy must be available for crew when take to ship think idea be very good one egbert will propose to thane proposition be accordingly made that married men must be exempt from service that youth above age of sixteen unmarried men must be formed into band kept permanently under arm landowner who lost service of son freeman working for must pay same assessment only a before who did not contribute men to levy must pay additional assessment edmund said must pay men composing band same wage must earn in field must undertake expense so long a king continues struggle said be duty to aid can escape from danger peril of invasion must dane come near must perforce fight so long a continue at distance thing can go on here a if have peace in land proposal be after discussion agreed to news caused gladness contentment throughout earldom younger men who have be included in levy be quite satisfied with arrangement spirit of west saxon be still high without wife family who must suffer by absence be ruined by death be eager to continue contest proposal that must be paid a when at work be considered perfectly satisfactory men of sherborne have under young leader gained great credit by steadiness valour in battle four year before looked forward to fresh victory over invader result be that ninety young men assembled for service edmund have sent off messenger to king saying that people be utterly weary of war refused to take up arm that be gathering band of young men with whom must ere long join prayed for short delay in order that might get into condition to be useful on day of battle after consultation with egbert edmund drew up series of order somewhat resembling of modern drill king alfred have once in speaking to described manner in theban people of northern greece have fought placing troop in form of wedge formation now taught men from morning to night be practised at rallying from pursuit flight changing from line into form of wedge man have appointed place in line wedge who formed outside line of formation be armed with large shield covered from chin to foot with short spear in inner line carried shield bore spear of increasing length so that four line of spear projected from wedge to nearly same distance inside four line be twenty men armed with shield bow arrow side of wedge be of equal length so that must march way egbert place be at apex of wedge intended generally for attack carried spear did at other corner a must be covered by beside behind be armed with huge battle axe other leader be also chosen for great personal strength edmund place be on horseback in middle of wedge whence must overlook whole direct movement in three week men must perform simple movement to perfection at sound from edmund horn must run in a when scattered in pursuit flight must form from line into wedge without least confusion man occupying assigned place men be delighted with new exercise felt confident that weight of solid mass thickly bristling with spear must break through danish line without difficulty must draw off from field in perfect order safety in case of defeat however numerous foe two front line be to thrust with pike others keeping long spear immovable to form solid hedge man carried short heavy sword to use in case by fatality wedge must get broken up when assured that band be perfect in new exercise edmund marched joined king found on arrival that summons to arm have be everywhere disregarded many men have indeed come in be in way sufficient to form force must enable to take field against dane edmund therefore solicited obtained permission to march with band to endeavour to check plundering band of dane who be already committing devastation throughout country be not rash edmund monarch said have handful of men must grieve indeed did aught of harm befall if can fall upon small party of plunderer destroy will do good service not only by compelling to keep together by raising spirit of saxon avoid conflict with party likely to defeat will hear of soon promise edmund replied trust that news will be good little party set out towards border before long met number of fugitive weeping woman carrying child old men boy making way from neighbourhood of dane men have for most part driven herd into wood where be prepared to defend a best must against roving party learned that haffa danish jarl with about follower be plundering ravaging country about twelve mile away force be formidable one after consultation with egbert edmund determined to advance deeming that might find dane scattered cut off of party a neared country of dane be in possession smoke of burning village homestead be seen rising heavily in air edmund halted for night in wood about mile distant from blazing farm band lay down for hour before daybreak three four of swiftest footed of men be sent out to reconnoitre learned from badly wounded men whom found lying near burning farm that dane have be plundering in party of twenty thirty that main body under haffa lay five mile away at village of bristowe consultation be held be agreed that party must remain hidden in wood during day that upon following night must fall upon dane trusting to surprise to inflict much damage upon to be able to draw off before enemy must recover sufficiently to rally attack accordingly about nine o'clock in evening started marching rapidly approached bristowe hour half later must see great fire blazing round dane be carousing after foray of day great number of cattle be penned up near village edmund egbert having halted men stole forward until close to village in order to learn nature of ground position of dane upon return waited until fire burned low sound of shouting singing decreased be useless to wait longer for knew that many of dane must according to custom keep up revelry night crawling along ground band made for great pen where be herded cattle dane have driven in from surrounding country over several guard have be placed before starting egbert assigned to man special duty be to fulfil saxon crept up quite close to danish guard unobserved to of three four bowman have be told off on nearing sentry lay prone on ground with bow bent arrow fixed until whistle from edmund gave signal then arrow be loosed distance being so short danish sentry be slain then party of men removed side of pen facing village rest mingled with cattle soon with point of spear goaded into flight in mass herd thundered down upon village saxon keeping closely behind adding to terror by goading hindermost dane astonished at sudden thunder of hoof bearing down upon leaped to foot endeavoured to turn course of herd deemed to have accidentally broken loose by loud shout by rattling sword against shield ox however be too terrified by in rear to check course charged impetuously down upon dane number of be hurled to ground trampled under foot wildest confusion reigned in camp be increased when a herd swept along number of active men with spear sword fell suddenly upon score be cut down run through before must prepare for defence recover from surprise at novel method of attack at last a thunder of herd died away in distance became aware of comparative fewness of foe began to rally make head against assailant sooner be case than note of horn be heard a if by magic assailant instantly darted away into night leaving superstitious dane in doubt whether whole attack upon have not be of supernatural nature long before recovered be ready for pursuit saxon be far away le than of dane having be slain trampled to death while of edmund band not one have received so much a wound saxon regained wood in highest state of exultation at success more confident than before in leader be convinced edmund said that be true way to fight dane to harry attack by night assault until dare not break up into party become so worn out by constant alarm that will be glad to leave country where plunder booty be only to be earned at so great cost knowing that haffa band must for time be thoroughly on alert edmund moved party to portion of country where inflicted blow almost a heavy a have dealt haffa upon sigbert of danish jarls three four more very successful night attack be made then dane by time thoroughly alarmed obtained from saxon country people whom took prisoner news a to strength of edmund band furious at heavy loss have be inflicted upon by so small number determined to unite in crushing by threat of instant death by offer of high reward succeeded in persuading two saxon prisoner to act a spy one day brought in to haffa news that band have that morning after striking successful blow at dane ten mile away entered at daybreak wood three mile from camp northman disdaining to ask for assistance from one of other band against so small foe moved out at once with of men towards wood saxon have posted guard who on approach of dane roused edmund with news that enemy be close at hand saxon be soon on foot now friend edmund said to here be time for trying what benefit have got from exercise can not well draw off for dane be a fleet footed a therefore let fight conquer men formed up cheerfully little body moved out from wood to meet dane latter gave shout of triumph a saw saxon force from compact formation appeared even smaller than be norseman advanced in haste eager to be first to fall upon enemy whom regarded a easy prey a arrived upon spot however saw thick hedge of spear bristled round little body of saxon first comer checked speed waited till haffa came up accompanied by principal warrior without moment hesitation jarl flung upon saxon in vain however tried to reach with long sword a neared front line of saxon dropped on one knee a dane with shield dashed against spear strove to cut through kneeling men be able with pike to thrust at unguarded portion of body below shield many fell grievously wounded after trying for time in vain haffa finding that individual effort did not suffice to break through saxon spear formed men up in line four deep advanced in solid body so a to overwhelm saxon now rose to foot spear instead of being pointed outwards be inclined towards front wedge advanced against dane saxon war cry rose loud a neared danish line then still maintaining close formation charged upon assault be irresistible whole weight be thrown upon point preceded a be by densely packed spear burst through danish line a if latter have be composed of osier twig bearing down in way with shout of surprise dane broke up line closed in thick mass round saxon behind pressing forward impeding motion of warrior actually engaged saxon no longer kept stationary in obedience to edmund order triangle advanced sometimes with one angle in front sometimes with way moved sweeping away dane opposed to while archer from centre shot fast strong into mass of enemy haffa trying to oppose advance of wedge be slain by blow of egbert axe after hour fierce fighting dane having lost upwards of fifty of best men finding effort to produce impression upon saxon vain desisted from attack fled at once wedge broke up saxon followed in hot pursuit cutting down flying enemy obedient however to edmund repeated shout kept fairly together when dane thinking broken disordered turned to fall upon single note of horn brought instantly together again astonished dane saw phalanx have proved so fatal to prepared to receive attack did not attempt to deliver took to flight saxon a before pursuing twice a many of dane be slain in retreat a in first attack pursuit be continued for many mile then fearing that might come across fresh body of enemy edmund called off men great be triumph of saxon few of have suffered from wound more le serious not one have fallen have defeated body of dane four time own force have killed nearly half of felt confident that tactic have adopted must enable in future to defeat scattered body of dane might meet for week after battle rested spending time in further improving in drill practicing especially alteration of position of spear requisite when changing from defensive attitude with pike at right angle to face to of attack when spear of face of advancing wedge be directed forward messenger arrived from king to whom edmund have sent news of various success alfred sent warmest congratulation thanks for great result have be gained with so small force king confessing that be unable to understand how with such disproportionate number edmund must so totally have routed force of so distinguished leader a haffa for week edmund continued work of checking depredation of dane so successful be that freebooter became seized with superstitious awe of band rapidity of maneuvering manner in men at one moment scattered be in formed in serried mass against effort broke a wave against rock seemed to to be something superhuman in part of wessex therefore invader gradually withdrew force across frontier in other part of country tide of invasion being unchecked large tract of country have be devastated west saxon must nowhere make head against one day messenger reached edmund telling that large danish army be approaching sherborne urging to return instantly to defence of earldom with rapid march proceeded thither on arriving at house found that dane be few mile away that whole country be in state of panic at once sent off messenger in direction bidding people hasten with wife family herd valuable to fort return to extent restored confidence news of victory have gained over dane have reached sherborne confidence of power to defeat invader follower expressed a scattered to respective farm again raised courage of people through night band of fugitive poured into fort by morning whole of people for many mile round be assembled there egbert edmund busied in assigning to duty station men capable of bearing arm be told off to post on wall old men young boy be to draw water look after cattle woman to cook attend to wounded men of own band be not placed upon wall be held in readiness a reserve to move to point might be threatened to take part in sortie against enemy soon smoke be seen rising up in many direction showing that enemy be at accustomed work cry broke from woman exclamation of rage from men a recognized by direction of smoke that own homestead village be in hand of spoiler about mid day party of mounted dane rode up towards fort made circuit of when have satisfied a to formidable nature of defence rode off again for rest of day none of enemy approached fort chapter vi saxon fort strict watch be kept night several scout be sent out on return reported that dane be feasting having slain many cattle broached cask of mead found in cellar of edmund house have not burned house around intending a scout supposed to make headquarters while attacked fort edmund egbert agreed that must be well to show dane at once that have active enterprising foe to deal with therefore awakened band who be sleeping on skin close to gate with started out be still two hour before dawn when approached house save few men on watch great danish host messenger calculated to amount to ten thousand men be asleep cautiously making way so a to avoid stumbling over dane who lay scattered in group round house saxon crept forward quietly until close to entrance when sleepy watchman started up who be answer be blow from egbert battle axe then leader with twenty of men rushed into house while rest remained on guard at entrance combat be short furious clashing of arm shout of dane roused sleeping near men who escaped from house spread alarm fight lasted three four minute for dane scattered through house in many case still stupid from effect of previous night debauch be unable to gather make collective resistance two jarls fought in manner worthy of renown saxon spear proved more than match for sword died fighting bravely till last between saxon dane there be thought of quarter none asked for mercy on side for none must be granted sea rover never spared armed man who fell into hand saxon be infuriated by suffering invader have inflicted upon have more pity upon foe than if have be wild animal besides jarls thirty of minor leader be in house five six of escaped be well for dane that detachment lay there be not principal body be still few mile in rear for have be so two of king six jarls men of famed valour must have be slain instant work be done saxon rejoined assembled at entrance already dane be thronging up at present in confusion disorder coming rather to see what be matter than to fight hardly believing that saxon must have have audacity to attack in instant saxon fell into usual formation overturning cutting down who happened to be in path burst through straggling dane at trot proceeded across country be still quite dark be time before dane became thoroughly aware of what have happened then missing voice of leader of rushed into house news that two jarls companion have be slain roused to fury at once set off in pursuit of saxon in tumultuous throng band have already considerable start have advantage of knowing foot of country of dane be ignorant when once fairly through enemy edmund have given word formation have broken up so that man must run freely without jostling comrade thus be enabled to proceed at rapid pace reached fort just a day be breaking without having be discovered overtaken by dane news of successful exploit raised spirit of garrison of fort dane swarmed nearly up to wall seeing how formidable be position being without leader fell back without making attack of more impetuous having fallen from arrow of bowman about mid day solid mass of enemy be seen approaching banner with black raven on blood red field showed that contained leader of importance be in fact main body of dane be imposing sight a marched towards fort with fluttering banner sun shining upon brass helmet shield of chief spear head sword of footman here there party of horseman galloped about plain number have not be exaggerated egbert said to edmund there must be ten thousand of there be full twice a many a attacked on field of kesteven sight of great array struck terror into mind of great part of defender of fort confident bearing of young ealdorman thought of strength of wall reassured dane halted at distance of about quarter of mile from wall three four of chief rode forward by splendour of helmet shield trapping be clearly men of great importance halted just out of bowshot distance one of raising voice shouted dog of saxon have laid down arm made submission to must have spared for deed did last night slaying of brave jarls swear that will have revenge upon by god wodin vow that not one within wall man woman child will be spared be oath of king uffa be well king uffa edmund shouted back to take rash oath before talk of slaying have got to capture will need aid of false god before take fort a to mercy must a soon ask of wolf have god good sword to protect fear not host be three time a strong a be saxon raised great shout danish king rode back to troop lesson have be given of enterprise of saxon be not lost for dane at once began to form camp raising earthen bank crowned with stake bush a defence against sudden attack work occupied two day during time blow be struck on side a dane posted strong body of men night to prevent saxon from sallying out on third day work be finished danish king with jarls made circuit round wall evidently to select place for attack time have passed quietly in fort in one corner priest have erected altar here mass be said three time day priest went among soldier exhorting to resist to last confessing giving absolution pain dane have taken in preparation of camp be proof of determination to capture fort however long operation might be showed too that recognized difficulty of task for have believed that capture must be easily effected must at once upon arrival have advanced to attack to morrow morning early egbert said expect that will assault in first place probably will endeavour to carry fort by general attack if fail in will set to construct engine with to batter wall at following morning dane issued from camp having formed up in regular order advanced towards castle divided into four band three of wheeled round to opposite side of fort fourth be a large a other three together advanced towards entrance saxon took post previously assigned to on wall edmund strengthened force on side where gate be by posting there in addition whole of band altogether there be nearly fighting men within wall of whom greater part have fought against dane in battle of previous year attack commenced simultaneously on side by discharge of arrow by archer of party saxon sheltered behind parapet on wall suffered slightly missile did considerable execution among mass of dane however did not pause to continue conflict at distance uttering battle cry rushed forward edmund egbert have little fear of attack on other face of fort proving successful chief assault be against gate be here that real danger existed main body of dane covered with shield rushed forward with greatest determination pouring through gap in outer bank in solid mass then turned along fosse towards inner gate closely packed together with shield above head forming sort of testudo roof protected against saxon arrow pressed forward in spite of shower of missile with saxon on wall assailed arrow dart great stone be showered down upon latter breaking down shield affording archer opportunity of pouring in arrow number fell column swept along until gained gate here in front began attack upon massive beam with ax when have somewhat weakened battered with heavy beam of timber until be completely splintered while be going on saxon have continued to shoot without intermission danish dead be heaped thickly around gate danish archer assisted by comrade have scrambled up on to outer bank kept up heavy fire on defender of wall saxon sheltered head shoulder be above parapet with shield between a through loophole archer shot at dane edmund egbert have debated much on previous day whether must pile stone behind gate have finally agreed not to do so argued that although for time stone must impede progress of dane must if shattered door sooner later pull down stone climb over be better to have smooth level place for defence inside have however raised bank of earth ten foot high in semicircle at distance of twenty yard within gate when be seen that gate be yielding edmund have called down own band from wall formed in half circle ten yard from gate be four deep a in usual formation with four line of spear projecting towards gate mound behind lined with archer at last gate fell with exulting shout dane poured in a did so archer on mound loosed arrow head of danish column melted like snow before blast of furnace still poured in flung upon spearmen strove in vain to pierce hedge of steel desperately threw upon pike head died there bravely be powerless to break passage archer on mound still shot fast among while on wall turning round smote in back where unprotected by shield offered sure fatal mark soon narrow semicircle inside gate became heaped high with dead impeding effort of still pressing in several of bravest of danish leader have fallen crowd in fosse unaware of obstacle prevented advance of head of column harassed by missile from above grew impatient after hour of desperate effort having lost upwards of three hundred of best men danish king furious with rage disappointment called off men on other three side attack equally failed dane suffered heavily while climbing steep side of inner mound brought with faggot cast down at foot of wall be built so near edge of slope that be unable to pile sufficient faggot to give height required for successful assault upon many climbed up on comrade shoulder so tried to scale wall be thrust down by saxon spear a raised to level in place succeeded in gaining footing over two hundred fell in three minor attack there be great rejoicing among saxon on whose side twenty three have be killed solemn mass be held at save few look out on wall attended thanks returned to god for repulse of pagan then garrison full of confidence awaited next attack of enemy stone be piled up in gateway to prevent sudden surprise being effected there dane in retreat have carried off dead next morning saxon saw that be busy with ceremony of burial at little distance from camp dead be placed in sitting position in long row back to back with weapon by side earth be piled over until great mound fifty yard long ten foot high be raised three jarls one of king be buried separately be placed together in sitting position with helmet on head shield on arm sword by side four war horse be killed laid beside twenty slave be slaughtered placed lying round for spirit to attend in walhalla of god golden drinking vessel other ornament be placed by then mound forty foot in diameter twenty foot high be piled over whole whole force be occupied day with work next day number of tree be felled brought to camp for next two day dane be occupied in manufacture of war engine for battering down wall edmund egbert utilized time in instructing soldier who did not form part of regular band in formation of quadruple line of defence dane have found so impossible to break through so that if more than one breach be effected resistance similar to made at gate must be offered at point skin of ox killed for use of garrison be carefully laid aside inside being thickly rubbed with grease danish preparation be at length completed war engine be brought up began to hurl great stone against wall at three point saxon kept up constant fire of arrow at employed at working dane though losing many men threw up breastwork to protect saxon manufactured many broad ladder in middle of night lowering over wall descended noiselessly three strong body fell upon dane guarding engine fought stoutly be driven back engine be destroyed saxon retired to wall again drew up ladder before main body of dane must arrive from camp caused delay of day in siege fresh engine having be constructed assault on wall be recommenced time whole danish army moving out sleeping at night close to after three day battering breach of from thirty to fifty foot wide be effected in wall saxon have not be idle behind of threatened point raised bank of earth ten foot high cut away bank perpendicularly behind shattered wall so that assailant a poured in at gap must have to leap ten foot down night mass of wall fell inside be cleared away when breach be complete be evident that assault must take place next morning hide have be prepared be laid with hairy side down on ground below through drove firmly into ground number of pike with head sticking up one two foot pointed stake hardened in fire then satisfied that have be done saxon lay down to rest in morning dane advanced to assault time be little annoyed in advance by archer be posted on wall at side of gap to shoot down at back of dane after have entered on inner semicircular mound saxon force gathered four deep with loud shout dane rushed forward climbed outer mound reached breach here leader paused on seeing gulf below pressed by behind must not hesitate long leapt down from breach on to slippery hide below not one who did so lived be impossible to keep foot a alighted a fell be impaled by pike stake pressed by behind however fresh men leapt down falling in turn until at length hide stake be covered leaping down found foothold on body of fallen then crowded on strove to climb inner bank attack saxon now archer on wall opened fire upon pierced through through with arrow struck on back dane fell in great number edmund commanded at one of breach egbert at old experienced warrior at third at point scene be similar dane struggled up mound only to fail to break through hedge of spear crowned fast number dying in attempt while a many more fell pierced with arrow for hour dane continued desperate effort not until fifteen hundred have be slain did draw off to camp finding impossible to break through saxon defence loud rose shout of triumphant saxon a dane retired needed effort of leader to prevent from pouring out in pursuit event of preceding year have taught saxon leader how often impetuosity after success have proved fatal to saxon once in plain dane must turn upon crush by still greatly superior number therefore one be allowed to sally out discomfited dane retired unmolested next morning to joy saxon saw that invader have broken up camp have marched away in night scout be sent out in various direction saxon employed in stripping burying dane who have fallen within fort only few of most distinguished having be carried off scout returned with news that dane have made halt have departed entirely from that part of country finding that for present be free of invader saxon left fort scattered again to rebuild a best might devastated home if in neighbourhood of sherborne dane have be severely repulsed in other part of kingdom continued to make great progress feeling of despair among saxon increased great number left home taking with portable possession made way to sea coast there embarked for france where hoped to be able to live peaceably quietly edmund placed hindrance in way of such of people who chose course for prospect appeared well nigh hopeless majority of saxon be utterly broken in spirit complete conquest of kingdom by dane seemed inevitable in spring however of king alfred again issued urgent summons great horde of dane have landed at exeter taken possession of town determined to endeavour to crush sent to edmund begging to proceed at once to poole where king fleet be ready for sea to embark in with what force must raise to sail blockade entrance to river exe so prevent dane from reinforcing countryman while with force laid siege to exeter edmund must have taken own vessel time must have be lost king ship be short of hand be not sorry indeed that men must have practise at sea taking own band in vacancy have be caused in defence of fort have be filled up proceeded to poole here embarked men in one of ship fleet comprising twenty vessel put to sea management of vessel sail be in hand of experienced sailor edmund men have duty to perform except to fight enemy when met news of siege of exeter reached dane at wareham be head quarter vessel filled with troop sailed for relief of exeter weather be unpropitious heavy fog lay on water dissipated occasionally by fierce outburst of wind saxon fleet kept sea be well that for time danish fleet did not appear in sight for saxon save sailor be unaccustomed to water many suffered greatly from rough motion have dane appeared for first week after fleet put to sea combat must have be avoided a troop be in condition to fight presently however recovered from malady became eager to meet enemy edmund bade men take part in working of ship in order to accustom to duty of seaman fleet did not keep sea time returning often to strait between isle of wight mainland where lay in shelter look out being kept from top of hill whence wide sweep of sea must be seen where pile of wood be collected by signal fire must warn fleet to put to sea must enemy vessel come in sight full month passed saxon began to fear that dane might have eluded having perhaps be blown out to sea having made land again far to west one morning however smoke be seen to rise from beacon fire crew who be on shore instantly hurried on board from hill danish fleet be made out far to west be seen to be approaching land from seaward having be driven far out of course by wind weather be wild threatening sailor predicted great storm nevertheless fleet put to sea with reefed sail ran to west vessel be larger than danish galley must better keep sea in storm many mile be passed before from deck danish flotilla must be seen presently however great number of galley be discerned rowing in towards swanage bay in spite of increasing fury of wind saxon spread more sail succeeded in intercepting dane desperate fight began dane in low long vessel have must do to keep afloat on wave many be run down by saxon shower of arrow from lofty poop confused rower slew many sweeping along close to often broke off oar disabled sometimes two three of danish galley must try to close with saxon ship sea be too rough for boat to remain alongside while men tried to climb up high side saxon with spear thrust down who strove to do so confusion terror soon reigned among dane fearing to try to escape by sea in such storm made for shore hotly pursued by saxon shore be even more inhospitable than foe great rock bordered coast upon galley be dashed into fragment people on shore who have gathered at sight of approaching fleet fell upon such of dane a succeeded in gaining coast everyone who landed be instantly slain thus partly from effect of saxon fleet still more from of storm whole of danish fleet of one hundred twenty vessel be destroyed not single ship escaping general destruction chapter vii dragon dane at exeter being now cut off from hope of relief asked for term king granted life on condition of promising to leave wessex not to return promise swore by most solemn oath to observe marching northward passed out of wessex settled near gloucester of saxon thought that king have be wrong in granting such easy term pointed out to ealdormen who remonstrated with that there be many other larger band of dane in mercia anglia have massacred band at exeter must not have done without loss of many men a assuredly dane must have fought desperately for life news of slaughter must have brought upon fresh invasion from side by time resistance to dane in mercia have ceased again again king burhred have bought off only brought fresh horde down upon at last finding struggle hopeless have gone a pilgrim to rome where have died dane acted in mercia a have done in northumbria did not care to settle down for length of time therefore appointed weak saxon thane ceolwulf a king of mercia ruled cruelly extorted large revenue from land owner robbed monastery have escaped destruction of treasure dane suffered to pursue course until have amassed great wealth when swooped down upon robbed of possessed took away nominal kingship have held a there be now little fresh scope for plundering in england many of dane in anglia mercia settled down in city on land have taken from saxon dane who have gone from exeter be now joined by band have landed in south wale latter finding small plunder be to be obtained among mountain of country moved to gloucester joining band there proposed fresh invasion of wessex dane in spite of oath have sworn to alfred hostage have left in hand agreed to proposal early in spring of band swollen by reinforcement from mercia marched into wiltshire captured royal castle of chippenham on avon from point spread over country destroyed everything with fire sword general panic seized inhabitant better class with bishop priest monk made for sea coast thence crossed to france taking with portable good with relic precious stone ornament of church monastery party of dane in twenty three ship have landed in devonshire here ealdorman adda have constructed castle similar to edmund have built be fortified by nature on three side have strong rampart of earth on dane tried to starve out defender of fort saxon held out for long time although sorely pressed by want of water at last sallied out one morning at daybreak fell upon dane utterly defeated only few straggler regaining ship thousand dane be said to have be slain at kynwith be isolated success in other part of kingdom panic appeared to have taken possession of west saxon who must not leave country retired to wood thence when dane have passed by leaving ruin desolation behind sallied out again began to till ground a best must thus for time west saxon formerly so valiant determined sank to condition of serf for when resistance ceased dane be well pleased to see ground tilled a otherwise must speedily have run short of store at commencement of invasion edmund have marched out with band have inflicted heavy blow upon party of plunderer soon perceived that struggle be hopeless therefore returned to sherborne collecting such good a required good store of provision marched to place where ship have be hidden wandering band of dane have passed that way bush with have be covered be undisturbed be soon removed passage three foot deep wide enough for ship to pas through be dug from deep hole in be lying to river when last barrier be cut water poured in saxon have satisfaction of seeing vessel rise gradually until water in dock be level with in river then be taken out into stream store fitting placed aboard be poled down to mouth of river egbert have gone before have already engaged fifteen sturdy sailor to go with dane have not yet reached sea coast from interior there be therefore difficulty in obtaining various equipment necessary in week mast be up sail in position dragon a be called excited great admiration at port saying that be finest largest ship have ever be seen there while fitting out have be going on be hove up on shore received several coat of paint edmund be loath to start on voyage without again seeing king one knew where alfred now be on finding struggle hopeless having retired to fastness of somerset to await time when saxon must be driven by oppression again to take up arm at last be ready dragon put out to sea be provided with oar a well a sail be only to be used when in pursuit when flying from superior enemy a soon a have be long enough at sea to enable band again to recover from effect of sickness oar be got out men practised in use a in model from have be built rowed two bank of oar one worked by men upon deck others through small port hole latter must only be used when weather be fine when sea be high be closed up fastened lower deck oar be rowed by one man while upper bank be longer heavier have two men to work before starting edmund have increased strength of band to ninety men that number being required for oar of dragon have fifteen on bank on side at first there be terrible splashing confusion in time men learned to row in order in three week after putting to sea oar worked well in time together dragon with ninety rower moved through water at great rate of speed during time have never be far from land keeping short distance from port from have sailed a edmund did not wish to fall in with dane until crew be able to maneuver with best effect when at last satisfied that knew duty returned to port took in fresh supply of provision then sailed away again in search of enemy coasted along shore of hampshire sussex without seeing foe then sailing round kent entered mouth of thames dragon kept on way until reached point where river begin to narrow there sail be furled anchor thrown overboard to wait for danish galley coming down river on third day after have anchored perceived four black speck in distance sailor soon declared to be danish craft be rowing rapidly having ten oar on side at mast head floated danish raven anchor be got up a dane approached golden dragon standard of wessex be run up to mast head sail be hoisted oar got out vessel advanced to meet approaching dane for moment stopped rowing in astonishment at seeing so large ship bearing saxon flag then at once began to scatter in different direction dragon impelled by wind sixty oar rapidly overtook when close alongside galley nearest to men on upper deck at order from edmund ran in oar seizing bow poured volley of arrow into galley killing most of rower then dragon be steered alongside saxon sword in hand leaped down into galley most of dane be cut down at once rest plunged into water swam for life leaving deserted galley behind dragon continued pursuit of others overtook captured a easily a have done first other two boat reached shore before be overtaken on board leaping out fled saxon took possession of deserted galley found a expected stored full of plunder of kind rich wearing apparel drinking goblet massive vessel of gold silver have be torn from desecrated altar rich ornament jewel other article be at once removed to dragon fire be applied to boat be soon mass of flame then dragon directed course to two galley have first captured be also rifled of content burned saxon be delighted at success have attended first adventure will have rougher work next time egbert said dane who escaped will carry news to london will be having whole fleet down to attack in few day if be in anything like reasonable number will fight if not can run have seen to day how much faster be than danish boat though will be in favour of fighting if have fair chance of success must be folly to risk success of enterprise by contending against overwhelming number at outset seeing that will be able to pick up so many prize round coast can beat score of egbert grumbled be in favour of fighting dane whenever see when there be hope of success egbert yes know even finest bull can be pulled down by pack of dog dragon be splendid ship doe credit alike to king alfred first advice to plan of italian shipbuilder to workmanship design of shipwright of exeter hope will long remain to be scourge to dane at sea a have be scourge to saxon on shore be because hope be going to do such good service to england must be careful of must remember too that many of danish galley be far larger than have to do with to day be not going to gobble up a pike swallow minnow dragon have now anchored again four day elapsed before danish galley be seen at end of time six large danish war ship be perceived in distance edmund egbert from top of lofty poop watched coming row thirty oar side egbert said be crowded with men what say edmund will stop fight will dragon spread wing have advantage of height edmund said from bow stern castle can shoot down into if lie alongside board number will give immense advantage must think that might run down one two of dragon be much more strongly built than galley of dane if when close round have oar lashed on side a when be rowing will be next to impossible for to get alongside except at stern bow be far too high for to climb very well egbert said if be ready to fight may be sure be anchor be got up oar manned dragon quietly advanced towards danish boat men be instructed to row slowly be not until within hundred yard of leading galley that order be given to row men strained at tough oar dragon leapt ahead to meet foe bow be pointed a if must have passed close by side of danish galley be crowded with men when close to however helmsman pushed tiller across dragon swept straight down upon shout of dismay rose from dane hasty volley of arrow dart be hurled at dragon helmsman strove to avoid collision in vain dragon struck on beam frail craft broke up like egg shell under blow sank almost instantly under bow of dragon without heeding men struggling thickly in water dragon continued course warned by fate of first boat next endeavoured to avoid path commander shouted order rower on one side backed while on other pulled be not quite quick enough dragon struck few foot from stern cutting in two other galley now closed in alongside saxon hastily fastened oar a have be rowing then betook to post with spear sword to side to prevent enemy from climbing up archer to lofty castle at end dane have greatest difficulty in getting alongside oar keeping galley at distance for time combat be conducted entirely by archer on side dane suffering much most heavily a saxon be protected by bulwark while from lofty position be enabled to fire down into galley at last one of danish vessel rowed straight at broadside of dragon breaking way through oar bow reached side then dane strove to leap on board saxon pursued tactic have succeeded so well on land forming in close mass where danish vessel touched dragon opposed thick hedge of spear to who strove to board dane fought desperately several notable leader hearing that great saxon ship have appeared on thames have come down to capture leading follower strove desperately to cut way to deck of dragon taking advantage of strife other galley repeated maneuver have succeeded in turn ran stem through saxon oar reached side of dragon in position however have immense disadvantage that only few men at once must strive to board while saxon be able to oppose strength at four point for time saxon repulsed effort a lashing of oar gave way under pressure of danish ship drifted alongside be thus able to attack along whole length of bulwark between castle saxon be now hard put to superior height still enabled to keep dane in check time five vessel have be drifting down river together presently when conflict be chief of sailor made way to edmund if get up sail may be able to draw out from galley do so edmund said at once for be hardly pressed be four to one against sailor at once sprang to halliard soon great sail rose on mast almost instantly dragon began to glide away from galley dane with rope endeavoured to lash to side be severed a fast a thrown in two three minute dragon have drawn clear of dane betook to oar many of have be broken between vessel rowing utmost must only just keep up with dragon for wind be blowing freely fully oar of dragon be broken rest be soon manned then rapidly drew away from pursuer be not going to run further edmund said now that have once shaken off let turn meet again a vessel head be brought up into wind dane ceased rowing fate have befallen two galley at commencement of fight be still before have lost great number of men in attempt to board from saxon pike arrow desire to renew fight vanished when saw that saxon be equally ready therefore a dragon approached sheered off on side of rowed for mouth of medway saxon did not pursue have lost eight men killed seventeen wounded by danish arrow be well content to be quit of opponent upon whom have inflicted severe blow a of galley sunk have contained fully hundred fifty men great number of dane on board other ship have fallen now left thames sailed to sandwich town have be shortly before burned by dane have left of inhabitant have returned here dragon waited for week by end of time trace of conflict have be obliterated new oar made edmund found difficulty in filling up vacancy caused in fight a many of young saxon be burning to avenge suffering dane have inflicted must have obtained several time number required have there be room for be therefore enabled to pick out sturdy fellow accustomed to sea when dragon again set sail head be laid to northward a edmund intended to cruise off east anglia from whose shore fleet be constantly crossing recrossing to denmark picked up several prize at mouth of eastern river scarcely having to strike blow so surprised be dane at appearance of great saxon galley whenever dane surrendered without resistance edmund gave quarter landed in small boat on shore ship after being emptied of booty contained be burned when off yarmouth where have captured four danish vessel sailing out unsuspicious of danger wind veered round to north east began to blow very strongly long line of sandbank off coast broke somewhat violence of sea dragon rode night to anchor in morning wind continued to rise sea became more more violent anchor began to drag edmund egbert after consultation agreed that only chance of saving vessel be to enter river tide be running in sea be so heavy on bar of river that effort of crew at oar barely sufficed to keep on course at length however made way safely between post marked entrance rowing up until passed turn be sheltered from force of gale again anchored oar be lashed out firmly to keep boat from approaching side bale of good with hold be filled be brought on deck piled high along bulwark so a to afford shelter from missile even a entered harbour number of dane have assembled at point for capture destruction of ship have of course be seen crew set ashore have spread news that strange vessel be saxon norfolk bank being somewhat higher than suffolk boat be anchored rather nearer to latter a be from town of yarmouth that attack be anticipated a soon a anchor be let go dane began to fire arrow so powerful be gale that greater part of be swept far away a day went on number of dane on bank increased largely vast number of arrow be discharged at dragon crew kept under shelter although be often struck damage be done in afternoon fleet of galley be seen coming down river dane possessed large number of boat at yarmouth in navigated inland water far into interior wind have shifted until be blowing nearly due east edmund egbert have agreed upon best course to be pursued in case of attack must hardly hope finally to beat off assault of large fleet of galley must besides be exposed to attack by boat laden with combustible therefore a soon a galley be seen approaching oar be unlashed great sail hoisted at best speed dragon advanced up river to meet foe dane gave shout of alarm a vessel advanced to meet with water surging in white wave from bow greater part of hurried towards one bank other to escape shock slower in movement stouter in heart awaited attack while from storm of missile be poured upon advancing boat heedless of continued way sharp bow crashed right through side of danish boat having destroyed seven of on way passed through flotilla continued course dragon waved triumphantly from mast a passed under wall of yarmouth be crowded with dane who vainly showered arrow javelin a flew past with fleet of galley rowing in wake few minute be out on broad sheet of water beyond danish galley paused at entrance in so wild storm must have have difficulty in keeping boat straight while great galley with sail oar must be able to maneuver freely must strike run down one by one be that pile of building on rising knoll of ground three mile away edmund asked be bamborough castle egbert replied roman stronghold of immense strength let run up thither edmund said if a be likely enough be unoccupied will land there take possession be wall complete assuredly be egbert said be of marvellous strength such a can not build in day run in great semicircle from edge of water round crest of knoll down again to water there be one gateway in wall on land side can block up need not fear attack from land for between river castle there be wide swamp so unless row up attack from water be safe think that will not do edmund said after taste dragon have given of quality at rate think be safe till storm abates by time running rapidly before wind dragon be approaching great roman fort whose massive wall struck edmund with astonishment one be to be seen moving about in space inclosed by sail be lowered vessel brought to bank anchor be taken ashore be soon solidly moored then crew leapt on to land ascended bank to great level inclosure wall be a egbert have said intact indeed except on side facing river remained almost unbroken to present day hour labour sufficed to block gateway where pair of massive door be in position for place have be defended by saxon against dane at first landing on coast few men be placed a sentry on wall feeling now perfectly safe from attack on land side edmund follower returned on board dragon for night chapter viii cruise of dragon night passed without alarm gale continued to blow with fury until abated edmund have little fear that dane must venture upon attack have indeed reason for haste saxon vessel be in water must not return so long a storm continued to blow from east next day party of dane be seen making way across swampy country from direction of yarmouth a soon however a approached near enough to see saxon in readiness on wall of castle retired at once knowing that place must be captured by nothing short of prolonged desperate siege on fourth day storm abated saxon prepared to make way seaward again wind still blew lightly from same quarter sail must therefore be of use with great oar power be confident that once through danish flotilla must defy pursuit accordingly again embarked loosing mooring rowed down towards yarmouth have chosen time when tide be running in for although must hinder progress must equally impede pursuer while must enable to check vessel in time did find unforeseen obstacle in way entered river rowed along quietly until neared wall of town here river be at narrowest saw danish galley gathered thickly in stream edmund egbert be on forecastle presently gave signal for men to cease rowing be just a expected egbert said have formed boom across river of trunk of tree beam lashed together can not make way down until obstacle be removed what say edmund agree with edmund replied have best keep along close to right bank until within short distance of boom then must land greater part of men must march along bank in phalanx others must keep boat moving close alongside from forecastle will be able to fire down upon dane aid on shore to drive back make way to end of boom have to cut lashing there whole will swing round now see nature of obstacle what be to be done be best to wait until tide turn in first place fewer men will be needed on board ship a will advance by abreast of men on shore in second place when lashing be cut boom will then swing down stream will cause confusion among boat behind will open clear space for to make way down edmund agreed light anchor be dropped dragon rode quietly in stream great animation be evident among dane large number crossed river strong force gathered at end of boom in boat close behind to prevent saxon from attempting to cut lashing there be little uneasiness on board dragon saxon be confident now of power of close formation to force way through number of enemy must gain such assistance from fire from lofty forecastle that doubted not that must be able to drive back dane destroy boom in hour tide no longer rose waited till ran down with full force then anchor be hauled up dragon rowed to bank sixty of fighting men headed by egbert leapt on shore edmund with remainder took place on forecastle oar next to bank be drawn in of on outward side manned by sailor then in usual order phalanx moved slowly forward while ship floated along beside close to bank dane with loud shout advanced to meet arrow soon began to fly thickly covered by long shield of front rank saxon moved forward steadily while a dane approached archer on forecastle opened destructive fire upon confidence of saxon be justified for combat be never in doubt although northman fought bravely be unable to withstand steady advance of wedge of spear very many fell beneath rain of arrow from above steadily wedge made way until reached end of boom few blow with ax sufficed to cut cable fastened in place a soon a be done edmund gave shout saxon at once sprang on board ship before dane must follow be steered out into stream a egbert have foreseen boom a swung round swept before number of danish boat imprisoned between shore oar be soon run out while men on forecastle continued fire at danish boat others seizing oar swept dragon along stream dane strove desperately to arrest progress tried to run alongside board others dashed in among oar impeded work of rower while from wall of town shower of missile be poured down upon tide be gaining moment in strength partly drifting partly rowing dragon like bull attacked by pack of dog made way down river effort of dane to board be defeated many of boat sunk at last made way into open sea there sail be hoisted soon left pursuer behind once at sea course be again turned north picking up prize on way took up station off mouth of humber several ship be captured a sailed out from river after spoil on board be taken out instead of being burnt a have always be case before be allowed to proceed on way since have be destroyed crew must either have be slain landed first course be repugnant to edmund second must not be adopted because must have carried news to dane that dragon be off river more ship must have put to sea indeed so large be number of danish vessel always up humber that fleet must easily have be equipped sent out before dragon must have taken flight one day large sailing ship be seen coming out dragon remained with lowered sail until have passed then started in pursuit speedily came up with danish vessel edmund summoned to surrender be answered by norseman of great stature noble appearance who from poop hurled javelin must have pierced edmund have not leapt quickly aside few other dart be thrown then dragon ran alongside enemy boarded opposition of northman be speedily beaten down leader desperately defended ladder leading to poop be struck by two arrow fell on one knee edmund be about to climb ladder when door of cabin in poop opened norse maiden sixteen year old sprang out seeing father wounded at top of ladder saxon preparing to ascend while others turned bow against wounded northman sprang forward throwing upon knee before edmund besought to spare father life edmund raised hand bow be lowered have wish to slay father maiden said gently slay only who resist resistance on part of single man wounded against whole ship crew be madness be sea wolf who slay for pleasure of slaying be saxon who fight for country against oppression rapine of people little right have to mercy seeing show none religion enjoins to have pity even upon enemy have best ascend to father see to wound none will harm girl with exclamation of thanks sprang up ladder edmund superintended searching of ship contained great store of valuable be speedily transferred to dragon when have be done edmund ascended to poop jarl be sitting in great chair placed there edmund have already learnt from crew that be jarl siegbert noted leader of northman daughter have drawn out arrow bandaged wound jarl siegbert edmund said a approached have be bitter enemy of saxon small mercy have shown to who have fallen into hand learn now that christian saxon take vengeance on defenceless foe be free to pursue voyage with daughter ship to norway store have made free with seeing that be plunder taken from saxon do reclaim own who be young sir jarl asked be one of king alfred ealdormen of wessex edmund by name have heard of dane said a one who have taught saxon new tactic fighting in close body have more than once pierced line caused overthrow be mere lad be young edmund replied have not be for invasion oppression of countryman might have still accounted a scarce man have made warrior of west saxon capable of bearing sword remember jarl that life have be in saxon hand that have spared so come not hither to shore again purpose not doing so northman replied have seen enough of stricken field be returning to own country to hang up sword content with fame have gained until woden called to join warrior feast in hall since may not meet there young saxon for say that christian look to place where arm will be laid aside sound of feasting be unheard will say farewell for thank not for life for must rather have died a have lived with sword in hand for daughter sake thank for be young to be left unprotected in world few minute later danish vessel continued on way dragon again took station on look out be now deep in water after picking up one two more small prize edmund egbert determined to return home be probable that dane must soon take alarm despatch fleet to attack laden down a dragon be speed under oar be materially affected be advisable to stow away booty before proceeding with further adventure head be turned south coasted down eastern shore of england without adventure several danish vessel be seen arriving at quitting coast dragon continued course without heeding rounding foreland sailed along south coast made way up parrot upon inquiry learnt that event of importance have taken place during absence dane be complete master of country king alfred be in hiding none knew where greater portion of dane be at camp at chippenham party roamed here there through land dressed a countryman edmund egbert made way to exeter there arranged with trader for purchase of le valuable portion of dragon cargo consisted of rich clothing silk other stuff wine vestment altar hanging from church arm armour hide skin price obtained be far below real value of article for money be scarce none must say when dane might again swoop down clear out content of warehouse nevertheless sum obtained be large one for day did not include value of gold silver goblet salver vas utensil used in celebration of religious service of spoiled from house of wealthy church monastery have obtained considerable number be buried in wood near lonely spot at dragon be moored rest of cargo be sent in wagon more valuable portion hidden under hide skin to exeter amount have be obtained from cargo be divided a agreed before starting twenty five share be set apart for king twenty five share be divided between two leader soldier sailor have one share be well satisfied with success of adventure with damage have inflicted upon dane fortnight leave be given for men to visit home money have gained in trip be of great use to friend in enabling to repair damage effected by dane not man be absent at appointed time dragon again made way down to sea be midwinter now cruised along southern coast of england without perceiving single hostile sail lay for week off mouth of thames then saw four large danish vessel making way down river be vessel of largest size strongly built full of men saxon judged to be too strong to be attacked in company northman on seeing golden dragon flying at mast head of saxon ship at once made towards keeping in close body dragon with sail oar easily left behind dane giving up pursuit continued on way dragon fell into wake followed at distance hoping that one might prove slower than others that might in night get separated at however dane lit cressets of tar hemp enabled not only to keep close together sent out wide circle of light so that must perceive dragon must venture to approach for two day night dragon followed patiently weather be about to change egbert said on third morning methinks that there be storm brewing if be so northman may well get separated may pick up one away from fellow darker darker grew sky wind soon blew in furious gust raising sea so heavy that saxon be obliged to lay in oar by nightfall be blowing furious gale in gathering darkness flying scud ship of dane be lost sight of be of little consequence now for attention of saxon be directed to own safety for next three day position be one of greatest danger with only rag of sail set ran before gale from south west wave a overtook threatened destruction of ship dragon light buoyant ably handled rode safely over wave on fourth morning wind be still blowing fiercely although force have in degree moderated a daylight dawned edmund egbert who have hardly left poop since storm began looked anxiously ahead surely edmund see dark mass ahead egbert exclaimed for minute two edmund gazed silently ahead be so egbert said be rocky coast do not see white fringe below where wave strike against a light became clearer imminence of peril grew more distinct lofty iron bound coast rose in front of extended a far a eye must reach on hand sea broke with terrible force against base sending spray far up on cliff must bring about edmund asked chief of sailor must be useless man said must not make way in teeth of gale see edmund said at present be rushing on to destruction if bring to wind may run distance along coast before be driven ashore may perceive spot towards may direct with chance of making land ere go to piece sail be still further lessened ship head brought round parallel with coast dragon laboured tremendously a sea struck full on beam wave flooded low waist sea struck lifted bodily to leeward for foot sailed forward be driven one towards coast be now three mile distant hour must ensure destruction for none there hoped that anchor even must find bottom must hold for instant in teeth of gale eye be directed towards shore break must be seen in wall of rock rose almost perpendicularly from water fear be hopeless edmund said to egbert strongest swimmer must be dashed to piece in instant against rock must indeed egbert replied wish now that have boldly engaged four danish ship far better must have be for to have died fighting for england on deck than to have perished here time passed slowly minute dragon be swept nearer nearer towards rock will just make headland master sailor said be once round have best turn head to rock if cliff rise a here sheer from water moment strike will be last for of if rock be a in place piled high at foot of cliff few may possibly manage to leap from forecastle a strike to clamber up scarce word be spoken on board dragon a came abreast of headland be few hundred yard away roar of sea a struck base sounded high above din of storm great sheet of foam be thrown up to vast height turmoil of water from reflux of wave be so great that dragon be tossed upon like cock boat man have to grasp at shroud bulwark to retain footing suddenly cheer burst from end to end of ship beyond headland great gap be visible quarter of mile wide a if cliff have be rent in sunder by tremendous convulsion fiord be seen stretching away in bosom of hill a far a eye must reach dragon head be turned soon be flying before wind up inlet mile farther fiord widened to lake two mile across between steep hill clothed from foot to summit with tree course be winding be soon sheltered from gale be gliding quietly over comparatively tranquil water ten mile up anchor be let go in sheltered inlet edmund summoned whole crew to return thanks to god for marvellous escape dragon have suffered severely in conflict with element large sail have be split blown away bulwark at waist have be shattered considerable damage done to gear fitting four twenty hour be allowed to men for rest after labour then hand be set to work to refit next morning edmund said to kinsman will take two of men go ashore to hunt there must be wild boar deer in forest must be glad of fresh meat be careful edmund remember be in country of enemy for without doubt land to have be blown be norway although can see sign of habitation there may well be village somewhere among hill will be careful edmund said laughing if return in two day do set sail without must like to discover abode of northern jarl must indeed be grand retaliation to give taste of suffering have inflicted upon must be good work egbert said nevertheless own that at present be anxious to be at sea again two day will be sufficient to refit edmund said then will spread wing good bye egbert will be back by sunset hope with deer two selecting couple of follower skilled with bow being armed with spear edmund leapt ashore for water be deep up to rock dragon have be moored alongside for convenience of taking on board wood for repair although on board dragon guessed not many eye be watching small fishing village lay at edge of fiord mile two beyond inlet in ship be moored hidden a be among tree hut have not be noticed by saxon strange ship have be seen by of in village fisherman at once pronounced that whencesoever might have come be assuredly northman ship messenger have immediately be sent to village among hill be widely scattered be not until day after ship arrival that force be collected be deemed sufficient to attack already a edmund leapt ashore norseman be making way quietly through forest towards dragon edmund have advanced few hundred yard up hillside when large party of norseman suddenly sprang upon two saxon arrow flew true to mark then dane rushed upon so far word have be spoken edmund placed to lip whistle with gave order on board ship blew long shrill note then shouted at top of voice dane dane push off instant afterwards be attacked men fought bravely in few second latter be cut down edmund be levelled to ground by tremendous blow from club minute later din of battle rose by water side edmund whistle shout have be heard saxon on shore sprang on board seized spear bow just a dane poured down through tree for time saxon defended ship against desperate attempt of dane to gain footing on seeing number of assailant being certain that edmund be killed captured egbert ordered rope to be cut dragon be thrust away from rock oar be then got out rowed out of bow shot from shore then egbert held consultation with leading men among saxon on board be filled with grief at loss of young leader felt that nothing must be done for must be courting danger to remain longer in fiord since so large force have be collected in forest news might have be sent to port at moment might see fleet of northman galley barring retreat therefore with bitter grief lamentation dragon sail be hoisted made way to sea only consolation be egbert said that if brave lad be not killed at once may yet find way back to england be ready of wit full of invention that if can possibly extricate from strait be assuredly fear that fell in first onslaught brave lad even in moment of own peril thought first of have not be for timely warning must have be taken unawares many must have be killed even if dragon escaped capture storm have entirely abated water sparkled brightly in cold january sun a dragon sailed out between two headland into sea very different be feeling of crew to have animated when two day before have passed through channel then heart beat with joy thankfulness now deepest depression grief reigned on board edmund be adored by follower kindness a ealdorman skill bravery a leader cheerfulness brightness under danger peril have immensely endeared to heart man felt that have sustained irretrievable loss that with chief spirit have animated dragon directed enterprise be gone egbert be valiant warrior be admirable second to enterprising leader be altogether without initiative except when excited by danger be dull silent although esteemed honoured for strength bravery felt that must be poor substitute indeed for leader have lost chapter ix prisoner when edmund recovered sens found that be being carried along on rough litter through forest be little time before realized position recalled circumstance of attack after dragon have moved safely out into fiord assailant have returned to spot where have attacked three saxon who have landed two of be without life found that third who from habiliment be evidently of higher rank whom judged although still youth to be commander of saxon party have only be stunned by blow of club have felled be at once resolved to carry to jarl of district who must assuredly wish to learn from meaning of coming of strange ship that dragon be saxon vessel northman be sure many of have be on expedition across sea knew saxon from dress manner of wearing hair ship be unlike anything have seen before seemed above thing strange that when a understood england have be completely conquered saxon warship must be entering northern fiord for many hour edmund be carried through forest wondered to whether must be slain on arrival kept a slave for norse saxon tongue be so similar that be perfectly able to understand language of captor party of twelve men accompanied four of whom bore litter be relieved at interval by others after hour feeling of giddiness weakness passed off on men stopping to change bearer expressed readiness to walk hitherto have lain with eye closed a thought better to remain a be until felt perfectly able to keep up with captor in journey might for aught knew be long one northman expressed satisfaction at finding that burden need no longer be carried throwing aside bough have formed litter proceeded with on way asked many question concerning dragon most of answered readily enough evaded a to place where have be built port from have sailed be not until late in afternoon that arrived at abode of jarl bijorn be rough abode constructed of timber thatched with rush for a yet northman be scarcely settled people tribe for most part wandering in forest hunting when not engaged in warlike expedition loved above other thing only leader dwelt in anything like permanent abode rest raising hut of bough at such place a might make stay at one of edmund conductor have gone on ahead a party approached building bijorn came out from house to meet be like almost northman man of great stature immense strength fifty year have passed over head be still in prime of life for northman owing to life of constant activity development of muscle from childhood existence passed in open air retained strength vigour to great age so assiduous be training so rapidly did figure develop in consequence at age of fifteen young northman received arm be regarded a man although did not marry until many year afterwards early wedlock being strongly discouraged among by bijorn side stood son who though twenty two year old rivalled in stature in muscular development although lacking great width of shoulder of jarl a edmund approached war horse of jarl fastened up to post close to entrance of house neighed loudly bijorn looked surprised neighing of horse among northman be regarded a happiest of augury in sacred grove horse be tied up a neighing of animal be considered infallible proof that propitious answer must be given by god to prayer of petitioner who sought aid by thor bijorn exclaimed good war horse welcome stranger a said to anon sweyn have intended to offer a sacrifice to odin a god have thus declared welcome here must need change intention who be young saxon asked a edmund be brought before whence do come how be that war ship of people be found upon coast be edmund young man said steadily ealdorman of king alfred of west saxon ship be seen on coast be mine built to attack northman who harry coast be here because when in chase of four of ship storm arose blew speak boldly jarl said for one in hand of foe how old be be twenty two edmund replied same age a sweyn stand side by side let compare ay went on lack nigh three inch of height be more than bigger across shoulder stalwart young champion indeed doe brave credit to rearing west saxon have shown worthy foeman handled roughly last year a will testify pointed to scar of sword cut across face doubtless be son of saxon earl who more than once last summer inflicted heavy loss upon be that so young saxon be ealdorman edmund young man replied quietly success be won not by own strength courage by valour of under who fighting in novel manner gained advantage over northman by thor bijorn exclaimed be youth who attacked at night drove off cattle have taken slew many of follower sweyn truly must be rare sacrifice to offer to odin god have welcomed here may be that welcomed a sacrifice father sweyn suggested ah may be so jarl replied must consult omen to find out true meaning of charger neighing nevertheless in case will be content for if be not welcomed a sacrifice be welcome a bringing good fortune in truth will make noble cup bearer to be not jarl who be waited upon by saxon ealdorman till omen have spoken let be set aside carefully watched in day two will journey to odin temple there consult augury three day passed during edmund be well fed treated at end of time be ordered to accompany jarl on journey two day travelling brought to temple of odin be rough structure of unhewn stone situated in wood bijorn son entered while edmund remained without under guard presently jarl son came out with priest latter carried white bag in hand with twelve small piece of wood on half of four small nick be cut on others five nick be placed in bag be then shaken now priest said will see will of odin first three stick drawn out will declare if two of three bear even number of nick neigh of horse signifies odin accepted sacrifice if two of bear unequal number then meant that coming be propitious to bag be again shaken edmund looked on calmly for saxon northman alike disdained to show slightest fear of death even colour did not fade from cheek a watched trial upon life depended first stick drawn out bore five mark priest showed to jarl without word dropped in bag again be again shaken stick drawn out bore four notch chance be even silence be unbroken until third twig be drawn odin have spoken priest said neigh of horse indicated that coming of saxon be propitious to house jarl gave exclamation of satisfaction while sweyn brow darkened bijorn have indeed set heart upon retaining famous young saxon leader a slave cup bearer be probable that in interview with priest before drawing inclination have be clearly shown for slight difference between thickness of stick might well have existed served a index to priest in drawing bijorn in gratification at answer of god bestowed handsome present upon priest then rode back to abode well content with journey edmund be at once installed in new duty hitherto have not entered house seen female of family ulfra jarl wife be woman of commanding stature appearance like most of northern woman have accompanied husband in many wandering shared danger privation wife of norseman occupied far more exalted position in household of lord than did of people of southern europe be not only mistress of house be treated with respect a well a with affection be not a in south regarded a puppet for amusement of idle hour be companion adviser of husband occupying position at least a free respected a at present day there be two daughter who bade fair to resemble mother in stature dignity of demeanour for be model of female strength activity edmund duty be light in morning gathered firewood for household at meal handed dish taking station behind jarl chair refilled goblet with mead a often a be empty usually large party sat down to supper for expedition to france be talked of in spring jarls warrior often met to discus place of starting arrangement for voyage number leader must place in field feast be kept up to late hour a be invariable custom of northman arrangement decided upon overnight be rediscussed at morning meeting for held that while over wine cup man must speak truth frankly honestly colder counsel greater prudence morning brought be needed before matter must be finally settled month thus passed bijorn family follower then moved south a there be to be great conference near southern point of country at large number of chief from denmark be to be present edmund observed that for reason sweyn be looking forward anxiously to meeting sister more than once joked about anxiety pooh pooh jarl said one day in answer to observation sweyn be lad yet know what be driving at sweyn be smitten with charm of old companion daughter pretty freda noted when be in camp together will be fully ten year yet before sweyn can think of marrying have got to win for name of great warrior before jarl daughter of proper spirit must so much a think of when have spoil of france to lay at foot will be time enough sweyn made reply edmund saw that be far from pleased at father word look of surly determination on face showed young saxon that must go own way in matter if lay in power after ten day travelling party arrived at rendezvous here drawn up on shore be vast number of galley of size for greater part of who have assembled have journeyed by sea great number of hut of bough many tent constructed of sail have be erected edmund other slave being saxon frank captured in war soon erected bower for jarl family edmund have be looking forward to meeting with much anxiety for have judged that mode of escape might there open to among saxon slave be several young men of strength vigour edmund have confided to project of stealing boat sailing away in knowing that have experience in navigation have readily consented to join in making effort for freedom jarl family be warmly welcomed by many of companion in arm day after arrival bijorn told edmund to accompany to banquet at family be to be present at four in afternoon set out presently arrived at large tent edmund waited without until attendant carried in dish when entered with prepared to take place behind master seat from few word have passed between sweyn sister edmund doubted not that companion with whom bijorn be going to dine be father of maiden about whom have joked be not surprised when on entering saw sweyn talking earnestly with damsel somewhat apart from rest entrance of viand be signal for to take place at table there be in sixteen in number a nearly half be woman meeting be evidently of family character a upon occasion of importance when serious discussion be to take place men alone sat down a edmund advanced to take place eye fell upon jarl who seated at head of table a did so gave slight start of surprise for at once recognized in northman siegbert whose ship have stopped at mouth of humber from eye glanced at girl by whose side sweyn be on point of seating recognized in maiden who have besought father life dinner commenced proceeded for little time when edmund saw girl looking fixedly at who be that who be standing behind father chair asked sweyn saxon slave answered vessel be well nigh wrecked on coast people captured slew of follower ship speedily took to flight father girl said in clear voice at once attracted attention of unless eye deceive young saxon standing behind jarl bijorn be whose ship captured a left england who suffered harm to be done to northman turned in chair be freda surely enough though how come to be slave here to comrade bijorn know not bijorn friend owe youth deep debt of gratitude have life life honour of freda in hand spared slave though may be of yours at present yet hail a friend tell how came in hand be edmund valiant young saxon who smote more than once so heavily down in wessex know bijorn replied will tell how came into hand in truth be captured by accident not by valour of arm jarl then related circumstance under edmund have be captured narrow escape have have of being offered a sacrifice to odin siegbert then told guest at length incident of capture by dragon let go free without ransom concluded that part of obligation must be glad to repay though for gentleness to freda must still remain debtor what say bijorn will sell to name price in horse arm armour whatever be will pay to in truth siegbert bijorn said like not to part with lad since be so urgent seeing that can not otherwise discharge obligation under a say have laid can not refuse prayer a to price will arrange that anon then be settled siegbert said be free man ealdorman edmund held out hand to youth now seat at table with guest there be none here may feel honoured at dining with one of king alfred bravest thane transformation in edmund position be sudden indeed moment since be slave although have determined upon making effort for freedom have known that chance of escape be small a swift galley must have be sent off in pursuit be probable that must have be speedily overtaken brought back now be free must doubtless be allowed to return home with first party who sailed thither siegbert at once tried to make edmund feel at home addressing much of conversation to bijorn too spoke in friendly manner with sweyn be silent sullen be clearly ill pleased at change of fortune have turned father slave into fellow guest equal annoyance be greatly heightened by fact that be freda who have recognized young saxon pleasure face evinced when father proposed to purchase from bijorn angered still more in heart cursed horse whose welcoming neigh have in first instance saved edmund life trial by augury have confirmed first omen after banquet be over siegbert requested edmund to relate various adventure telling of tale of daring be one of favourite amusement of dane siegbert friend quaffed great bumper of mead lady sat apart listening while edmund told story have brave record indeed siegbert said when have finished for one so young fond a be youth of adventure there be not one of of age who have accomplished tithe of what have done why freda if youth be one of must have heart of norse maiden at foot in eye of danish girl a of dane valour be highest of recommendation know father freda said colouring at being thus addressed that must be a bold a although assuredly be right that maiden must esteem valour highly be to husband have to look for protection share in honour spoil gain by valiant deed so have always taught rightly too girl next to being great hero greatest honour be to be wife of one pledge ealdorman edmund must be right proud be son of mine have told story modestly for many of battle adventure of have spoken be known to by report fame have given larger share in success than claim for 't be pity be not born northman for there be little for to do in saxon england now despair yet edmund replied thing have gone badly with last blow be not struck yet will hear of king alfred in spring unless be mistaken say king alfred be monk that love reading book more than handling sword though to do justice have shown brave warrior have given far more trouble than other saxon king together king alfred fight bravely edmund said because be fighting for country people be true that love not war strife read much think more must ever come to kingdom again will assuredly be one of wisest best monarch who have ever sat on throne have talked to much of thing have at heart know intends to draw up wise law for ruling of people love not greatly being ruled northman bijorn said for to go own way a will provided only inflicts ill upon neighbour come go a plea fleet traverse sea bring home plunder booty what need of law at present have great need of law edmund replied seeing that lead wandering life when time will come must come to a have come to other nation when will settle down a rich peaceful community then law will become necessary well bijorn said right glad be live before such time have come so far a can see settling down speak of abandonment of ancient god have done great good to saxon to frank of be in old time valiant people while now be unable to withstand arm gather good carry off build city destroy cultivate land sweep off crop seems to that have best of seems so at present edmund said will not last already in northumbria in east anglia dane seeing that there be more plunder to be have be settling down adopting custom of saxon so will be in mercia wessex if keep hold of so will be in other place change be beginning seems to certain to come so have heard king alfred say doe think sweyn said scoffingly speaking almost for first time that will abandon worship of god take to of christ think so hope so edmund replied quietly so long a men life be spent wholly in war may worship god like yours when once settled in peaceful pursuit will assuredly recognize beauty holiness of life of christ pardon said turning to siegbert if seems to that being still young speak with over boldness be telling what king alfred say men recognize wisdom goodness know not of religion siegbert replied will own willingly that though teaching may be peaceful make not coward of who believe in have seen over over again old men young men die on altar of church a fearlessly calmly a viking must do when time come northman fear death for know that joyous time awaits be bound to say that christian meet death to full a calmly well own way say for aught know there may be christian heaven a well a hall of odin may be rewarded in own way for deed bijorn party now rose to take leave will come across to tent in morning siegbert said can then discus what payment will make for young saxon fear not that will prove over hard to old comrade after bijorn have departed siegbert assigned to edmund place in tent a honoured guest slave brought in bundle of rush for bed freda retired to small tent have be erected for adjoining larger one jarl edmund lay down on pile of rush at upper end of tent siegbert companion follower stretched along side slave lay down without in few minute silence reigned in tent chapter x combat be thinking much of what said last night freda said at breakfast how be that whose religion be a say peaceful one can yet have performed so many deed of valour bloodshed be fighting for home country religion edmund said christianity doe not forbid men to defend for did do so band of pagan might ravage christian country in world fight not because love hate bloodshed must rather die than plunder slay peaceful unoffending people have be in england have seen misery war have caused there such misery assuredly must inflict on none fight only to defend country men woman did people leave land must gladly never draw sword again what must do with freda asked in tone of surprise how must pas time if there be fighting must have plenty to do edmund said smiling have people to look after have to see to welfare to help who need to settle dispute to rebuild church house have be destroyed there must be difficulty in spending time how must man show to be hero danish girl asked if there be fighting there must be occasion for hero edmund said at least of hero in sense mean be of men famous principally for number have slain destruction misery have caused religion teach that mere courage be not highest virtue be one possessed a much by animal a by men higher virtue than be kindness charity unselfishness desire to benefit fellow creature virtue make man truer hero than bravest viking who ever sailed sea even freda worshipper of odin a be must see that be higher better life to do good to fellow creature than to do evil sound so girl said hesitatingly idea be so new to that must think over before can come to conclusion freda then went about occupation edmund knowing that siegbert must not return for time a be going with bijorn to council be to be held early in day strolled down to look at galley ranged along on beach varied greatly in form character of sailing ship be large clumsy galley for rowing be lightly gracefully built be low in water rising to lofty bow sometimes turned over like neck of swan at other time terminated in sharp iron prow formed for running down hostile boat of be of great length with seat for twenty rower on side while be provided with sail a well a oar when hour for dinner approached returned to siegbert tent jarl have not yet come back from council when did so edmund perceived at once that be flushed angry what have disturbed father freda asked a on hearing voice entered tent have aught gone wrong at council yes jarl replied much have gone wrong bijorn have not concluded bargain when went to council have indeed no difficulty about term have not clasped hand over a be going back to tent after council be over at council expedition against france be discussed be proposed that must consult god a to chance of adventure then jarl eric rose proposed that must be done in usual way by conflict between dane captive be of course agreed to then said that understood that there be in camp young saxon of distinguished valour that proposed that sweyn son of bijorn must fight with sweyn have expressed to willingness to do so must council agree rose at once said that saxon be no longer captive since have ransomed because have once done service upon being pressed be forced to admit that bargain have not be concluded must acquit bijorn of share in matter for came upon a much by surprise a did upon seems that be sweyn doing must have taken step a having private grudge against have have quarrel with edmund replied have ever shown haughty domineering have come to quarrel at rate want to kill siegbert said did best to prevent pointing out that combat ought to take place between frank dane however northman be always glad to see good fight having satisfied that in point of age strength be not unfairly matched decided that conflict must take place be taller think somewhat stronger than have proved valiant fighter must give much if combat must be avoided fear not edmund said quietly though must fain that must be avoided have met sweyn upon battle field in england must have slain a natural enemy to fight in cold blood a matter of augury to furnish amusement for assembly like not however must of course defend if harm come to be blame of mine will have easy victory can tell siegbert said for none among young dane bear higher reputation after combat be over how will stand edmund asked for if defeat slay sweyn will still be father slave will not siegbert replied in case captive if victorious be always restored to liberty at rate will fight a free man for when have finished dinner will go to bijorn conclude bargain look so cast down freda northman daughter must not turn pale at thought of conflict sweyn be son of old friend be before took to arm playfellow since then have methought be anxious to gain favour though too young yet for thinking of taking wife never mind there be a good a to be found if young saxon here prof conqueror other suitor will come never fear freda be silent face flushed painfully edmund saw tear falling down cheek a bent over plate after meal be over siegbert again went out edmund approaching freda said fret freda if must be that find skill in arm greater than of sweyn promise that for sake will not wound mortally care not girl said passionately spare not for sake for hate be there no other norseman in world must never be wife of so saying left tent edmund now regretted chance have assigned to siegbert for must rather have taken chance of escape by sea than have awaited conflict with sweyn must not carry plan of escape into effect now for must seem a if have fled conflict that must be desperate one did not doubt course sweyn have taken showed bitter feeling of hatred against even be not so young northman must fighting in presence of leader of nation assuredly do best to conquer edmund have already tried strength with older more powerful men than adversary have little fear of result news of approaching conflict caused considerable excitement in danish camp edmund figure be narrowly scrutinized a wandered through who have be engaged in war in wessex have heard of edmund there be slight curiosity when news went abroad that saxon leader be captive in camp to see what be like at first when be bruited abroad that sweyn son of jarl bijorn be to fight noted saxon champion idea be that enterprise be rash one strong valiant a sweyn be known to be for young man when be seen that edmund be older than to eye strong powerful felt confident in power of champion to overcome siegbert spared pain to see that guest have even equal chance procured for strong well made helmet fitted comfortably gave choice out of large number of shield sword edmund selected weapon answered nearly in weight balance that be accustomed to wield there be feasting again that night in siegbert tent did not allow edmund to join in insisting after meal be over that must retire to small hut hard by will want head nerve in good order to morrow said feasting be good in way night before battle always drink deeply for single combat be best to be prudent a edmund left tent freda who have not appeared at dinner came up to have be cry day said simply know not why for have often seen father go out to battle without tear think must have upset with talk morning hope that will win because be wrong unfair of sweyn to force battle upon hate for will pray odin to give victory believe in know still prayer can do harm thank edmund said will pray to one greater better than odin weep not longer for trust neither of will be killed will do best to guard will try not to slay for fight be not for nation for religion concern only following morning northman assembled jarls other leading men formed inner line of circle thirty yard in diameter others stood without jarl eric entered ring with sweyn while edmund accompanied by siegbert entered at other side of circle protest siegbert cried in loud voice against conflict taking place edmund saxon be captive here free man guest moreover being saxon issue of fight between northman can serve purpose a augury a to success of expedition against frank therefore do protest against conflict there be again consultation between leader for murmur of approbation have run round rank of spectator who be evident be impressed in favour of young saxon considered that jarl word be just reasonable eric spoke for minute with sweyn feel said in loud voice that what jarl siegbert say be reasonable that augury can be drawn from fight that since edmund be no longer captive friend of siegbert can not be forced into fighting in order that may have augury saxon though so young have won reputation even among enemy of race friend sweyn who have shown one of bravest of young men considers that have cause of quarrel with challenge to fight not necessarily to death till one be slain till jarls here assembled do pronounce one other to be victor be fair challenge first there be private quarrel next there be emulation between young men who may fairly claim to be champion of youth of two race such challenge saxon will hardly refuse in accordance with custom of day must have be impossible for edmund to have refused challenge without disgrace did not for moment think of doing so be ready to fight sweyn said have great cause of quarrel with if conceives that have ground of quarrel with be enough a to championship of saxon have champion fight not for personal honour glory for home country religion doing best according to strength god have given without thought of pride on one hand envy on other because strength courage of one may be somewhat greater than of still a saxon standing here a only representative of nation in assembly of northman can not refuse such challenge for to do so must be to infer that saxon be le brave than therefore be ready for combat northman clashed weapon against shield in token of approval of young saxon word young champion prepared for combat be naked to waist save for shield helmet below waist wore short tightly fitting garment covered with plate of brass leg be naked wore pair of light sandal weapon be long straight sword weapon edmund have chosen be considerably lighter than of opponent be of toughest steel on be engraved in rough character prayer to woden for victory difference in height between combatant be considerable edmund stood five foot ten looked shorter from squareness width of shoulder sweyn be nearly four inch taller too be very strongly built muscle indeed stood out in stronger development than did of edmund if pure strength be to win day few of who looked on doubted that dane must be victor combat be long one for time edmund contented with standing upon defensive guarding tremendous blow sweyn rained upon in spite of effort of northman must neither beat down saxon guard force to fall back single step again again rattle of spectator arm clashed approval of edmund steady resistance to opponent assault norseman delighted beyond thing in well fought encounter man warrior be able to appreciate value of stroke parry betting at commencement have run high upon sweyn horse armour arm slave have be freely wagered upon success a fight went on odds veered round demeanour of combatant have a much to do with a skill strength shown by edmund in defence dane be flushed furious temper gave way under failure of assault saxon on contrary fought a calmly coolly a if practicing with blunted weapon eye never left of adversary half smile played on lip although drop of perspiration from forehead showed how great be exertion breathing hardly quickened twice sweyn drew back for breath edmund time instead of pressing dropped point of sword waited for to renew combat at present have scarce struck blow while own shield be riven in several place helmet dinted of sweyn be unmarked at third assault sweyn came up determined to end conflict renewed attack with greater fury than before three time sword descended with tremendous force time met blade of saxon fourth time arm be raised then there be flash sudden shout from crowd with mighty blow edmund have smitten full on opponent uplifted arm striking just above elbow sword clove through flesh bone severed limb still grasping sword fell to ground loud shout of approval burst from dane although conqueror be enemy appreciated so highly virtue of coolness courage that applause be le hearty than if victor have be countryman sweyn have fallen almost instant blow have be struck ring be at once broken up friend ran to norseman be adept at treatment of wound everything have be prepared in case of emergency bandage be instantly tied tightly round upper part of arm to stop rush of blood stump be then dipped into boiling pitch sweyn who have become almost instantly insensible from loss of blood be carried to father tent according to custom handsome present of sword armour be made to edmund by who have won by success must have be considered churlish to refuse edmund have thought of doing so for needed money thing in day be equivalent to wealth have done well gallantly indeed young friend siegbert said a followed by several slave bearing edmund present returned to tent be glad did not slay for think not that will die blow given in battle must assuredly have be fatal here mean of stanching blood be at hand trust for bijorn sake that will recover whether brought on on reaching tent freda ran out radiant hear that have conquered said be glad indeed serf right for say that forced fight upon did not know that sympathy be so strongly against sweyn siegbert said in somewhat reproachful tone have always be devoted follower have always be tyrant father for have always insisted on doing pleasure if have be ten time follower have be valiant warrior instead of youth maiden of twenty instead of girl of fifteen must still be glad that be conquered because without reason for quarrel have sought to slay saxon youth who did such great service to whom a knew be so indebted siegbert smiled hitherto have wondered daughter mine at reason induced sweyn to challenge edmund now methinks understand sweyn have a father have told youth a be set heart on winning hand when will reach age of womanhood be just because edmund have done service that hate be young child for bright eye to have caused bloodshed if go on like there will be end to trouble will have on account before get fairly wedded freda coloured hotly be nonsense father five year will be soon enough to begin to think of such thing at rate said with laugh be rid of sweyn for can hardly expect ever to love one armed man there have be brave warrior seigbert said with one arm make difference freda laughed if have fifty arm must never love edmund now entreated siegbert to repay from present have received for good have evening before given to bijorn a price of liberty jarl must not hear of edmund then begged to buy with of bijorn four saxon slave with whom have agreed to attempt escape to expend rest of present in freeing a many other saxon prisoner a must siegbert did by evening edmund have satisfaction of finding around twelve saxon whose freedom have purchased remained a guest of siegbert until expedition sailed in last week of march then with twelve saxon embarked in siegbert ship instead of keeping with others sailed for mouth of thames wind be favourable passage quick three day after sailing edmund companion be disembarked on coast of kent adieu with siegbert be hearty earnest must have be northman jarl said for love a son methinks when time come have be so inclined might have really stood in relation to for guess that little freda must not have said have asked hand now path be to part will never war again with saxon for indeed there be scant booty to be gained there while be not likely again to be cast upon shore must fate ever throw together again remember that have friend for life in jarl siegbert freda who have accompanied father a usual wept bitterly at parting however did not deem to be a final a appeared to father for evening before a be standing on poop with edmund have said to will not forget freda be very young yet day when war be over england no longer requires sword will seek again be that promise edmund yes freda solemn promise will wait for said simply if be till end of life youth

at mouth of parrot have entered river at night so a to be unseen by in village at mouth have after dragon be laid up passed time in forest edmund narration be much more lengthy egbert be surprised indeed to find that kinsman owed freedom to jarl whose vessel have captured at mouth of humber chapter xi isle of athelney edmund spent month on land moving about among vassal dwelling in abode inspired by word with fresh spirit confidence telling that state of thing must not last that be going to join king who doubtless must soon call to take part in fresh effort to drive out cruel oppressor edmund found that although none knew with certainty hiding place of king alfred be generally reported that have taken refuge in low land of somersetshire athelney be specially named a place have made abode be good omen edmund said for athelney lie close to parrot where good ship dragon be laid away after visiting village in earldom edmund started with egbert four young men whom might use a messenger for reported hiding place of king first visited dragon found lying undisturbed then followed river down till reached great swamp extended for considerable distance near mouth after much wandering came upon hut of fisherman man on hearing footstep came to door with bent bow when saw that new comer be saxon lowered arrow be already fitted to string can tell edmund said be way to

wish to go edmund expressed desire to visit island even if king be not there man at once drew out small boat from hiding place near hut must hold four at most edmund egbert stepped in with one of follower charging others to remain at hut until received further instruction fisherman with long pole took place in bow of boat pushed off for hour made way through labyrinth of sluggish narrow channel of morass be gloomy journey leafless tree frequently met overhead long rush in wetter part of swamp rustled a cold breeze swept across slight coating of snow have fallen previous night added to dreary aspect of scene at last came upon sharply rising ground be athelney fisherman said good hiding place truly for a see rise high over surrounding country be always swampy from water of parrot

thick fringe of spear burst way straight through danish centre carrying before then at note of edmund bugle broke up into two body moved solidly to right left crumpling up danish line alfred now gave order for general advance saxon rank with shout of triumph flung upon disordered dane success be instant complete confounded at sudden break up of line bewildered by new formidable tactic attacked in front in flank dane broke fled saxon pursued hotly edmund keeping men well together in case dane must rally rout however be too complete vast number be slain remnant of army did not pause until found within shelter of camp at chippenham quarter be given by saxon to who fell into hand pressing upon heel of flying dane victorious army of king alfred sat down before chippenham hour brought fresh reinforcement to king standard many be already on way when battle be fought a news of victory spread rapidly man of west saxon capable of bearing arm made for chippenham feeling now never must complete victory over dane be obtained assault be made upon danish camp confident in now vastly superior number in enthusiasm reigned in army alfred be unwilling to waste single life in attack upon entrenchment must ere long surrender from famine there be risk of reinforcement arriving to relieve dane guthorn have led to battle whole fighting force of dane in wessex east anglia be far smaller than must have be year earlier northman having once completed work of pillage soon turned to fresh field of adventure whose disposition led to prefer quiet life have settled upon land from have dispossessed saxon principal band of rover finding that england be exhausted that more plunder must be have have gone back to enjoy at home booty have gained have sailed to harry shore of france spain italy thus position of dane in chippenham be desperate at end of fourteen day by time be reduced to extremity by hunger sent messenger into royal camp offering submission promised if spared to quit kingdom with speed to observe contract more faithfully than have hitherto made broken offered king a many hostage a might wish to take for fulfilment of promise haggard emaciated condition of who came out to treat moved alfred to pity so weakened be by famine that must scarce drag along must have be easy for saxon to have slain to last man majority of saxon smarting under memory of cruel oppression have suffered destruction of home property slaughter of friend relation must fain have exterminated foe king alfred however thought otherwise guthorn dane have effected firm settlement in east anglia lived at amity with saxon there have be true wrested from greatest portion of land still peace order be now established saxon be allowed liberty equal right intermarriage be taking place two people be becoming welded into one alfred then considered that must be well to have king of country a ally settled people must soon be a hostile to further incursion of northman a be saxon interest of wessex must be identical did on other hand carry out general massacre of dane now in power might have brought upon england fresh invasion of northman who next to plunder loved revenge who might come over in great host to avenge slaughter of countryman moved then by motif of policy a well a by compassion granted term asked hostage having be sent in from camp ordered provision to be supplied to dane same night messenger of rank came in from guthorn saying that intended to embrace christianity news filled alfred saxon with joy king sincere devoted christian have fought a much for religion a for kingdom joy at prospect of guthorn conversion must a matter of course be followed by of subject be deep sincere to saxon generally temporal consequence of conversion have doubt greater weight than spiritual conversion of guthorn dane must be pledge far more binding than oath of alliance between two kingdom guthorn follower must be viewed with hostility by countryman whose hatred of christianity be intense east anglia must therefore naturally seek close alliance assistance of christian neighbour great be rejoicing in saxon camp night seldom indeed have victory have so great decisive effect upon future of nation a of ethandune have saxon be crushed domination of dane in england must have be finally settled christianity must have be stamped out with civilization island must have made backward step into paganism barbarism might have delayed progress for century victory established freedom of wessex converted east anglia into settled christian country enabled king alfred to frame wise law statute to establish on firm basis institution raised saxon england vastly in scale of civilization have in small degree affected whole course of life of english people chapter xii four year of peace

arrangement considerable portion of kingdom of mercia fell to alfred share treaty comprehended various rule for conduct of commerce court be instituted for trial of dispute crime dane did not at once leave mercia for considerable time lay in camp at cirencester who refused to become christian be ordered to depart beyond sea dane gradually withdrew within boundary guthorn conversion although doubt brought about at moment by admiration of clemency of alfred have probably be for time projected by mingling a people did in east anglia with christian saxon there must have have opportunity for learning nature of tenet of contrasting mild beneficent teaching with savage worship of pagan god by far greater proportion of people followed king example wilder spirit quitted country under renowned leader hasting sailed to harry shore of france departure of more turbulent portion of follower rendered more easy for danish king to carry plan into effect after holding of witan edmund egbert at once left army with follower for month young ealdorman devoted to work of restoring shattered home of people aiding with loan from plunder have gained on sea alfred having at once repaid sum have lent at athelney a so many of follower have also brought home money after voyage work of rebuilding restoration went on rapidly in few month mark left of ravage by dane have be well nigh effaced flock herd again grazed in pasture herd of swine roamed in wood field be cultivated house rebuilt in part of wessex be prosperity so speedily re established a in district round sherborne governed by edmund dragon be thoroughly overhauled repaired for none must say how soon fresh fleet of northman might make appearance upon southern shore of england be not long indeed before northman reappeared great fleet sailing up thames at beginning of winter ascended a high a fulham where great camp be formed seeing that saxon east anglian must unite against did advance further dane remained quietly in encampment during winter in spring again took ship sailed for france for next two year england enjoyed comparative quiet dane turning attention to france holland sailing up maas scheldt somme seine spreading from river carried fire sword over great extent of country frank resisted bravely in two pitched battle defeated invader with great loss struggle going on across channel be watched with great interest by saxon who at first hoped to see dane completely crushed by frank ease however with northman moved from point to point in ship gave such immense advantage defeat at hasle saucourt in way checked depredation appearing suddenly off coast penetrating into interior by river horde must land ravage country slay who opposed carry off woman child captive must then take to ship again before leader of frank must assemble army alfred spent time of repose in restoring a far a possible loss damage kingdom have suffered many wise law be passed church be rebuilt order restored great number of monk wealthier people who have fled to france in day of danish supremacy now returned to england be for time freer from danger than land in have sought refuge many frank from district exposed to danish ravage came over settled in england gradually greater part of england acknowledged rule of alfred kingdom of kent be again united to of wessex while mercia extended across centre of england from anglia to wale be governed for alfred by ethelred ealdorman who be head of powerful family of hwiccas have received hand of alfred daughter ethelfleda ruled mercia according to own law custom differed materially from of west saxon prevented more perfect union of two kingdom until william conqueror welded whole country into single whole ethelred acknowledged supremacy of alfred consulted upon occasion of importance issued edict order in king name be ably assisted by werfrith bishop of worcester energy activity of leader enabled mercia to keep abreast of wessex in onward progress alfred laboured so indefatigably to promote edmund when not occupied with affair of earldom spent much of time with king who saw in spirit of intelligence activity resembled own edmund be however of le studious disposition than royal master though so far improved education a to be able to read write well alfred must not persuade to undertake study of latin being a said well content to master of learning of people by mean of king translation at end of two year of peace edmund be again called upon to take up arm although dane attempted fresh invasion of ship hung around english coast capturing vessel interfering with trade committing other act of piracy great complaint be made by inhabitant of seaport to alfred king at once begged edmund to fit out dragon collecting few other smaller ship took place on edmund ship sailed in search of dane after search came upon four large ship of northman have be scourge to coast saxon at once engaged desperate fight took place dragon be laid alongside largest of danish vessel king with edmund egbert by side leapt on to deck of danish vessel followed by crew of dragon danish ship be crowded with men who fought desperately discipline even more than courage of edmund crew secured for victory for time fought for although inspired by presence of king be able to gain advantage being much out numbered by northman edmund seeing sounded on horn signal with in battle ordered men to form wedge signal be instantly obeyed saxon be fighting with boarding pike against northman sword ax for have become used to weapon preferred to other instant edmund horn be heard man desisted from fighting rushed to leader around whom instantly formed in accustomed order dane astonished at sudden cessation of battle understanding nothing of meaning of signal of swift movement of saxon for minute lowered weapon in surprise before again rushed forward formation be complete in close body with levelled spear saxon advanced egbert a usual leading way with edmund king in centre in vain dane strove to resist onset in spite of superior number be driven back step by step until crowded in close mass at one end still saxon line of spear pressed on many of dane into sea others be pushed over run through in few minute not northman remained alive in captured vessel in meantime battle be raging in other part two of small vessel be engaged with one of dane at close quarter while other ship hung around remaining danish vessel kept up volley of arrow javelin upon dragon at once went to assistance of two saxon ship whose crew be almost overpowered by northman laying ship alongside edmund boarded dane northman rushed back from deck of saxon ship to defend own vessel saxon regaining courage at once rallied followed combat be short desperate attacked on three side dane be speedily overcome be slaughtered to man attack be next made upon two remaining vessel resisted for time be overwhelmed by missile from saxon flotilla greater portion of crew being killed wounded commander prayed for mercy be granted by alfred with four captured vessel fleet returned to england on reaching port alfred begged edmund to continue for while with dragon to cruise along coast to stop depredation of dane for week dragon kept sea met with considerable success capturing many danish galley of contained rich spoil have be gathered in france for cruising in sea off dover edmund intercepted many of danish vessel on homeward way from raid up seine garonne other french river one day in excitement of long pursuit of danish galley finally succeeded in making escape edmund have paid le attention than usual to weather on giving up chase a hopeless perceived that sky have become greatly overcast while wind be rising rapidly be in for storm from north egbert said must make for mouth of thames for shelter sail be lowered dragon head turned west before two hour have passed sea have risen so greatly that be no longer possible to row what have best do edmund asked chief of sailor think that can make dover shelter under cliff there fear that can not do so sailor replied for there be terrible sand willow off kentish coast between mouth of thames dover wind blow so strongly that can do nought run before then let do so edmund replied anything be better than being tossed at mercy of wave sail be hoisted dragon flew along before wind storm increased in fury for hour vessel ran before be short distance from french coast a wind veered round more to west danger became great fear will be cast ashore edmund said to sailor fortunately man answered be mile two from mouth of seine there can run in take shelter be anxious time until reached mouth of river for be continually drifting nearer nearer to coast however cleared point in safety turning head ran up river soon anchored under wall of havre a came to anchor armed men be seen crowding wall take for dane egbert said have best hoist dragon will then know that be saxon ship soon after flag be hoisted gate of town be seen to open officer men issued out launched boat rowed out to ship officer mounted to deck be evidently in considerable fear a saw saxon standing about unarmed be reassured be really saxon ship asked a flag testifies be so edmund replied be vessel be ealdorman of king alfred have be chasing danish pirate storm having arisen be blown down french coast forced to seek shelter here governor bid welcome officer said bade invite to land will gladly more so since ship have suffered damage in gale bulwark having be partly shattered will need stay of few day here to repair for sea will tell governor that in short time will land with kinsman egbert accept hospitality hour later edmund egbert landed be at once conducted to governor who welcomed cordially found there many whom have known at court of king alfred wealthier men bishop thane have for most part journeyed to paris to other town in interior to escape dreaded northman there be many detained at havre from want of fund to journey farther be sad pity governor said a talked over troubled state of western europe that english king frankish monarch did not make common cause against sea robber be enemy of mankind not only do ravage coast have entered mediterranean have plundered ravaged coast of provence italy laying town under ransom burning destroying must must meet of ship on way back from italy edmund said warrant that must obtain rare booty with gem of art such a must delight king alfred be thrown away on barbarian agree with that 't be shameful that coast of europe must be overrun with pirate yes governor replied if country in christendom must unite against common foe send quota of ship men must drive black raven from sea might even land on danish shore give taste of suffering have inflicted elsewhere a be seem paralysed local effort be made to resist number be too great to be thus withstood wonder that pope doe not call christendom to arm against pagan robber who not only destroy town village level to ground holy shrine slay minister of god on altar chapter xiii siege of paris on following morning edmund who have returned to ship to sleep be aroused by loud shout on deck hurrying from cabin saw vast fleet of ship approaching mouth of river be of size from great sailing ship to rowing galley needed glance at to assure that be dreaded ship of northman for black raven floated at many of mast head from town sound of horn great shouting must be heard showing that there too approaching fleet have just be discerned a morning fog lifted from sea edmund held hurried consultation with kinsman be now too late to gain sea for danish ship have already reached mouth of river to attempt to escape by fighting must be madness hesitated only whether to run ship ashore leaving there enter town share in defence to proceed up river with speed to rouen even to paris latter course be decided upon for danish ship must contain so vast number of men that there be little hope that havre must resist attack be likely that rouen on previous year have be captured sacked must even attempt resistance must only bring massacre ruin upon inhabitant paris alone capital of frankish king seemed to offer refuge deliberation be short one by time men have taken place at oar leader have decided upon course anchor rope be cut for not moment be to be lost leading ship of dane being already le than mile distant tide be flowing dragon swept rapidly up river of danish galley followed for while seeing that dragon have speed of abandoned pursuit at more easy stroke rower continued work until reached rouen here tide failed moored against bank under wall edmund egbert went on shore found city in state of wild confusion saying that have important news must see governor be led to council chamber where leading men of town be assembled after stating who companion be edmund announced arrival of great danish fleet at mouth of river news sir be terrible for poor country governor said to scarce brings additional horror although will probably decide question be engaged in discussing have news here that great danish army landed at abbeville be marching hitherward be met to discus whether town must resist to last must open gate at approach news bring of arrival of fresh army of sea robber at havre render case desperate so fierce be attack that must hardly hope successfully to resist approaching army against fleet tell of resistance must only bring about utter destruction at least be opinion other member of council must speak for other member who be principal merchant trader of town be unanimously of same opinion better said to give up worldly good to northman than to be slaughtered pitilessly with wife family such being decision edmund said kinsman will proceed up river to paris hitherto a hear northman have not ventured to attack city must do so will doubtless resist to last accordingly two saxon returned at once to dragon a soon a tide turned unmoored proceeded up river three day after leaving rouen arrived in sight of paris capital of frank be small city be built entirely upon island situated just at confluence of seine marne be surrounded by strong lofty wall on approach of vessel differing entirely from anything have before seen citizen flocked to wall golden dragon floating at mast head showed that vessel did not belong to dane of more experienced in matter said at once that must be saxon ship count eudes who have be left by king in command of paris came to wall just a dragon came abreast of edmund ordered rower to pause at work who be count eudes shouted whence do come with what intent name be edmund be ealdorman of king alfred of saxon when at sea fighting northman tempest blew down coast took refuge in port of havre four day since at daybreak vast fleet of northman entered river rowed up to rouen hoping to be able to find safe shelter there citizen being aware that great army of sea robber be marching against town being further intimidated by news brought decided upon surrendering without resistance therefore have continued journey hither being assured that here at least danish wolf must not have way unopposed have fought long in native land wish for nothing better than to aid in effort of frank against common enemy be welcome sir earl count eudes said though news bring be bad indeed have heard how valiantly thane of king alfred have fought against invader will be glad indeed of assistance must northman a fear come hither so saying count ordered gate to be opened dragon having be moored alongside edmund egbert with crew entered town where leader be received with great honour by count begged to become guest at castle where quarter be also assigned to crew banquet be at once prepared at many of principal citizen be present a soon a demand of hunger be satisfied count made further inquiry a to size of fleet have entered seine a to army reported to be marching against rouen doubt not said when saxon have given particular in power that be armament of siegfroi who have already wrought such destruction more than once have appeared before wall have pillaged ravaged whole of north of france last time be here threatened to return with force must suffice to raze paris to ground doubtless be coming to endeavour to carry out threat will not find task easy one will resist to last right glad be that will have assistance of two of saxon thane who have so often inflicted heavy defeat upon wolf of sea vessel be strange one differs from have hitherto seen dane saxon be sailing ship yet appears to row very fast be built edmund said partly upon design of king alfred be made from painting possessed of war galley of italy country visited in youth be carried out by clever shipwright of exeter indeed ship sail a well a row a dane have discovered to cost be able to fight a well a can sail row have be fairly out to sea before danish fleet made appearance must have given good account of ourselves be caught in trap fear that if northman surround city ship will be destroyed be thinking of edmund said pray to let have men who know river higher up there must assuredly be low shore often overflowed where there be wide swamp covered with wood thicket enemy must not enter seeing that booty must be obtained there ship be built in such spot must cut narrow gap from river float well in among tree so a to be hidden from sight of passing up river in galley closing up cut again so that none might suspect existence must be done easily enough count said there be plenty of spot must be suitable for bank be for most part low ground around swampy wooded to morrow will tell off strong body of men to accompany in ship aid crew in work twenty mile up seine suitable spot be found crew of dragon with hundred men whom count eudes have lent for purpose at once set about work have little trouble for spot be chosen where sluggish stream fifteen foot wide drained water from wide spreading swamp into river channel needed widening little to allow of dragon entering water be quite deep enough to permit being taken three hundred yard back from river tree underwood be thick edmund be assured that even when winter be now approaching stripped last leaf from tree dragon must not be seen from river mast be lowered bundle of brushwood be hung along side so a to prevent gleam of black paint being discerned through tree entrance to stream be filled up to width of three four foot new work turfed with coarse grass similar to grew beside bush be planted close to water edge stake be driven down in narrow channel to within few inch of surface of water certain now that danish boat must be likely to turn aside from river to enter channel into swamp party embarked in boat have be towed up by dragon returned down river to paris afternoon before starting valuable booty have be captured from dane be landed placed in security in castle upon return to paris edmund disposed of at good price to trader of city fortnight after have returned to paris news be brought in vast fleet of northman be ascending river next morning be close at hand citizen mounting wall beheld with consternation approaching armament so numerous be ship that completely covered river fleet consisted of seven hundred sailing ship vastly greater number of rowing galley boat vessel be crowded with men fierce aspect glittering arm lofty stature spread terror in heart of citizen be truly tremendous host count eudes said to edmund who stood beside on wall be indeed edmund replied numerous a be fleet have poured down upon shore of england methinks that none approached in strength be clear that northman have united force for great effort against city having at home successfully defended fortification be not to be named in comparison with of paris against see reason to doubt that will be able to beat off here dane landed on opposite bank formed vast camp there following morning three of number in small boat rowed across river said that king siegfroi desired to speak with goslin archbishop of paris who stood in position of civil governor be told that archbishop must receive king in palace hour later stately figure in glittering armour be seen to take place in long galley rowed by twenty men quickly shot across stream siegfroi landed accompanied by four of leading warrior entered gate be opened at approach chief of northman be warrior of lofty stature on head wore helmet of gold on whose crest be raven with extended wing wrought in same metal hair fell loosely on neck face be clean shaved in danish fashion save for long moustache wore breastplate of golden scale carried shield of toughest bull hide studded with gold nail be unarmed save long dagger wore in belt follower who be men of immense stature walked with proud assured air between line of citizen who clustered thickly on side of street who gazed in silence at dreaded figure be escorted by chamberlain of archbishop on arriving at palace be conducted into chamber where goslin count eudes several of leading person of paris awaited siegfroi bent head before prelate goslin said beg to have compassion upon flock if wish to perish beseech to turn favourable ear to word grant only that will march through city will touch nothing in town undertake to preserve property yours of eudes archbishop replied at once city have be confided to by emperor charles who be after god king master of power of earth holding under rule almost world confided to with assurance that must suffer harm to come to kingdom must keep for safe sure if have happened that defence of wall have be committed to hand a have be committed to mine what must have done have such demand be made upon must have granted demand if have granted siegfroi replied may head fall under axe serve a food for dog nevertheless if grant demand by day will overwhelm city with dart with poisoned arrow by night will suffer horror of hunger year after year will return make ruin of city without word turned followed by companion strode through street of paris taking place in boat returned to camp at daybreak next morning norseman be seen crowding into ship trumpet sounded loudly citizen seized arm hastened to wall norseman crossed river directed attack against tower stood at head of bridge connecting city island with farther bank who landed be provided with pick crowbar other implement for effecting breach approach be protected by cloud of arrow javelin from fleet covered surface of river french leader soon assembled at threatened point chief among be eudes brother robert count ragenaire abbe ebble nephew of archbishop frank bore bravely in spite of rain of arrow defended wall against desperate attack of northman fortification in day be very far from having attained strength solidity few generation later be bestowed upon stone of be constructed be comparatively small fastened together by mortar consequently must ill resist even assault by manual weapon covered by shield northman worked untiringly at foundation piece by piece wall crumbled to ground effort however to enter at breach so made be repulsed siegfroi kept back warrior determined to delay grand assault until next day by tower be in ruin scarce portion of wall remaining erect many of besieged have be killed archbishop be wounded with arrow frederic young soldier who led troop of church be killed besieger have suffered much more severely great number having be killed by stone missile hurled down by defender while engaged in demolition of wall at dane carried off wounded recrossed river confident that next day must succeed in assault a soon a darkness have set in count eudes collected citizen bearing beam plank crossed bridge to tower set to work outside circle of ruin hole be dug beam securely fixed plank be nailed to earth heaped up behind night work continued by morning fortification much higher than original tower have be erected round ruin dane again crossed river in ship assault be renewed javelin great stone be hurled at fortification cloud of arrow from shipping fell within covered with portable roof constructed of plank dane strove to destroy wall besieged poured upon blazing mixture of oil wax pitch number of dane be burned to death while others maddened by pain threw into river over over again siegfroi led warrior to attack defender headed by eudes brave abbe ebble time repelled abbe particularly distinguished be reported to have slain seven dane at once with one javelin blow may be considered a bordering on miraculous number of defender of tower be small indeed to of enemy loss inflicted upon dane great a be be a nothing in so vast host flame of machine lighted by pitch oil communicated to plank of fortification soon too be on fire a burned earth behind gave way breach be formed encouraged by result dane brought up faggot in several place lighted great fire against fortification defender began to lose hope when tremendous storm of rain suddenly burst over paris quenching fire besieged gained heart reinforcement crossed from town dane again withdrew to ship having lost in day fighting three hundred men after repulse northman desisted for time from attack formed strong fortified camp near church of st germain then spread over country slaying burning sparing none man woman child from wall of paris smoke must be seen rising over whole country heart be moved with rage sorrow edmund party have taken part in defence of tower loss must not have involved that of town eudes requested to keep band in reserve in order that might remain intact until dane must make breach in wall of city when sudden reinforcement of party of such well trained warrior might decide result while portion of danish host be engaged upon work of devastation large number be employed upon construction of three great tower be built on wheel be large enough to hold sixty men far overtopped wall citizen viewed with alarm time when assault must be delivered under protection of formidable machine eighteen ship of equal size be moored by bank six deep great plank be laid across sloping platform having be formed tower be by effort of thousand of men moved up placed on ship if destroy tower egbert edmund said one day a saw slowly moving into position on board ship be lost for from summit northman with bow javelin will be able to clear wall while below effect breach at leisure be true enough edmund see way to destroy unfortunately have boat might fill of with combustible tow down until near enough for stream to carry upon vessel even then chance be small indeed for dane must swarm out in boat manage to tow push so that must not touch ship must think egbert that if must get skin plank band might when be quite dark sally out take to water at lower end of island float down quietly for mile two then gain further bank then might march along quietly until reach ship dane know that have boat will not fear attack must not do until hour two before morning when after spending early hour of night a usual in feasting drinking will sleep heavily just before be ready to begin small party can unmoor two three of boat by bank push out one to outside of tier of six vessel so that may have mean of retreat across river when be done will make rush on board ship cut down dane may find there set fire to vessel must hold gangway to shore until flame get well alight then take to boat return think plan be good one edmund may well be carried out without great loss there be plenty of empty wine skin at present in paris will at once set about collecting hundred of will fasten to stout cord so a to form loop to go over head shoulder then have best attach together by one long cord by mean will float in body fortunately night be very dark think that will succeed say nothing about egbert tell men to keep silent good people of paris will know nothing of matter until see flame dancing round tower hold in so much dread saxon received with satisfaction news of intended expedition have be disappointed at being kept back from taking part in fighting during two day attack upon tower longed for opportunity to inflict blow upon hated enemy dane wine skin be fitted up with rope a egbert have suggested soon after party armed with spear sword carrying float sallied out from gate a edmund be by time so well known among citizen that gate be opened without demur on order crept along foot of wall until reached lower extremity of island across river innumerable fire blazed high song shout of dane rose loud in air number of figure must be seen moving about standing near fire tent of chief be visible distance back number of a well a of fire be much le than have be on first arrival of northman owing to number who have gone to camp round st germain night be very dark light rain be falling before taking to water edmund bade men strip off greater portion of clothes fasten in bundle on head a must be time after landed before must advance upon camp cold dripping garment must tend to lessen spirit courage when be ready stepped into water keeping in body drifted down stream wine skin floated well above water stream be running strong light of danish fire be soon left behind in hour edmund egbert deemed that be now far beyond point where might chance upon danish straggler word be therefore given made for bank stream have already drifted in direction soon reached shore here skin have proved so useful be left behind putting on dry clothes felt comparatively comfortable edmund ordered to lay down spear sword by side to swing arm violently continued to do until be nearly breathless by time blood be coursing warmly in vein be now in december water be extremely cold egbert congratulated edmund upon having made men strip for have be compelled to remain in wet garment while waiting for danish fire to die down must scarce have be in fit state to fight when moment for so doing have arrived three hour elapsed before glare of distant fire began to subside half hour passed then band be formed up moved along on bank of river chapter xiv repulse of norseman when within mile of danish camp edmund egbert left band advanced alone be pretty confident that must find few of dane near bank of river for arrow from wall of paris carried distance beyond northman consequently encamped hundred yard away have to pick way carefully for ship be moored along bank rope being fastened to great stake driven into ground there be light on board vessel many of crew remaining on board made way along until reached spot aimed at here lay three set of vessel six deep mast have be removed great tower rose high into darkness above platform extending over deck plank forming gangway up tower have be moved have be taken away save one gave access to tier edmund doubted not that be intended that must next morning move across river in tow of numerous row boat two saxon did not attempt to go on board a have now found out wanted might mar by disturbing sleeper upon platform accordingly returned to spot where band be awaiting propose egbert edmund said that a go along cut mooring rope of vessel must do quietly so a not to excite alarm will know nothing of until find drifting down river in mass then there will be great jostling carrying away of bowsprit bulwark confusion shouting will arise will tend to confuse dane to distract attention from egbert agreed to proposal a soon a reached first ship saxon began work sawing with knife dagger through rope vessel lay four five deep there be many cable to cut keen knife of saxon made short work of before beginning work have spread along bank leaving only two men abreast of ship so that in course of two three minute cable for length of forty ship be severed consort beyond began to drift out into stream saxon ran quickly on ahead repeated work until whole of vessel below forming platform for tower be adrift in stream by time in ship at lower end of tier have taken alarm shout of wonder anger rose on air nine saxon told off for purpose leaped into three small boat rowed out into stream while rest of band divided into three party dashed across plank on to platform dane here have already be alarmed by uproar from vessel adrift although unable to see what be passing judged that something be wrong have called to comrade sleeping in hold to come up of bearing torch came up on deck just a saxon pouring across plank connected ship with shore fell upon taken utterly by surprise dane must offer effective resistance saxon charging with levelled spear drove above headlong into water then having made master of platform dashed below despatched dane found there torch be now applied to content of hold be for most part crammed with booty norseman have gained at havre rouen other place flame speedily shot up by time dane in camp alarmed by shouting from drifting ship sound of conflict from tower came flocking down in haste plank have already be thrown overboard dane strove by pulling at rope to haul vessel nearer to land ran towards ship others jumped into boat pushing out to platform strove to get on board by time flame be rising high through hatchway according to previous agreement edmund leader of other two party seeing that flame have now firm hold cut rope fastened to bank a soon a stream began to swing out leaped into boat rowed for opposite shore uproar be now tremendous shout of rage rose from northman who be amazed puzzled by appearance of saxon whose attire differed slightly from own general belief among be that sudden alarm be result of treachery among there be time to waste in conjecture three group of ship be now mass of flame in midst of lofty tower rose high shout of sailor in vessel crowded together in helpless confusion in stream below rose higher higher a blazing vessel drifted down threatened to overtake tried to hoist sail others got out long oar strove to sweep vessel towards shore be huddled too closely in stream yard rigging of many having become interlocked with other northman leaped into rowing boat by bank above where tower ship have be moored rowing down endeavoured to tow to bank be now in blaze from end to end heat be so great that be difficult to approach endeavour to fasten rope to be frustrated a be instantly consumed northman finding effort unavailing then turned attention to trying to tow ship below to bank in case be successful few of vessel also at lower end of mass succeeded in getting up sail drawing out from fellow for wind be blowing down stream however proved destruction of rest of ship for great tower rising amid lofty pillar of flame acted a sail bore fire ship down upon helpless crowd of vessel soon reached nearest to flame borne forward by wind sprang from vessel to vessel there be longer hope of saving single ship crew climbing hastily across from one to other till reached nearest to shore leaped overboard although now more than mile below city flame lit up wall with bright glare shout of exulting frank rose loud continuous sudden shouting have broken out among dane have alarmed watchman who ignorant of cause called citizen to arm on reaching wall have stood astonished at spectacle flame be already rising from three group of ship have regarded with so much anxiety on previous evening by light must see river below covered with mass of drifting vessel then saw tower ship float away from bank figure on deck leap into three small boat at once rowed with speed across river that be friend who have wrought destruction be certain count

general cry rose to st germain to come to aid of town just at moment edmund egbert who have till now held saxon in reserve feeling that desperate effort must be made formed up band advancing to principal breach passed through rank of disheartened frank with levelled pike charged headlong down into crowd of dane latter already exhausted by effort be at once borne back before serried pike of fresh assailant in vain chief at point tried to rally nothing must withstand impetus of saxon attack astonished at seeing tide of battle swept away from breach french believed that st germain have wrought miracle in favour taking heart poured out in rear of saxon news of miracle spread rapidly through breach from gate poured out suddenly upon dane who struck with consternation at sudden onslaught by foe whom have already regarded a beaten hesitated soon took to flight vast number be cut down before must reach vessel great portion fled towards bridge endeavoured to cross there number impeded saxon frank falling upon rear effected terrible slaughter two day after battle force of six hundred frank arrived from emperor charles dane sought to oppose entrance to city be defeated with loss of three thousand men siege be now virtually over in short time emperor with great army arrived be now november after negotiation dane agreed upon receipt of seven hundred pound of silver to

board dragon edmund landed took leave of frankish leader provision store be hastily carried on board then amidst enthusiastic cheer of inhabitant who thronged wall shore oar be got out dragon proceeded at top of speed up river on way edmund questioned dane found that siegbert have be wounded in last assault upon paris have not be present at first part of siege having recently arrived from norway daughter freda have accompanied yes be still unmarried although many valiant northman have sought hand chief among brave leader sweyn of left hand there have be fray on previous night in siegbert camp be said for that must not vouch that freda have be carried off news filled edmund with anxiety ever since day left on father galley thought have turned often to danish maiden resolution to carry out promise day seek again have never for moment wavered have seen many fair young saxon must have chosen bride where must among for few saxon girl must have turned deaf ear to wooing of one who be at once of high rank prime favourite with king regarded by countryman a one of bravest of saxon champion dark haired freda who united fearlessness independence of woman with frankness gaiety of child have won heart be true be dane pagan father be friend must felt sure offer objection on ground of enmity of race since guthorn people have embraced christianity enmity between race in england at least be rapidly declining a to religion edmund doubted not that must under guidance teaching soon cast away blood stained god of northman accept christianity in five year of strife warfare have elapsed since saw edmund have often pictured next meeting have not doubted that must remain true to few a be word have be spoken knew that when said will wait for even till die have meant that be not one to change have even be purposing on return to england to ask king alfred to arrange through guthorn for safe pas for to go to norway to hear then that have be carried off from father side be terrible blow in anxiety to arrive at siegbert tent edmund urged rower to fullest exertion be three hour after leaving paris when dane pointed to village at short distance from river told that siegbert be lying there dragon be steered to shore edmund leaping out followed dane with rapid footstep to village wounded jarl be lying upon heap of straw be really edmund exclaimed a young saxon entered glad be indeed that messenger did not arrive too late heard of when first landed how dane when sailed up seine have seen saxon galley of strange shape have rowed rapidly up river how galley have never again be seen how young saxon with band have performed wonder in defence of paris have burned well nigh danish fleet said that leader be named edmund for have heard name shouted in battle especially when with one other alone escaped from burning tower swam river so be sure that be then week back men told of strange ship have passed down river to paris doubted not that be dragon have be hidden somewhere during siege thought then of sending to tell be lying here wounded freda who have always be talking of suddenly turned coy said that might have forgotten if wanted must come to in norway where be freda edmund who have be listening impatiently exclaimed one of men told that have be carried off be true ala be true siegbert replied be why sent for have never be good friend with bijorn since wounding of son after time matter blew over sweyn who though with one arm that left have grown into valiant warrior be now bijorn being dead one of boldest viking year since became declared suitor for freda hand in indeed be not alone seeing that have grown up one of fairest maiden many be valorous deed have be done to win smile from have refused suitor sweyn with others took refusal in bad part even ventured to vow must be whether willed not of course took matter up forbade further intimacy have not met again till other day before paris have high word there thought more of few day afterwards be struck by crossbow bolt in leg smashed knee will never be able to use leg again well nigh died of fever vexation freda nursed through have carried on litter here to be away from noise revelry of camp last night there be sudden outcry of men who sprang to arm be smitten down assailant burst in here tore freda shrieking away leader be sweyn of left hand a lay tossing here mad with misfortune tie to couch thought of said 'if can follow recapture freda be edmund ' dane have for most part moved away there be few must care to risk quarrel with sweyn in matter concerned not closely felt must rely upon that must spare pain to rescue child will not edmund exclaimed tell first what think be plan way have gone what force have with band command be six shipload numbering fifty men what plan may be know not many of dane know purposed when war be finished here to move east through burgundy intended to build boat on bank of rhine sail down on river others intended to journey further to descend by elbe know not course sweyn may adopt country between rhine swarm with dane suppose that sweyn will join other party having freda with will prefer keeping apart in case must not be safe for to journey with band who must assuredly become embroiled with first party of dane met even if be a brave a must be defeated by such superior number think that sweyn will venture to use violence to force freda to become wife think will hardly venture upon siegbert said however violent headstrong may be to carry off maiden for wife be accounted very evil deed for maiden be generally not unwilling to force by violence to become wife must be deed so contrary to usage that must bring upon anger of whole nation knowing sweyn disposition believe be there no other way must not hesitate even at might take ship carry to distant land must not do until other mean fail will strive to tire out so bring in despair to consent to wed edmund be silent for three four minute then said must consult kinsman egbert will return tell purpose doing on leaving cottage edmund found egbert walking up down outside awaiting result of interview have be present when dane have told of freda abduction knew how sore blow be to young ealdorman for edmund have made secret to of intention day to wed danish jarl daughter edmund in few word related to substance of siegbert narrative ended by saying now egbert what be best to be done 't be of use asking edmund know well enough that be that always decide agree have hand to strike head to plan tell only what wish may be sure will do best to execute of course must follow edmund said of there be question only doubt be a to force must take what siegbert said be true danish band be so numerous to east that must be sure to fall in with of fight a might must be destroyed yet with smaller number how must hope to rescue freda from sweyn hand edmund walked up down for time think went on at last best plan will be to take party of four at most must choose who will be able to pas best a dane with so small number may traverse country unobserved will take with two of siegbert men who when get nigh to sweyn band may join with tell how thing be going how sweyn treat captive if find be pushing matter to extreme must make desperate effort to carry off if a be more probable trust to time to break resolution will follow at short distance will go with edmund think will be better not egbert beard must mark a saxon at once that can cut off egbert said must be sacrifice truly must do without hesitation thanks dear kinsman think must be of more purpose for to remain in command of dragon may meet many foe be best that be there to fight direct pray at once to descend seine sailing round north coast of france place dragon at mouth of rhine interfere with danish ship that may see pas out keep at distance must sweyn descend rhine will if possible send messenger down before so do look out for small boat if see one in rower hoist white flag at end of oar will know be messenger if find sweyn go on towards elbe will also send word will then move dragon to mouth of river lastly if receive message if mark that in danish vessel when passing white cloth be waved from one of window of cabin in poop will be signal to that vessel be sweyn that freda be captive on board in case will of course at once attack let ask siegbert have sailed up rhine elbe can tell of quiet port near mouth of river where may lay dragon somewhat out of sight of passer by while can yet note ship go down river messenger will then know where to find having settled point returned to siegbert edmund told what thought of doing can advise better siegbert said assuredly can not prevail by force at present have only ten of follower with rest after be wounded be plain that long time must elapse before must again lead in field asked to let follow other chief a must not be idle here consented have ten men with must be small reinforcement a say saxon must be instantly known northman have suffered so at hand during siege that first party met must set upon will take two only of men edmund said choose two who be not known by sight to sweyn wish one to be subtle fellow who will act a spy for other must choose of commanding stature air of leader will go with party must come upon dane will assume place of leader can answer question there be far too much difference between saxon danish tongue for men to pas a dane if have many word to say will take four of men full grown strong good fighter have little hair upon chin at present can shave off now jarl want five danish dress for costume differs somewhat from ours have horse if not must send back to paris to buy have plenty to mount party good edmund said will go down to ship pick men in hour party be ready to start egbert have received from siegbert particular of village at mouth of rhine elbe promised edmund that watch must be kept night day at mouth of rhine until messenger arrived edmund have already ascertained that sweyn have left fortnight before with following have marched towards champagne there probably have halted main body returning only with party of horseman to carry off freda must must go with siegbert groaned a edmund said adieu to must ride straight into camp challenge to mortal combat a be be helpless never fear good siegbert edmund said cheerfully when leg be cured travel straight homeward there trust before very long to place freda safe unharmed in arm if come not will know have perished minute later after few parting word with egbert edmund mounted horse followed by six companion rode off at full speed knew that must be useless making inquiry about sweyn party few of inhabitant of country be to be seen about for dane have burned house within very many mile of paris peasant must assuredly not have paid special attention to party of dane for whenever saw dreaded marauder even at distance forsook home fled to forest party therefore rode eastward until then picketed horse having fire made supper from store of provision have brought with then lay down to sleep for night at daybreak again started continued journey until be necessary to halt to give horse rest have passed several party of dane for in great number after siege of paris have be given up be journeying towards burgundy there be slight greeting a passed on one occasion horseman rode out from one of band entered into conversation with two dane who rode at head of party told that be follower of jarl siegbert be riding to join rest of band who be with company of jarl eric a siegbert must be long before must be able to move have therefore kept only few of follower with eric be long way ahead dane said must be full a far a nancy by time who left first grumbled will have pick of country be fool to linger so long before paris then turning horse rode back to comrade party continued way avoided town large danish encampment on way made inquiry from small party met after party of sweyn learned without difficulty place where have be encamped few day before on arriving in neighbourhood found that place be deserted must tell direction in northman have travelled chapter xvi freda for day edmund party scoured country round journeying now in one direction now in without hearing ought of sweyn party certainly have not gone along track main body of dane have followed question be whether have turned rather to south in order to cross mountain range between rhine have turned north journeyed through great forest of ardennes so to of other river run down into north sea latter be in respect most likely course to have be chosen by taking sweyn must avoid altogether track majority of countryman be taking must naturally be object siegbert have many powerful friend carrying off of jarl daughter from side of wounded father must be regarded a grave offence sweyn might well wish to keep clear of countryman until have forced freda to become wife even then must not be safe for for long time to return to country striking through ardennes must come down upon scheldt moselle maas other river flowing into north sea direct into rhine edmund knew nothing of stream dane with said there be several river so situated for have sailed up where took rise knew not must probably be in beyond forest of ardennes then in way will search edmund said if come upon river will doubtless set to work to build galley to carry to sea for with only three hundred men sweyn will not venture to march by land through country have lately suffered heavily at hand of dane will take month six week to cut down tree build ship therefore may hope to find before be ready to embark first will push through forest to other side there will question inhabitant concerning position of nearest river then will divide into party go on search appointing place of rendezvous where may rejoin other can hardly be that will fail to find if have taken way before entering forest obtained considerable store of provision for have idea of extent have time to spend in hunting game forest of ardennes be at time of immense size extending from verdun metz on south to liege aix on north men of present day must have found impossible to find way through must speedily have be lost in trackless recess saxon dane be accustomed to travel in forest knew sign a well a did red skin hunter of american forest therefore felt hesitation in entering forest without guide danger might beset be of different kind immense number of inhabitant of france champagne burgundy have taken refuge in forest driving flock herd before here lived wild life hoping that emperor must ere long clear country of invader mercy must be expected if edmund party fell in with number of fugitive must have time to tell story must be attacked at once a party of plundering dane knowing that horse must be encumbrance to in forest be sold to last party of northman encountered before entering pursued way on foot greatest caution be observed sound be marked at call of human voice low of cattle bleating of sheep turned course so a to avoid encounter with inhabitant of forest lit fire at night scarce word be spoken on march several time have to take refuge in thicket when heard sound of approaching voice needed knowledge of woodcraft to maintain direction steadily towards north at last after six day journey issued out into open country beyond forest soon arrived at cottage peasant be struck with terror astonishment at appearance of seven dane must with difficulty be made to understand object be plunder murder that wished only information from of situation direction of various river of country after learning from that knew edmund arrived at conclusion that sweyn must probably attempt to descend either by branch of moselle so to rhine on right by one of maas on left of place at have emerged from forest edmund decided to strike maas to follow course up into forest taking with one of dane two of saxon to send others to search bank of tributary of moselle before starting sent peasant to nearest village to purchase garment of country for whole party have already told man that be not dane saxon bitter enemy of northman that have be aiding in defence of paris against peasant did not doubt what edmund told for conduct of visitor be so opposed to that have heard of doings of dane that well believed must not belong to nation be away hour returned with required dress having put on laying aside helmet shield two party started dane alone carrying with former garment next day edmund arrived at river at once followed course upwards for sweyn party must be building ship in forest have not proceeded many mile before heard sound of ax edmund gave exclamation of delight be almost certain that have hit upon sweyn track for be unlikely that of inhabitant of country must have gone so far into forest for timber now moved with greatest caution a approached place whence sound proceeded edmund halted two saxon bade conceal dane resumed own garment put on helmet shield then taking advantage of clump of undergrowth moving with greatest caution edmund made way forward presently came within sight of animated scene large number of tree have be felled by bank of river three hundred northman be busily at work frame of two great galley have already be set up be now engaged in chopping out plank for side two hut be erected in middle of clearing one be large sweyn banner floated from spear before other stood close by be much smaller edmund doubted not that be appropriated to freda nothing more must be done now object be so far attained retiring joined two saxon made way along river bank till reached edge of forest one of saxon be now sent off to peasant hut where be to remain until return of other party be then to bring on to spot edmund have chosen for encampment be in heart of large clump of underwood extending down to river brushwood be so thick that be entered with difficulty passer by must dream that party be hidden within near stream edmund companion with sword soon cleared away circle with bough constructed arbour thin screen of bush separated from river must see water none must pas up down unperceived saxon be charged to bring with on return considerable supply of provision for must have be dangerous to wander in wood in pursuit of game northman have edmund noticed cattle with must be sure to be hunting in wood a must wish to save cattle for provision on voyage be nightfall before hut be completed a have journeyed far for many day edmund determined to postpone attempt to discover what be passing in sweyn camp until following evening day passed quietly towards evening edmund dane started for sweyn camp when approached saw many fire burning shouting singing of norseman rang through forest waited until fire burnt down somewhat must see many of dane stretching down by then edmund companion proceeded to camp anxious a edmund be to learn what be doing restrained impatience for be safer that northman must go alone in dull light of dying fire feature must be unnoticed tongue must not betray if spoken to siegbert have commended a crafty ready fellow edmund felt that must be able to gather more information than must do from place of concealment kept eye fixed on northman figure presently saw enter clearing sauntering slowly across throw down near fire by party of dane be still sitting talking one by one lay down when last have done so northman rose quietly stole out again into forest when rejoined edmund latter set forward with not word be spoken until be distance from camp then edmund stopped what have learned asked that there be to learn think northman replied lady freda be a supposed captive in little hut two men only keep watch over by day at night six lie around two being always on foot speak in admiration of courage spirit have sworn to sweyn that will slay if attempt to use violence to force to marriage with doubt not that will keep word however believe that will grow tired out at last when find that there be hope whatever of rescue ship be being built for long sea voyage for sweyn be going to lead to join viking hasting in mediterranean have promised men plunder of country ten time richer than france england with so long expedition in view may well think that lady freda resolution will soon give way that may come to see that position of wife of bold viking be thousand time preferable to of captive many of men loudly express wonder why must refuse love of so valiant warrior a sweyn news be at once good bad edmund did not fear freda resolution giving way for long time news that sweyn intended to carry upon so distant expedition troubled be of course possible that might intercept with dragon at mouth of maas be uncertain whether ship must arrive at mouth of rhine in time to be brought round before northman descended length of voyage must depend entirely on wind be favourable when reached mouth of seine week must carry to destination must be unfavourable there be saying how long voyage must last risk be so great that edmund determined to make effort to rouse country against dane to fall upon in encampment task must knew be hard one for dread of dane be so great that only in large town be resistance to ever offered however determined to try for if northman succeeded in getting to sea pursuit must indeed be long one many week even month might elapse before must again come up to on following day rest of party arrived leaving forest edmund proceeded with through country visiting village endeavouring to rouse people to attack dane news that dreaded marauder be so near excited terror only assurance of edmund that there be much rich plunder in camp must become property of who destroyed excited feeble interest only point in narrative excited contentment be news that dane be building ship be going to make way down to sea in heaven name let go be cry who must interfere with flight of savage beast if be going down river will scarcely land to scatter plunder country must be mad indeed who must seek when be disposed to let alone finding effort vain in country near forest edmund went down river to town of liege stood on bank when became known that band of northman be on upper river be likely to pas down alarm spread quickly through town council of principal inhabitant be summoned before edmund told story suggested that fighting men of town must march up river fall upon dane in camp be two day march northman will be unsuspicious of danger taken by surprise may be easily defeated proposition however be received with absolute derision must be mad to propose thing young saxon if saxon indeed be for aught know may be northman sent by to draw into ambush will prepare for coming will man wall stand on defensive if there be a say three hundred of can defend successfully may hope that seeing strength that be prepared for coming northman will pas by without molesting a for moving outside wall must be worse than folly even to think of thing after rebuff edmund concluded that must hope for assistance from inhabitant of country must depend upon dragon alone at once despatched two of men dane saxon with order to journey a rapidly a possible to rendezvous where dragon be to be found at mouth of rhine to beg egbert to move round with speed to maas having done purchased small very fast rowing skiff at liege taking place in with four remaining follower rowed up river took three day before reached edge of forest on reaching former hiding place landed bush be carefully drawn aside boat hauled up until completely screened from sight of river edmund dane at once started for encampment of northman have be ten day absent in time great progress have be made with galley looked indeed completely finished a stood high lofty on river bank plank be in place long row of bench for rower be fastened in poop forecastle be finished decked number of long straight pole lay alongside ready to be fashioned into oar edmund thought that in two three day galley must be ready for launching be long low in waist be evidently built for great speed edmund did not think that be intended to sail except perhaps occasionally when wind be favourable a aid to rower must carry hundred fifty men there be thirty seat so that sixty must row at once be fine galley dane whispered sweyn have good eye for boat yes edmund said look a if will be very fast with oar alone must leave dragon behind with sail oar must overhaul in wind wish have be otherwise for if when reach mouth of river there be wind may give dragon slip ah exclaimed there be freda a spoke tall maiden came out from small hut distance be too great for edmund to distinguish feature doubted not from style of garment that be siegbert daughter there be other woman moving about camp for dane be generally accompanied by wife on expedition there be something in carriage mien of figure at door of hut distinguished from rest did not move far away stood watching men at work on ship scene around presently tall figure strode down from vessel towards there be sweyn edmund exclaimed seeing that warrior possessed one arm ah know by sight then dane said must do so edmund answered grimly seeing that be who smote off right arm of regret now did not strike at head instead dane looked with admiration surprise at leader have heard of fight between saxon champion sweyn have cost latter right arm until now have be ignorant of edmund identity with sweyn conqueror freda did not seek to avoid captor remained standing quietly until approached for time conversed then turned left re entered hut sweyn stood looking after then with angry stamp of foot returned to galley must give much to be able to warn that be present will follow until rescue from sweyn edmund said once at sea on way south may well despair of escape may consent from sheer hopelessness to become wife be not that hut be so strongly guarded at night must try to approach a can not be done must take chance in day to morrow will dress in garment will hide in wood a near a can to hut then if come out to take air will walk boldly out speak with see other way of doing on following morning attired in dane clothes helmet edmund took place near edge of wood be not until late in afternoon freda made appearance moment be propitious almost men be at work on ship oar woman be cooking evening meal there be one near freda with exception of two armed dane who sat on trunk of fallen tree on guard short distance away edmund issued boldly from wood waiting till freda step a passed backwards forward took to farthest point from guard approached freda said start betray surprise for be watched at sound of voice girl have paused in step exclaimed in low voice edmund then obeying word stood motionless be near dear will watch over have not strength to carry away ship will be at mouth of river a pas out hang white cloth from window of cabin in poop a signal if fail to rescue there will follow wheresoever may go even to italy where hear be bound so keep up brave heart have seen father have sent to save see guard be approaching must go edmund then made for forest stop there guard cried who be whence do come edmund made answer quickening step passed among tree be soon beyond pursuit indeed dane did not attempt have be surprised at seeing a supposed one of party addressing freda for sweyn order that none must speak with be precise have given command because feared that by promise of rich reward might tempt of follower to aid escape have therefore risen to interrupt conversation be not until approached that struck that northman face be unfamiliar to that be not one of party edmund have entered wood before recovered from surprise shout to to stop brought sweyn to spot what be asked strange northman have come out of wood spoken to lady freda sweyn turned to captive stood pale trembling for shock of surprise have be severe one who be whom have spoken to asked freda did not answer insist upon knowing sweyn exclaimed angrily freda recovered with effort raising head said insistence have small effect with a know jarl sweyn a there be reason for concealment will tell be messenger whom dear father have sent to to tell that day hope to rescue from hand sweyn laughed loudly might have saved trouble said good father lie wounded near paris by time be able to set out to rescue will be with hasting on sunny water of italy long ere that will hope have abandoned obstinate disposition consented to be wife freda did not answer at once now that there be hope of rescue however distant thought might be a well to give sweyn faint hope that in time might yield to wish then said have told often jarl will never be wife think that will ever change mind may be that sunny sky speak of may work wonderful change in remains to be seen sweyn retired well satisfied word be le defiant than have hitherto addressed to a to message of father who must know nothing of intention to sail to mediterranean thought further of three day later galley be launched after day spent in putting everything in place started on way down river rowed many mile at night moored by bank after darkness have fallen small boat rowed at full speed past paid attention to summons to stop enforced though be by several arrow continued way down river be soon lost in darkness sweyn be much displeased a rowed down have carefully destroyed boat found on river in order that news of coming might not precede boat must have be hauled up hidden said might a well have stopped landed at of village replenished larder now will find small place deserted cattle driven away from river be unfortunate mischance a northman anticipated found village passed next day entirely deserted by inhabitant not head of cattle be to be seen grazing near bank in afternoon came to liege gate be shut wall bristled with spear galley passed without stay sweyn have other object in view booty might be obtained without severe fighting must have be glad enough to gather in with long sea voyage before cared not to burden galley principal desire be to obtain sufficient supply of provision for voyage for several day galley proceeded down river village be deserted town prepared for defence when arrived within day journey of sea be forced to halt crew be left in charge of ship with others led foray far inland after sharp fighting with native succeeded in driving down number of cattle to ship in bringing in store of flour edmund have kept ahead of galley stopping at town village warning people of approach of marauder reached mouth of river two day before to deep disappointment saw that dragon have not arrived at rendezvous on following afternoon however distant sail be seen a approached edmund follower gave shout of joy a recognized dragon be using oar a well a sail be approaching at full speed edmund leaped into boat rowed to meet shout of welcome arose from dragon a crew recognized commander be in time egbert shouted just in time edmund replied will be here to morrow edmund be soon on board be astonished at seeing siegbert standing by side of kinsman what be news of freda jarl asked eagerly be well keep up brave heart edmund replied have sworn to kill if sweyn attempt to make wife by violence have spoken to told that rescue will come how be that be here after have left good kinsman egbert suggested to must take passage in dragon in first place must sooner see daughter in next must be perilous work after danish army have left for small party of to traverse france must have thought of edmund said mind be so disturbed with thought of freda peril that have room for other matter how fare with bravely northman replied a soon a sniffed salt air of sea strength seemed to return to wound be well nigh healed joint have stiffened leg will be stiff for rest of life that matter little now tell adventure have heard from messenger sent how shrewdly hunted out sweyn hiding place chapter xvii long chase following morning weather be still dull not breath of wind ruffled surface of river be unfortunate edmund said to companion sweyn galley will row faster than can go with oar alone though may not know dragon will be sure that be not one of own ship must hope that may attack day passed on without sight of galley late in afternoon be seen in distance dragon be moored near middle of rivet oar be stowed away crew ordered to keep below bulwark in hope that dane seeing few men about taking for easy prize might attack when approached within mile danish galley suddenly ceased rowing what be strange looking vessel sweyn asked northman standing round know one of said for have twice seen before to cost first time chased hotly at mouth of thames destroying several of vessel with be sailing in convoy next time be in battle where king alfred defeated last year nearly in same water be saxon ship wondrous fast well handled did more damage in battle than four of consort be not have other game in view sweyn said must fight for be two to one strongly manned saxon can scarce carry more men than one of galley be not likely to be worth life must cost to capture therefore will e'en let alone will be easy enough for see that bank of sea fog rolling up river ten minute will not see across deck give order to other galley to lay in oar till fog come then to make for left bank of river to drift with tide close inshore let none speak word silence be kept until hear horn will follow right bank till reach mouth freda be standing near heard order with sinking heart have doubt that edmund be on board saxon ship have looked forward with confidence to be delivered from captor now seemed that owing to evil change of weather hope be to be frustrated edmund saxon have viewed with consternation approach of sea fog instant enveloped ship oar be got out rowed in direction of danish vessel hoped must drop anchor when fog reached not word be spoken on board dragon edmund egbert siegbert stood on forecastle intently listening for sound must betray position of dane not sound be to be heard have calculated already reached spot where dane must have be anchored when from left far away astern loud call in woman voice be heard that must be freda edmund exclaimed turn ship have passed in fog dragon head be turned be rowed rapidly in direction of voice further sound be heard presently there be sudden shock threw everyone on to deck dragon have run high on low muddy bank of river tide be falling although for few minute crew tried desperately to push off soon found that effort be in vain be not until tide again rose high nine hour later that dragon floated until morning broke nothing must be done even when did so matter be not mended for fog be still dense disappointment of edmund siegbert at escape of dane be extreme plan have be so well laid that when be found that dragon have arrived in time doubt be entertained of success of enterprise to be foiled just when freda seemed within reach be terrible disappointment only consolation be edmund said a paced deck impatiently side by side with egbert that fog delay will also hinder dane may be so may not egbert answered be evident that on board danish ship must have recognized that be anxious to escape rather than fight draw so little water that must not be afraid of sandbank off mouth of river seeing even if strike can jump out boat push off once well out at sea be probable that may get clearer weather for siegbert tell that fog often lie thick at mouth of river when be clear enough in open sea when tide again began to run out edmund determined at risk to proceed to sea mooring be cast off from shore dragon suffered to drift down men with pole took station in bow sounded continually while at stern two anchor be prepared in readiness to drop at moment notice several time water shoaled so much that edmund be on point of giving order to drop anchor time deepened again so continued drifting until calculated that tide must be nearly on turn then dropped anchor be much lighter now than have be in river be still so misty that must not see more than hundred yard so round vessel change took place until night then edmund who have be too excited anxious to sleep on previous night lay down to rest ordering that must be woke if change took place in weather a sun rose next morning fog gradually lifted be able to see where be head pointed west far away on left must be seen low line of coast not sail be in sight indeed sail must have be useless for water be still unruffled by breath of wind anchor be at once got up oar manned ship head turned towards shore two hour rowing took within short distance of land keeping about mile out rowed to west men knowing how anxious be leader to overtake danish galley rowed hardest relieving other by turn so that oar be constantly going without intermission rowed until night set in then cast anchor when wind came be not until third day be ahead instead of helping dragon greatly impeded progress so far have seen nothing of galley have mortification of knowing that in spite of effort be probably gaining ground upon day even without wind galley must row faster than dragon being so fully manned must be able to keep oar going against wind advantage must be increased greatly for lying low in water must offer little resistance to must be able to make way at brisk pace while dragon must scarce move against saxon ship be off calais when breeze sprang up a increased progress became slower slower edmund held consultation with companion be determined to run across channel lie in mouth of thames till wind turned so long a continued to blow must lag farther farther behind chase who might moreover enter of river in search of shelter provision so escape pursuer altogether siegbert have never be up mediterranean have talked with many dane who have be have told that best course be to sail west to extremity of england then to steer due south until came upon north coast of spain must follow to western extremity then run south following land till came to channel ten mile wide formed entrance to mediterranean decided therefore to follow course in hope of interrupting galley there must thus avoid dangerous navigation of west coast of france where there be known to be many island rock around tide ran with great fury for fortnight dragon lay windbound then came two day of calm then to delight pennon on top of mast blew out from east be lying in mouth of colne must therefore have difficulty in making foreland with sail set oar out dragon dashed away from mooring swiftly ran round south easterly point of england then flew before breeze along southern coast on third day be off land end hauled head to south east wind held bay of biscay be calm after rapid voyage sighted high land of spain ahead then sheered to west till rounded extremity then sailed down coast of spain put into river for provision native assembled in great number on bank with evident intention of opposing landing upon egbert shouting that be not dane saxon be ready to barter for provision required native allowed to approach there be wrangling for term cattle be purchased water tank filled up few hour after entering river dragon be again under way rounding southern point followed land after day sailing perceived land on right gave shout of joy at thought that have arrived at entrance of strait at dropped anchor what be looking at siegbert edmund asked seeing jarl looking thoughtfully at anchor chain a ship swung round be thinking jarl said that must have made error do not see that ride just a be sailing with head to north east show that current be against assuredly doe edmund said current be very slack one for rope be not tight agrees not siegbert said with what have be told in first place channel point to northeast whereas a have heard strait into mediterranean run due east in next place who have be through have told that there be tide a in northern sea that current run ever like river to east if be so edmund said must have mistaken way for here what current there be run to west to morrow morning instead of proceeding farther will cross to opposite side will follow down until strike upon right channel in morning sail be again made crossing what be really bay of cadiz sailed on till arrived at mouth of strait there be doubt now that be right width of channel direction steady current through corresponded with what siegbert have heard proceeding mile along cast anchor soon opened communication with native who although speaking tongue unknown to soon comprehended by gesture holding up of article of barter that intention be friendly trade be established there be now nothing to do to await coming of galley must edmund said a when evening be closing looked across strait at low hill on opposite side that passage be narrower sweyn will doubtless have men on board ship who have sailed in sea before will not need to grope way along a have done if enters strait at night will see nothing of current run so fast that must sweep speedily by be possible indeed that have already passed if continued to row down shore of france time be lying wind bound must have have so long start when east wind began to blow although galley carry little sail might well have be here day before sweyn must be anxious to join hasting a soon a must men must be thirsting for booty must make short halt anywhere will stay week if in time come not will enter southern sea seek fleet of hasting when find that will find sweyn fear that search will be long one for people speak not tongue will have hard work in gaining tidings of whereabouts of northman fleet day night vigilant watch be kept up from mast head of dragon without success day became more more convinced that sweyn must be ahead of on morning of seventh lifted anchor proceeded through strait many have be consultation between edmund friend have be determined at last to sail direct for rome siegbert knew that by sailing somewhat to north of east after issuing from passage must in time arrive at italy at rome there be monastery of saxon monk through must be able to obtain full information a to doings whereabouts of squadron of hasting scarcely be through strait than wind veering to south east prevented from making course have fixed upon be able to coast along by shore of spain put into several small port a cruised up must obtain intelligence of dane being unable to converse except by sign when reached marseille be pleased to meet with frank with whom must converse hired pilot acquainted with coast of mediterranean learned that hasting fleet have harried coast of provence italy that genoese galley have have several engagement with have be worsted danish fleet be now off coast of sicily northman be ravaging that rich fertile island be reported to have even threatened to ascend tiber to burn rome having obtained service of man who spoke italian frankish tongue edmund started again first went to genoa a thought that people there might be despatching fleet against northman in case must have joined to on arrival there be well entertained by genoese when learned through interpreter who be that have come from england a enemy of dane edmund saxon be much surprised at splendour of genoa immensely surpassed anything have hitherto seen in magnificence of building dress appearance of inhabitant variety of good displayed by trader wealth luxury distinguished be indeed first sight of civilization edmund felt how vastly behind be northern europe understood for first time alfred extreme eagerness to raise condition of people on other hand genoese be surprised at dress appearance of saxon crew of dragon be picked men strength stature width of shoulder muscle of arm above fair hair blue eye greatly astonished genoese edmund companion might have remained in genoa received entertainment hospitality from people for long time after stay of day two having obtained various store necessary for voyage edmund determined to proceed three of young genoese noble fired by story heard of adventure dragon have gone through desirous of taking part in action might fight against dane begged leave to accompany edmund gladly acceded to request a presence must be of great utility in other port at dragon might touch at genoa edmund procured garment for men similar to worn by italian soldier sailor here sold to gold silversmith large number of article of value have captured from dane with count eudes people of paris have presented dragon differed little in appearance from galley of genoese edmund determined when approached shore where northman be plundering to pas a genoese ship for must news come to sweyn ear that saxon galley be in mediterranean might put on guard a must believe that be specially in pursuit of own vessel on arriving at mouth of tiber dragon ascended river anchored under wall of imperial city genoese noble have many friend relation there edmund egbert siegbert be at once installed a guest in stately palace pope upon hearing that strange galley have anchored in river be saxon sent invitation to commander to visit edmund kinsman be taken by italian friend to presence pope received most graciously after inquiring after king alfred state of thing in england asked how be that saxon ship have made so long voyage edmund explained that be in search of danish damsel who have once shown great kindness who have be carried off from father by one of viking of hasting fleet when said that have taken part in defence of paris holy father told that now recognized name for full account of siege have be sent to by one of monk there that have spoken much of valour of saxon captain crew of galley to whom indeed successful resistance to northman be in slight degree due must must aid son in enterprise against northern pirate depredation be committing on shore of italy be terrible indeed be powerless to resist have even threatened to ascend tiber attack rome though trust that might resist attack yet rather than such misfortune a siege must fall upon people have paid large sum of money to leader of northman to abstain from coming hither know that greed of pirate doe increase with gain that ere long may see pagan banner floated before wall few galley must man place under order in truth people of town be not skilled in naval fighting have already endeavoured to unite state of genoa pisa venice against for be only by common effort that can hope to overwhelm wolf of sea edmund expressed thanks to pope for offer said that must rather proceed with dragon alone be to full a swift a northman vessel said although must right gladly join great fleet might be assembled for attack upon must rather proceed alone than with few other ship not being strong enough to attack whole armament must depend upon stratagem to capture galley of be specially in pursuit will with permission set out a soon a have transformed ship so that will pas muster a galley of genoa venice holy father gave order assistance must be afforded to edmund to carry out design next morning large number of artisan workman took possession of dragon be painted from stem to stern with bright colour carved wood work be added to forecastle poop great deal of gilding overlaid upon shape of bow be altered so transformed be that none must have known for vessel have entered tiber must have passed without observation a galley of genoa number of prisoner accustomed to row in state galley be placed on board to work oar thus leaving whole of crew available for fighting purpose state officer be put in command of galley slave ship be well stored with provision after farewell interview with pope edmund companion returned on board ship dragon took way down river fleet of northman be at palermo keeping under land saxon ship sailed down coast of calabria at night crossed near mouth of strait to shore of sicily entered quiet bay edmund dressed a dane with two northman who have accompanied from paris landed journeyed on foot to palermo everywhere came upon scene similar to with be familiar in france village burned destroyed house deserted orchard crop wasted country destitute of inhabitant having fled to mountain to escape invader did not meet with single person upon journey when approached palermo waited until then boldly entered town here most intense state of misery prevailed many of inhabitant have fled before arrival of dane who remained be kept in state of cruel subjection by conqueror who brutally oppressed ill used making free with possession treating a slave dane entered into conversation with of countryman professing to have evening newly arrived from home learned much of disposition of fleet of northman pretended that be desirous of joining galley under command of sweyn be told that have arrived three week before be now absent with others on southern side of island having obtained information edmund companion started without delay to rejoin dragon upon reaching at once put to sea palermo be passed in night vessel held way down western coast of sicily be now under sail alone night lay up at anchor in order that might not pas danish galley unobserved on third day after passing palermo several galley be seen riding off small port wind be very light after consultation with friend edmund determined to simulate flight so a to tempt dane to pursue for with so light breeze smaller galley must row faster than dragon besides be possible that sweyn might be on shore be early morning when danish galley be seen apparently crew be still asleep for movement on board be visible dragon sailed back round projecting point of land then cast anchor be so important to learn whether sweyn be with freda on board ship whether a be likely have established on shore that be decided must be better to send two dane to reconnoitre before determining what plan must be adopted chapter xviii freda discovered spy upon return reported that sweyn have taken up abode in mansion of count of ugoli who be lord of part of country most of dane lived on shore in house of townspeople many of have be slain rest be treated a slave lady freda be also on shore be thought that must ere long become bride of viking think that there will be possibility of surprising house carrying off think not dane said for sweyn men be on alert keep good guard for people of part of island being maddened by exaction cruelty have banded together although can not withstand strong party go out in search of plunder cut off straggler have made several attack on small party be thought that may even venture attack upon place at night therefore sentry be set portion of force remains always under arm in readiness to sally out in case of alarm must fain go edmund said see how matter stand try to communicate with freda may be that long resistance have tired out that be at point of consenting to become sweyn bride think not that siegbert replied when freda have once made up mind be not given to change doubt not resolution edmund said none can blame if after month have begun to despair of rescue nay be even probable that having sweyn who be assuredly brave enterprising viking always near may have come to love edmund siegbert replied be sure need have fear that have softened towards sweyn how do think of proceeding if land will take with dane if one of genoese noble will go with will take also man brought from marseille who act a interpreter between italian why hamper with two men who must be even more likely to be detected by dane than must will leave in outskirt of place edmund replied must fain see if can enter into negotiation with native perhaps may arrange that will attack place on land side while dragon fall upon galley in case may need interpreter with people one of young genoese upon being asked whether must take part in adventure at once consented four men attiring a dane speedily landed in dragon boat bay in ship be lying be ten mile along shore from town spy have made way along sea coast by night a be morning when edmund landed thought that must be safer to make detour so a to arrive near landward side of town so enter after dark have not proceeded far when came upon ruin of village have be destroyed by fire freshness of charred beam showed that have be done short time before probably not many day mark of blood must be seen in roadway body be visible edmund supposed that after dane have retired survivor must have returned buried dead have not proceeded far when dane pointed out to edmund half naked lad who be running with swiftness of deer over slope of little distance be going too fast for to catch edmund said carelessly a even if did so must give information of use for may be sure have not ventured near town may well let go on in way for three four mile further pursued course country be exceedingly fertile covered with corn field vineyard appeared entirely deserted here there wide blackened tract showed where from carelessness malice brand have be thrown into standing corn dane be ever same edmund said well may be called sea wolf must be bad enough did only plunder kill who oppose destroy from pure love of destroying slay for pleasure of slaying why be robber permitted to be scourge of europe why indeed genoese repeated when interpreter have translated edmund exclamation to be shame disgrace christendom doe not unite against be more invincible now than be when caesar overran country brought into subjection what roman must do then must be easy for christian power to do now if must make common cause against marauder nay italy alone must be able at rate to sweep mediterranean free of pirate galley venice genoa pisa be consumed by own petty jealousy quarrel while sea coast be ravaged by wolf of ocean ah what be that exclaimed breaking off a arrow struck smartly against helmet be at moment passing through small wood bordered road on side first arrow seemed signal for in instant score of others flew among party be well that carried with long danish shield nearly covered whole body a be several slight wound be inflicted interpreter fell dead with arrow in forehead immediately following flight of arrow crowd of peasant armed with stave ax pike dashed out from wood on side fell upon uttering shout of death to marauder kill sea wolf so great be din although genoese shouted loudly that be not dane friend word be unheard in din attacked fiercely on side three men be forced to defend for life standing back to back in form of triangle defended valiantly against desperate attack of assailant several of be cut down so furious be attack of maddened peasant that defender be borne down by weight of number one by one beaten to ground then peasant rained blow upon a if have be obnoxious wild beast in spite of armour must speedily have slain have not genoese with great effort pulled from breast cross be suspended there by silken cord held up shouting be christian be italian dane so surprised be peasant at sight that recoiled from victim dane be already insensible edmund have just strength to draw dagger hold up cross hilt repeat word be christian be sight of cross rather than word have arrested attack of peasant indeed word of genoese be scarce understood by so widely did own patois differ from language of polished italy fact however that dane be christian seemed so extraordinary to that desisted from attack dane knew be pagan bitterly hostile to christianity monastery priest being special object of hostility suggestion of one of peasant that cross have doubt be taken from body of man murdered by dane revived passion of rest nearly cost prisoner life older man who seemed to have certain authority over others said that matter must be inquired into especially a man who have cross who continued to address in italian clearly spoke language approaching own must have questioned further genoese be now rapidly losing consciousness from pain of wound loss of blood three prisoner be therefore bound being placed on rough litter constructed of bough be carried off by peasant strength excellence of edmund armour have enabled to withstand blow better than companion retained consciousness of what be passing for three hour journey continued at end of time entered wood high up on hillside there be great clamour of voice round judged that conductor have met party that be at end of journey litter be now laid down edmund struggled to foot before stood tall handsome man in attire of person of upper class old peasant be explaining to manner of capture of prisoner reason why have spared life how be noble asked when have finished turning to edmund that who be dane pagan plunderer murderer claim to be christian edmund did not understand entire address have already picked up little italian be not difficult for from acquaintance with french be not dane said be enemy be saxon earl friend be noble of genoa saxon italian exclaimed in surprise one of people of king alfred genoese noble how be that be masquerading here a dane speak few word of italian edmund said friend will tell whole story when recovers pray to order aid to be given to at once although still at loss to understand how have come about count of ugoli for be that noble saw that prisoner statement must be true one in native patois hastily told peasant there must be mistake that although prisoner seemed to be dane be really christian friend bade then instantly to strip off armour to bind up wound to use effort to restore to life at bidding one of peasant brought wine skin filling large cup with liquid offered to edmund latter drained at draught for be devoured by terrible thirst after felt revived soon have satisfaction of seeing comrade recovering under ministration of peasant who chafed hand applied cool poultice of bruised leaf to bruise poured wine down throat in hour genoese be sufficiently recovered to be able to sit up to give full account of presence there of object in assuming disguise of dane then told count edmund intended to reconnoitre place alone that hoped people must attack town while saxon in galley made assault from sea count replied that peasantry must not be induced to take step will however aid friend said by feigned attack to morrow evening when be there may help to escape if dane sally out next day in pursuit there will be fewer for to cope with when edmund awoke next morning found able to walk move without difficulty with little pain thanks to care of peasant in afternoon being furnished by count with guide started for town when arrived within short distance dismissed guide lay down in bush till nightfall then rose made way into town passing unobserved between watch fire made by party of dane encamped in outskirt to protect against surprise once in town walked boldly on having fear of recognition question sound of carousing came through open casement few people be in street made way down to sea shore followed until came to large stately mansion standing in beautifully laid out garden at end of town several tent be erected in garden although night be not cold great fire have be lighted around dane be carousing avoiding edmund walked up to open window first room looked into be deserted in next be large apartment number of dane be seated at table at head sat sweyn with freda on right hand around be number of leading men captain of galley wife meal be over winecup be passing round number of attendant moved about room many of warrior who have supped elsewhere stood around table joining in conversation taking share of wine edmund saw at once that must not hope for more favourable opportunity accordingly entered mansion passing through open door joined party within keeping in rear of standing round table so that light from lamp placed there must not fall upon face just a have taken place sweyn called out let have song odoacre minstrel do sing to song of raven minstrel bearing small harp advanced into centre of horse shoe table after striking chord began to sing rather to chant one of favourite song of sea rover shout of applause rose from dane a minstrel ceased holding goblet high above head drank to raven while singing be going on edmund quietly made way round to one of open window be hour at count have promised to make attack listened eagerly for sound might tell that peasant have begun work other song followed first edmund began to be afraid that courage of peasant have failed at last moment suddenly saw light appear at five six point in distance putting head out thought must hear distant cry shout light grew brighter soon broad tongue of flame shot up shout at once arose from guard without of reveller hearing went to window to see what be happening gave cry of alarm sweyn must be attacked fire be rising in outskirt of town coward must never venture to disturb sweyn said scornfully of foe have ever met none be so feeble timid a italian see sweyn flame be rising from eight point can not be accident sweyn rose from seat went to window by wodin exclaimed there be mischief here let arm ourselves do said turning to young man run swiftly to outpost learn what be meaning of scarcely however have spoken when man ran breathlessly into hall haste to front jarl said to sweyn be attacked of enemy creeping in between fire set fire to house in outskirt a leapt to foot in astonishment at sudden outbreak fell upon many of comrade be killed with first discharge of arrow then rushed on in such number that many more be slain rest driven in how fare with other post know not methinks be attacked at same moment waited not to see for captain bade speed here with news sound horn of assembly sweyn said do oderic take twenty of guard without at once conduct lady here to boat get on board galley let others hasten to scene of attack can hardly even now believe that coward herd intend to attack in earnest in confusion reigned a warrior be seizing shield arm edmund approached freda who have with rest risen from seat dragon be at hand whispered in few hour will attack sweyn galley barricade in cabin until fight be over freda gave little start a edmund first word reached ear then stood still silent felt hand taken pressed glancing round met edmund eye for moment just a turned joined dane who be leaving hall minute later oderic entered with guard at once escorted woman down to boat rowed off to galley sweyn main body of
