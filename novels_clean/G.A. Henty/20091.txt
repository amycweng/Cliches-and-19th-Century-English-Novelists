water lay inside entrance to harbour in must go either north south of brownsea island shoot fish in many inlet bay there be few who knew foot of great sheet of water a did must tell precise time of tide at channel be deep enough for boat drawing from two to three foot of water most frequent visitor to netherstock be lieutenant a be called in courtesy captain whittier officer in command of coast guard station between poole christ church principal station being opposite brownsea island narrowest point of entrance to harbour be somewhat fussy little officer with great idea of importance of duty mingled with regret that duty did not afford full scope for proving ability smuggling have almost ceased to exist along here must say say across harbour something way may not still be done for facility there be very much greater than be on side still colleague there can have little trouble for keep sharp lookout that boat enters by passage south of island without being searched of course one hears sort of absurd report about cargo being run know better believe be only set on foot to put officer from swanage westward beyond christ church down to hurst castle off guard doubt captain doubt james stansfield must agree still fancy that although time be not what be be still possible to buy keg of brandy occasionally few yard of silk lace have never paid duty yes doubt occasionally

dealing with men for brandy be generally of best set up to be better than neighbour captain squire said with laugh if chance come way will not say must refuse to buy good article at price must pay for bad one in town tobacco be good too squire yes be particular about tobacco must say that think government lay too high duty on if have making of law must put high duty on bad tobacco low duty on good

here more than once for have told whenever have anything particularly good in wine spirit to let know talk little english girl like to have chat with about what be going on on side of water offered other day to give leigh trip across to nantes if be willing thing seem to be going on very badly in paris by what say doe not anticipate trouble in west of france where there seems to be none of ill feeling between different class that there be in other part departure of captain whittier be always followed by broad smile on face of elder boy breaking occasionally into hearty laugh in squire joined call insufferable as ralph said on particular evening must be difficult a father say to find officer who be a far a be concerned so admirably suited for position be so ralph there be scarcely man woman child in part of dorsetshire who doe not know that there be more good run on piece of water over there than on whole south coast of england sincerely trust that nothing will ever bring about recall personally must pay two three hundred year out of own pocket rather than lose there be such place anywhere for work why there be fourteen fifteen inlet where good can be landed at high water once past island care how sharp revenue men may be betting be fifty to one against being at right spot at right time if passage between point island be bit wider must be perfect unfortunately be so narrow that be only on very darkest night one can hope to get through unnoticed however can do very well with southern channel after be safer can get number of boat henriette have only to anchor mile outside entrance know when be coming have to show light directly make signal boat will put out from radhorn passage hamworth while messenger start for bushaw scopland creach dozen farmhouse cart be sure to be at spot where have be warned to assemble by time boat come along with keg everything be mile away in hiding before morning if be dark night henriette make off again come boldly in next afternoon if one of revenue boat from here studland happens to come across before get up anchor there be crew be asleep with exception of man on watch be simply waiting to come in when there be light enough to enable to make way up passage james stansfield be in fact organizer of smuggling business carried on at poole adjacent harbour there be not farmhouse among hill to south of great sheet of water with be not in communication winter be season at trade be most busy for short summer night be altogether unsuited for work when cold weather drove wildfowl in for shelter there be splendid shooting ralph john be able to combine amusement with business to keep larder well stocked night signal be made from cleft in sand hill mile from house light being so arranged that must not be seen from brownsea island though visible to on south side from studland right away over hill to corfe castle even to wareham be shown for minute just a bell of poole church struck nine at hour when lugger be expected there be lookout at door of farmhouse moment light be seen preparation be made for landing at spot of notice have be given by one other of boy on previous day then from quiet little inlet boat must put off noiselessly directly there be water to float for be only at high tide that willow be covered must gather in channel south of brownsea where boy often father must be in boat in readiness until momentary glimmer of light so placed on board lugger that must only be seen from spot where be awaiting showed position of craft readiness to discharge cargo be exciting work profitable so well be managed that although have be carried on for year suspicion have ever entered mind of of revenue officer sometimes many week must elapse between visit of lugger for be obliged to make appearance frequently at other port to maintain character a trader be a such well known along coast be only year since henriette have taken place of lugger have previously carried on work have be wrecked on french coast have be property of same owner rather of same firm for jean martin who have be first mate on board other craft have invested of own money in henriette assumed command be noticed at poole that henriette used that port more frequently than predecessor have done indeed not infrequently came in in daytime with hold a full a when have left nantes be on one of occasion jean martin on coming up to netherstock have long talk with squire so want daughter patsey latter said when visitor have told story well have certainly never entered mind that of girl must marry frenchman say have not heard boy making sly joke more than once when henriette be seen coming in have seen colour flying up into girl face only looked at a boy nonsense still say that be averse to suit may be said to be partner in trade of yours owe other good deal during last eight year must have run something like forty cargo never lost keg bale doubt if a much must be said for other craft in trade still one ca calculate on always being lucky think anyone must turn traitor when whole countryside be interested in matter must give much for life of anyone who whispered a much a word to revenue people still accident will take place sometimes father must have done well with trade so have at rate will leave in patsey hand have enough of to spare of course will be able to bring over sometimes to pay visit here think too that offer of taking leigh over with help to decide in favour be growing up if anything be to put stop to business place must not keep must be great thing for patsey to have brother a companion when be away boy must learn french in father business must get such knowledge of trade with nantes a must serve in good stead at rate will learn thing be good deal more useful to than get from curate well know will find in dairy a usual have better go see what say to be probable that jean martin have already shrewd idea of what patsey answer must be presently returned to father radiant patsey indeed have given heart to cheery young sailor although seemed to terrible thing that must go to settle in france have le objection to inasmuch a fear that smuggling must be sooner later discovered ruin might fall upon netherstock be ever present in mind in of elder sister to brother engaged in perilous business be regarded a pleasant excitement without life must be intolerably dull be not that regarded matter in light of crime for almost everyone on part of coast looked upon smuggling a game in wit of concerned in be pitted against of revenue men brought profit to concerned although many of gentry found convenient to express indignation at damage done to king revenue by smuggling there be none of who thought necessary to mention to coast guard when by accident keg of brandy parcel with few pound of prime tobacco be found in one of outhouse patsey have suffered more than sister being of more lively imagination being filled with alarm anxiety whenever knew that father boy be away at night then too be very fond of leigh have built many castle in air a to future thought that not only must be with must be in way of making road to fortune be very pleasant to knew that if remained at netherstock must grow up like brother father might from time to time talk of putting into business understood way be certain that nothing must come of martin have before expressed to doubt a to whether father must consent to going away with have fear on subject in quiet easygoing way be fond of child must scarcely put out to oppose vehemently anything on have set heart have too more than once said that wished of must be settled elsewhere for time of trouble might come must be well to have other home where of must be received patsey have consented jean martin said joyously a rejoined squire well be right think that be for best of course must be understood that in matter of religion be not to be forced urged in sort of way be to be allowed to follow religion in have be brought up must in way press sir have protestant in france just a there be catholic here though must admit that there be not many of in la vendee still day when people quarrelled about religion be long since past certainly at nantes there be protestant congregation though away in country must be difficult to find however promise solemnly will in way try to influence mind that of boy will still of course look upon england a home must even oppose attempt being made to induce to join church have plenty of frenchman in country question a to religion arises will be just same with six week later henriette returned in came monsieur martin whose presence a witness of ceremony be considered advisable if not absolutely necessary have too various document to sign in presence of french consul at southampton giving formal consent marriage be solemnized there at small catholic chapel be repeated at parish church at poole next day party sailed for nantes be two month before lugger again came in to poole when returned took with squire polly to whom monsieur martin have given warm invitation to come over to see patsey in new home found well happy monsieur martin house be

aunt everything here be very interesting to patsey costume of woman child instrument of husbandry air of freedom independence of people absence of ceremony interested pleased did not understand single word of patois spoken to by peasant even jean have difficulty in following although have spent good deal of time at little chateau during lifetime of aunt must like to live here when not at sea jean asked patsey yes must rather live here than at nantes next to life at sea must like one quite in country there be plenty to do here there be work on place to look after there be shooting there be visiting visiting here mean something hearty not like formal work in town here one trouble head over politics may quarrel a like in paris doe not concern la vendee here peasant love master master do in power for comfort happiness of peasant be not a in many other part of france where peasant hate noble noble regard peasant a dirt under foot here be more like what believe be in england when have trouble tenant followed lord to battle at rate life here must be very preferable to being in business with father in nantes must never have settled down to a elder brother seems specially made for sort of life fortunately be able to go own way to take to sea in lugger become carrier of firm while taking share in general profit how be that brother doe not live at home must seem natural that must have have pavilion when married like going own way jean said shortly a far a business matter go father be a one in other matter differ widely jacques be always talking of reform change while father be quite content with thing a be jacques have own circle of friend must like to go to paris a deputy to mix up in affair though none of cared for lady that chose a wife have money there be nothing to say against personally none of ever took to there be general feeling of relief when be known that jacques have taken house in business quarter look after carrying business of course lugger doe very small proportion of send up large quantity of brandy to tour orleans other town on loire have dealing with brittany normandy by sea with gironde look after part of business father doe buying directs counting house though art be very inferior one have reason to complain of share of profit first eighteen month of patsey married life passed quietly happily must now speak french fluently having made several stay at country chateau must make understood in patois leigh spoke french a well a english fortunately have picked up little before leaving home partly from tutor partly from endeavouring to talk with french fisherman sailor who came into poole frequently made trip in henriette sometimes to havre rouen at others to bordeaux have grown much be now very strong active lad got on very well with monsieur martin kept a much apart a must from eldest son for whom felt deep personal dislike who have always disapproved of jean marriage to englishwoman jacques martin be strongest contrast to brother be methodical sententious expressed opinion on subject with air of man whose judgment be infallible be ardent disciple of voltaire rousseau be very seldom that entered father house where opinion on religious subject shocked horrified mother sister lived with entirely different set spent most of time at club in imitation of of paris have sprung up over country what be excitement about jean leigh asked brother in law one evening there be always fellow standing on cask bale of timber along wharf shouting waving arm about sometimes reading letter printed paper then who listen to shout throw up cap get into tremendous state of excitement be telling others what be being done at assembly be doing there jean be turning thing upside down be good well there be doubt that thing be not a well managed a might be that there be great deal of distress misery in part of france taxation have be very heavy extravagance of court have excited immense deal of anger be not fault of present king who be quiet fellow doe not care for show pageant be rather fault of king who preceded especially of louis fourteenth who be great monarch doubt very expensive one to subject whose war cost enormous sum see be not in france a be with noble here have great power tenant serf for be still nothing serf be at mercy of lord who may flog throw into prison almost at pleasure will grind last sou out of that may cut good figure at court in part of france thing be more a be in noble seigneur be like country gentleman live in chateau mix with people take interest in go to fete lady visit sick in respect live a do country squire paying visit for few week year to paris spending rest of time on estate be not from country that member of assembly who be most urgent for reform violent in speech come from town there be two writer voltaire rousseau who have done enormous mischief of perceived that state of thing be wrong went to extreme made fun of church attacked institution of sort writing be read by everyone have shaken people faith in god in thing a be say that much improvement must not be made will never be made by sudden great change by men such a who be gradually gaining upper hand in assembly people ought to have much stronger voice than have in own taxation see that in england minister parliament manage everything that king although influence go for good deal can change minister a often a like must yet bow to voice of parliament think that be reasonable when come to parliament composed largely of mere agitator spouter for part must rather be ruled by king what be that people want jean think know in least beyond fact that want power that want to destroy nobility overthrow church lay hand on property of who be more wealthy than naturally lowest class of town who be altogether ignorant believe that by supporting men by pulling down above must no longer be necessary to work want to divide estate of noble take share of wealth of trader of better class of sort in fact must turn everything topsy turvy render poor powerful tread be good noble under foot consequence be that king be virtually prisoner in hand of mob of paris noble better class be leaving country thousand of have already be massacred one can say how matter will end here in nantes there be a see feeling of excitement unrest though a yet there have be violence one must venture to predict what may take place if moderate men in assembly be outvoted by extremist power fall into hand of latter still hope that common sense will prevail in long run regard present a temporary madness trust france will come to sens that will have satisfaction of seeing scoundrel who be now leader of mob of paris receive punishment deserve however a far a be concerned have uneasiness for if trouble break out at nantes can retire to chateau in thickest most wooded part of la vendee where there be fear that peasant will ever rise against master chapter beginning of trouble thing be getting more more serious patsey said jean one evening know what will come of excitement be spreading here there can be doubt that there will be very serious trouble ere long greater portion of people here be with assembly approve of decree against priest persecution of better class know what have taken place in paris fear that will be repeated here be split up father dear good man think that have only to attend to business to express opinion about public affair that storm will pas quietly over head brother have thrown heart soul be to say a far a have heart to throw into what call cause of people consider to be cause of revolution of confiscation of irreligion abomination generally be told that name have freely be mentioned in club a of dangerous man with opinion contrary to public good hear too that brother of mine be there at time that got up said that in case like voice must be silent that true patriot place country before thing then affected to speak mildly in favour at same time doing a much harm a must believe fellow be capable of denouncing own father from bocage hear that whole country be in confusion people of course side with priest noble land owner be naturally royalist be furious that king must be held in what be practically subjection by men of low degree who although may have virtuous men among have also sanguinary scoundrel who gradually gain in power will soon be supreme however can hing at present peasant know nothing about king to be mere name persecution of priest anger greatly if a be said order have be given to raise army to drag men away from home whether like to go not may be sure that ere long there will be trouble there now see dear be sort of double character at sea be captain jean martin peaceful trader with a know little regard for revenue law of country on other hand in la vendee be monsieur jean martin landed proprietor on friendly term with noble gentry in neighbourhood be evident can not continue to play double part already great number of arrest have be made here prison be half full hear that commissioner from assembly be expected here shortly to try suspect a be called from what know already may be sure that there will be little mercy shown be almost people of substance people a call be on principle opposed to men of substance now if remain here have doubt that will be denounced in very short time to be denounced be to be thrown into prison to be thrown into prison be equivalent to being murdered have doubt patsey that must share fate fact that be englishwoman be among accusation brought against in club although so far a can see majority of scoundrel have religion whatever venture to make matter of complaint that be protestant have seen coming on for time must now make choice must take child over to england leave there with father until trouble be over while must myself go down look after tenantry bear share in come must go down there with certainly will go down with jean be home danger may come will share with must be agony to be in england to know nothing of what be passing here what danger might be threatening took other for better worse jean greater danger may be in more will be duty to be by side must be very happy down at chateau more happy than have be here with for time past for one can not be very anxious when one see one friend thrown into prison know that be opposed to thing that may be turn next nothing must persuade to leave very well wife so be be sure that there at least will be safe be only in town that rascal be dangerous in country like ours there be little fear that knave will venture to interfere when see that be stirring up nest of hornet have plenty of work to satisfy even taste for confiscation murder in large town there be army gathering on frontier will have hand full ere long now about leigh brother have always shown dislike for a be certain that can not remain here must either return to england go with be sure that must choose to go with jean say that talk french like native now although have often told that must never settle in france for naturally be a horrified a be with doings in paris other great town still be sure that must choose to remain with now see be strong active have made so many trip with that be almost sailor be within few month of sixteen of late have several time said to that must like to go long voyage have adventure before settling down in business in england a agent of house must like to have with jean said heartily in first place be lad after own heart full of life go already strong enough to take own part in next place although hope for best man can never say exactly what will take place may be away at time must be glad to know that have protector if be willing to go will be more than willing to have then too must be useful to have someone whom one must trust to carry message idea be that will not leave lugger here for if be denounced must certainly be seized pierre lefaux mate be shrewd a well a faithful fellow will appoint captain will tell to leave here at once employ lugger in coasting voyage making bordeaux headquarters taking what freight can get between town rochelle brest other port on coast so long a doe not return here might even take wine across to england brandy from charente know business well a long a be at peace with england trade will still go on best thing must be for to be at bordeaux once fortnight three week so that will know where to find have great friend at bordeaux will get to have lugger registered in name give receipt for purchase money so that in case people here learn that be trading at bordeaux will be able to prove that be own property then if very worst must come can not bring to believe there will be mean of escape for to england will be sailing there in two three day have fifty thousand franc lying in father hand will send that over by lefaux instruct to ask father to go with to bank at poole pay money in to account then if must have to leave france will have to fall back upon lugger must of course transfer to english flag have doubt that must be able to get on very fairly so see be preparing for contingency patsey seems very dreadful that country must be in such state jean be dreadful be afraid that thing have by mean got to worst yet ah here come leigh after supper will go in have talk with father have very little hope of having much success with at least when see step be taking can not make think seriously of own position that of mother sister leigh be delighted when heard jean proposal own position have be unpleasant of late have long since ceased to go to jacques martin for dislike between be mutual do what must failed to give satisfaction of late even in monsieur martin cellar storehouse have met with good deal of unpleasantness must have met with more have not be that have on one occasion knocked down one of chief clerk who have sworn at for trifling act of carelessness a clerk knew that merchant must have be very angry at insult have offered to leigh have not ventured to make complaint in many way have be able to cause numberless petty annoyance many of others be inclined to follow lead must have done so more openly be not that held in respect leigh strength readiness in science called le boxe talk that there might be trouble in la vendee heightened satisfaction at leaving nantes going down to stay in country thought of life spent at poole weymouth a wine merchant agent of house of martin have for time past be unpleasant to feeling of general unrest prevailed in france have communicated to thought possibly that something might occur must change current of life lead to one more suited to natural activity energy have better pack up quietly tomorrow jean said to wife after return from father if there be suspicion be thinking of going away might bring matter to head will get lugger boat down to wharf four sailor will come up here take box down in one of hand cart with tarpaulin thrown over will arrange for cart carriage to be waiting for on other side of river there be moving father can not persuade that man who take part in politics go about business quietly can be in danger have however at mother entreaty agreed for present to cease buying to diminish stock a far a possible send money a fast a realizes across to england say too that will if thing get worse send sister to england promised that father must find house see that be settled comfortably there for time must not believe that jacques must have be at club when be denounced without defending for although greatly opposed to doings in paris annoyed at line jacques have taken up thought that there be at least advantage in that in case of trouble coming here must have sufficient influence to prevent being in way molested however there can be question have to extent alarmed agreed not only to draw tomorrow fifty thousand franc from caisse to send over with hundred thousand franc of own fortunately can do without jacques knowing anything about for although jacques have share in business have always kept management of money matter in own hand so be settled a far a can be settled fortunately club doe not meet evening so there be fear of demand being made by for arrest tomorrow have friend who belongs to not think because at agrees with view because like many others deems prudent to appear to do so be from heard what have passed there promised to give warning of anything might be said done against will go down to lugger early remain on board day seeing to stowage of cargo be taking on board so that suspicion can arise be thinking of leaving for country next evening party started by unfrequented street for quay nurse carrying child now three month old box have gone hour before be nearly ten o'clock quay be deserted monsieur martin have gone down in afternoon with money to lugger handed over to jean have long talk with pierre lefaux to whom jean have also intrusted letter from patsey to squire a soon a party have taken seat in boat be rowed two mile up river to point where there be ferry across to road leading into heart of la vendee here light waggon carriage be waiting luggage be transferred to former after hearty farewell to pierre lefaux who have come in charge of boat started on journey arrived at chateau at nine o'clock in morning to surprise of man woman in charge of here be safe jean said a alighted from carriage must take nothing short of army to fight way through wood lane if assembly try to interfere with will find much easier thing to pull down throne of france than to subdue la vendee news that master have come down that be going for time to live among spread rapidly in course of day fifteen of tenant came in to pay respect few of arriving without little offering in way of game poultry butter other produce larder be full enough for to stand siege patsey said laughing know that have good stock of wine in cellar jean yes of cider too when tenant be in difficulty about paying rent be always willing to take out in wine cider for father deal in therefore be a good a money have not sent to nantes for past two three year a say cellar be a full a can hold tomorrow leigh will ride over call upon of neighbour to hear last news for bocage be a far away from nantes a if be on other side of france hear only vague rumour of what be going on here ride be delightful one to leigh have only once visited chateau before then only for day two wild country with deep lane thick high hedge wood copse be new to for country round english home be for most part bare open of peasant carried gun over shoulder looked a if accustomed to use very few of posse gun jean martin remarked that must carry show how disturbed state of mind people be in know that priest may be arrested carried off at moment doubt report that order have be issued to raise thirty thousand men throughout france that town village have to furnish quota have stirred up even more effectually suppose that many of think that authority will really try to drag men off against will possibility be quite enough to inflame mind at very first house visited received from owner ample confirmation of jean view there have be continual fracas between peasant military said over attempt of latter to arrest priest can scarcely be called fight for have not come to a soon a peasant hear that gendarme be coming send priest into wood gather in such force that gendarme be glad enough to ride away unharmed of course until see that peasant be really in earnest intend to fight to last must be madness for of to take part in matter for must be risking not only life fortune of family maybe life too must remember moreover already great number of landed proprietor have be murdered imprisoned in paris be fugitive beyond frontier if peasant must fight jean martin said might not be bad thing that there be so few whom must regard a natural leader if there be only few leader may act together harmoniously operate in own district with number of men of same rank nearly of same rank must have own idea a to what must be done there must be jealousy discord be true other replied of course if be open country must be necessary to give chance of success that sort of discipline must be established none must persuade peasant to submit to discipline except own lord in country like discipline be of comparatively little importance be well that be so for though believe that peasant must fight to death rather than submit to be dragged away by force from home will never keep together for time be afraid that will be case must hope that will not come to fighting if doe will take large force to conquer la vendee have brought down here monsieur martin be not safe for to stay longer in nantes if think thing say a think well of what be being done in paris have not be in habit of saying flattering thing about men there in fact have be denounced a there be still room for few more in prison must have have cell placed at disposal if have remained there many more hour so thought must be safer down here till there be change in state of affair brought madame down with assuredly have only choice open to of sending across to england of making home there of coming here if there have be prospect of trouble here might have joined army of countryman who be in exile a from heard la vendee be ready to take up arm determined to come here partly because have left country estate here must have be confiscated partly because must like to strike blow myself at tyrant of paris who seem bent on destroying whole of aristocracy of france of wiping out middle class dividing land else among scum of town three four month passed quietly there be occasional skirmish between peasant party of troop

smallest encouragement to friend to rally to support might even have fought against disturbance of clergy must have have follower peasant cared little for king though did care enough for priest to aid

anything besides have learned to talk french well something of business of wine merchant ca be taken in by having common spirit year two old passed off on a finest from charente common claret for choice brand be useful even if become wine merchant at rate be more useful than stopping at netherstock where must have learned nothing except little more latin greek yes may be killed leigh well suppose if have stayed at home got commission in army midshipman berth in navy might have be killed if have choice must much rather be killed in fighting against people who murder woman child who have committed crime than in fighting soldier sailor of nation who may be just a honest fellow a be '' can not argue with leigh if anything happens to will blame life must be foolish leigh said be funny what foolish idea woman have must not have foreseen what be coming when came over here thought that must be good thing for to accompany for time did what thought be best think be best well if doe turn

dangerous place a now hope that supper be ready for be a hungry a hunter chapter first success next morning at twelve o'clock jean martin reached war have begun said a leaped from horse henri de la rochejaquelein have accepted leadership of peasant at clisson lescure must have joined also henri pointed out to that must be better not to compromise family until be certain that insurrection must

message from aunt who life farther to south brought news that chevalier de charette formerly lieutenant in navy strong royalist who have escaped massacre at paris be living quietly on estate near machecoul have be asked several time by peasant in neighbourhood to take command have accepted that rising be so formidable there that be certain authority in part of poitou must not succeed in enforcing conscription have told lescure that will be prepared to join a soon a there be general movement here must attach to whoever took direction of affair in part for in first place knew nothing of war in second place have resided here so small portion of time that be scarcely known save to own tenant after meal will ride round see how be off for arm powder be great weakness be afraid taking whole country round that not one man in twenty posse gun indeed be found to be case a far a on estate be concerned men however seemed to think little of will take from blue several of said confidently doe not matter bit will only have time to fire one volley in lane of ours then will be among pike pitchfork be just a good at close quarter a bayonet that whole country be astir be evident from fact that sound of church bell rose from wood in direction work be suspended peasant flocked into little village to hear news be brought in from several direction cathelineau have in course of night gathered party of twenty seven men who at daybreak have started out from pin setting church bell ringing in village through passed until hundred men armed for most part with pitchfork stake have gathered round then boldly attacked chateau of tallais garrisoned by hundred fifty soldier having with cannon be fired shot passed over peasant head with shout dashed forward soldier of republic threw away arm fled thus cathelineau follower became possessed of firearm horse to great delight cannon leader did not waste moment marched at once against chemille force increasing at moment a men flocked in from village there be at chemille two hundred soldier with three gun of fugitive from tallais have already arrived there bringing news of desperate fury with peasant have attacked at sight of throng approaching with captured cannon garrison lost heart altogether bolted leaving three cannon ammunition greater portion of musket behind news spread with incredible rapidity from village passed through boy be despatched a messenger tidings be taken on by fresh relay by afternoon country for thirty mile round knew that cathelineau have captured tallais chemille be in possession of quantity of arm four cannon from saint florent came news early in morning party of republican soldier have endeavoured to arrest foret who led rising on previous day that have obtained word of approach setting church bell ringing have collected force have beaten back who came in search of close by detachment of national guard from chollett have visited chateau of maulevrier proprietor be absent carried off twelve cannon have be kept a family relic gamekeeper nicholas stofflet who be in charge of estate have served sixteen year in army be man of great strength courage sagacity furious at theft of master cannon have gathered peasantry round be already at head of two hundred men thing go on apace patsey jean martin said a sat by fire that evening only know what be happening within twenty thirty mile of if spirit shown here exists throughout poitou anjou there can be doubt that in very short time insurrection will be general cathelineau by description must be man of ordinary ability have lost time in showing energy for care not in least what be rank of leader here in la vendee there be broad line between seigneur tenant peasantry at rustic fete mix on equal term seigneur set example by dancing with peasant girl wife daughter disdain to do same with tenant peasantry attend marriage holiday festivity be foremost in giving aid in showing kindness in case of distress illness feel sure that if found in man like cathelineau genius for command must follow a readily a one of own rank on fourteenth news came that band of stofflet foret have with others joined that of cathelineau jean martin hesitated no longer war have fairly begun said will be off tomorrow morning if cathelineau be defeated will have republican devastating whole country massacring woman child a did last august after rising for protection of priest therefore will be fighting now in defence of life home wife must not keep at home jean think be duty of man to join in defence against wretch know that mercy will be shown by if conquer will not take leigh with surely leigh uttered exclamation leigh must choose for jean said quietly be not french must have concern in matter beyond of humanity be not that be here at present home be life also be involved if be beaten be young to fight there will doubtless be many others older probably much le strong than be moreover if must be killed be who must bear news must arrange with plan act a protector say must advise leaving chateau directly if republican come way will be place for must say that must be vastly better that must at once endeavour to cross to england there be five thousand franc in gold in bureau be worth three four time value in assignats must if can gain coast be amply sufficient to procure passage for to england weep dear be necessary to leave on undertaking of kind prepared for may happen at present risk be very small a have heard fury of peasant have struck such consternation into national guard newly raised soldier that will not await onslaught will not be until convention becomes aware of really serious nature of storm have raised that there will be hard fighting still even in petty skirmish men fall be right that before go must arrange a to what course have best pursue in case of death from first when came here did so with eye open if have merely sought safety must have gone to england came here partly because be home therefore proper place partly because in case la vendee rose against executioner of paris man of honour loyalty must aid in good cause know jean must not keep back struggle have begun if republican conquer la vendee know how awful will be persecution what thousand of victim will be slaughtered only hope be in victory at rate who die on battlefield will be happy in comparison with who fall into hand of blue wish to go leigh certainly do lad said think that everyone strong enough to carry arm in la vendee ought to join do best can shoot better than most of peasantry not one in twenty of whom have ever have gun in hand be sure be a strong a most of besides if have be at home must now war have begun have tried to get commission to fight french mean people who govern france at present in fighting here be only doing what thousand of englishman will be doing elsewhere very well leigh then will go with jean will certainly be glad to know be together so that if one be wounded ill other can look after bring here will do best can while be away think that will soon be back again that will be constantly seeing jean said may be sure that peasant will not keep field will gather fight win lose will then scatter to home again until church bell call out to repel fresh attack of enemy be real weakness there will never be discipline never common aim if peasant in west must join in great effort march on paris believe that peasantry of department through pas must join must only be national guard of town new levy that must have to meet believe that might take paris crush scum of faubourg hang member of convention will never do will be war of defence only war so carried out must in long run be unsuccessful one however result will be that will never be very far away from home will often return for few day must always keep change of clothes trinket so on packed up so that at hour notice marthe can start with child on receiving note from telling where to join if get news that force from nantes be marching rapidly in direction two horse will always remain in stable in readiness to put into light cart henri will be driver francois must send off to find tell road that have taken however of course will make arrangement later on when affair become more serious think there be chance whatever of enemy making way into country for week perhaps for month to come next morning jean martin leigh started early carried rifle slung behind brace of pistol in holster sword in belt patsey have recovered from depression of previous evening natural good spirit enabled to maintain cheerful face at parting especially a husband assurance that there must be no serious fighting for time have somewhat calmed fear for safety horse be useful to for carrying about leigh jean martin said a rode along unless there be enough mounted men to act a cavalry will have to do fighting have to be done on foot peasant must not follow mounted officer a must one who placed in front of fought a fought hope that later on may manage to get to adopt sort of discipline have great doubt about peasantry of la vendee be independent race be respectful to seigneur be always ready to listen to advice be respect not obedience fancy from what have read of scottish highlander that feeling here closely resembles that among clan regard seigneur a natural head must probably die for in field in other matter go own way chief know better than to strain power beyond certain point a see have already own leader stofflet gamekeeper foret woodcutter cathelineau small peddling wool merchant doubtless many men of rank family will join will naturally from superior knowledge take place a officer doubt whether will displace men who have from beginning taken matter in hand be glad that must be so peasant understand men of own class will believe follow better than must men above in rank will at least have suspicion of strength of insurrection lie in fact that be peasant rising not insurrection stirred up by men of family at ten o'clock arrived at cathelineau camp just a reached spot encountered monsieur sapinaud de la verrie be riding at head of about hundred peasant of whom be armed with musket have early that morning attacked little town of herbiers be defended by two company of soldier with four five cannon republican of town have ranged with blue nevertheless peasant led by commander nephew have fearlessly attacked with loss of only two three defeated enemy captured place obtaining sufficient supply of musket to arm a jean martin be known to monsieur sapinaud saluted other cordially so be coming willingly monsieur martin there have advantage of for good fellow made nephew come with a leader must take refusal however drew into matter few day earlier than have intended for have already made up mind to join movement come willingly enough monsieur sapinaud if have remained in nantes must have be guillotined by time made up mind when left there must on first opportunity do little fighting before be put end to be brother in law have be out here now nearly two year have seen enough of doings of murderer at nantes to hate a much a do street of little village cathelineau have made headquarters be thronged with men through four mounted gentleman made way slowly until when came to church saw three men standing apart from others be cathelineau one standing in middle leigh said have come to place under order monsieur sapinaud said a rode up to named companion be glad indeed to see sir cathelineau said be first gentleman who have joined here though hear that farther south have already declared want badly one of have seen already smiled at leigh told that must hear of young sir see have kept word with be stofflet who a may have heard recaptured cannon blue took at clisson foret who have honour of striking first blow at saint florent name be widely known in part monsieur sapinaud said courteously well sir have come to fight under order have brought hundred men with have already done something on own account for last night captured herbiers be defended by two company with four cannon have gained sufficient number of musket to arm party if offer to give up leadership to monsieur de la verrie cathelineau said gravely be from desire on part to be commander be widely known to peasantry of many parish round pin perhaps because understand better than most have confidence in must think follow rather than gentleman like yourself of whom know little be quite right monsieur sapinaud said peasantry commenced war be right that must choose own leader two companion have already confidence be far better that must be leader believe other gentleman who join will be a ready a be to follow be sure that only rivalry will be a to who will most bravely expose when face enemy thank sir cathelineau said believe earnestly that in many respect be best that peasant must have own leader can associate ourselves with feeling better than gentry must do will have more patience with failing must want to make army of know that can not be done will fight die a bravely a men must do know that will never submit to discipline after battle will want to hurry off to home will obey order to fight be only order one can rely upon obeying be on point of starting for chollet be town where people be devoted to cause of convention at last drawing for militia killed without pretext number of young men who have come unarmed into town many inhabitant of adjoining parish have be seized thrown in prison charged only with being hostile to convention expressing horror at murder of king capture will produce impression throughout country have three four hundred dragoon there yesterday hear called in national guard from village round though scarce believing that must venture to attack reinforcement of hundred men armed with musket will be very welcome one for will hardly suspect that many of have firearm however have before arrival three hundred who have so armed through capture at saint florent chemille now ordered bell to be rung a soon a note pealed out started followed at once by crowd in village without sort of order regularity jean leigh continued to ride with monsieur de la verrie nephew after hour marching at two o'clock in afternoon approached chollet on way received considerable reinforcement from village passed through a soon a approached town saw dragoon pouring out followed by three four hundred national guard vendeans now fell into sort of order short council of war be held be arranged that monsieur de la verrie with hundred musketeer foret with a many more must advance against dragoon while cathelineau stofflet with hundred musketeer main body of peasant with pitchfork must attack national guard illustration at first volley colonel of dragoon many of men fell dragoon have expected that mere sight of must be sufficient to send peasant flying be amazed that must continue to advance a soon a be within easy range peasant opened fire at first volley colonel of dragoon many of men fell reloading peasant advanced at run poured in volley at close quarter then with loud cheer charged dragoon being newly raised troop be seized with panic turned galloped off at full speed astounded at defeat of cavalry in whom have confidently trusted national guard at once lost heart a with loud shout cathelineau with peasant flung upon too broke fled in direction peasant pursued for league then returned exultant to chollet here leading revolutionist be thrown in prison with exception of national guard who attempted resistance after reaching town life be taken large quantity of arm money ammunition fell into hand of victor scarcely have peasant gathered in chollet than news arrived that national guard of saumur be marching against cathelineau requested monsieur de la verrie foret with following to go out to meet marched away at once met enemy at vihiers unprepared for attack national guard at once broke fled throwing away arm abandoning cannon among be one taken from chateau de richelieu have be given by louis thirteenth to cardinal on engraving with be nearly covered peasant thought that must make out image of virgin so called by name with trophy party returned to chollet next day being saturday little army dispersed peasant making way to home in order to spend easter there while cathelineau with only small body remained at chollet from here messenger be sent to monsieur bonchamp d'elbee dommaigne officer who have served in army have retired when revolution broke out cathelineau offered to share command with entreated to give military knowledge experience to cause assented thus force have advantage from time forward of being commanded by men who knew business of war leigh have started for home a soon a national guard of saumur be defeated jean martin at cathelineau request remaining with in order to join other gentleman who have day arrived in calling upon three officer inviting to join cathelineau in command leigh sister ran out a rode up to house news of capture of chollet almost without loss have already spread although surprised felt alarm at seeing leigh alone hear that have taken chollet defeated dragoon national guard yes morning put to flight guard of saumur without loss of single man know what may come to presently just now can hardly be called fighting sight of peasant rushing on seems to strike hero with panic at once be off helter skelter throwing away gun ammunition have come home only to tell news leigh have come home because at present army have evaporated into thin air tomorrow being easter sunday peasant have scattered to home so that be of use staying at chollet cathelineau be there other leader among monsieur de la verrie nephew of jean several other gentleman who have just arrived there be going a sort of deputation tomorrow to bonchamp d'elbee officer whose name forget to ask to join cathelineau in command think that will still remain a leader that will act a councillor in command of column then impression of man be confirmed more than confirmed jean said morning that be born leader of men while round there be excitement confusion be a calm serene a if be alone be evidently man who have read good deal thought good deal can quite understand influence have gained over peasantry in neighbourhood that have long be custom to refer dispute to stofflet be different sort of man be tall powerful in frame stern almost morose in manner have be sixteen year soldier be hear distinguished for bravery foret be active young woodman evidently determined fellow a be first to lead peasant against blue be sure to have following be three very different character of well fitted to act a peasant leader will jean be leader not leader patsey be to say certainly not general doe not want will no doubt lead peasant on estate perhaps in neighbourhood know that must not have church bell rung when started because did not wish tenant to join until have seen result of first fight when come home will summon who like to go with yes have have to explain that over over again yesterday today almost men have be up here to ask why jean did not take told that be one reason be that have started on foot when did must not have arrived in time to take part in fight at chollet conversation begun a leigh dismounted have be continued in house groom having taken horse round to stable so peasant fought well leigh must have fought well if blue have given chance must not stop till came up to if have done so be convinced that peasant must have beaten there be mistaking way rushed forward upon word be not surprised that enemy gave way although well armed not far inferior in number must have have chance with did rush forward leigh be with party attacked cavalry jean fired rifle twice after only saw back of cavalry if have be well drilled troop ought to have scattered like sheep for everything must have gone down before have charged there be sort of order among men be not formed into company there be attempt to direct simply joined leader fancied when word be given charged forward at top of speed be very well against national guard young troop a jean said must be different affair altogether if be to meet trained soldier peasant seem to be quick expect will adopt tactic better suited to country when come to fighting in lane wood see so far very small proportion have be armed with gun only chance be to rush at once to close quarter have captured so many musket at chollet vihiers that in future considerable proportion of peasant will have gun when once learn to use hedge will be just a good a trained troop then suppose jean be more hopeful about future than be say that patsey think that will make hard fight of that end must depend upon whether people in paris rather than keep fifty thousand men engaged in desperate conflict here when be badly wanted on frontier decide to suspend conscription in la vendee to leave to ourselves there can be doubt that must be best plan a care nothing for human life even if cost hundred thousand men to crush be likely to raise number of troop send against rather than allow authority to be set at defiance do know patsey when used to read about guy fawkes wanting to blow up house of parliament thought that must be villain indeed to try to destroy so many life have changed opinion now for if have chance must certainly blow up place where convention meet destroy soul within wall including spectator who fill gallery howl for blood well see leigh a guy fawkes other conspirator failed in attempt be afraid there be very small chance of being able to carry out plan more successfully be afraid there be not leigh said regretfully must never be able to dig way into vault certainly must not be able to get enough powder to blow big building up if must be only saying that if guy fawkes hated parliament a much a hate convention there be excuse to be made for now patsey be a hungry a hunter have good supper ready for said thought be quite possible that jean must come home evening for felt sure that most of peasant must be coming back if possible for easter sunday have doubt that if did come must both be hungry have news from other district asked after have finished supper there be report captain charette have gathered nearly twenty thousand peasant in lower poitou that have already gained success over blue there be report too of rising in brittany there be doubt that thing be going on well at present patsey see be fighting on own ground fifty thousand men can be called to arm in course of few hour by ringing of church bell have baggage waggon train of provision be ready to fight at once on other hand blue have be taken completely by surprise have large force nearer than frontier at rate nearer than paris will be week before can gather army such a even must see will be required for conquest of la vendee up to time can be only war of skirmish unless leader can persuade peasant to march against paris that fear will never be able to do when enemy be really ready fighting will be desperate 't be true that vendeans have good cause fight for religion freedom while enemy will fight only because be ordered to do so there be thing victory win will give more arm ammunition cannon while defeat will mean simply that peasant will scatter to home be ready to answer next call for service on other hand if blue be defeated will lose so heavily in arm store will suffer such loss of life from ignorance of road lane that will be long time before will again be able to advance against next morning after service at church be over peasant came down in number to chateau to hear from leigh full account of fighting at chollet vihiers report of latter event having arrived that morning there be exclamation of lively pleasure at recital mingled with regret that have not borne share in fighting will have plenty of opportunity leigh said monsieur martin have told that when next leaf home who be willing to do so can go with may be little time before anything of importance take place a at present what fighting there be be considerable distance away think best that must reserve yourselves for great occasion unless indeed blue endeavour to penetrate bocage when have doubt will know how to deal with when be entangled in lane wood will go man of one of peasant shouted cry be re echoed with enthusiasm by whole of men be nearly hour before leigh sister be able to withdraw from crowd make way homeward be difficult to believe that men so ready eager to fight can be beaten said did notice too that wife looked on approvingly believe that even if of men wished to stay away must be hounded to front by woman think that with must be regarded a war for religion while with men be conscription have chiefly driven to take up arm chapter cathelineau scout for day nothing happened insurrection spread like wildfire in poitou anjou everywhere peasant be successful authority soldier gendarme for most part flying without waiting for attack news that la vendee be in insurrection astonished infuriated convention at once took step to suppress on second of april military commission be appointed with power to execute peasant taken with arm in hand who must be denounced a suspicious person general berruyer be sent down to take command large army have be raised principally from mob of paris for defence of city marched down berruyer at head of force entered bocage on tenth of april time have passed quietly at chateau peasant have dispersed at once except that principal leader small body of men remained together watching course of event be a quiet a if profound peace reigned jean martin have returned home two day after arriving have called tenant on estate together have endeavoured to rouse to necessity of acquiring certain amount of discipline have brought with waggon load of musket ammunition have be discovered at chollet after main bulk of peasant have departed cathelineau have allowed to carry off in order that peasantry in neighbourhood of chateau must be provided with proportion of gun when day of action arrived peasant gladly received firearm must not be persuaded to endeavour to fight in sort of order did not do at chollet elsewhere exclaimed yet beat blue easily what good did discipline do to enemy none why then must bother about when enemy come will rush upon when be tangled in thicket leigh be somewhat more successful fact that have fought at chollet be seigneur brother in law have established position for in eye of peasant of own age a went from house to house talking with succeeded in getting twenty boy to agree to follow have be nominated officer by three general who have picked out without reference to rank age who thought must either from position energy determination fill post well thus one company be commanded by noble next by peasant must on day of battle fight equally well leigh argument be such a be suited to lad addressed see if go with band of men will be lost in crowd men will rush forward in front will be in rear want to serve country well can serve much better by watching movement of enemy carrying word of to commander then sometimes can have little enterprise of own cut off post of enemy manage to decoy into lane where know gun will stick fast be not size strength be most necessary in war quickness alertness watchfulness know that already leader have found that nothing can persuade men to keep guard to carry out outpost duty if do even if hing else will be serving cause much better than if be to join in general rush upon enemy will have musket with one of boy objected must want must have to move about quickly gun must be terribly inconvenient if have to push way through hedge close thicket besides if have gun must not be of much use to for none of be accustomed to use need great deal of training to learn to shoot straight be quite sure that if be to march with twenty of to cathelineau headquarters be to say to have come here sir to act a scout for to bring in news of movement of enemy to do anything in power to prevent from being surprised ' must be more pleased than if have brought hundred men armed with musket when twenty have expressed willingness to go leigh asked jean who have warmly entered into plan to speak to father of lad get to consent to going with accordingly called together for purpose do mean that will be away altogether master yes while go on will lose labour in field there will not be much labour in field till be over by having scout watching enemy will get early news of coming have time to drive off beast before arrive how will live when be in neighbourhood one two can come back fetch bread if be too far off for brother will buy bread for in case where can not well be spared will remit portion of due a long a be away will not be for long for can see that ere many week be past blue will be swarming round in such number that there will be little time for work on land will have to make great sacrifice must remember that le there be in barn more difficult will be for enemy to invade for if can find nothing here will have to bring everything with waggon will add to difficulty brother tell that one of thing mean to do be to break up road when find out by line blue be advancing for purpose will serve out from store pick axe to of band at last difficulty be got over twenty lad be enrolled three week passed peasant of poitou anjou thought little of storm be

insurrection take terrible vengeance for what have passed when storm must burst none knew jean one day said to leigh that be certain that must come soon that if be still resolved to carry out plan be time that set out be quite ready to carry out plan jean a know danger seem to threaten from so many quarter like going away from home while company be scattered near chollet for instance blue may be burning down chateau think there be much danger of leigh be quite certain that a soon a division begin to move will have hand full may hope that in case will be defeated in others may drive off peasant march to town that intend to occupy will only hold ground stand upon will not be able to send out detached party to attack chateau destroy village for present have fear whatever of coming here be well away from of road that be likely to march by say that of road be good will assuredly keep on principal line not venture to entangle in country lane there be village of size within mile of be one of most thickly wooded part of bocage a know mean thicket therefore will when time come leave sister without uneasiness may be quite sure that if contrary to anticipation column must try to make way through neighbourhood must be hotly opposed will have ample time to take to wood where child will find shelter in of forester cottage be going to have peasant dress made for marthe will of course drive a intended two men will take horse vehicle to place in wood at considerable distance from here keep there until join carry out original plan of making for coast directly be gone will make business to find out most out of way spot among wood ride over make arrangement with woodman with wife family living there to receive if necessary will let know spot fixed on give direction how to find in order to add to leigh influence authority martin persuaded village cure who be man of much intelligence perceived that real good might be done by party of lad to have farewell service in church accordingly on morning on be to start attended church be filled by friend here addressed boy telling that service in be about to engage be one must be of great importance to country that must demand energy strength then asked to take oath to carry out order might receive from leader seigneur brother who must share in work many hardship might have to undergo here said be gentleman who be by birth foreigner who have come to love land that sister adopted a own to hate enemy godless murderer of woman child executioner of king enemy of church so much that be ready to leave home comfort to risk life in cause remember that have voluntarily joined accepted a leader work once begun there must be drawing back there be not man in la vendee who be not prepared to give life if need be to cause in way can do a much more then administered oath to lad a have be arranged leigh also took oath to care for in respect to share risk danger then cure pronounced blessing upon service ended very greatly impressed with what have taken place little band marched out from church surrounded by friend jean martin then presented hatchet light pick to waist belt in tool must be carried a rule peasant carried leathern belt over shoulder in sword hatchet other weapon be slung jean thought waist belt must be much more convenient for getting rapidly through hedge thicket have also advantage that long knife constituting in formidable weapon must also be carried in patsey presented with hat of supply have be obtained from saint florent be of kind ordinarily worn by peasant in shape like modern broad brimmed wide awake made of much stiffer material have bought to give certain uniformity to band of whom already wore hat of kind others long knitted stocking cap while others again be bare headed added piece of green ribbon round hat leigh objected to on ground that might sometimes have to enter town that badge of sort must be speedily noticed a said must only have to take off when engaged in such service quarter of hour after leaving church marched away amid acclamation of friend boy feeling sensation of pride in work that have undertaken in ceremony of have be centre now lad leigh said a soon a be fairly away from village instead of walking along a loose body have better form four abreast endeavour to keep step be more difficult to walk way than in clump indeed by keeping step make walking easy have advantage that can act much more quickly if heard enemy approaching gave order go to right ten go to left must not know be to go now four of will form section order into fall now will always observe then if say 'first two section to right other three section to left one of know what to do instead of having to wait until mention name be nearly drill will have to learn can choose place now afterwards will have to keep to so of who be brother special friend will naturally fall in next to other in minute two arrangement be made party proceeded four abreast with leigh marching at head for first hour so have difficulty in getting to keep step presently fell into time being kept by breaking into one of canticle of church after long day march arrived at village cathelineau now occupied a headquarters a have be necessary in view of threatening circle of various column of enemy to remove headquarters from chollet to central point from must advance at once against whichever of column might first move forward into heart of country lad straightened up a marched through street unwonted spectacle of twenty peasant lad marching in order exciting considerable surprise cathelineau be standing at door of house occupied conversing with monsieur bonchamp d'elbee ah monsieur stansfield said be a leigh halted party raised hat be most military looking party have yet seen be young none worse for there be nothing military about except that march four abreast said with smile for work have come to do drill will not be necessary have raised band on jean martin estate sir with permission propose to call be scout seemed to brother that sorely need scout to inform of movement of enemy road by be approaching force order have therefore raised little body of lad of own age will remain with permanently a long a occasion need will go on special mission with may charge will at other time watch road by enemy must be likely to advance if will do monsieur stansfield will be valuable indeed be just what can not get peasant to do when come to fighting will obey order at other time regard a own master entreaty offer of pay suffices to persuade to undertake such work a be proposing to carry out consequently be only by chance that obtain news of enemy movement wish have fifty such party must be valuable indeed monsieur d'elbee said obstinacy of peasantry be maddening how do propose to feed men when be within reach of home two will go back to fetch bread for whole when be too far away will buy in one of village when be within reach of headquarters wherever may be have only to send in will have loaf served out to same a band who remain here be not short of money thanks to capture have made see that none of band have firearm sir jean martin must have let have of musket brought from here seemed to that must be encumbrance may have to trust to swiftness of foot to escape at rate will want to carry message to a quickly a possible weight of gun ammunition must make good deal of difference must moreover be in way in getting through wood hedge for that ought to have defence cathelineau said if came upon patrol of cavalry though only three four in number must be in bad case with only knife to defend yourselves do know whether there be pistol in storehouse monsieur bonchamp there be be picked up from cavalryman killed have not be given out yet then think have better serve out pistol with score of cartridge to of lad if let fire three four round at trunk of tree mark of sort monsieur stansfield will get to know something about use of weapon thank sir must be excellent must certainly enable to face small party of enemy if happen to encounter please form boy up two deep cathelineau said will say word two to manoeuvre be not executed in military style boy be presently arranged in order congratulate lad cathelineau went on in having devoted yourselves to country that in direction will be most useful trust that will strictly obey order of commander will remember that will be of far more use in carrying out than in merely helping to swell number in pitched battle have confidence in monsieur stansfield have set noble example to youth of country in thus undertaking arduous fatiguing work be not without danger be glad to see that marched in here in order hope that will go little further learn to form line quickly to gather at call thing may seem to to make very little difference in fact will make great deal saw that be at least couple of minute forming in line just now supposing enemy cavalry have be charging down upon that two minute lost must have made difference between receiving in order being in helpless confusion when came up have doubt that one of general here have among follower someone who served in army who will teach within course of hour if pay attention to instruction how to form into line back again into four will give hour monsieur bonchamp said have nothing particular to do must be glad to instruct young fellow who be so willing well disposed be too tired to drill now have have long march general negative be reply well then march to open space just outside town will begin at once feeling very proud of honour of being drilled by general boy fell into formation followed monsieur bonchamp leigh be at loss at first to comprehend instruction given by end of hour have fairly mastered very simple movement will do monsieur bonchamp said of course be not perfect yet with quarter of hour drill by commander day at end of week will be able to do quickly neatly will certainly find great advantage if come upon enemy large empty room be allotted to a sat down on floor munched bread that have brought with felt quite enthusiastic over work be high honour indeed to have be praised by monsieur cathelineau be taught by one of general even felt advantage that drill have given contrasting quickness with have finally formed into line with trouble in arranging before monsieur cathelineau fact too that be next morning to be furnished with pistol be great gratification to over over again said to other will people at home say when hear that monsieur cathelineau have praised that monsieur bonchamp have drilled that be to be provided with pistol in morning pistol ammunition be served out leigh have during previous evening seen cathelineau asked for order can not say exactly line blue be likely to take must say that have better make chemille headquarters berruyer who be new commander have arrived at saint lambert there be strong force at thouars being portion of army from saint lambert enemy be also in force at vihiers at parthenay be from force at thouars vihiers that danger be most likely to come doubtless other column will come from north will hear of having crossed loire in time to oppose with so small band a yours will be amply employed in watching thouars there be many road more le bad by may march a soon a ascertain that be moving by route will send messenger to others of band that may have with send off to village round give warning set bell ringing promise aid will soon arrive urge to harass enemy to fell tree across road to impede advance in possible way will give dozen paper for use of messenger saying that be acting under order be charged with raising country directly enemy advance above be important must get earliest possible information a to route by be moving a will take thirty six hour before can gather in anything like full strength will be useful that must spread false news a to whereabouts boy can say in one village that be marching towards tour in that be massed in neighbourhood of saint florent in third that hear that order be that able bodied men be to go west to oppose force coming from nantes have already taken clisson carried monsieur de lescure family prisoner to bressuire will have to tell villager sir that wish news to be given to blue if must come there if questioned must tell something else be sure that even woman must suffer to be killed rather than give news that thought must be useful to enemy be right yes must tell that be what want blue to believe that be wish that be answer to be given to of who may enter village only thing sir be that may find village empty a come along woman child will doubt take to wood men will perhaps offer resistance when find how strong blue be will probably hurry to join there will probably be few old people remaining in village however must trust much to chance great thing be for to let know a soon a main body be in motion whichever way come must meet attack be in wood lane that must defend will endeavour to carry out order sir will start tomorrow morning a soon a get pistol a soon a little band be well away from town pistol be loaded of lad in turn fired three shot at trunk of tree at distance of ten yard under leigh direction shooting be quite a good a have expected boy be well satisfied then pistol being reloaded placed in belt resumed march halted at tiny hamlet consisting of dozen house four mile from thouars inhabitant be greatly surprised at appearance old man who be head of little community came out asked leigh who be be cathelineau scout replied have order to watch movement of enemy wish to be of trouble if there be empty shed must be glad of still more so if there be truss two of straw can have old man said if cathelineau order have be that be to turn out of house for must have done so willingly shed will do excellently for will be here little half number will always be away if can supply with bread will pay for if can not do so will have to send two of party away day to fetch bread from cathelineau camp will see what can be done will not be for long may possibly be only two three day may be week then think that can manage if have not flour enough here to spare can take horse fetch half sackful from other village thank very much however think that will only occasionally want bread for will be sending messenger day to monsieur cathelineau can always bring bread back with old man led to building have served a stable be then untenanted will get straw taken in presently lad a for sir will be glad if will be guest thank leigh said prefer to be with follower come by persuasion wish to share lot in thing besides being with will keep up spirit there be hour drill then leigh led party to shed to four five bundle of straw have by time be brought now said before do anything else must choose two sub officer at time may divide into two party therefore be necessary that one must be responsible to for what be done in absence will leave to to choose remember be not size strength be of most importance be quickness intelligence know comrade better than do will be quite content to abide by choice will go outside for quarter of hour while talk over want to influence at in ten minute two of lad came out have chosen andre favras pierre landrin think that have done very wisely leigh said be two whom must have selected have indeed noticed a two most intelligent of party have be first recruit be in small degree owing to influence that others have joined returned to shed approve of choice lad said doubt andre pierre will make very good sub officer when be not present must obey order a readily a do mine will be able to trust to carry out direction implicitly now will divide in two party first two section two of third section will form one party will be under andre command when acting in two party other two of third section fourth fifth will form second division under pierre will take in turn to be on duty will not need to watch by night for there be chance of enemy venturing to enter lane thicket after dark party not out on scouting duty will remain here will furnish messenger to carry news to cathelineau to fetch bread to perform other duty next morning leigh set out with whole band except two have gathered from people of village position of various road lane by troop going westward from thouars must be likely to travel when within two mile of town placed two boy on of road be not to show be to lie behind hedge if saw body of troop coming along be at once to bring news to own point being on principal road andre pierre be to leave arm belt behind to make long detour to enter town from other side be to saunter about place listen to what be being said gather a much news a possible be provided with two franc if questioned be to say that have come in from village near to buy axe must have gone in andre although can get on fairly enough in patois can not speak well enough to pas a native however be not likely to be questioned in town crowded with troop two lad can move about without attracting smallest attention from military must be only civilian authority that must have to fear will be so much occupied in attending to want of soldier that will not have time on hand for asking question be sure before enter town that find out name of village three four mile on other side so a to have answer ready if be asked where come from be probable that will find troop quartered in village beyond town must hardly accommodate so large number a be there remember must try to look absolutely unconcerned a go through a walk about street of town great object be to find out how many men there be in around thouars whether be looking for more troop to join from saumur when be expecting to move forward a soon a have left repeated to six lad who remained with order that have given to posted on other road be to remain in hiding said whatever force may be be likely enough that patrol of four five men may come along to see that road be clear that there be sign of body being gathered to oppose advance be quite true that might shoot down overpower such patrol must not attempt to do so if one of escaped must carry news to thouars that road be beset must put on guard doubtless imagine that with force a have gathered will march through la vendee without opposition must adopt such precaution at to render far more difficult than otherwise must be to check advance when begin in earnest be here only to watch will have opportunity for fighting later on be good spot for watching for have thick wood behind plenty of undergrowth along edge by road where can hide so closely that there will not be slightest chance of being discovered if do keep absolutely quiet three four time during day indeed cavalry party passed along road did not appear to have fear of attack laughed jested at work have come to do scoffed at idea of peasant venturing to oppose such force a have gathered against discussed chance of booty one party of four men old sergeant pulled up dismounted close to spot where lad where hidden be very well comrade leader said for part must rather be on frontier fighting austrian be work for soldier here be to fight frenchman like poor chap who have done harm except that stick to clergy object to be dragged away from home be politician care snap for doings of assembly in paris be soldier have learned to obey order be like job have in hand mind be bound to be good deal harder than most of expect be true that say there be twenty thousand troop round province what sort of troop there be not five thousand soldier among others be national guard newly raised levy blackguard from slum of paris of national guard must say half must desert if only have chance new levy ca be counted on chapter checking enemy see leigh said when patrol have ridden on real soldier like work be called upon to do have belief in national guard in new levy will make difference in own fighting when know that can not rely upon of troop working with have doubt that what say of national guard be true have have to come out because be summoned can have interest in war against doubtless many of hate government in paris just a much a do must give great deal to be back again with home family be just a hard for to be obliged to fight a be for to be obliged to fight be late in afternoon before andre pierre returned by time did so various cavalry patrol have gone back to thouars from time to time boy have come in from other road one two patrol only have gone out by of lane on be posted be evident that main road be considered of most importance be probable that greater portion of enemy force must move by well what be news leigh asked a two lieutenant came down from wood behind hope have gone well with yes captain andre replied have have difficulty troop in village on other side of town did not even glance at a went through supposing doubt that belonged to place thouars be crowded with soldier heard that two thousand more be to arrive from saumur evening heard one of officer say that order be expected for forward movement tomorrow that other column be to move at same time three of be to meet at chemille be enough for present andre have done very well to pick up so much news a will be off at once messenger be at once sent off to order in other party a soon a joined returned to village where passed night on arriving there leigh wrote report of news that have gathered sent off one of band who have remained day in village to cathelineau other to monsieur d'elbee at chollet next day watch passed like first two three officer however trotted along main road with squadron of cavalry rode to within few mile of chemille then returned to thouars next morning leigh band be out before daybreak making way to within short distance of thouars heard drum beating trumpet sounding there be doubt that force there be getting into motion band at once dispersed carrying news not only to village along road warning woman child to take to wood men to prepare for passage of enemy to village within two three mile of road ordering church bell to be sounded to call peasant to arm while two lad started to carry news to cathelineau d'elbee when once bell of church near road be set ringing be speedily echoed by of village beyond until entire district knew that enemy be advancing on way from chemille leigh have kept sharp lookout for point where enemy might be checked have fixed upon one about halfway between two town stream four foot in depth passed under bridge where road dipped into hollow beyond ground rose steeply be covered with thick wood of very considerable extent a soon a reached point set band to work to destroy bridge a group of peasant came flocking along saw what be intended at once joined in work a soon at be done leigh led to spot where forest began thirty yard up hill set to fell tree be work to be accustomed a many of carried ax tree nearest to road be felled to fall across while on side facing stream be cut so a to fall down slope so form abattis before work be finished to distance of two three hundred yard on side of road several hundred peasant have come up of about third be armed with musket seeing advantage of position that in case be forced forest offered mean of retreat prepared for desperate resistance men with firearm be placed in front rank with pitchfork other rural weapon be to keep at work till last moment cutting underwood filling interstice between bough of fallen tree so a to make extremely difficult to force be ordered to withdraw when fight began to distance of two three hundred yard then to lie down in inequality of ground so a to be safe from cannon shot only when defender of abattis be forced back be to prepare to charge young fellow with cow horn took place by leigh side when blew horn front rank be to run back reserve to come forward to meet then be to rush down again upon assailant who have passed abattis to hurl into stream peasant recognized advantage of arrangement who have come first have found leigh in command by readiness with be obeyed by own follower saw at once that be in authority a others came up showed cathelineau circular recognized order informed later arrival that young officer who be giving order be specially empowered by cathelineau to take command leigh be a promptly obeyed a if have be favourite leader saw too that knew exactly what wanted done gave order with firmness decision confidence in became profound be three hour after arrived at river when party of horse came down opposite slope leigh have ordered that not shot be to be fired until gave signal waited until enemy came to severed bridge when halted suddenly a did so gave word from long line of greenery fifty musket flashed out more than troop of horse fell rest turning tail galloped up hill again while shout of derision rose from peasant illustration scattered fire broke out from defender hour passed then head of column be seen descending road opened out a came forming into thick line of skirmisher two hundred yard wide moving along leigh spread musketeer to similar length of front at first enemy be half hidden by wood at other side of slope a issued from twenty yard from stream scattered fire broke out from defender blue replied with general discharge at invisible foe be crouching behind stump trunk of felled tree fire be ineffectual leigh own band be lying in little hollow twenty yard behind abattis pistol must have be useless until enemy won way up to tree until then be to remain a first reserve exposed a be to steady fire of peasant assailant suffered heavily at edge of stream paused irresolutely be fifteen yard wide be ignorant of depth hesitated to enter urged however by shout of officer who set example by at once entering stream by seeing that water did not rise above shoulder men followed a gained opposite bank fell fast at so short distance shot of peasant told be time before sufficient number have crossed to make assault against wall of foliage in front fresh troop be constantly arriving from behind encouraged by at last rushed forward a did so leigh called up own band crawling forward through tangle a far a must opened fire on enemy a strove to push way through obstacle for quarter of hour fight went on then assailant having with great loss succeeded in passing over pulling aside brushwood began to pour through moment did so leigh horn sounded at once defender rushed up hill pursued by blue with exulting shout few shot be fired for assailant have emptied musket before striving to pas through obstacle leigh men have run hundred yard into wood when met main body of peasant rushing down at full speed turning at once party joined fell upon advancing enemy taken wholly by surprise when believed that victory be won two three hundred men who have passed abattis be swept before crowd of peasant like chaff latter pressing close upon heel followed through gap have be made panic of fugitive spread at once to who have crossed river be clustered round opening jostling in eagerness to get through join a believed in slaughter of who have caused such heavy loss fled together peasant be at heel making deadly use of pitchfork ax knife drove survivor headlong into river horn again sounded in accordance with strict order that have received ran back again to shelter few dropping from scattered fire that troop on other side of stream opened against a soon a fugitive have cleared away from front scarcely have peasant gained shelter when six piece of cannon have be placed on opposite slope while fight be going on opened against leigh at once ordered main body back to former position scattering hundred men with gun along whole line of abattis whence again opened fire on troop on opposite side of river replied with volley of musketry defender stationed a be five six yard apart sheltering behind tree suffered little from artillery musketry fire while men dropped fast in rank of blue cannon be principally directed against tree blocking road gradually be torn to piece after hour firing be so far destroyed that passage through be comparatively easy then enemy again began to cross stream a soon a commenced to do so leigh called up men with musket from flank sent word to main body to descend hill again a cannonade must cease a soon a attack began three time assault be made repulsed peasant fighting with fury that blue already disheartened with heavy loss must not withstand a fell back for third time leigh thought enough have be done ordered peasant at once to make through wood to proceed by lane byway to join cathelineau who doubted not must by time have gathered considerable force at chemille by time that blue be ready to advance again time in overwhelming force peasant be well away wounded a fast a fell have be carried off to distant village when enemy advanced found to surprise that foe have disappeared that only thirty dead body remained on scene of battle own loss have exceeded three hundred large proportion of whom be regular soldier national guard new levy be profoundly depressed at result of action if said to what must have be comparatively small number of peasant have caused loss what will be when meet cathelineau main body there be thought of pursuit regiment be thrown out in skirmishing order advanced through wood rest following in column along road general berruyer have joined general menou evening before with force from saumur a moved forward two general rode together be much more serious business than have expected berruyer said certainly imagined that with such force a have gathered round la vendee campaign must be little more than military promenade see however be entirely mistaken men have today shown capable of taking advantage of wild character of country a to courage there can be question whatever if be fair sample of resistance that have to expect throughout whole country will need at least fifty thousand men to subdue fully that menou said shortly there be doubt that blame national guard who be so easily routed by peasant on tenth of march more severely than deserve rode forward to encourage men at last attack never saw soldier fight with such fury a did peasant threw on troop like tiger in many case wresting arm from braining with own musket even best soldier seemed cowed by fierceness with be attacked a for men of new levy be worse than useless effort to force way to rear blocked way of reinforcement who be trying though must own not very vigorously to get to front peasant be well led too acting on excellent plan of defence must have be sheltered altogether from fire for among dead did not see one who have be killed by cannonball country must posse hundred of point equally well adapted for defence if be a well obstinately held a have be will take even more than fifty thousand men to suppress insurrection convention be going to work wrong way berruyer said commissioner have order to hang peasant found in arm suspect be to say virtually one in la vendee must have be infinitely better for to have issued general amnesty to acknowledge that have made mistake that cure of poitou brittany must be excepted from general law allowed to continue work in respective parish without interruption that for year at least part of france must be exempt from conscription why if campaign go on far larger force will be employed here than number of troop district be called upon to contribute to say nothing of enormous expense loss of men be hideous business altogether to mind must give posse to be recalled sent to fight on frontier two hour after fight leigh with band of whom none have be killed although several have received wound more le serious arrived at chemille have be preceded by many of peasant who have already carried news of fight that column from thouars have be delayed for three hour have suffered very heavy loss be owing monsieur cathelineau head of one of peasant band said to officer sent to command be splendid be to that everything be due be cutting down bridge when came up be by order that felled tree blocked road made sort of hedge took so long to get through must have be greatly damaged by fire of gun musket kept lying down out of reach till be wanted while men with gun defended line of fallen tree when be wanted called up by blowing cow horn then drove blue back into stream returned to shelter until be wanted again did not lose more than thirty men altogether while more than ten time that number of blue have fallen thought at first that have chosen rather strange leader for a always be right for if have be there thing must not have gone better sent one a commander cathelineau said in surprise have paper that read out saying that be acting on order a can not read can not say that be written down a read if did not send god must have done so be strange bonchamp cathelineau said to officer for certainly did not send anyone never thought of defending passage of stream however whoever be who have commanded have done great service for three hour have be gained will make difference can not arrive now until after dark will not attack before morning by time force will have doubled here come officer monsieur peasant exclaimed a leigh with party came down street loudly cheered by peasant who have fought under why be jean martin young brother in law monsieur bonchamp exclaimed raising voice called to jean who be talking to group of other officer near jean ran up monsieur martin be young englishman who have held berruyer in check for three hour see how peasant be cheering cathelineau advanced to meet leigh who halted band saluted general latter stepped forward returned salute by lifting hat monsieur stansfield said salute a saviour of position here have berruyer arrived afternoon must have retired for be not yet in sufficient force to withstand attack tomorrow will hope be strong enough to beat have be wondering who officer must be who with three four hundred men held principal force of foe led by commander in chief in check for three hour a hear killed three hundred of best troop with loss of thirty of ours ought to have thought of when said that read order saying that be acting in name be great presumption on part general leigh said know that have right to use for purpose felt how important be that must have time to prepare for defence thought duty a there be one else to take matter in hand to do so have done magnificently sir thanks of la vendee be due to see that several of lad be wounded for five of wore bandage sixth be carried on rough litter by four of companion lad said salute have done well indeed there be not boy of age in la vendee will envy when hears how under brave young commander have today played chief part in checking advance of army of five thousand men will publish order today saying that scout have rendered inestimable service to country well leigh jean martin said after little band have fallen out one of surgeon have taken charge of wounded have indeed distinguished certainly did not think when persuaded sister to let go that be going to match against french general to command force must inflict heavy check upon cathelineau have asked to bring round to quarter presently so that can give full detail of affair saying that plan have succeeded so well might be tried again with equal effect can not stay with now for be going with bonchamp to see to work of loopholing fortifying church be going to look after boy jean have have nothing to eat morning except mouthful two of bread have be up since two hour before daylight do feel sure that blue will not attack tonight yes think so after lesson have given berruyer of fighting quality of peasant be pretty certain that will not venture to attack after hard day march fight must have sorely discouraged men that evening news came in from several quarter leigonyer have marched from vihiers by three road directing course towards coron two of column have be attacked by peasant being largely composed of new levy have at once lost heart retreated central column in be regular troop being obliged in consequence also to fall back column have crossed loire taken saint florent without very heavy fighting quetineau have advanced from bressuire to aubiers without meeting with resistance news be on whole satisfactory have be feared that force at vihiers must march north join that of berruyer that must make joint attack upon town disaster have befallen rendered no longer possible there be disappointment that saint florent have be recaptured none quetineau have advanced without opposition to aubiers for whole of peasantry from locality be with cathelineau in point of fact berruyer have not ordered force at vihiers to march to join on contrary have intended after capturing chemille expected to do without serious trouble to march south effect junction with leigonyer at coron halted four mile from chemille harangued new levy reproaching who have shown cowardice during day fighting exhorting to behave with courage on following day inconsiderable portion of belonged to force have marched down from paris hero of slum who have be foremost in massacre in prison in demand for blood of hostile to behaved throughout with abject cowardice whenever met foe with arm in hand after having have interview with cathelineau relating to full particular of fight leigh having nothing to do strolled about town presently came upon group of three four peasant who have be drinking more than be good for one of whose bearing appearance showed that have served in army be talking noisily to others will see that jacques bruno artilleryman will be great man yet said will soon be rich have have enough poverty since left army will have plenty of gold yet will see what will see how can be rich one of others said with air of drunken wisdom be lazy jacques bruno know be too fond of wine cup be seldom that do day work never mind how will get rich tell that will be so word of jacques bruno be not to be doubted turned away saying will go for few hour sleep now to be in readiness for tomorrow who be that man leigh asked sharply going up to others scarf that wore showed to be officer peasant removed hat be jacques bruno monsieur be in charge of gun be old artilleryman cathelineau have appointed to post a need artilleryman to load point gun leigh moved away fellow be half drunk not too drunk to know what be saying what did mean by declaring that must soon be rich peasant have said that be lazy fond of wine cup must hardly be likely to acquire wealth by honest labour perhaps might be intending act of treachery putting aside other consideration a old soldier must scarcely care to mow down former comrade sympathy must be rather with army than with peasant have personal interest in revolt against conscription be likely that cause of cure concerned greatly might however meditate act of treachery by must benefit former comrade gain rich reward at rate must be

comrade country chapter assault of chemille few word be spoken a group of officer returned to town when reached cathelineau quarter leigh must have gone on general said come in if please monsieur stansfield followed party in have be trial gentleman heavy trial general said when entered upon work knew that that there be many thing must have to endure knew trouble of forming soldier from men who like ours prize freedom independence above other thing that might have to suffer defeat that must meet with hardship probably death that in long run effort might be futile have not reckoned on having to deal with treachery have never dreamed that one of first act must have be to try to sentence vendean to death for act of grossest treachery however let put aside be perhaps in nature of thing in community there must be few scoundrel if turn out to be solitary instance may congratulate ourselves especially a have escaped without injury that have done so gentleman be due solely to monsieur stansfield who thus twice in course of single day have performed inestimable service to cause there be few indeed who on hearing braggadocio of drunken man must have given matter moment thought still le have undertaken night of watchfulness after day of heaviest work merely to test truth of slightly founded suspicion might have occurred to be not too much to say have not act of treachery be discovered defeat tomorrow must have be well nigh certain know how much people think of gun if when fight began cannon have be silent instead of pouring content into rank of enemy must have lost heart at once must have be beaten almost before fight began have honour to bestow on monsieur stansfield in name of la vendee thank with heart will add to order respecting fight of yesterday statement of what have taken place tonight will beg that officer read aloud to party follow agree most cordially with general word monsieur bonchamp said defence yesterday must have be credit to military man discovery have saved from ruin tomorrow rather today will venture to say that not one man in five hundred must have taken trouble to go out of way to ascertain whether word of drunken man rested on foundation there be then short conversation a to approaching fight number of men who have arrived be much smaller than have be anticipated owing to fact that simultaneous invasion at so many point have effect of retaining peasant of various locality for defence of own home leigh learned that mounted messenger have be despatched shortly before brought prisoner down to beg monsieur d'elbee to bring force commanded at chollet with speed to aid in defence of chemille for if town fell must be exposed to attack of united force of general berruyer leigonyer now gentleman think have better get few hour sleep cathelineau said will not be here very early probably not until noon for may wait for time before starting in hope of being joined either by leigonyer one of other column be not likely that news of sharp reverse leigonyer have met with have reached be now two o'clock in morning leigh slept heavily till roused at eight must have called before andre said reproachfully when learnt how late be thought be better that must have good sleep captain of course if there have be message to say that be wanted must have woke a one came there be still news of enemy thought that be better to let sleep till now pierre have started with party at five to scout on road by enemy be advancing leigh first hurried down to river have bath then felt ready for work that might have to do then went to house where jean be lodged latter who have not returned from outpost work till day broke be just getting up well leigh said called in at cathelineau quarter to report found already up told work that have be doing praised up to sky seems to that be getting credit of campaign really feel quite proud of will be having starting a rival leader to cathelineau leigh laughed one doe not often have two such opportunity in course of day suppose be likely to have such luck again if war go on for year where be going to be today be going to act a aide de camp to bonchamp what will do do think well must say have best keep out of altogether leigh band did much more than share of fighting yesterday pistol will be of use in fight such a will be seriously unless cathelineau assigns post must keep out of little corp be specially formed to act a scout a be so extremely badly off in respect will be far better for to keep to proper duty than to risk life how do think fight be likely to go jean depends in first place upon how blue fight if do well ought to beat in next place depends on whether d'elbee come up in time if doe think that will hold place will be stiff fighting be not until noon that berruyer force be seen approaching a soon a be in sight vendeans poured out took up station by hill on gun be placed in spite of what jean have said leigh must have placed band with rest have not cathelineau sent for hour before given order be almost identical with advice of jean wish band to keep out of battle monsieur stansfield force be so small that can make possible difference in fortune of day whether win lose lad may be wanted a messenger after be over have done extremely well at present need further credit than have gained beg therefore will take post with somewhat in rear of village away on right will then know where to find if have message to send moreover want at once to send off one of most active lad with note to d'elbee urging to come on at full speed for fight be likely to go hard with unless come in time to assistance telling wish to know that even if have to fall back church will be held till last that a soon a arrives will if possible again take offensive beg that will attack enemy in flank in rear a see opportunity upon belfry of church mile on right will be able to see how battle go can send off news to d'elbee from time to time very well sir will despatch letter at once then march out to church noticed yesterday here be telescope cathelineau said be well provided with a took that must find at chollet vihiers think that with aid will be able to have good view of what be going on in twenty minute leigh have taken up post in belfry of village church that cathelineau have indicated andre pierre whose party have returned hour before be with rest of band be in story below from view be also obtainable three most severely wounded have started for home early that morning others be fit for duty fight began by discharge of gun of assailant leigh must see that defender gun have be somewhat withdrawn from position on top of rising ground where must have be too much exposed to enemy fire muzzle now only showed over brow during course of morning earthwork have be thrown up to afford protection to men serving did not return fire until enemy be within distance of quarter of mile then commenced with deadly effect blue halted leigh must make out that considerable number of men in rear at once turned ran in order to encourage have be informed just before marched of plot have be arranged to silence gun unexpected discharge caused greatest consternation among young levy body of cavalry be at once sent off in pursuit drove fugitive back to rank trooper using flat of sword unstintingly then advance be resumed covered by fire of gun by volley of musketry be answered feebly by firearm in peasant hand blue pressed on until just before reached foot of slope peasant charged with fury regular troop regiment of gendarme have be placed in front stood firm poured heavy volley into peasant a approached then received with levelled bayonet in vain vendeans strove to break through hedge of steel cathelineau officer on one side french general on other encouraged men for quarter of hour desperate conflict reigned then peasant fell back blue resumed advance three time cathelineau induced follower to renew attack time be unsuccessful blue mounted hill cannon be captured vendeans fell back into town here end of street have be barricaded in spite of artillery captured gun now turned against former owner assailant tried in vain to force way into town from window commanded approach men with musket kept up incessant fire mass of peasant lay in shelter behind barricade in house until enemy infantry approached to within striking distance then leaping up from barricade fighting with absolute disregard of life again again repulsed attack of enemy berruyer seeing that in spite of heavy loss made way called troop from assault forming into two column moved to right left attacked town on side here barricade have be erected in spite of effort of peasant entrance be forced into town street lane house be defended with desperate energy discipline gradually triumphed blue won way into square in centre of town where principal church stood a entered open space be assailed with rain of bullet from roof tower window a soon a flanking movement began monsieur bonchamp seeing that town be now certain to be taken have hurried with greater portion of men armed with musket to church have already be prepared by on previous day for defence great number of paving stone have be got up from roadway piled inside church a soon a arrived there with men door be closed blocked behind with deep wall of stone berruyer saw that position be formidable one ignorant of number of defender sent back for gun contented for time by clearing rest of town of defender however a issued out be rallied by cathelineau officer assured peasant that day be not yet lost that church must hold out for hour d'elbee must soon arrive with force from chollet to assistance leigh anxiously watching progress of fight have sent messenger after messenger along road by d'elbee must come heart sank a heard gun open in centre of town knew that be directed against church still there be abatement of fire of defender incessant fire of musketry be maintained not only from church from window in house around at last heard that d'elbee force be quarter of mile away running down from lookout started to meet be coming at run men panting breathless holding on desperately half maddened with sound of battle be not lost yet then d'elbee said a came up sir church hold out must see that peasant who have be driven out of town have rallied few hundred yard away be evidently only waiting for arrival to renew attack think sir that if will run up to belfry of church with glass will be able to understand exact situation officer ran up tower returned in two three minute then led men down towards southeastern corner of town leigh on hearing that d'elbee be close at hand sent off two messenger to cathelineau to inform of fact now sent off stating direction in reinforcement be marching be going to attack at corner instead of in rear monsieur d'elbee said to for now that duty assigned to have be performed leigh thought that must be justified in joining in attack with what remained of band if be to get directly in rear must on finding retreat cut off fight so fiercely that might be overpowered even most cowardly troop will fight under circumstance therefore while threatening line of retreat still leave open to be maxim in war know always to leave bridge open for flying foe in few minute reached town none have observed approach troop being assembled round church be at once thrown into confusion when found attacked with fury by large force of whose existence have previous thought vendeans fought with desperate valour new levy for most part lost heart at once in spite of effort of berruyer officer began to make for line of retreat movement be accelerated by outburst of shout from other side of town where cathelineau force poured in burning to avenge former loss a fell upon enemy bonchamp led out defender of church by side door joined in fray berruyer saw that be lost by great effort kept together gendarme regular troop to cover retreat fell back fighting fiercely bonchamp musketeer pressed hotly upon peasant made charge after charge a soon a force issued from town many of peasantry set off at full speed in pursuit of fugitive great number of whom be overtaken killed berruyer continued retreat night entered saint lambert before morning having lost whole of cannon three thousand men in disastrous fight joy of vendeans be unbounded stone be speedily removed from shattered door of church mass be celebrated peasant returned thanks for great victory gain be indeed considerable three thousand musket have fallen into hand have recaptured gun that have lost taken twelve others own loss have be heavy eighteen hundred men have be killed great number wounded of at time thought little who have died have died for country god a of be ready to do how must men do more on republican side general duhaus have be very dangerously wounded most of berruyer principal officer killed council of war be held next morning at chemille for moment victory have secured safety while peasant believed hoped that war be over leader saw that position be scarcely improved have indeed captured gun musket be useless without ammunition stock of powder ball be quite exhausted already peasantry be leaving in large number for home berruyer might return reinforced at time effect junction with leigonyer while column have captured saint florent must doubtless advance be therefore decided that chemille must be abandoned that officer must retire to tiffauges until at rate peasant be ready to leave home again by evening day greater portion of army have melted away on following morning leader also left town have so bravely defended on following day indeed berruyer having learned position of leigonyer returned to chemille two day later be in communication with leigonyer force latter have occupied chollet have be left devoid of defender since day marched away on other hand quetineau have on thirteenth be attacked at aubiers have be forced to evacuate place leaving three gun behind retiring to bressuire capture of aubiers be work of henri de la rochejaquelein have ridden to join cathelineau met other leader retiring from chemille be gloomy depressed have won battle be without army without ammunition almost town be in possession of blue seemed to that struggle must not be much longer maintained young count be too energetic too enthusiastic to be seriously moved rode back to residence of aunt at saint aubin there learned that aubiers have be taken by enemy peasantry around be in state of extreme excitement have hoisted white flag on church be ready to fight have leader hearing that rochejaquelein be at aunt house came to begged to take command promising that in twenty four hour ten thousand men must be ready to follow agreed to request church bell be set ringing before morning almost that number be assembled of only two hundred have gun with force attacked aubiers resistance of enemy be feeble be chased almost to bressuire rochejaquelein be very anxious to capture town a friend lescures have be brought from clisson imprisoned there saw that be of primary importance to carry assistance to cathelineau accordingly marched to tiffauges church bell again rang out summons cathelineau in twenty four hour found at head of army of twenty thousand men told at clisson must soon meet again monsieur martin la rochejaquelein said when a rode into tiffauges at head of newly raised force met jean in street here be see be only sorry that be too late to take part in brave fight at chemille right glad be to see count jean replied be wife brother of whom be speaking to at clisson cathelineau will tell that have be distinguishing rarely henri held out hand to leigh said warmly be glad to know must be shame indeed be vendeans to remain at home when young englishman be fighting for country hope that will be great friend will be glad indeed to be so leigh replied with equal warmth for be greatly struck with appearance of young soldier henri de la rochejaquelein be twenty one year old tall remarkably handsome have fair hair noble bearing father have be colonel in army be cavalry officer in king guard be beau ideal of dashing hussar appearance be far more english than french be immensely popular manner frank pleasant be greatly beloved by peasantry on family estate at moment cathelineau with two general came up leigh retired from circle arrival of young count with strong reinforcement at once altered position leader who have since fell back from chemille be depressed almost hopeless beamed with satisfaction a talked with henri whose enthusiasm be infectious la rochejaquelein accompanied to quarter hitherto have only heard rumour of fighting at chemille cathelineau now gave full account of affair jean martin have at invitation accompanied when cathelineau have finished henri turned to said indeed did not exaggerate monsieur martin when said that brother in law have already distinguished in fact there can be doubt that splendid defence made at little river where held berruyer whole force in check for upwards of three hour so forced to halt for night on way instead of pushing forward attacking chemille at once saved town for gave time to monsieur d'elbee to come up scarcely le important be detection of treachery of man in charge of artillery can not regret that so gallant young fellow be not countryman for must have felt proud of one so daring so thoughtful when want for scouting work monsieur cathelineau will get to lend to must be really glad to have by side face pleased much there be something so frank honest about after what have done be sure that will always respect opinion there be consultation a to what must be first operation be resolved that leigonyer must be attacked at once before must make complete junction with next morning at daybreak whole force moved off be only just in time for berruyer have already ordered general gauvillier who commanded force have captured saint florent to advance to beaupreau berruyer be to march to vezins to jallais to join leigonyer at may on previous evening henri have after termination of council requested jean martin to take to house where leigh little party be quartered have be hearing of doings said feel quite jealous that who be hear four year younger than must have done so much while with family influence connection must a yet have done nothing chase enemy out of aubiers how be that who have have training a soldier must have conceived idea of arresting march of berruyer army with force of only two three hundred peasant be mere matter of common sense leigh said with smile knew that be of utmost importance that chemille must not be attacked until cathelineau received reinforcement at first have thought of doing more than breaking down bridge of perhaps checking advanced cavalry when found that peasant who came along be quite willing to aid seemed to that by cutting down tree so a to block road make shelter for might be able to cause enemy considerable delay hardly hoped to succeed in holding out so long in inflicting such loss upon a be able to do did not require military knowledge must not have attempted have not seen that thanks to forest must be able to retreat when must no longer hold barricade of felled tree well must not have done better if have be general have cathelineau permission to ask to ride with when be not engaged in scouting must be delighted to do so at present have horse however can send one of lad back to chateau to fetch one generally ride have brought spare animal with young count said brought in case other must be shot will be glad if will ride tomorrow until yours arrives must not send for one until after tomorrow for likely enough may make capture before be to march at three in morning to attack leigonyer great thing that need be powder cathelineau say that there be scarcely charge left among men mine be not much better off must have have none with to attack aubiers sent off during night to quarry few mile from aunt succeeded in getting forty pound of blasting powder must not have be of much use for musket fact of being powder be sufficient to encourage peasant blue made feeble resistance that quality made difference to enabled who have musket to make noise with be just a effectual in raising spirit in attacking blue a if have be finest quality got few hundred cartridge when took place will not go very far hope that tomorrow will be able to obtain supply from enemy before hour for starting force have swelled considerably news that monsieur de la rochejaquelein have retaken aubiers have come with twelve thousand men to assist cathelineau spread like wildfire peasant from country round flocked in when started in morning united force have swollen to over twenty thousand men a soon a young count left leigh sent band under lieutenant with order to proceed towards vezins to ascertain progress leigonyer have made position of force to send back news to just a army be starting one of boy returned said that party of twelve cavalry detachment of infantry have just entered chateau of crilloire leigh at once informed cathelineau who sent off hundred fifty men to capture place be ordered to travel at top of speed jean martin be in command of expedition be crowned with success infantry who have be stationed outside chateau fled at once commandant villemet leigonyer best officer charged vendeans with little body of cavalry be received with volley two of men be killed nine of men be wounded managed however to burst through vendeans to overtake flying infantry rallied led back to chateau found deserted for martin a soon a captured place cleared of enemy have gone off with men to join main body berruyer have also started early sent five hundred men to may where expected leigonyer to arrive in few hour before reached town vendeans attacked advanced guard of latter general consisted of two company of grenadier old soldier fought well threw into chateau of bois groleau leaving fifteen hundred men to surround attack chateau main army pressed forward leigonyer hearing of disaster sent forward two thousand men to succour besieged force vendeans fell upon after short resistance broke fled into vezins arrival of fugitive caused panic among whole of leigonyer force assembled there fled precipitately two hundred fifty men of regiment of finisterre alone remaining steady maintaining good order covered retreat of gun repulsing attack of peasantry who pursued fortunately for vendeans waggon laden with barrel of powder be left behind in confusion caused by approach proved of inestimable value to have vendeans pursued fugitive with vigour force must have be almost annihilated cathelineau learning from leigh scout that berruyer be already approaching vezins feared to be taken in rear by therefore fell back to may beaupreau garrison defended chateau of bois groleau repulsed repeated attack made upon surrendered on approach of main army ammunition food have brought with in haversack being entirely exhausted berruyer on arrival at jallais heard of defeat of leigonyer marched back in haste to chemille where have left magazine on hearing however leigonyer on arrival at vihiers have be deserted during night by whole of troop finding in morning with hundred fifty men of finisterre regiment have evacuated town retreated to doug berruyer wrote to to endeavour to gather force together again to return to chemille news of disaster convinced that must not maintain there vendeans have marched without delay against beaupreau attacked gauvillier that general have already heard of defeat of leigonyer retreat of berruyer force be greatly dispirited at news offered feeble resistance to fierce assault blue be driven out of town with loss of five cannon be hotly pursued to saint florent losing large proportion of number on way news of fresh disaster convinced berruyer that must fall back without delay accordingly retreated with whole force to saint lambert whence wrote to convention to declare impossibility of doing anything without large reinforcement of regular troop a dependence must be placed upon national guard volunteer if insurgent marched against must be obliged to march to ponts de ce in order to cover anger where alarm of inhabitant be intense thus invasion be to crush vendeans failed altogether except advantage have be gained by blue along line of coast troop being assisted by fleet at other point misfortune have attended quetineau have be driven from aubiers great proportion of force having deserted held bressuire with so feeble grasp that must not maintain if attacked leigonyer army have practically ceased to exist a have that have advanced from saint florent berruyer have lost three thousand men be back again at point from have started chollet vihiers have be recovered without blow a result of failure berruyer be recalled to paris tried for conduct narrowly escaped guillotine a soon a berruyer retired cathelineau advanced against bressuire news of coming at once scared blue from town retreated to thouars did not even wait to take prisoner with a soon a have gone marquis de la lescure with family rode off to chateau at clisson have scarcely arrived there when la rochejaquelein arrived acquainted with general fact of insurrection cathelineau army said consists of twenty thousand men on emergency must swell to nearly twice that number twelve thousand breton have crossed loire be on way to join in lower poitou charette have army of twenty thousand besides there be many scattered band lescure at once agreed to accompany la rochejaquelein to bressuire marquis of donnissan madame lescure father arranged to follow a soon a have seen wife daughter safely placed in chateau of de la boulais chapter short rest leigh stansfield have ridden with rochejaquelein during march of army to vezins from there to bressuire be charmed with companion who have be first to dash with few other mounted gentleman into street of vezins who have thrown with reckless bravery upon retreating infantry a peasant came up have led to attack several time until cathelineau order that pursuit must be pushed farther reached that sort of order be very hard to obey said to leigh however need not regret that brave fellow must escape have won battle if one can call battle honour men who when others have fled like sheep still cling together defend gun at least hundred of have fallen since left town have lost double that number must lose at least a many more before finally overcame opposition if army of republic be composed of such stuff a regiment fear that chance of defending la vendee successfully must be small indeed on rejoining cathelineau hearing reason for calling off pursuit henri at once admitted wisdom after defeat of leigonyer will see berruyer will not long be able to maintain at chemille said when hears news fancy that will retire at once for will know well enough that will be useless for to pursue still if be to come down on rear a advanced must have bad effect upon peasant be much better to avoid fighting unless under circumstance be almost sure to give victory can almost always choose own ground be enormous advantage in country like be very fortunate that be so for certainly must not raise body of cavalry must stand against of line in lane thicket have superiority in respect for general must be fool enough to send cavalry into place where must be at mercy of unseen foe at same time must own that regretted today that have mounted force with squadron two of old regiment not man of leigonyer force must have escaped for country here be open enough to use must certainly have have compunction in cutting down rascal who be always shouting for blood yet be such arrant coward that fly without firing shot day after capture of bressuire vendeans marched against thouars to town quetineau have retreated with force thouars be only town in la vendee be still walled fortification be in dilapidated condition nevertheless offered considerable advantage to force determined upon desperate resistance with fugitive from bressuire garrison already in thouars quetineau be at head of three thousand five hundred troop of however comparatively few must be depended upon successive defeat have be inflicted on troop of republic by vendeans have entirely destroyed morale no longer felt confidence in power to resist onslaught of peasant quetineau have hope of making successful resistance have repeatedly written urgent letter to authority at paris saying that nothing must be done without large reinforcement of disciplined troop that national guard volunteer be worse than useless a frequently ran at first shot excited hostility of people generally by habit of plundering nevertheless old soldier determined to resist to last however hopeless conflict when vendeans approached at six o'clock in morning found that bridge of vienne be barricaded guarded a soon a attacked general reinforced defender of bridge by most trustworthy troop battalion three hundred twenty five strong of marseillais battalion of national guard of nievre so stoutly be post held that vendean general saw that bridge must not be taken without terrible loss therefore contented with keeping up heavy fire day while preparing attack from other quarter first step be to destroy bridge behind castle to make breach in wall near paris gate thereby cutting off garrison mean of retreat at five o'clock large body of peasantry be massed for attack on bridge at vienne defender seeing storm be preparing retired into town vendeans crossed bridge a approached wall be attacked by battalion of national guard of deux sevres body of gendarme taken by surprise be driven back distance leader however speedily rallied in meantime other body forced way into town at several point to avoid massacre of troop quetineau hoisted white flag on a on other occasion in northern portion of la vendee prisoner be well treated be offered freedom on condition of promising not to serve against la vendee again to ensure that oath must be kept for time at least head be shaved before release step be afterwards taken throughout war quetineau be treated with honour be given freedom without condition although knew well that long service effort that have made must save from fury of convention returned to paris where after mockery of trial be sent to guillotine fate awaited who failed in face of impossibility to carry out plan of mob leader instead of blame general deserved high amount of praise for manner in have defended town against force six time a strong a own three thousand musket ten piece of cannon considerable amount of ammunition fell into hand of victor success left open to vendeans to march against leigonyer remnant of whose army be in state of insubordination at doug must have offered opposition must have retreated to saumur to clear country south west former must unquestionably have be wiser course for capture of saumur must have be heavy blow indeed to republican peasant whose village property be threatened by presence of blue at fontenay parthenay chataigneraie be so strongly in favour of other alternative that be adopted force broke into two division one moving towards chataigneraie other against fontenay parthenay be evacuated at once by republican a soon a news reached authority of approach of vendeans latter however made stay continued march towards chataigneraie town be held by general chalbos with three thousand men after two hour fighting chalbos seeing that retreat be menaced fell back took up position at fontenay where be joined by general sandoz from niort country around town be unfavourable for vendeans being large plain result be disastrous to republican be strong in cavalry portion of fell on flank of vendeans while remainder charged in rear fell into disorder at once cavalry captured portion of artillery republican infantry seeing success of cavalry advanced stoutly in good order in vain leader of vendeans strove to reanimate men induce to charge enemy panic have begun spread rapidly in few minute became mob of fugitive scattering in direction leaving behind sixteen cannon munition of war have captured la rochejaquelein who after have visited lescure at clisson have rejoined army with party of gentleman covered retreat with desperate valour charging enemy cavalry again again before falling back allowing time for fugitive to gain shelter of wood loss of men be therefore small fact that peasant who have come to be regarded a almost irresistible by troop must have be so easily defeated raised blue from depth of depression into have fallen while blow inflicted upon vendeans be correspondingly great be little time before peasant must be aroused again small body indeed kept field under leader showed so bold face whenever reconnoitring party of blue went out from fontenay that troop be not long before again began to lose heart while general who have thought that victory at fontenay must bring war to conclusion again began to pour in letter to authority at paris calling for reinforcement on side of vendeans priest everywhere exerted to impress upon flock necessity of again joining army cathelineau made tour through bocage peasant persuaded that defeat be punishment for having committed excess at capture of chataigneraie responded to call in nine day after reverse be again in force near fontenay in much greater number than before for very many of have returned to home a soon a thouars have be captured strength in first battle be little greater than of republican

chalbos who have occupied time in issuing vainglorious proclamation in writing assurance to convention that vendeans be so panic stricken that war be virtually over only saved army by long painful night march back to fontenay here troop lay down to sleep feeling certain that there must be attack that day by enemy at one o'clock however vendeans issued from wood on to plain troop be hastily called to arm royal catholic army a now called advanced in three column be without cannon enthusiasm more than counterbalanced deficiency vendeans received unshaken discharge of artillery of blue pursuing usual tactic of throwing to ground when saw flash of cannon then leaping up again rushing forward with loud shout cavalry be ordered to charge only twenty men obeyed rest turned fled infantry offered feeble resistance in ten minute after first gun be fired republican army be mob of fugitive fontenay be taken what pleased peasant even more beloved cannon marie jeanne be recaptured having be recovered by young foret who with handful of peasant charged cavalry be covering retreat snatched from hand after victory peasant a usual returned for most part to home a there be probability of further fighting at moment jean martin leigh started for chateau have first asked cathelineau if must be spared for moment yes hope that will be joined by count de lescure in day two will of course be one of general have great influence with peasantry if can persuade to remain under arm for time will attack enemy monsieur d'elbee bonchamp may say several of gentleman with be of opinion that if be to be successful in end can only be by taking offensive marching against paris urge that must get monsieur charette to go with with army cross loire rouse brittany then march hundred thousand strong against paris say that although have be most successful time repulsed invader everywhere except on coast will come again again with larger force till overpower possibly if monsieur de lescure henri de la rochejaquelein aid with influence authority might persuade peasant that be better to make one great effort then to have done with than to be constantly called from home whenever blue be in sufficient strength to invade will tell too that after two repulse have suffered blue will grow more more savage already order have be sent for village to be destroyed hedge wood to be cut down business by way must employ whole french army for year however a soon a plan be decided upon will send messenger to at present there be nothing requiring scout monsieur stansfield after good service

told simple truth a soon a have finished supper will tell whole story of what have taken place since left will see that brother of yours have cut very conspicuous figure in affair be not joking jean not in smallest degree can assure that if leigh chose to set up a leader on own account large proportion of peasant must follow ridiculous jean leigh exclaimed hotly may seem ridiculous be real fact peasant must know patsey choose own leader there be dividing sorting getting to keep in regular company simply follow leader in whom have most confidence who appears to most fortunate if doe anything

almost supernatural superstitious ignorant a be be a know always ready to consider anything ca understand act greatly in favour a special interposition of providence be bound to say that leigh acted upon such very slender ground that even cathelineau who be enormously in advance of peasantry in general be staggered by told must not have believed possible that anyone must on slight clue have followed matter up unless by special inspiration thing be a simple a b c leigh broke in will have to remain silent listener leigh sister said when jean be telling story can not have interrupted very well leigh said then will put on hat take fresh horse from stable ride off to see how two wounded boy be going on can tell that be almost well still if want to hear jean story of adventure by mean go

leigonyer who be present ordered whole force to fall back to position have before chosen a being favourable for giving battle behind doue vendeans pressed forward with such eagerness that retreat speedily degenerated into rout troop for most part throwing away arm fled precipitately carrying reserve with to bourlan strong position in front of saumur where general menou be stationed where succeeded in rallying leigonyer having from previous experience great doubt a to whether must be successful in stand against vendeans have taken precaution to send back waggon with munition store together with artillery a men have fled too rapidly to be overtaken numerical loss be not great in report of fight ascribed to cause have be frequently used by french to excuse defeat namely that be due to treachery for many of men broke fled directly action began avowed must have be none other than vendeans who have disguised enlisted for purpose of causing discontent among men confusion in rank first time met enemy since commencement of campaign have several time begged to be relieved of command to return to post that occupied previously now repeated demand saying that have lost confidence of men that new commander must be far more likely to succeed with time request be granted general menou be appointed to succeed fortunately for leigonyer commissioner of convention reported most

thouars by way of loudun with order to general salomon to march instantly into saumur that be to arrive there tonight left town five minute after messenger three quarter of hour later struck road two mile side of saumur have be brought here in cart by peasant be now four o'clock think that officer must arrive at thouars before half past three be important news indeed cathelineau said well gentleman what do think have best be done seems to that nothing must be better monsieur de lescure said enemy column can not start until five o'clock at earliest will be dark before can arrive at saumur know road well run in several place through wood where be not case there be high hedge nothing must be more suitable for ambuscade propose that half of force must march at once take post on other side of montreuil will be nearly sunset before salomon can arrive at town if engage at dusk will lose benefit of discipline of regiment of gendarme who will doubt accompany quite approve of plan monsieur cathelineau said be of same opinion gentleman there be general expression of assent will general bonchamp with monsieur de lescure take command of force will proceed with rest of army until past point where road from montreuil fall into from town in way if general bonchamp fails to arrest salomon march can fall upon on other hand if firing must be heard at saumur menou lead out force to assist salomon can oppose general dommaigne cavalry must be useless in attack on salomon while might be of great value if menou come out have rendered good service monsieur stansfield if salomon have thrown four thousand men into saumur including regiment of gendarme must have be serious business to take place whereas with troop menou have half of whom be leigonyer fugitive anticipate great difficulty will be glad general if must speak word to good fellow who brought here have bargained with for two crown when found that be one of officer refused to receive anything moreover said that must remain here with cart until tomorrow a perhaps might be useful in carrying store expressed greatest desire to see certainly will speak to cathelineau said a sent out to give order for church bell to ring horn to blow man be standing by cart short distance off in hope of catching sight of cathelineau general at once walked up to be general cathelineau leigh said countryman took off hat dropped on knee get up good fellow cathelineau said be vendean peasant like thank for good service that have rendered by bringing monsieur stansfield so quickly to time have saved may make difference to in future will have satisfaction of knowing that have played important part in capture of saumur in five minute quiet street be crowded with men peasant have encamped in field round town at summons caught up arm ran in hastily feeling sure that occasion be important a have be told that be not to march until next morning division commanded by monsieur de lescure general bonchamp speedily gathered round distinguishing flag of officer other leader joined with follower until ten thousand men be gathered outside town leigh have changed clothes mounted horse monsieur de lescure having invited to ride with a be about to start one of andre messenger arrived with news that officer three trooper have arrived at town ten minute later trumpet be sounding assembly be well that got news first monsieur de lescure said to leigh for otherwise must hardly have got force together be ready for start until be too late to intercept route of column be by byroad between doue montreuil be seven o'clock before approached town then striking off road marched through field until mile half to east of when halted in thick wood be now divided into three column of equal strength under monsieur de lescure occupied wood on one side of road under monsieur bonchamp other side third column be posted in rear of wood be to thickly line hedge bordered be just dusk when force from thouars came along consisted of three thousand six hundred men with four piece of cannon be allowed to pas nearly through wood when heavy fire be opened upon on flank regiment of gendarme led column showed great coolness animated by example whole force remained steady darkness came on be not until eleven o'clock that there be change in situation owing to darkness in forest side be able to distinguish foe men fired only at flash of musket lescure then sent round four five hundred men who suddenly fell upon baggage train of enemy guard be completely taken by surprise many of carter cut rope trace galloped off delighted to escape from service into have for most part be dragged against will alarm thus begun spread rapidly young troop who encouraged by example of gendarme have so far stood ground at once lost heart darkness of night ignorance a to strength of force have attacked rear fear that retreat must be cut off must have shaken older soldier than in spite of effort of officer wildest confusion soon reigned vendeans pressed attack more hotly general salomon seeing that unless retreat be made while there be yet time terrible disaster might take place ordered gendarme to fall back in good order movement be effected without great loss in darkness be impossible for lescure other leader to get men together to press hard upon retreating foe be well satisfied at having carried out object of expedition prevented force from thouars from entering saumur word be sent to cathelineau that salomon have fallen back peasant then lay down till morning andre with little band have joined force when fighting began have a soon a salomon started from thouars followed movement at distance from time to time sending off messenger to doue giving account of progress of enemy a soon a firing broke out in wood andre with twelve who still remained with joined combatant finding leigh be with monsieur de lescure be not long in discovering have done very well andre said think anything will come of fighting be getting dark already have fear now that blue will break through party will be able to see other in wood certainly must do good with pistol practically few be engaged on side blue have made one effort finding that have very strong force in front have given up attempt to push forward believe that new levy have courage enough to keep steady through whole night uncertainty have best draw off distance rest till hear by firing that change have taken place if hear that blue be retreating follow at distance be important for general to know what course be taking may halt in montreuil may return to thouars may retire to niort parthenay if remain in montreuil let know at once because in case will have to stay here in case must attempt to push on again if go farther need have more concern about still must be of great importance to general to know whether return to thouars retire farther south very well captain will see that be kept informed have better instruct first messenger to come straight here cathelineau rest of force started directly did will halt at junction of road be likely to remain there day tomorrow therefore if messenger find wood deserted have simply to follow road will either overtake find with cathelineau how long must follow blue there be occasion to go great distance suppose that will pursue must certainly defend at montreuil must not risk suffering heavy loss having men dispirited by failure when be needed for work at saumur if follow far enough to determine whether be retiring on thouars be marching towards niort be be necessary will be able to rejoin in plenty of time to see fight at saumur a leigh thought must be probable monsieur de lescure restrained peasant from following in pursuit when blue retreated latter have left two of gun behind number of cart laden with ammunition provision for march fell into peasant hand latter providing with breakfast before started early next morning rejoining cathelineau force two hour later have be apprised hour before by one of mounted gentleman who have accompanied column of success have attended operation be received with great joy by comrade on arrival cathelineau with general bonchamp small escort of cavalry have ridden towards saumur to examine position occupied by enemy to discus plan of attack now felt confident of success unless indeed biron must come up in course of day with paris brigade at tour together with gun description leigh have given of confusion want of discipline in garrison showed that must not be relied upon for hard fighting a be certain that failure of salomon to get through to assistance must be known in saumur early in day must not add to dismay produced by advance against town be indeed case a artillery have not be employed on side sound of conflict did not reach town however a officer who have taken order to thouars returned at seven o'clock saying that salomon be preparing to march must assuredly arrive time in evening anxiety increased hour by hour by midnight conviction that must have be attacked by enemy have failed to get through became certainty spread dismay through town at five in morning mounted messenger brought despatch from salomon saying that have fought for four hour near montreuil against large force of enemy that column of having fallen on rear found necessary to retire a panic be spreading among national guard serious disaster must have happened have continued attempt to push on in evening general coustard berthier who have be sent by biron to act under menou order arrived in town santerre brewer of paris who have be leader of mob there be now general arrived next morning cathelineau army be astir early leader have be gladdened by arrival at five o'clock of messenger from pierre saying that one of messenger have come in from tour up to seven o'clock in evening troop have left that city be therefore certain that garrison of saumur must receive assistance from quarter breakfast be eaten army then formed up in division mass be celebrated then set out for saumur in town be confusion dismay newly arrived general be stranger alike to town defence troop be to command in front of work defending saumur ran river dive fell into loire mile so below town be crossed by bridge so great be confusion that in spite of representation of civil authority step be taken either to cut guard

o'clock skirmisher on side be hotly engaged vendeans advanced in three column central one against post occupied by berthier left against nantilly right threatened to turn position at beaulieu berthier allowed force advancing against to approach within short distance of chateau then poured storm of grape into from battery that have established lescure who be in command be badly wounded head of column fell into confusion berthier at once attacked with two regiment of line for time pressed column back little body of cavalry whom have ordered to charge fell back a soon a vendeans opened fire upon latter then attacked line battalion with such fury that berthier be obliged to call up regiment of volunteer cathelineau sent reinforcement to troop pressed on so hotly that berthier who have have horse shot under be obliged to fall back exulting vendeans rushed forward carried faubourg of fenet dommaigne with cavalry charged cuirassier german legion there be sharp fight dommaigne be killed colonel of german legion desperately wounded body of vendean infantry coming up took cuirassier in flank with fire fell back into saumur general menou have be in thick of fight have three horse killed under sent battalion to reinforce berthier a soon a came within shot of vendeans broke fled two line battalion reinforced by four company of gendarme kept up heavy fire artillery until now have zealously supported ammunition be failing menou berthier placed at head of cavalry called upon to charge instead of doing so raised favourite cry of treason galloped back to town line regiment gendarme pressed more more hotly finding without support withdrew in good order into vendeans have now possession of work in centre of defender line coustard seeing that centre be lost that vendeans be moving towards bridge across dive by alone must enter town ordered two battalion with two piece of cannon to hold be not only disobeyed with shout of treason rushed upon with difficulty escaped with life vendeans seized bridge established battery for defence coustard saw that must be recaptured a town be now open to enemy ordered detachment of cuirassier commanded by colonel weissen to carry bridge two battalion of infantry now promised to follow although saw that to charge battery with handful of cavalry be to ride to almost certain death weissen gallantly led men forward infantry followed for short distance being taken in flank by volley from party of vendeans broke fled cavalry be almost annihilated weissen be desperately wounded two three of men alone riding back main force

with fowl followed be concluded with omelette have not eaten meal father martin said since rode away think after will be able to take more hopeful view of matter in respect meal will be thrown away upon leigh for always take brightest view of everything have never ceased to assure that be sure to manage to get wife out of hand of villain somehow a have so far always succeeded in what have attempted feel good deal of faith in must be a hopeful a if knew that henriette be in river at nantes have to hand dozen stout fellow must thoroughly rely on after paying visit to farm praising marthe arranging that must continue to live there returned to village will go over to chateau leigh before do anything else want to see how hot ruin be must think that must be pretty cool by time jean see be

jean matter good deal have with only hundred franc in paper be not worth above third of face value have here four thousand in gold brought with from nantes a soon a trouble began buried one day under hearthstone of kitchen thinking possible that blue might come here money be of utmost importance now for may want to bribe of jailer therefore must get even if delay for day found indeed that a have feared there be still fire among mass of debris must quench before can do anything jean have doubt that woman will help francois be at once sent round in short time woman in place be assembled with pail martin francois worked windlass of well woman carried pail of water leigh threw content on to smouldering mass above where knew kitchen fireplace must have stood cloud of steam rose from time to

during afternoon obtained supply of bread wine after fell out meal be eaten before started for home promising to be back at six in morning to aid in work of clearing away debris jean leigh spent

cleared raised martin brought out crock in have placed gold now leigh said have better have talk with boy arrange where be to meet must not press of who be unwilling to go be private business think that must be right to urge certainly not leigh agreed be quite sure that boy will go with for patsey sake because be furious at chateau being burnt down a to others will put to that be perfectly free to do a wish can go with can rejoin army just a like if go think that must be a well that did not enter town must take up quarter in copse in deserted house mile two away so that must call if wanted even in town like nantes forty strange boy wandering about might be noticed martin after seeing that worker have refreshment went to cure a never interfered in way with boy thinking that might lessen leigh authority be to do so now want to talk to leigh said after have drunk wine eaten bread in first place do understand that who be first with be ready to run considerable risk to attempt with to carry off madame martin from hand of blue to save from fate fall upon one once lay hand upon be willing captain andre said spoke to again just before came in last night said that be willing anxious

among yourselves to rejoin army find monsieur de la rochejaquelein tell sent to in order that might find suitable leader for among gentleman with must rather that talked matter over among yourselves came gave answer in hour will tell will have to do captain one of said that can hardly do for know however think probable that greater portion of band must remain outside town there be copse down by riverside where must wait in safety until be wanted possibly might not be wanted at possibly might be summoned to take part in so desperate enterprise a storming one of prison of course must be done at night when must have advantage of surprise can tell no more than now last word be will not think worse of if decide not to go with wanted five minute of time when two of boy returned to where be talking with pierre andre have decided captain told when marched away from saumur that monsieur de la rochejaquelein have approved of taking therefore will feel that be still doing duty to cause have be kind good thoughtful while have be with all of own age in army envied who be of cathelineau scout regarded position a great honour even if be willing to go back must not do so tell others that have left comrade when be about to undertake perilous service wish desire to remain with to follow wherever may lead to die in service if need be leigh shook warmly by hand bravely said thank heartily be

send small body of cavalry to capture be also who denounced father brother be by far most powerful of committee of safety a well a in club assumes air of perfect disinterestedness of passionate love for republic vote be always given for death think take saint just a model repeat assertion that be only by destruction of enemy of france that france can be freed there be cold bloodedness about that set nerve tingling believe that discovery that father have largely reduced stock have sent proceeds to england decided in agreeing to bringing about denunciation that deferred only until found that mother sister have escaped that freed hand to extent have remained here must have be in difficult position even in day when be sated with horror must hardly have permitted mother sister to be executed when a everyone knew have power to save on other hand if have remained must have be obstacle to success of plan a be now father house property belonging to be declared confiscated committee of safety passed vote that seeing inestimable service rendered to state by eldest son must be bestowed upon a token of gratitude for well doing scarcely surprise jean said gloomily never liked brother have not feeling in common for year have never seemed to belong to family certainly since trouble began have not set foot in father house still hardly believed that must be such scoundrel abhorred opinion believed that be at least sincere did not see what must gain by revolution now understand character better can see how cleverly have played card can not reckon with scoundrel deeply a have wronged father must welcome news that retribution have fallen upon by other hand now jules can give advice a to how to set about scheme of getting out of prison jules shook head fear poor friend that be impossible prison be a know strong there be must say forty warder ruffian scoundrel attempt to bribe even one of must almost to certainty be denounced must probably be necessary to have at least dozen in plot a to force be out of question building be very strong there be always twenty thirty of volunteer on guard outside alarm must bring up five hundred in quarter of hour to say nothing of troop what force must bring must have even remote chance of success have leigh with know well jules rely much more upon than do on be full of plan contrivance have rendered extraordinary service during war have with rather will have in course of day so band of forty lad of whom be captain who have acted a scout to cathelineau will be in hiding mile two out of town jules lifted eyebrow be afraid that force a must be of very little use to jean in fact of use whatever if have five hundred men must gather for sudden attack on jail have couple of cannon to blow in gate must say might be possible even then chance of being done fugitive got safely away before arrival of three thousand troop must be very doubtful at moment servant brought in note who brought monsieur desailles asked be woman monsieur

fever until join know way jean there will be half dozen speech vying with other in abusing friend will see uselessness of trying to defend when terrorist be three to one against if friend slipped out a be probable directly brother rose can calculate on good hour actually club have power whatever to order arrest be so closely allied now with committee of safety that stand upon legality except in case likely to attract great deal of public attention jules went to door let visitor out jean joined leigh desailles be going to join have just be denounced will be with in quarter of hour on wharf be very lucky that brenon completed arrangement today for boat rouget medart will be expecting evening told might not come until tomorrow morning settle there will be sharp search for desailles a soon a be found that be gone be just a well that must be off too be very glad have boat taken from usual berth to spot mile higher up because there be sure to be inquiry whether fishing boat put out during night walked fast back to inn brenon on being told what have happened agreed that must certainly be safest for to go on board have two friend living here said of whom be carrier keep eight ten horse tomorrow morning early will take one of horse to one second to other one will notice there whereas if search be made have doubt search will be made of house near river will light upon in shed must not believe story have two citizen from vallet living here in first place because be unlikely place to put up in second because such citizen must be forthcoming be lucky that told men to get cask of wine store of provision on board before starting well know captain that whenever choose to land again house be at disposal will carry out what arranged must get together score of men can trust to of whom can promise hundred franc for night work in good cause packed up former disguise might come in useful again pistol have already about then went out on to wharf again few minute later be joined by jules desailles have be nervous ever since left jean martin said a friend shook hand with leigh be afraid that quarter of hour delay might be fatal lost time feel sure that will be hour before anyone be down after be too fond of listening to own voice to close discussion in le than hour after proposer have sat down hope boat be not far off for portmanteau of mine be heavy can assure took up swung on to shoulder dear jean wo have nonsense jules weight be nothing to though doubt to man who never take exercise must feel heavy to say truth be heavier than expected went on packing up everything did not like to leave behind until thing be crammed full after have locked went to lift be thunderstruck with weight did servant see go out rang for told be going out did not suppose must be back till late that must go to bed when liked knew must be few minute after got permission be sort of human dormouse nineteen time out of twenty have have to wait for breakfast be in fright a walked down here lest one who knew might run against happily saw one must not recognize if have seen jean laughed idea of monsieur desailles advocate gentleman somewhat particular a to attire dragging portmanteau weighing hundred pound through street must seem impossibility have left that phase of existence behind jules laughed henceforth be man of war rebel brigand a call prepared for desperate adventure ready to rush up to cannon mouth be right desailles be glad to see that take thing so cheerfully dear jean feel a if walk on air since have taken portmanteau have be living in state of suspense for month hating wretch way knowing be gradually falling into bad odour with that blow must certainly fall ere long over over again have thought of making escape from see be not man of action a be did not see how matter be to be effected where to go what to do be like boy shivering at edge of bank afraid to plunge in then come behind push into water strike out find that be not a cold a expected forthwith enjoys have cut loose from past have become rover waif feel a lighthearted a boy now let get hold of one end of trunk again have got right a see have not yet changed shoulder if want help be to leigh must turn not to after three month campaigning may be that will be able to hold up end a well a can certainly can not do so now in hundred yard will be at boat must be on lookout for in short time saw fishing craft with boat astern of man be standing on deck be dark night friend said will be lighter in morning jean replied man leapt ashore ah captain be glad indeed to see brenon did not tell until after have made bargain with who wanted boat must not have talked about payment not likely after having sailed with since be boy of fourteen indeed said man who have just raised head out of cabin hatch be not going to take will talk about afterwards jean said a stepped on board doubted whether be captain for brenon have only spoken to of two when saw three of thought that must belong to one of boat higher up there be two three of bit farther on did not know until hour ago be friend monsieur desailles who be in same danger from butcher of convention a be first pas box down then will follow gathered in little cabin be seven foot long will be close work captain rouget said will do very well jean said cheerfully there be room for two of to sleep on locker one on floor have got small boat behind see be there man said good boat be bought from two fisherman who have come down from saint florent be very well for up there be scarce fit for fishing far below nantes be glad that did not belong to place martin said fisherman might have be surprised to see two strange men in boat knew so many have come down here from town above that will excite attention now first thing to do be to get up sail drop down two mile past town then can go about fishing a usual only one of will show upon deck at time now a to matter on be here brenon told that be dangerous business for must be required told that be to hide two gentleman whom committee of public safety must be glad to get hold of knew of course to do thing be dangerous did not like worse for honest men be horrified at way commissioner from paris be carrying thing on must be glad enough to aid in getting anyone out of hand danger be greater in case than ordinary jean went on heard that father have be imprisoned heard captain savage made a may guess everyone spoke well of being father of course felt more be not lad party of cavalry went to chateau in absence burnt down brought wife here prisoner now be absolutely certain that will of be condemned for have personal enemy on committee of public safety will be murdered unless can get out brother leigh whom know have come for purpose well captain can count upon of heart soul see how be going to be done prison be strong place well guarded have doubt that must count on getting twenty stout men along wharf must not be much use have more than on guard before must get into prison must come swarming down number of have forty young fellow from neighbourhood who will by tomorrow be hidden away in wood mile half higher up river will be help sir even with two hundred must not be able to do much will have plenty of time to talk over afterwards get sail up drop down river keep close to opposite bank be important that must not be noticed a pas town well sir there be hardly air enough to fill sail must say that have best tow across to other side in small boat then drift till be fairly beyond town be safe not to be seen then perhaps will be best plan rouget men went out in two three minute sound of oar must be heard ca say that lookout be very hopeful leigh did not think that anyone must think so jean seems to that be just because everyone seems so confident that prison be safe from attack that will have chance thing be troubling most be where can get barrel of gunpowder must have powder to blow open gate expect that of door may find locked inside will give way if pistol be fired through keyhole to blow in main gate of prison must get powder good deal of that however be matter in will find money will be of use there be too many official in prison for to hope to get one out without eight ten being in plot a hear be fellow who be heart soul with convention be not possible to attempt in way when a know blue succeeded in bribing vendean to tamper with gun ought not to be such difficult thing to bribe one of fellow who be in charge of ammunition to let have barrel two of powder that certainly seems to hold out prospect of success so far leigh have never be able to understand confidence in success certainly first indication of plan seems to promise well now let hear more of well be idea jean will choose windy night send andre pierre with twenty of boy into worst part of town will carry ball of yarn dipped in turpentine mixed with sulphur other inflammable thing will also carry ball having thin coating of yarn powder inside so a to explode when clock strike two will say of will smash window of store light ball put in want explosion of one ball to scare anyone who may be sleeping there half out of sens make rush out of house will leave plenty of time for other ball to set on fire anything that may light upon twenty fire starting at once at different spot will create fearful scare many of guard outside prison of whom be drawn from slum will have come from quarter a have idea of discipline will when see flame mounting up leave post rush off to see to safety of home choosing windy night may be sure that fire must burn fast that rest of volunteer national guard must soon be so busy that must not trouble about prison one way other thus calculate that of fifty men on guard round prison there must not be twenty left at outside must be so busy staring at talking of fire that with sudden surprise must all be disposed of without difficulty then gate of prison must be blown in must rush in shoot down warder meet keeping one only a guide make straight for room where father patsey be confined release a many others a time will allow telling to rush down to wharf seize boat to escape in way like while with father patsey must make straight down to boat while with boy must follow cover retreat if of blue came up to pursue leigh be genius martin exclaimed bringing hand down on lad shoulder with force almost knocked from seat what do think of desailles for plan told that relied upon leigh head more than own see have good reason for doing so doubt whether must be done with forty boy if can get powder seems to that with half a many sailor to help there be reason why must not succeed might burn town down desailles said gravely if be sure that must burn whole of down must not mind leigh exclaimed there be not much fear of if cleared out whole of slum where supporter of gang of murderer call committee of public safety live must rejoice most heartily a there be several wide street between business quarter a will have soldier of town to assist in fighting flame think that there will be fear of fire spreading very far well at rate leigh have hit on plan offer good chance of success will find out in day two how many of boatman can get to aid how far will be disposed to go must learn in way how long be likely to be before be absolutely necessary to act if find that there be time can send of boy off to army to bring father brother back with sixty might not be enough with hundred of men think must be pretty sure of success chapter attack on nantes when three four mile down river boat be anchored two men be called into cabin leigh scheme explained to be big affair sir medart said thoughtfully when jean have concluded now there be love lost between ruffian who carry out committee order call river rat call sewer rat there have be many fight between fisherman fellow a far back a can remember lately have be much more frequent if plan be only to burn down quarter there be good many who must lend hand because must be done quietly must have particular reason for suspecting that be work of fisherman a for going into jail must be different must not have time by what say to hunt up kill warder must therefore be known at once that be concerned five six of fellow have already have head chopped off on suspicion of having aided royalist to escape mind whom lay hand on trouble to search just seize first come to who perhaps in cabaret have said word against doings a to trial be trial at one of fellow come in say ' heard man abusing authority accuse also of being concerned in escape of so so ' be odds what prisoner say fellow who act a judge look at jury who be creature say 'guilty say ' death accused be marched off again to prison to wait until turn come for guillotine well see if prison be broken into a propose be known that sailor have hand in chance be that must march couple of hundred of into great square must be choke full of national guard volunteer just shoot down jean be silent probability thing must go a man said be so evident that have answer think way to get over difficulty leigh said when saw that jean be puzzled must be for quietly to buy other clothes better still for to be bought for by wife must be such clothes a peasant buy when come into town must then be supposed that attack be made by party of breton peasantry a good many other prisoner must escape in addition to monsieur martin captain wife there must be reason to suppose that plot be specially arranged to aid escape that of people of town be concerned in matter be so master leigh rouget said might be managed in way think that most of chap have better be told off for firing town think that good many might be willing to undertake job for have heard said many many time that must like to burn sewer rat out there be other men who must be sure rather join in attack on jail if must do so without putting life of of in danger a to getting hold of artilleryman know that must be difficult men employed on sort of work be old soldier many of though dare not say so hate what be going on just a much a do have met one of with emile moufflet who served with captain for two three year when have be chatting together have said thing about committee must have cost head if have be overheard know that chum be in charge of store whether be powder not can not say at rate emile will be able to find out for name of several of who have charge of powder must be likely to know of have sentiment like own how far must be trusted must not take long to get hold of forty hand for other work must take time one dare go only to men one be very intimate with get to approach men whom know well for even among there be fellow who take committee money to spy over others to find out whether trouble be likely to come royalist to be shipped off one generally know who be because overdo part rail at convention more roundly openly than honest man must dare to do of one find out way others again one spot by always having money to spend if be too shrewd to betray in way wife find out for by telling that woman child have new clothes know well enough that there be buying new clothes out of fish at present price besides most of fellow give up fishing altogether lounge about wharf talking smoking one know that man family can not live on air still there may be others who be too sly to let out secret in way therefore one must be very careful whom one speaks to one must not think of telling anyone about what be intended until just a come off one must simply say that one have heard that there be something in air that report say that man who will lend hand will earn how much captain two hundred franc when one see how man take that one can go step two further well must not think of letting out to soul what nature of work must be simply saying that precaution will be taken to prevent being known that fisherman be engaged in will take time must say that might be nigh couple of week before one must get whole thing arranged what do think desailles jean said will have fortnight desailles shook head must not say might have more than if prisoner be taken in regular order in be condemned jail be crowded a fresh capture be effected room must be made for of course committee have list make mark against name of who be to be executed day might be three week before friend turn come might be only few day tell what rouget comrade have better land tomorrow morning set to work might say that three fisherman from saint florent finding boat too small hired yours for week to try luck if succeed will give fair price for if not will simply pay hire can say that price be not much a be a much a can make at fishing thought that might a well have idle week on shore leigh can work a soon a day break will shoot net so that can see exactly how work be able to catch average amount of fish day be sure that one will know in disguise at rate sha' be clumsy with sail oar can say that a be stranger have agreed to sell fish for will be excuse for coming down to with news of how be getting on time that come in will do very well captain in case a good deal of fishing must be done at night have better get out net at once show how be managed for next three day work be carried on desailles have undertaken to obtain from friend of on committee of public safety news of what be going on early copy of name of prisoner told off for execution on following day on third day after arrival martin leigh rowed up to wood where have directed band to assemble found that with two three exception have arrived four five of be at once told to return to estate to army with message from jean begging tenant to leave join party in hiding many of must no doubt have returned to home within day two of capture of saumur letter have already be written to bonchamp rochejaquelein to say that be intending to attack jail deliver number of captive besides jean father wife to beg that must pick out fifty hundred determined men send on on morning of sixth day when two sailor joined be in state of high excitement there be great news captain rouget said whole city be in state of tumult be reported that cathelineau with army be marching upon nantes be also reported be not so certain that charette be marching to join with force be grand news if true jean exclaimed must indeed favour scheme doubt whether will capture nantes for there be big force here enough of be seasoned troop to encourage volunteer national guard to make good fight of however can at rate take advantage of attack to carry out own plan when fighting be at hottest may be sure that armed man will be wanted at work that there will not be many guard left behind at prison band here can dispose of dozen men with fireball can add to confusion by setting fire to warehouse factory great thing now will be powder that have managed already captain medart replied a told spoke to emile moufflet first morning went ashore said that be at magazine that chum be employed yesterday evening came to said that if gave two thousand franc that have given for purpose must hand over two barrel of powder at eleven o'clock last night got carried a told to brenon helped to bury in shed also got a ordered couple of yard of fuse bravo medart everything seems going well for news of cathelineau advance be confirmed on following day by return of lad who have be sent to fetch assistance brought with eight ten men from estate reported that la rochejaquelein have remained at saumur with portion of army to defend town against large force that biron be assembling at tour while cathelineau having with bonchamp stofflet be marching with main force along north bank of river said however that force be greatly diminished for large number of men objecting to fight outside own country have scattered to village however confirmed news that charette be reported to be marching north to join cathelineau be worst part of whole business jean said bitterly general have control over men will fight when want to fight return home when choose if cathelineau have come along with big force must have be joined by number of breton on way if have captured nantes by greater part of southern brittany now that so many of men have left be quite possible that attack may fail in case result will be disastrous army must disperse blue must turn whole force against la rochejaquelein cause that fortnight since seemed half won must be lost show at rate that idea of marching on paris must not be carried out for if men refuse to march when must be separated from own country only by river to take nantes by la vendee be constantly threatened certainly greater portion still must have gone off to home rather than join in must seem to so terrible affair a march on paris peasant be good enough at fighting though may win victory by bravery be certain to lose campaign by independent habit feeling convinced that approach of vendean army must enable enterprise to be carried out by much smaller body than have at first appeared necessary jean martin told two sailor that have better abstain from broaching matter to more of acquaintance have already obtained adhesion of of whose fidelity felt absolutely assured must one of others whom intended to approach turn traitor must overthrow chance of success might cause such alarm to authority that execution must go on more rapidly than before fate of friend be precipitated day by day excitement in city increased general beysser canclaux have under command ten thousand men there be chance of further reinforcement reaching felt confident that must successfully defend town with force have charette marched to ponts de ce crossing there joined cathelineau danger must have be much more formidable instead of so doing be advancing directly towards nantes on south side of river few place remaining in hand of republican being hastily evacuated on approach here however must give slight aid to cathelineau for bridge crossing loire must be defended by comparatively small force provided with cannon to sweep approach in order to reassure townspeople encourage troop french general a enemy approached moved out with large proportion of force threw up intrenchment mile half outside town feeling confident that must withstand attack in open country a many of peasant fled into nantes especially who in village have rendered obnoxious by persecution of suspected of royalist leaning who be personally obnoxious to leigh be able to gather whole of party in town be like other peasant to sleep in open square down near wall be always to go about in pair to meet pierre andre at place hour arranged by be supplied with money sufficient to buy bread be warned on account to make conspicuous in way with be men from martin estate who have answered to summons clothes have be bought for twelve sailor engaged by medart rouget fireball have be prepared in cabin of fishing boat of fourteen fisherman be to carry two of leader have carefully gone round quarter have picked out store warehouse into fireball be to be flung among be several wood yard private house be to be fired that flame must spread to be likely enough at least there must be time for woman child to escape having decided upon place to be fired sailor be one by one taken round two building assigned to pointed out so that there must be confusion loss of time when signal be given only two store near water have be marked down for destruction namely belonging to martin be leigh work a firm business be extinct be now sole property of jacques martin there be probability that martin senior jean must ever recover share in a in of store considerable quantity of spirit in addition to wine be housed not only must loss be very heavy interest excited in vicinity must increase confusion alarm must prevail desailles be in daily communication with friend learned that list of prisoner be being taken now more in order in stood farce of trial have be gone through in case of jean wife have of course be condemned stood good deal lower on list than father there be not much chance of day of execution being settled before arrival of vendean force number of name however above of monsieur martin be rapidly decreasing there be imminent danger that might be included in fatal list before arrival on twenty sixth of june vendeans arrived within few mile of town formal summons be sent in to general be briefly refused general canclaux believed that have so strengthened advanced position be occupied by best troop that must be able to repulse cathelineau force there vendeans however being informed by peasantry of formidable nature of intrenchment decided that must be dangerous to attack consequently moved round so a to threaten town from north charette on side moved force up within cannon shot of bridge at eight o'clock on evening of twenty seventh sound of heavy firing be heard in nantes column of vendeans have attacked nort place lying to north of town be defended by six hundred troop of line body of national guard maintained there during night at daybreak fell back upon town leaving cannon behind considerable body of troop moved out to cover retreat confident that attack must begin that evening preparation for action be made by jean leigh powder barrel be dug up hole bored for fuse boy be informed that hour for action be at hand be ordered to lie down at nightfall in open space facing front of prison scattering among others who must be sleeping there in expectation of attack on town beginning must be standing in group listening for must be among a hour neared twelve be to gather in body sailor be not to begin work until attack on town commenced in earnest jean with twelve tenant be to come up at twelve exact moment for attack be to be decided upon by progress made by fire when have have effect leigh be to fall upon guard round prison jean with band to run forward to gate plant powder barrel against light fuse run back a soon a have killed driven away guard leigh party be to return to front there andre with band be to station to hold gate against armed body might arrive while leigh with others entered prison aided if necessary to overpower warder blow open door of cell prisoner be to be told that charette army be on other side of loire that best plan be to make way down to river seize boat get across at five o'clock in afternoon charette gun opened against barricade have be thrown up at bridge canclaux seeing that attack upon north have rendered useless for to retain advanced post ordered troop there to fall back into town at ten o'clock in evening at eleven whole garrison be concentrated in nantes finding that with exception of cannonade on side across river remained quiet leigh passed word round among follower to remain a be until further order jean men came up by two three before twelve too lay down a if to sleep seated on step of house few of inhabitant have retired to rest knew that at moment storm might break awaited attack with hope that time of release from tyranny under have for month groaned have come while others trembled at thought of vengeance that if town be taken must fall upon who have be concerned in what have passed martin desailles presently joined leigh a time went on began to fear that for reason other vendeans have determined to delay attack until next day at past two charette cannonade redoubled in vigour rattle of musketry showed that troop be advancing battery of defender opened with equal violence musketry answered that of assailant on opposite bank think that must be signal for cathelineau to begin martin said ten minute later attack commenced with fury upon gate of vannes rennes that by river window be opened anxious face looked out night be dark few oil lamp alone threw feeble light on square suddenly broad glare rose to west murmur there be house on fire passed from mouth to mouth in few minute flame be seen rising at dozen point cry of consternation arose brigand have entered town be going to burn to ground man after man of little group of national guard who have be gathered talking in front of door of prison be seen to detach from to move quietly away then at window noticed four five party of men move forward from among who be standing talking when within short distance of guard there be sharp command group rushed towards gate together there be shout cry then there be silence taken wholly by surprise guard have fallen under knife of vendeans without having have time to fire shot then majority of assailant ran off half one way other following wall of prison two pistol shot be fired moment later men who have remained at gate drew back for distance there be short pause then tremendous explosion people gathered in place save who have carried out affair fled with cry of terror then jean party dashed forward towards shattered gate entered prison shot cut down frightened warder a came running out dazed bewildered at sound of explosion jean seized one of by throat illustration jean seized one of by throat where be key kept answer will blow out brain frightened ruffian at once led way to chief warder room have already fallen being one of first to run down there be two bunch of key be of door of corridor man said taking down one bunch others be of cell now go before open one mind be soon joined by leigh with party who have made short work of few guard who remained at post outside prison set men to blow in door jean said must take hour to unlock at rate pistol be at once applied to keyhole lock destroyed there be few separate cell prisoner be for most part crowded twenty thirty together in larger room a entered room leigh shouted direction agreed on to prisoner in short time came upon jean who a have be arranged have first gone to room where father patsey be confined jean started with at once with six of men leaving leigh desailles to see to release of rest of prisoner a soon a room have be burst open unlocked party with at gate hurried away street be light a sheet of flame rose from store of jacques martin musketry fire on wharf showed that there be troop stationed there a hurried along shout of alarm rose in town showed that news of attack upon prison have spread rapidly a soon a released prisoner knew that be well above bridge silence on wharf showed that none of troop be stationed there shout of delight arose there be good many boat moored to bank fugitive threw into get out oar row straight across leigh shouted if drift down stream will come under fire of troop there then having done work band went up hundred yard farther where knew that three large boat be lying in took place started to row across river in five minute reached opposite bank sprang out with shout of joy at finding again in own country most of fugitive also gained opposite bank boat in there be few capable of handling oar drifted down river lost most of number from fire of troop on bank before must land among men of charette army leigh with boy soon joined other party who have landed hundred yard higher up be joyful meeting indeed between patsey jean tell be doing that have be got out said felt sure must manage somehow have already arranged plan jean with wife father twelve men be to start at once for parthenay where lescure be in command leigh have determined to join cathelineau with a many of band a chose to accompany desailles must go with jean boy on choice being given almost decided to accompany leigh be excited at success have attended tremendous roll of fire round town showed how fiercely countryman be fighting longed to join in conflict saying goodbye to who be going leigh party towed one of boat mile up river then crossing soon joined party engaged vendeans have already advanced distance house garden be fiercely contested hour after hour passed troop be beginning to be discouraged be broad daylight now vendeans pressed forward at point more hotly than ever troop be falling into disorder must soon have become disorganized mass when musket ball fired from window struck cathelineau in breast a with officer who have be considerably increased in number owing to many gentleman who have joined at saumur be leading on troop cry of dismay rose from who saw fall news spread like wildfire among peasant who regarded with almost superstitious reverence have firm belief that be protected by heaven from ball of enemy loss seemed to irretrievable misfortune fierceness of attack diminished ardour be gone blue gaining courage a assailant ceased to press took offensive met with little opposition vendean army lately on point of being victorious be already breaking up ere long be scattered over country retreat being undisturbed by enemy who must scarcely believe own good fortune at having succeeded when have seemed lost cathelineau be carried off died fortnight later from effect of wound death be terrible blow to cause failure to take nantes have in be great misfortune vendeans have suffered no more heavily than enemy have cathelineau be spared matter might still have gone well with effect of death however be for time to dishearten peasantry utterly have at time term of peace must have permitted to enjoy exercise of religion to be free from conscription be offered to must gladly have be accepted charette after saw that attack upon nantes from north side of river have failed fell back with force a before into lower poitou vendeans now under bonchamp who have also be wounded retired along north bank of loire crossing river at various point a must find boat before joining in fight leigh have told band that in event of failure must recross river in boat have brought over have kept near during struggle eight of have fallen several others be wounded have received musket ball in shoulder a soon a saw that battle be lost withdrew from made way with boy to river bank recrossed stream struck across country after proceeding six mile entered wood lay down slept for hour then marched to parthenay here band broke up proceeded to home while leigh made way to lescure headquarters learned where friend be lodged joined patsey gave cry of alarm a entered fugitive have arrived before be already known that attack on nantes have failed that cathelineau be mortally wounded what be leigh be wounded in shoulder be nothing very serious think though suppose sha' be able to hold sword for time surgeon be soon fetched ball extracted wound bandaged then sat down to talk over event have occurred since have be separated monsieur martin have become broken man fact that son who assuredly have in power to protect have given over to terrible tribunal have be harder blow to than prospect of death even devotion have be shown by jean scarcely sufficed to comfort patsey be pale thin imprisonment have told upon still more thought of what jean must be suffering on account uncertainty a to fate of child even twenty four hour have elapsed since have left prison have done much for news that child be safe well have taken load off mind felt proud indeed that release that of so many others of fellow prisoner have be brought about by devotion of husband brother before day be out be laughing chatting a if nothing have happened on following morning started early reached home in afternoon be received with delight by people although many of have lost relation in recent battle house in village be placed at disposal patsey riding straight on to see child with faithful nurse soon returned now jean patsey said when with cure jules desailles sat down for quiet talk that evening what be to be next thing must ask blue that replied so far a can see will be repetition of what have taken place will invade again probably will beat back time will come with larger force at last suppose will have to endeavour to make way to england be afraid there can be question that will be end of fight a may can not withstand whole strength of france why can not fly at once monsieur martin asked difficulty in reaching coast of getting passage must be immense besides so long a la vendee resists so long be duty to fight be sure that patsey must not wish to do otherwise have be in from first must stay until end if be not killed before come if be possible to send patsey leigh away to england must gladly do so

in hand of republican although in paris public attention be concentrated on struggle british government be very badly informed a to what be passing there have ally be aware of term granted to garrison

by rochejaquelein bonchamp to whom jean introduced desailles a new comrade know nothing of fighting latter said gentleman will do best be that anyone can do rochejaquelein said heartily may say that none of with exception of monsieur bonchamp few others have experience in fighting when began have done pretty well on whole do think that have much chance of holding place jean asked told a came in at present there be not much more than eight thousand men here westermann say have about a many be so bonchamp said expect that will beat must fight will march through country wasting destroying a go be only by showing that be still formidable that must keep together be prudent cautious that can maintain succession of blow even of light one will break rock at two o'clock enemy force approached engagement soon became hot hedge be lined by peasant position strongly defended only evacuated when horn gave signal at end of two hour westermann after losing considerable number of men approached ground where cavalry must come into play leader of band have be warned that when fell back to point horn be to be sounded three time resistance be to cease at once band disperse to meet at given point two hour later seven of ten cannon have with be safely carried off although compelled to retire from position peasant be well satisfied with having withstood so long attack of equal number of troop supported by artillery much superior to own leigh have taken part in actual fighting right arm be tightly strapped bandaged across chest therefore acted only a general aide de camp will tell what be jules jean said to desailles a retired from field if be going to expose in way have done today fighting will be over before long when come to leading peasant to attack one must necessarily set men example when on defence see peasant lie down behind hedge bush show a little a possible there be walking about a if be in principal street in nantes say that must not expose good deal more than peasant in order to encourage there be limit to thing one must remember that be very short of officer that peasant brave a be must be useless without someone to direct have doubt be right jean desailles said with laugh in fact remember giving thought to matter be almost bewildered by roar of battle whistling of bullet felt like man who have taken too much wine in student day happened to more than once blood seemed to rush through vein must have given anything for order to come for to throw upon enemy will get over jean laughed same feeling be strong among men one can see how eager be for order to charge use musket be to use bayonet that be panting must make grand soldier if be well drilled disciplined unless be mistaken will see at favourite work before many day be over westermann will get to chatillon tonight when get there will find provision for troop will begin to wonder whether be wise in thus penetrating so far into nest of hornet bonchamp will give two three day to forget mauling that have given by time force will have increased will be well for westermann if manages to carry force back with news of burning of la rochejaquelein chateau on following day excited liveliest indignation young count received news with greater indifference than did around when man carry life in hand day said doe not fret over loss of house suppose must ever have sat down quietly in possession of cousin who be heir may have to wait number of year before if ever come to take possession of estate have circumstance be different loss of old chateau where family have lived for so many year must have be very grievous to at present affect comparatively little be lucky that sent off four men directly fight be over with letter to steward charging to hand over to four horse still remained in stable arrived here hour ago guessed that blue must be paying visit there in absence one of be for monsieur martin one for others will keep a spare charger have have two shot under already be likely to have more in meantime if friend monsieur desailles like to ride one be at service thank very much marquis jules said must prefer trusting to own leg profession have be peaceful one have never yet mounted horse certainly must feel utterly out of element in saddle with animal under excited almost to madness by sound of battle of two think must prefer being on ship during storm rochejaquelein laughed be matter of training said a for feel twice man on horseback do on foot have never tried fighting on foot yet must certainly feel altogether out of element first time attempted however will not press animal on will send other to cottage in heart of wood whence can have fetched when needed be sure that be greatly obliged to jean said a told when relating adventure in nantes have to leave horse behind there though have captured town must have recovered a be blue carried off two have left behind at chateau must only buy one other a came through detailed for use of wife certainly have not expected to obtain until captured from enemy be heartily obliged to not only for generous gift for thoughtful kindness in sending for for say not word rochejaquelein said be sailor be soldier between there be occasion for thanks compliment must have done same for be glad to be able to set on horseback again indeed be not sure be not little selfish in matter for yesterday missed company of brother in law greatly felt must give good deal to hear cheery laugh confident tone a usual army dispersed after victory there be few day quiet for on fourteenth gathered to oppose advance of strong french column from brissac on morning of fifteenth early just a troop be getting into movement vendeans burst down upon number be not large for notice have be short only peasant of surrounding district have have time to gather nevertheless attacked with such energy led by rochejaquelein d'elbee that fought way into middle of camp captured headquarters with correspondence treasury scattered several battalion in utter confusion on return of advanced guard under situation changed fugitive be rallied after long fierce fighting vendeans drew off must admit failure said rochejaquelein who have with little troop of mounted men be in thick of fight charging again again into midst of enemy covering retreat when began by opposing determined front to enemy cavalry failure glorious one be superior to in number yet if have be that advanced guard returned while men be scattered intent upon plunder of headquarters must have won day however will have reinforcement up in couple of day on seventeenth french column resumed march santerre command led way to vihiers reached without opposition rest of division arrived in afternoon have left at previous halting place heavy baggage with portion of artillery ammunition scarcely have arrived at vihiers when tremendous explosion told that guard left behind have be overpowered store of ammunition destroyed feeling of uneasiness alarm spread through army santerre battalion be at once attacked by rochejaquelein who have small body of men with who thought to take advantage of alarm explosion must naturally cause among enemy santerre battalion however stood firm vendeans be drawn off in night however main body of peasant arrived at one o'clock next day made attack menou with rest of command have now come up of battalion a before stood steadily rest of army dispirited by perseverance with vendeans in spite of failure loss be ever ready to renew attack speedily lost heart in two hour right fell back in disorder panic spread in short time rout became general in vain officer endeavoured to check fugitive so great be terror that in three hour panic stricken mob traversed distance between vihiers saumur thus second great invasion of la vendee have met with greater success than first two strong column have advanced in full confidence of success have returned utterly discomfited westermann division have be annihilated army from saumur have lost great number of men have for time ceased to be military body bocage with sombre wood thick hedge brave population seemed destined to become grave of republican army order to advance into be in sufficient to shake courage of who boasted so loudly when at distance be grave too of reputation of french general one after have tried failed be disgraced first general marce be superseded by berruyer berruyer by biron who be recalled guillotined westermann be also tried having powerful friend be acquitted general of division have come gone in number have be dismissed at own urgent request allowed to return to district commanded before outbreak of insurrection one have failed one too have never ceased from time joined army of invasion to send report after report to convention complaining of untrustworthiness of troop bad conduct uselessness of officer want of sufficient staff to maintain discipline restore order indeed bulk of revolutionary troop possessed little more discipline than vendeans being uninspired a be latter by feeling either of religion of patriotic enthusiasm be match for men who be willing to give life for cause vendeans be far better armed than when commenced struggle then proportion of men who be possessed of musket firearm of kind be extremely small now thanks to immense quantity have be captured in hand of prisoner thrown away by fugitive found in storehouse of town there be sufficient to supply almost man of population with firearm in addition possessed good many piece of artillery unfortunately have learned little during four month fighting method be unchanged love of home overpowered other consideration after victory a after defeat hurried away leaving with general only officer small body of men who be emigre who have returned from england to take part in struggle royalist who have made way from distant part of france for same purpose after capture of saumur too good many swiss german belonging to cavalry regiment formed of foreigner have deserted joined vendeans thus small nucleus of army held together swelling only when church bell summoned peasant to take up arm for few day while royalist of la vendee remained quiescent after have expelled invader republican more alarmed than ever be making most tremendous effort to stamp out insurrection beysser who have commanded at nantes be appointed to succeed menou order be given that forest hedge of la vendee be to be levelled crop destroyed cattle seized good of insurgent confiscated enormous number of cart be collected to carry faggot tar other combustible into la vendee for setting fire to wood be actually proposed to destroy whole male population to deport woman child to repeople la vendee from other part of france from immigrant must be attracted by offer of free land house santerre suggested that poisonous gas must be inclosed in suitable vessel fired into district to poison atmosphere carrier infamous scoundrel who have be appointed commissioner at nantes proposed equally villainous scheme namely that great quantity of bread mixed with arsenic must be baked scattered broadcast so that starving people might eat be destroyed wholesale must have be carried out have not be vigorously opposed by general kleber who have now taken command of one of army of invasion rest of july first half of august passed comparatively quietly general toncq advanced with column into la vendee fought two three battle in generally gained success over peasant with exception forward movement be made majority of peasant remained undisturbed in home soon however from side flood of invader poured in fewer than two hundred thousand men be now under order of french general advanced from different direction in case carrying out order of convention to devastate country burn down wood destroy crop slay inhabitant five army moved forward simultaneously that commanded by kleber consisting of veteran battalion of mayence everywhere be met charette have marched to aid of vendeans of north country be divided into four district commanded by charette bonchamp lescure la rochejaquelein of strove to defend own district war now assumed terrible aspect maddened by atrocity perpetrated upon peasant no longer gave quarter to who fell into hand in despair performed prodigy of valour have not now a at commencement of war superiority in number instead of fighting generally four to one against blue latter now exceeded in same proportion peasant have changed tactic instead of rushing impetuously upon enemy line hurling upon artillery utilized natural feature of country a republican column marched along believing that there be enemy near must hear sound of horn from behind hedge thicket tree stream of musketry must break out very soon column must fall into confusion lane must be blocked with dead horse immovable waggon in vain must soldier try to force way through hedge to return fire of invisible foe then a suddenly a attack commenced peasant must leap from shelter with knife bayonet carry havoc among enemy tactic prevailed over number even when a in case of kleber division number possessed military discipline training high reputation for month fighting be almost continuous at end of time to stupefaction of convention two hundred thousand troop be driven out of la vendee at point by fourth of number of undisciplined peasant never perhaps in history of military warfare did enthusiasm valour accomplish marvel second half of september be spent by peasant at home rejoicing returning thanks for success already heavy blow be being struck at cause charette hotheaded impetuous self confident have always preferred carrying out own plan without regard to of leader in upper vendee now quarrelled with a to course have best be pursued left with force that have brought with to renew war in south although peasant rejoiced leader knew that struggle must not long continue number of fighting men be to say of whole male population of la vendee capable of bearing arm have diminished terribly indeed number originally responded to summons of church bell be decreased by fully half food be scarce owing to continued absence of peasant harvest have in many place not be garnered wherever republican troop have passed destruction have be complete large portion of population be very movement of vendeans be hampered by crowd of woman child who with few belonging that have saved packed in little cart wandered almost aimlessly through country many of town be in ruin deserted in save few secluded spot a yet unvisited by republican want misery be universal there be thought of surrender among chief peasant alike idea a last resource must be necessary to abandon la vendee altogether to take refuge in brittany where vast majority of population be favourable to gradually gained ground general beysser canclaux dubayet be recalled by convention for failure to obtain success l'echelle be appointed to command having kleber westermann a leader of principal division jean martin leigh have joined friend in retreat in forest after repulse of republican column have heard while engaged in thick of fighting of death of monsieur martin have never recovered from effect of imprisonment at nantes instead of gaining strength have become weaker weaker terrible uncertainty of position news constantly arrived of desperate battle conviction that in end vendeans must be crushed told heavily upon took to bed sank gradually be not sorry child said to patsey day before died that be going to leave be wrong in not taking jean advice sailing for england with wife daughter however be useless to think of now can see terrible time in store for here be evident that mercy be to be shown to vendeans have be decreed by convention that be to be hunted down like wild beast have lived must have be terrible burden to must have hampered movement destroyed chance whatever that might have of escaping from fiend must have be impossible for to have supported fatigue hardship of flight must have be mean of bringing destruction on be therefore better in respect must go pray that heaven will protect jean brave brother enable to reach england in safety will bear last message to wife louise will tell that last thought be of last feeling one of gratitude to god that be in safety have be permitted to die in peace quiet be sad homecoming time jean patsey said a husband leigh rode up to door be indeed patsey yet even when news came to must scarcely grieve that be so have seen how be fading when went away be not surprised when heard that have gone for be one care one anxiety le in future patsey will be together can not leave here when leigh be away child will go with when be lost will escape die together be glad to hear say so jean have be terrible waiting here knowing that be in midst of danger that even while thought of might be lying dead will be glad indeed to share fate whatever be for three week little party lived quietly in cottage there be many discussion a to future be agreed that in case of final reverse must be better that must travel alone more of there be more certain to attract observation jean said must go without francois marthe chance of safety will be greater if either return to village take up abode with family of woodman rather marthe safety must be greater a to francois have long be eager to join in fighting be only fidelity have constrained to remain in what considers be disgraceful position when other man who can bear arm be fighting will therefore take with when day of battle come will join fighting men if be defeated must care for own safety when fight will always leave at village mile two away will have horse ready to mount will join at once if be defeated ought to be disguised jean leigh said must be well jean said hardly see what disguise must be of use to certainly not that of peasant for in dress must be shot down without question by first party of blue came across even if succeed in reaching river crossing may be sure that authority will be everywhere on lookout for fugitive peasant must be better to be shot at once than to await in prison death by guillotine must say that doe not matter bit how be dressed till reach river know now pretty nearly lane in country leigh said must think that ought to be able to reach loire be where difficulty will begin in first place there will be trouble of crossing then that of making way through country certainly must not do so a vendean peasant must say jean that best disguise must be of fairly well to do townspeople something like wore into nantes rather le formal sort of thing that ordinary tradesman without strong political feeling way must wear say that will not be suspected however be dressed because one in sens must be travelling about just at present when once get beyond tour if go way might pas without much notice way do think that ought to go jean jean shrugged shoulder see that there be choice there must be very little chance of escaping from of port of brittany la rochelle must be still more hopeless a far south a bordeaux must be in comparatively peaceful country must hope to find friend there eastern frontier be of course safest to cross distance be very great in town near border very sharp lookout be kept to prevent emigre escaping there be rumour that lyon have declared against convention if got there be certain that must be la vendee over again lyon can not resist france a soon a have done with here will be able to send number of troop to stamp out rising undoubtedly if must get there toulon must be best place have heard for certain that have driven out extreme party have admitted english fleet once there must be able to take berth in ship bound somewhere abroad matter little where thence get passage to england most probably will be able to arrange to go direct from toulon for there be sure to be vessel coming going with store for british fleet must be terrible journey jean wife said yes think must be quite out of question seems to that best chance must be either to cross loire then make for le man so up through alencon to honfleur way must be east of disturbed district if found that vast number of fugitive have made way into brittany a be almost certain to be case might bear more to east go up through vendome chartres evreux then branch off strike seine near honfleur in case must be outside district where must be searching for fugitive from here once on seashore on seine must be hard if must not steal fishing boat cross channel however one must of course be guided by circumstance still do think that must be a well to buy disguise leigh suggests without loss of time will ride over to chatillon tomorrow get chapter across loire marthe be filled with grief when heard that have be decided that be better that must return to native village mistress pointed out to that if went well must rejoin if thing went badly escaped must send for wherever might be in case disaster compelled to fly three person be a many a must hope to travel together without exciting suspicion nurse however begged that at rate might go with to headquarters of army everyone be going said say that if be beaten in next battle will cross loire take refuge in brittany for blue will not leave soul alive in la vendee must have nowhere to go to here will keep with others happens if be with madame can rejoin if not hope to be with afterward be indeed exodus rather than gathering of army be taking place atrocity committed by invader destruction of village cloud of smoke ascended from burning wood created so terrible scare among peasant that greater portion of village farm be entirely deserted road leading to chollet be rendezvous where fighting men be ordered to gather be crowded with fugitive francois walked by horse head patsey nurse child with trunk containing article of absolute necessity occupied cart jean leigh rode ahead company of cathelineau scout no longer existed more than half of have fallen in late battle service be no longer required a scout survivor have joined father brother formed part of command of bonchamp on fourteenth of october enemy column be closing in upon chollet round mortagne be marching forward when advanced guard under general beaupuy be suddenly attacked by vendeans while entangled in lane head of column fought well in rear finding also attacked fearing that retreat must be cut off retired hastily to mortagne column must have be destroyed have not beaupuy promptly sent up large reinforcement after long obstinate fight vendeans be driven from wood republican artillery opening upon be compelled to retire to chollet here halt be made kleber have also be fiercely attacked have also though with much difficulty repulsed assailant next morning republican entered chollet found deserted by enemy on seventeenth whole force being now concentrated there be about to move forward towards beaupreau when advanced guard be hotly attacked in short time combat became general for time vendeans bore down opposition a whole of republican force came into action advance be arrested battle began soon after one o'clock raged without intermission till decisive advantage have be gained on side result be still doubtful when panic took place among multitude of noncombatant in rear of vendeans cry be raised to loire panic spread in vain leader officer galloped backwards forward endeavouring to restore confidence shouted to men victory be still in grasp in darkness din must only be heard by immediately round even failed to reanimate men who have for seven hour fought a kleber reported like tiger lost heart lescure have fallen in fighting on fourteenth bonchamp d'elbee be desperately wounded at battle at chollet be carried off by men la rochejaquelein with whom jean martin leigh be riding have made almost superhuman effort to check panic fell back almost broken hearted with band of peasant who held together to last on previous day leigh have escorted patsey to beaupreau be to town that fugitive made way arriving there at midnight thank god that be alive patsey said bursting into tear a husband entered room in be established can hardly believe jean said have be terrible day indeed men fought nobly firmly believe that must have won day have not unaccountable panic set in what caused know not be doing well everywhere have begun to drive back must have fought on for half hour be likely that a usual panic must have seized however patsey must have gathered again stronger than ever must have come to same thing in long run now put on disguise at once will lie down for two hour see off before daybreak know whether la rochejaquelein who must now be considered in command since d'elbee bonchamp be desperately wounded will gather force to act a rearguard if so must stay with think that even influence must suffice to hold considerable body of peasant together have convinced that there be safety in brittany at rate enemy will need day rest before pursue must have suffered quite a heavily a have night however be not to pas quietly at two o'clock two officer who have remained a piquet rode into town with news that westermann division have marched through moulet have taken part in action be approaching horn sounded alarm fugitive started up renewed flight marthe must not be left behind now did others desire until have crossed loire there must be separation for whole country must swarm in forty eight hour with party of enemy hunting down slaying who have taken refuge in wood jean leigh have lain down in cart to prevent of fugitive seizing two woman child be hurried down took place in francois who have escaped have fortunately found took rein journey be continued there be pursuit be only portion of westermann force have arrived be so exhausted worn out by length of march by fact that have be unable to obtain food by way that threw down when reached town incapable of marching mile farther at beaupreau there have be no fewer than five thousand republican prisoner kept under guard on arrival of routed vendeans peasant a last act of retaliation must have slain bonchamp who be at point of death ordered to be set free be last order that will ever give said to peasant assembled round litter surely will not disobey child order be obeyed prisoner be at once sent off a republican column marched out from chollet next day encountered on road liberated comrade sentiment with commissioner of convention be animated be evidenced by fact that one of declared in letter to commander in chief of army that release of prisoner by vendeans be regrettable affair recommended that mention must be made of in despatch to paris lest act of mercy by insurgent must arouse public opinion to insist upon cessation of measure have be taken for annihilation of vendeans fugitive vast crowd of over one hundred thousand men woman child reached saint florent without coming in contact with enemy republican general indeed have idea that peasant have intention of quitting beloved country imagined that must disperse to home again that there remained only task of hunting down company have be left on hill commanded saint florent have idea of being attacked have not even taken precaution of removing boat across river a soon a arrived vendeans attacked post with fury captured twenty boat be found crossing be effected with little difficulty there be still two three thousand principally woman child to be taken over when party of republican dragoon arrived number of woman child be massacred great bulk flying precipitately regained country beyond height of saint florent took refuge in wood multitude be for present safe there be strong force of enemy between nantes saumur halted for night dispirited worn out filled with grief have left home cared for behind be in strange country without aim purpose only hope being that breton must rise join poor hope since terrible vengeance have be taken on la vendee must not strike terror throughout brittany also jean martin leigh have seen patsey nurse placed in one of first boat crossed go far from spot where land said will stay here until be over if blue come up before have crossed will swim across with horse be under uneasiness about taking horse out of shaft of cart putting saddle that have brought with on back left three animal in charge of francois then aided other officer to keep order among crowd to prevent from pressing into boat a returned from other bank in such number a to sink day work went on quietly regularly until so comparatively few remained that hope became strong that must cross before of enemy arrived that hope be destroyed when suddenly enemy cavalry appeared at edge of slope came galloping down officer in vain tried to get few men remained to make stand be too dispirited to attempt to do so little throng broke up fled one way fortunately empty boat have just returned into other officer leapt while jean with two companion led horse into water have already linked rein francois be unable to swim at jean order took hold of tail of horse in middle while jean leigh swam by head of two outside horse without difficulty other side be gained patsey who have have eye fixed upon day be standing at spot where landed be near town of ancenis portion of vendeans entered place be wholly undefended inhabitant be in abject terror thinking that town must be sacked be surprised to find that peasant did one harm be ready to pay for anything that required so long indeed a money remained vendeans paid scrupulously when be expended chief did only thing in power issuing note promising to pay although have value save in good faith of vendeans be received by breton a readily a assignats of republic indeed like note of vendeans be never destined to be paid have army plunged into brittany after capture of saumur there can be doubt that peasantry must everywhere have risen coming a fugitive exile be warning rather than source of enthusiasm although small number of peasant joined accession of force be very trifling jean martin wife leigh held anxious consultation that evening have found poor lodging after attending meeting of leader at la rochejaquelein have be unanimously elected commander in chief bonchamp having died while d'elbee wounded to death have be left at cottage of breton peasant who promised to conceal young soldier have accepted fearful responsibility with greatest reluctance around saw plainly enough that only hope of escape from annihilation be landing of british force to assistance unhappily however england have not a yet awoke to tremendous nature of struggle be going on army be small one fleet a yet have not attained dimension be before many year to render unquestioned mistress of sea feeling that revolution be fruit of century of oppression terrible a be excess committed in name of liberty cause of revolution be still cause of people of europe have created party sufficiently powerful to hamper ministry moreover government be badly informed in respect by agent in france have idea of extent of rising in la vendee how nobly people there have be defending against whole force of france be not too much to say that have england at time landed twenty thousand troop in brittany la vendee whole course of event in europe must have be changed french revolution must have be crushed before became formidable to europe countless million of money million of life must have be saved throughout france there be considerable portion of population who must have rejoiced in overthrow of republic for even in large town crime have provoked reaction toulon have opened gate to english lyon be in arm against republic normandy discontent be general peasantry must have joined of brittany la vendee have there be fair prospect of success england however did nothing stood passive until peasantry of la vendee be exterminated indeed added to misfortune by promising aid that never be sent thus encouraging to maintain resistance added to exasperation of enemy to own misfortune suffering what be going to do patsey asked a husband leigh returned from meeting be more than anyone can say jean replied will for present move north be like flight of locust must move since must eat district must furnish subsistence for eighty thousand people for more than day two there can be doubt that impulse to cross loire be mad one on other side at least knew country must have be far better to have died fighting there than to throw across river be well nigh miracle that got across will need nothing short of miracle to get back again of one thing may be sure whole host of enemy will by time be in movement must never have got across have dreamed that such be intention now that have done may be sure that will strain effort to prevent from returning probably by time force be marching to cross at nantes other half be pressing on to saumur in three four day will be united again will be between river be smaller body be only men must say that ought to march twenty mile north then sweep round east west while enemy followed north bank of river to effect junction must march night without halt pas hurl upon saumur nantes so return to la vendee with such host a there must be little hope of success fancy that will march to laval there halt for day two by time whole force of enemy will have come up there will be battle jean see nothing for to march with know nothing of movement of enemy be to try to make way across country might run into arm besides leigh have agreed that at present at least can not leave rochejaquelein must not indeed patsey leigh broke in if have seen evening when with tear in eye accepted choice must feel a do be very well for before to talk of making off now that worst have happened if be only for sake must stay by though think that jean with responsibility of child must be justified in going patsey said firmly come will stay together a jean said can not desert cause now a long a there be battle to fight must stay with be not until further fighting have become impossible that like others must endeavour to shift for well spoken patsey husband said that must be course so long a vendeans hang together with rochejaquelein at head must remain true to cause that have taken up when once again army becomes mass of fugitive can without loss of honour clear consciousness that have done duty to end think of safety grant that if one must find safe asylum for louis in cottage of breton peasant interrupted must never consent to will remain together jean come what may if be lost will ask to put pistol to head must thousand time rather die so than fall into hand of blue either be slaughtered mercilessly thrown into one of prison to linger until guillotine released agree with in patsey well will regard matter a settled a long a army hang together so long will remain with after will carry out plan talked over make for coast by way seems most open to next day be spent by rochejaquelein officer in going about among peasant did not disguise from extreme peril of position pointed out that be only by holding together by defeating blue whenever attacked that must hope for safety be difficult to cross loire before said will be tenfold more difficult now boat will have be taken over to other side may be sure that strong body of enemy will have be posted along bank to prevent returning have fought well before must fight even better in future for there be retreat home to retire to life of woman child with depend upon being victorious have beaten blue almost time that have met must have beaten last time have not sort of madness seized be not who led across loire have chosen to come have followed at rate be better to die fighting for god country than to be slaughtered unresistingly by murderer saw how fell upon helpless one who be unable to cross with how murdered woman child although there be resistance nothing to excite anger if die die a martyr to faith loyalty man must wish for better death be not lost yet defeat blue brittany may yet rise besides be promised aid from england at rate la vendee have be true to herself through over six month of terrible struggle la vendee may perish let world see that have be true to herself to end fugitive priest with army seconded effort of officer by feeling of resolution hope succeeded depression caused by terrible event of preceding thirty six hour be with air of calmness courage that march be recommenced on following morning instant that became known that vendeans have crossed loire panic seized republican at nantes messenger be sent to implore commander in chief to march with haste to aid must a believed vendeans be marching to assail town kleber with division started at once followed more slowly by main body of army column advanced to saint florent obtaining boat crossed river entered anger to immense relief of republican there who have be in state of abject terror at presence so near of vendeans kleber marched with great rapidity passed through nantes without stopping established at camp of saint george news of what be termed glorious victory at chollet although in point of fact republican fell back after battle to town caused

be extremely heavy kleber division alone having lost over thousand men beaupuy have suffered even more heavily while division of chalbos grenadier of bloss have also lost large number total loss including deserter amounted to over four thousand whole of cannon of two first division have fallen into hand of enemy artilleryman having cut trace large number of ammunition waggon quantity of cart

order of general napoleon afterwards pronounced that tactic pursued by la rochejaquelein showed that possessed highest military genius be night alone saved routed army of republic from absolute destruction be probable that at time vendean general have idea of completeness of victory that have won of disorganization of enemy have known must doubtless have attacked again on following day when must have experienced resistance must have captured anger without firing shot must have chosen have recrossed loire vendeans however well content with success returned to laval there enjoyed week quiet repose crushing defeat that republican have experienced caused immense sensation at paris in town through vendeans must pas on way to capital be at time actually open to patsey be delighted when jean leigh returned unwounded seem to bear charmed life said leigh have indeed once be hit be not serious have escaped altogether what be going to be done next be going to rest here for ten day so there be plenty of food to be have rest will do wonder for men of course rode back with la rochejaquelein opinion be a always have be that march on paris will alone bring terrible business to close know that even authority will not suffice to carry out such plan a long a be in brittany be among friend be still near home to turn back on march on paris must appear so terrible undertaking reckless a be of life in battle nothing must induce to attempt after ten day delay vendeans commenced march towards coast battle at vihiers be fought on twenty seventh by sixth of november have captured town of ernee de fougeres defeating at latter place three battalion dol be next captured mayenne opened gate without resistance greatest effort be made by republican to place seaport in state of defence cherbourg must have be best point for fugitive to attack a here must have found abundance of powder of be in great need cannon here might have defended until promised help arrived from england granville however have be fixed upon by british government march thither be shorter therefore be against granville that attack be directed considerable portion of force with artillery be left at avranches although assured that march to sea be made in order to obtain succour there from england there be much fear among peasant that intention of chief be to embark to leave army to fate consequently advanced against granville with le energy enthusiasm than usual however league out of town came upon portion of garrison repulsed so successfully that entered one of suburb with garrison have for most part shut up in fort commanded town having erected strong palisade across street leading to four hundred men occupied post vendeans have ax to cut down palisade powder to blow then in be therefore obliged to content with musketry fire against a garrison be well supplied with ammunition kept up constant fire suffered heavily when night came vendeans scattered among house to find food fire shelter night battery on height played upon in morning republican redoubled fire became evident that town must not be taken mass of vendeans without order from chief began to retire in short time whole be in rapid retreat to avranches there cry be raised back to la vendee la rochejaquelein after halting force on main road few hour called upon men to follow to caen only one thousand did so on arriving at village learned that bulk of army instead of being behind have marched towards pontorson be therefore forced to retrace step to follow on overtaking found that have already carried bridge driven away enemy occupied town enemy be closing round capture of pontorson deranged plan of republican place have be held by four thousand men ten piece of cannon a must be approached only by narrow defile be believed that must be impossible for vendeans to force way into however after three hour fighting desperate valour won day republican be routed with loss of most of cannon affair indeed appeared to peasant to be miracle granted in favour with renewed heart marched next night to dol kleber be with large force in neighbourhood impetuosity of westermann again upset plan a soon a latter heard that pontorson have be carried by vendeans that have marched to dol pursued with three thousand infantry two hundred cavalry four cannon arrived within short distance of dol at six in evening without waiting for infantry to come up charged into town for moment spread confusion among vendeans illustration westermann cavalry charged into street of dol however soon recovered from surprise drove enemy out with loss westermann infantry took part in action kleber be occupied in closing route by vendeans must leave dol westermann who have held communication with knew nothing of plan marched with marigny division with six thousand men to attack town did at two o'clock in morning vendeans at once rushed to meet first tried to turn right failed here also in attack on left fought however so fiercely that westermann withdrew troop to position that have occupied before attacking vendeans however gave time to form in order of battle heralding charge with heavy musketry fire rushed down upon enemy at once broke leaving cannon behind continued flight till reached pontorson in meantime marceau be advancing with division by road vendeans hearing ceased pursuit of westermann routed division moved against at four o'clock in morning attacked when within league of dol combat ensued that lasted for three hour vendeans then drew off on learning that division of muller be on point of joining that of marceau together division must have forced way into dol muller be hopelessly drunk being senior officer greatest confusion arose have vendeans known what be taking place must have gained decisive victory marceau seeing that must hing to restore order rode at full speed to kleber headquarters at daybreak two general arrived at spot found two division mingled in supreme disorder brigade battalion being mixed up together finding that nothing must be done with there kleber drew off confusion being almost converted into rout by fire of about hundred vendeans council of war be held eighteen hundred men with two gun be sent to pontorson to join westermann defeated division that general be ordered to advance again at once upon dol kleber opposed rest of council coming at last to opinion order be sent to westermann to remain on defensive await fresh order westermann however a usual disregarded marching through night approached town arrived early in morning at village close to sounding of church bell told that vendeans have discovered enemy in few minute be seen rushing a usual to attack in spite of reinforcement have reached westermann troop fought worse than have done two night before reinforcement be first to give way advanced guard speedily turned fled westermann marigny with small party of cavalry fought desperately to cover retreat marigny however fell whole force became mass of fugitive kleber on way next day to reconnoitre town met vendeans advancing scattering rapidly occupied ridge attacked brigade formed advanced guard so fiercely that broke fled kleber sent to fetch battalion of troop of mayence a soon a arrived with battalion of grenadier formed in order of battle other troop came up prepared for serious engagement at moment vendean column have defeated westermann showed on right flank of republican threatened rear kleber ordered of battalion to take post further back to cover line of retreat other battalion seeing movement believing to be signal for retreat followed grenadier alone stood firm defended for three hour in meantime greater portion of republican army be already in full flight retreat be ordered troop remaining on field retired at first in good order a victorious vendeans pressed on speedily became rout marceau gathering together such soldier a still retained presence of mind endeavoured to defend bridge of antrain vendeans pressing forward swept away fugitive fled in confused mob a far a rennes vendeans on entering antrain at once scattered in search of food disregarding order entreaty of la rochejaquelein stofflet who urged to press hotly upon routed enemy so to complete victory have won at antrain learned that wounded who have be left in hospital at fougeres have be murdered in bed by blue accordingly shot prisoner have taken in battle victory seemed to open way to loire vendeans steadily marched south through mayenne laval arrived in front of anger city be longer in defenceless state in be when first crossed loire a soon a be perceived to be point for vendeans be marching four thousand troop be thrown into preparation made for stout defence if defend a ought to do la rochejaquelein said to two three of officer among whom be jean martin there be hope of taking town have cannon to blow down wall mean of scaling thirty six hour be utmost can hope for operation kleber rest of will be up by time however be sole hope possibly panic may seize when attack even coward will fight behind wall after failure at granville have little hope of taking anger especially a must know how soon army will be up affair be repetition of at vendeans at once obtained possession of one of suburb twenty piece of cannon opened fire upon from wall while from house vendeans replied with musketry fire during night number of men laboured to undermine wall by one of gate partially succeeded day broke before work be completed defender planted several cannon to bear upon vendeans be too much discouraged to make further effort when few hour later news came that republican army be fast approaching must reach ground in hour time again got into motion pursued hopeless journey in search of point where must cross river if only to die in beloved land on following day kleber be reinforced by column eight thousand strong from cherbourg reconnaissance be made along road by vendeans have retreated found everywhere body of men woman child who have succumbed to cold fatigue misery westermann cavalry set out in pursuit muller following with division to support marceau be now appointed commander in chief pending arrival of turreau rossignol latter have almost from commencement of war intrigued against general concerned in operation especially against kleber be utterly without military talent owed position simply to devotion to convention readiness to denounce men who failed to satisfy anticipation of easy victory who showed slightest repugnance to execute barbarous decree with exception of three thousand men who marched at head of vendean column fugitive be now utterly disheartened many hid musket cutting stick thought that being longer armed must not be molested by enemy night number stole away in group of two three in hope of finding boat on bank of river others scattered among village appearance exciting compassion fear of troop be more powerful

over one hundred thousand men between la vendee intended after giving much needed rest to march round through chateaudun to come down on loire above orleans so to make way back into poitou have have with only men project difficult a seemed might possibly have be accomplished unembarrassed by baggage train cannon peasant must have out marched pursuer hampered by crowd of wounded sick woman child

scarce drag along can not conceal from that be nearly over jean said when told wife leigh that route be changed will get to le man republican will be on heel one can not doubt what issue will be

give way behind vendean line of defence panic be gaining ground among fugitive three four thousand escaped by road to laval retreat of rest be cut off by cavalry in morning kleber division came up at once relieved marceau division have be fighting night renewed attack resistance be feeble few hundred men disputed foot of way died with consciousness that have at least covered retreat of rest hot pursuit be at once organised while taken in town be massacred at once westermann cavalry pursued fugitive in direction covering plain with corps pressing hard on rear of force still held together jean martin have day before republican attack gone with leigh to la rochejaquelein quarter told that intended if town be captured by enemy to endeavour to save life of wife by flight be quite right rochejaquelein said warmly entirely approve of determination a long a ten of men hold together be duty to remain with for have accepted position of commander must share fate to end be different with a cause of la vendee for have fought be lost first duty now be to wife trust that will three succeed in making way to england enjoy there peace rest that none can have in unhappy france thank for gallant service thank in name of la vendee leigh for manner in have fought for also for companionship have so often cheered during last day a for have wish to live must feel dishonoured be army led to be exterminated who accepted responsibility of leading to survive have consolation at least never in history have people fought more bravely against overpowering odds than la vendee have done though at present be called brigand be sure that world will acknowledge that have fought like hero for country faith unfortunate a may be be proud to be one of who have led so often to victory when will go friend intend to be with to last jean said when fight begin leigh wife will be ready at point agreed on in rear of town when be lost will join there will ride until beyond pursuit then put on disguise then will not say goodbye to now rochejaquelein said goodbye leigh may heaven keep take safely home again leigh be too much affected to speak after silent grasp of hand of gallant young soldier returned with jean to quarter occupied now for plan jean said be a vague a ever must settle now be quite evident that alarm be so widely spread here in west that will be well nigh impossible to pas through even village without being questioned alencon on north have strong garrison at mayenne on west be division whole country beyond will be alive with troop on search for fugitive be only to east that road be open to must say that safest way will be to travel so a to cross loir between chateaudun nogent then come down on road running south from fontainebleau through montargis travelling south through nevers must excite suspicion if questioned can say that be going to visit friend at macon unfortunate thing be that have paper think that story have best be that belong to le man fled in such haste when town be captured by vendeans that escaped just a stood omitted to bring paper with fortunately speak french without accent there be nothing about to give rise to suspicion that belong to la vendee if can think of more likely story a go along all better when get a far a macon if ever get there can decide whether to endeavour to cross frontier into switzerland to go down to toulon now remember patsey last injunction be that when perceive from rush of fugitive that be over that firing may still be going on be attempt to cover retreat must not wait for a soon a sound of combat approach will ride off with leigh need not suppose because join that be killed enemy may have pushed so far through town may find impossible to join from cause tarry be not to wait for if be shot will be consolation to to know that will be away under brother protection if escape will if make way to england have hope of meeting there will not be haunted with fear that have delayed too long have sacrificed life uselessly want to give solemn promise that will act thus will a soon a considers that further delay will be dangerous ride off remember that be last wish be last order will do a wish jean wife said firmly god have preserved three thus far trust that will continue to do so will have le hesitation because think that alone will have perhaps better chance of escaping than with at rate will carry out instruction must miss other be there place where can arrange to meet see that be possible to make arrangement patsey may be turned out of course by circumstance be impossible to foresee same may be case with suppose named seaport there must in first place be difficulty in finding other might see opportunity of getting across water if lost that chance might not occur again delay might cost life trust that will not be separated dear see clearly that if misfortune must happen be best that must make own way in hope of meeting at poole may be sure that will join if possible for see that if separated difficulty will be far greater than mine too must have burden of child let suppose be wounded got away managed to obtain shelter in breton cottage might be waiting for for week at agreed point now while travelling might escape many question be to stop even for few day at town village may be sure that must be questioned so closely by authority that there must be little chance of getting on must know must be fretting heart out yes see be best that must do a say jean god forbid that must be separated if come to rendezvous promise that will a wish go on by ourselves now dear will divide money have still three hundred louis left will take one hundred will take rest be much more likely to want money if be separated than have best greater part up in saddle leigh think have better divide a much a possible jean can put seventy five louis in of saddle weight must not be so great that anyone who happens to handle one of must notice can put five forty in belt round waist keep odd five in pocket for expense of course if decide to abandon horse will make other arrangement best plan leigh will be for to change louis for assignats at first opportunity gold be so scarce that time offered to pay with must excite suspicion have doubt can buy assignats here have taken quantity from enemy la rochejaquelein will be sure be glad to obtain gold for will be double advantage will have le weight to carry will be able to pay way without gold exciting suspicion assignats now be only quarter of face value so that for two hundred louis must get eight hundred louis in assignats of must take two hundred must take rest must certainly be excellent plan jean for two hundred louis in gold must be serious weight to carry if found on must in be sufficient to condemn a intending emigre jean at once took two hundred louis have hitherto be carried in wallet went out returned in hour be satisfactorily settled said blacquard who be in charge of treasury be delighted to obtain gold have given five time amount in assignats of will take two hundred fifty louis worth will have seven hundred fifty louis in assignats will divide hundred louis in gold of latter have best sew up twenty in of saddle can carry ten about people be so anxious for gold that in case of need can get service rendered for that must fail to obtain for amount of paper greater portion of assignats gold a agreed be sewn up in saddle provision packed in valise jean leigh went out together fixed upon spot where be to wait preparation be finished when firing broke out jean kissed wife may god blessing

of fugitive turned down one leading east din of battle have ceased now scattered fire of musketry showed that enemy be engaged in usual work of shooting who fell into hand after riding for hour at full speed drew rein at wood entering dismounted put on disguise have fear now of pursuit enemy cavalry must have made very long march to reach town horse must be worn out by previous exertion while own have have forty eight hour rest during time have be well fed cared for moreover pursuit be made must be in direction taken by bulk of fugitive mounting again rode on be narrow country road that be traversing during day only passed through two three small hamlet be brigand coming way be asked leigh replied be fighting at le man if be beaten wo come way will make south thought best to leave town when fighting be going on in street be time for quiet people to be off rode forty mile before night then entered wood having agreed that until got farther away from scene of action struck road running south must be better not to enter place where must be questioned choosing open space among tree leigh took off bridle to let horse pluck what grass must after giving to hunch of bread from store then

however though speaks sharply must say that be kind hearted woman however may be very thankful that have obtained shelter where can live safely quietly until have fixed on plan for future although monsieur tourrier be in matter connected with business a child in hand of wife be far better acquainted with what be passing around when leigh mentioned to that intended to ride out to versailles at once warned against doing so dear monsieur said know nothing of state of thing at arthenay for aught know people may go out riding for pleasure there must be little short of madness to attempt thing here at present thing have got to such state for man to seem richer than be in crime here must be on equality be to ride out man pas must look askance at at first village through rode must be arrested to be arrested at present be to be condemned there be question asked prisoner be brought in in bunch be condemned wholesale say nothing against condemnation of aristocrat when perhaps two three aristocrat be brought up with dozen journalist dozen others who may have be arrested merely out of spite be condemned in five minute be clear that only way to live be to avoid being arrested only way to avoid being arrested be to avoid attracting attention if be really going on matter of business must be different to ride to versailles merely to see place must be regarded a ample proof that be aristocrat one must regard paper a anything proof that have be obtained by fraud that be aristocrat spy of pitt girondist certainly enemy of convention therefore monsieur if wish to go anywhere walk go out in market cart for to ride might be fatal will take advice leigh said did not think that thing be so bad a that must not be worse monsieur must be impossible who be quiet men think that can not go on much longer even sans culotte be getting tired of bloodshed there be longer great crowd to see execution tumbril pas along without insult imprecation being hurled against prisoner men of convention having killed girondist be now quarrelling among robespierre be still powerful party opposed to be gaining in strength there be feeling ere long there will be terrible struggle between if robespierre be beaten there be many of who think that reign of terror will come to end who be too insignificant to be watched talk thing over together when gather at cafe there be one ourselves present even then talk only in whisper live in hope of change change must surely be for better chapter friend at last day after day leigh went out into town more than once saw fatal tumbril going along in distance always turned walked in opposite direction once twice having changed clothes for of workman fought way into public gallery of convention listened to speech in seemed to that principal object of speaker be to exceed who have gone before in violence that most violent be most loudly applauded by gallery assembly patsey be most anxious to be off urged that must not do to show haste did not leave house at while be out almost day at end of fortnight told monsieur tourrier that have now finished business asked if must obtain from maire of arrondissement pas down to havre be pity that did not get pas direct from arthenay said say that sister want to make inquiry about husband there that be taking down also say that be sailor yes then must think that best thing for must be to dress a sailor again will seem more natural than for to be in civilian dress can go with say that be strongly recommended to by maire adjoint at arthenay that paper be en regle if asks why did not have paper made out in first place to havre say that have hoped to have be joined by brother in law here a have not arrived sister be anxious about wish therefore to go on to havre indeed have requested to do a be uncertain whether must be able to leave ship know of course that be all right cousin must not have recommended so strongly to in day everyone be suspicious one can not be too cautious will get one of market authority to go up with be well known to be likely that none of people at mairie will know seeing that be quiet man keep to myself leigh have trouble in buying sailor dress at shop down by wharf having put on went up with monsieur tourrier one of market officer to mairie a former have anticipated there be difficulty leigh pas be examined market official testified to grocer a being well known citizen doing business with market people taking part in public affair while monsieur tourrier showed letter that have received from cousin adjoint at arthenay what be name of ship sister husband command maire asked henriette lugger formerly traded with england since war broke out trade between port on western coast have be sailor on board yes citizen maire nodded made out pas for jeannette martin travelling to join husband captain of lugger henriette for brother lucien porson for louis martin aged two year son of above named citoyenne martin a agreed that must now be best to travel by water leigh next went to stable a horse be good one obtained fair price for next morning went on board sailing craft going down river after cordial adieu from host hostess promise to take up abode there on return through paris went on board leigh have sold saddle with horse having on journey to paris removed bundle of assignats concealed in accommodation on board be very fair patsey occupied roomy cabin aft rest slept in large cabin forward for before trouble began majority of people travelling from paris down to rouen havre went by water although boat be mainly constructed for carriage of merchandise conveyance of passenger formed important part of profit at present however there be little travelling patsey have woman cabin to while one other male messenger with master two hand have forward compartment to master explained that at ordinary time two men occupied tiny place boarded off from hold in summer slept on deck that a there be so few passenger lived with rest for a growled under breath present voyage be slow not unpleasant there be scarce wind enough to fill two sail carried by boat captain two hand frequently got out sweep to keep boat in middle of current stopped for day at rouen while cargo destined for town be landed patsey leigh be glad to spend day in town visiting cathedral taking meal at restaurant for cuisine on board boat be not of highest character used to keep regular cook captain lamented in day often carried several passenger at present when seldom have more than one two can not afford revolution be doubt grand thing have greatly benefited nation have weighed hardly on there be boat on river there used to be be hardly paying expense now that one travel go to sea be worse off still for what with falling off in trade with english cruiser along coast there be little employment for seaman save in privateer however starve for greater portion of men on coast have to go in ship of republic on sixth day after leaving paris arrived at havre here have difficulty in obtaining lodging in small auberge near port pas be on arrival sent to authority of town duly stamped leigh first inquiry be for henriette found that be well known in port have sailed for la rochelle six week before doe not very often come up here one of sailor said sometimes be month between visit a likely a not may have be captured on way down port be bordeaux if wanted to find have much better have gone straight there than come to place do want to find leigh said be there chance of finding ship going down south well might find one man said must have to take chance of getting there many of ship be laid up for risk of capture be great be small craft for most part make venture creep along inshore run into port anchor under gun of battery if see british cruiser outside drawing so little water can keep in nearer than cruiser must dare to a can take mud mind if stick on sand for tide leigh returned with news to sister what do think patsey said say that can not cross from here in boat though have learned that entrance to channel be guarded by gunboat if passed safely through must have serious risk many hardship to undergo hear that there be numerous french privateer might be picked up by one of instead of by english cruiser be afraid that pass in case must not avail in slightest now if go down to bordeaux have only to wait till henriette come in possibly may be there when arrive in case be sure that lefaux will be willing to take out either put on board british cruiser land in england certainly will go to bordeaux patsey said may find jean there if escaped that night must make for loire a be good swimmer must get over without difficulty must then try to make way towards bordeaux may be so patsey must not be too sanguine about finding there be so much nearer for to have made for one of northern port that might very well have done so a soon a managed to obtain sea outfit must no longer be suspected of having anything to do with vendeans have learnt before after fight at le man vendeans have made for river have desperately fought way through force barred march have come down on bank have failed to find mean to cross then have turned into brittany again for short distance have fought two three more desperate battle have again reached loire there be one leaky boat to be found in la rochejaquelein with few of officer have crossed river to bring back boat be moored on opposite bank directly got across be attacked la rochejaquelein with two three others effected escape after vendeans no longer kept together woman child wounded invalid hid in wood where be hunted down like wild beast either slaughtered at once sent to nantes where thousand be either executed drowned by infamous carrier one of most sanguinary villain produced by revolution many of men managed to cross river either by swimming on rough raft in boat in la vendee war be still going on for charette have marched up again from lower poitou be keeping large force of republican troop engaged will try not to hope too much patsey said at rate be for going down to bordeaux for apart from chance of finding jean there seems much safer than putting out to sea in little boat certainly think so leigh replied now will go out make inquiry a to what craft there may be bound south returned in couple of hour have arranged for passage patsey be fast looking little craft with very decent accommodation be in wine trade brought cargo safely up last week will start again day after tomorrow carry crew of eight hand have made inquiry about captain hear very good report of seemed to first rate fellow when mentioned name of henriette said that knew well be acquainted with present captain with jean have heard from lefaux that former owner have be denounced have be obliged to fly from nantes to chateau that have in la vendee henriette have never be into nantes since went down to bordeaux be there registered in owner name lefaux have worked for ever since ' fancy said behe sometimes make run with brandy to england be in business before have lefaux said be chased many time by english cutter have always managed to give slip be half inclined to tell be jean brother in law thought better not to until have be to sea for day two have learned little more about next day leigh went to mairie explained that not having found ship commanded by citoyenne martin husband thinking likely that must hear of at bordeaux have taken passage by trois freres sailed next day addition be made to paper without question next morning went on board be heartily received by captain ought to bring luck madame said mean citoyenne old word slip out of one mouth sometimes be not often have lady passenger there be few who travel now before war broke out people preferred taking passage in larger ship than mine still will do best to make comfortable can assure that leon cook be by mean bad hand at turning out dainty dish be cook in hotel at one time let tongue wag too freely having to leave suddenly be glad enough to ship with fortunately like life think anything must tempt to go back to hotel kitchen again be not particular can assure patsey said in time have to rough still own like good dinner better than bad one will put in to good many little port skipper said sailing a close a do inshore always make port if can a evening come on be therefore never without fresh meat fish vegetable how long will be going down can not tell depends upon wind may too be kept in port for two three day if there be enemy cruiser anywhere about may get there in ten day may take three week before boat set sail commissary with two men came on board examined pass of passenger searched below hatch to make sure that one be hidden there a soon a have completed inspection sail be hoisted trois freres started on way down channel wind be light blowing from southwest be just able to lay course anchored for night off mouth of vire river suppose tomorrow will get round cape de la hague captain leigh said will not attempt that coast be very difficult one with furious current will bring up off cherbourg start at daylight will hope be well down towards bay of avranches by there be fear of british cruiser till get out towards ushant care about coming inside island what with fog rock current be safer outside than in besides there be little to be picked up except coaster like ourselves fishing boat there be hardly foreign trade between havre brest be from there down to mouth of gironde that cruiser be so thick from ushant to boulogne there be plenty of be chiefly occupied in guarding ship going up down channel from privateer run out from port dieppe havre granville avranches saint malo skipper have by mean over praised cook who turned out better dinner than that have eaten since trouble began with exception only of have have at arthenay take pride in captain said will never get good work done in line unless by man who doe so sailor who be careless about appearance of ship be sure to be careless about keeping of watch be not to be trusted in matter of navigation when see craft with rope in place everything spotlessly clean brass work polished up paint carefully attended to may be sure that skipper be a particular in more important matter be just so with man be little bit of galley saucepan shine like gold everything be clean in place grumble if run short of anything be good deal more particular about dinner being just what must be than be sometimes when have rough weather say to beake soup today leon will be well content with be not weather for turning out regular dinner always reply gravely beonsieur anyone can cook when sea be calm be on occasion like one who know business be required monsieur will dine a usual up come dinner with three four course cooked to perfection for must rather snatch few mouthful go up on deck again must hurt leon feeling if saw might even consider that must seek employer for talent be wasted upon so go through with exemplary patience must not lose for anything not only because own like good food trois freres have reputation for good living that if be in port passenger will wait for day to sail with instead of going by other craft then too have trouble with crew be rarely indeed that change one of hand for although meal be of course much simpler than mine be perfect in way take great deal of trouble off hand too instead of having dozen little account to go into at port enter allow certain sum manages on so much day for own table so much for passenger so much for crew how doe know find be cheaper than used to be before time yet have sort of dainty never dreamt of then say to sometimes 'leon must be ruining ' smile say ' be well content captain if be satisfied be so buy fish off boat a come in can understand that get far more cheaply than if waited till be hawked in street be great at omelet when have chance be ashore before countrywoman come into market will buy whole stock of egg pound two of butter three four couple of fowl from one woman who be glad to sell cheaply so be free to return home at once at bordeaux lay in stock of snipe other bird from sand hill marsh oyster other such matter be great favourite with crew in cold weather stormy night there be always hot soup ready for have only one fault a rule cook be expected to help get up anchor sail will not put hand to sailor work say that cook must not have rough hand that must be a soft a woman personally believe be nonsense however a have fairly strong crew press on subject though sometimes when tail on to rope see leaning quietly against galley smoking pipe be inclined to use strong language think be much to put up with captain patsey said with smile if always cook for such breakfast dinner a have have today do think that there be perhaps something in what say about rough hand well feel that said still be little aggravating when everyone else be working hard to see man calmly smoking never raising finger to help next day kept very close inshore more than once white sail be seen in distance captain pronounced from cut to belong to british cruiser weather be fine see wind be steady so be coming rather farther into bay than usual will see more of a soon a be round that cape ahead for keep very sharp lookout off cherbourg be not however until have rounded ushant that british vessel came near enough to cause uneasiness there be two large frigate cruising backwards forward off brest brig of war came within shot a be doubling penmarch point there be plenty of water for here skipper said however will hardly catch before be under shelter of battery of quimper must have thought that must hardly think worth trouble of chasing may be that think be carrying fresh meat from saint malo to nantes there be good deal of trade way time of year when meat will keep good for week may be that want to get news of what ship there be in brest however be certain that be in earnest be politely requesting to lower sail laughed a puff of white smoke broke out from brig second two later ball dashed up water fifty yard ahead of emotion with patsey leigh watched brig differed much from of captain must gladly have seen lugger overhauled captured soon saw that there be little chance of lugger be fast boat wind just suited brig fell farther farther astern until a former entered bay of quimper laid course north brig hauled wind turned to rejoin vessel off brest keeping close to land passed l'orient quiberon vannes without stopping did not drop anchor again until entered bay on eastern side of island of noirmoutier next day passed out through narrow channel of froment have gone between island mainland for distance of two mile when saw large brig making in towards shore of cruiser captain exclaimed be more serious for there be bay can run into fellow be bringing wind down with only chance be to anchor under gun of saint jean de monte will be lucky if get there in time brig came up fast be within mile when lugger caught wind then running along rapidly held own until off saint jean when ran in a close a draught must permit anchored two french privateer be already lying in there one having dropped anchor only few minute before trois freres arrived expect be that fellow that brig be in chase of be not by mean sure that have done with yet be a likely a not to try to cut out one if not of privateer of course must look like madness with gun of battery on height protecting have done such thing so often that one can never say that one be altogether safe from brig stood in until two three gun in battery opened fire when turned made out to sea again that mean nothing captain said of course must not attack in daylight dare say will sail pretty nearly out of sight so a to make privateer believe that have intention of meddling with if be sure that be game must get up sail again a soon a be dark make for oleron be likely enough that may think that be just what privateer will do will sail in direction so a to cut off before get there force to fight without protection of shore battery there be bell for breakfast leon must not be two minute late if there be action going on close to hour later went on deck again at rate sea have saved trouble of discussing matter captain said be aground tide turned just before got here be now half past twelve will not be afloat again for nearly twelve hour well there be one thing if be thinking of trying to cut out privateer be not likely to do before two three o'clock in morning a soon a float will haul out cable length two so a to ensure being able to get off if do attack will get up sail at once run south will be too much occupied to give thought whereas if stay here capture privateer might take into head to come on board set fire to lugger a be part owner must be very serious matter to be apparent that privateer have thought of brig returning at rate at present a boat went backwards forward between shore what do think leigh sister asked quietly a be sitting alone together know in least said best chance be that two frenchman seem to be so confident that be safe under gun of fort that will take very great precaution one of mount eight gun other ten ought to be match for brig even without fort for must see by port that only carry sixteen gun however think that will very likely have try at will be very dark night for sky be overcast there be moon be between ten eleven when just a be about to turn in captain ran in quick madame must hurry on clothes heard sound just now must only be made by boat a be still aground will bring boat alongside land there be nothing like being on safe side two privateer be lying quarter of mile farther out there be still light burning on board fool captain growled a leigh sister came on deck leigh carrying little louis who have be put to bed fully dressed indeed time have be lost for mother leigh have agreed that must be better to lie down in clothes in case of alarm being given fool captain repeated if have extinguished light a ought to have done boat must have have difficulty in finding now must not miss if tried now madame will please take place in boat with be sure that there be boat coming along of course oar be muffled there be enough sea on to prevent hearing splash think noise heard be caused by one of stretcher giving way reluctantly patsey leigh took place in boat just a reached shore shout be heard on board one of privateer moment later came sound of british cheer be followed by hubbub of shout then musket flashed out from deck almost immediately came sound of conflict blue light be struck on deck of one of privateer by light on shore must obtain view of conflict boat have boarded from shore side two of lay alongside of privateer crew must be seen climbing up by chain leaping down upon deck deserve to be taken captain said have not even triced up boarding net confused medley of sound came to shore with shout of french sailor be mingled clash of cutlass crack of pistol british sailor fought for most part silently on height above blue light be burning in battery men must be seen standing on crest watching combat below powerless to assist friend be five minute after outbreak of combat when loud british cheer followed by dead silence showed that one at least of privateer have be captured fighting still continued on deck of other craft from vessel have be captured number of sailor leapt down into one of boat rowed to assistance of comrade reinforcement apparently decided issue of fight for in couple of minute british cheer be again heard blue light be promptly extinguished a be other light on vessel scarcely be done when gun from battery boomed out be of use firing captain said think can depress gun enough to bear upon there be making sail went on a creaking of block be heard of course have cut cable must not waste time in getting up anchor with fort playing upon however be mere waste of powder shot on night a suppose gunner can make out now for certainty wo be able to do so a soon a have moved off quarter of mile of course stray shot may hit practically be over think that can go on board again did not think of before must hardly set fire to for light must enable gunner to see till be long way out there be doubt englishman can fight men be right when be under sail be question of exchanging broadside success of so many of cutting out expedition show that somehow other lose heart when be boarded must have have nearly twice a many men a there be in four boat yet seemed to be certainty a soon a english got among craft have much better have sailed out together when brig came in morning fought fairly ought to have be more than match for doubt must have done so if have thought that must be attacked tonight relied upon battery allowed to be taken completely by surprise must see even from distance that most of be fighting in shirt expect that be sound asleep when attack began men roused in sudden way can never be relied upon to do duty a must do if prepared to meet party be soon on board lugger again just a daylight be breaking there be trampling of foot on deck leigh going up found that sail be being hoisted keeping close to shore ran down without putting in anywhere to la rochelle here waited for day then keeping inside isle of oleron entered gironde next day anchored in garonne off quay of bordeaux after thanking captain very heartily for kindness during passage landed showed paper to official on quay then being unhampered by luggage walked quietly away a there be nothing particularly noticeable in appearance attracted attention whatever be five o'clock when landed already becoming dusk waited until be quite dark then having inquired for house of monsieur flambard merchant to whom jean have assigned henriette knocked at door be handsome house not far from quay lower portion be evidently occupied by office a servant opened door leigh seeing that sister hesitated to speak inquired if monsieur flambard be at home be man said shortly doe not see people on business after office be closed leigh saw that dress a sailor did not impress man think will see said if take name up to will tell that citoyenne martin wish to speak to minute later merchant handsome man of about same age a jean martin came down ah madame be glad indeed to see said for have more than once be up to nantes during time be living there have be frequently at house have be in great anxiety about have jean be here asked in tone of intense anxiety madame have heard nothing of for many month not indeed since lugger first came down here with letter deed of sale to myself did expect to find here hoped so although there be arrangement between to meet here still thought that must have made way down here if possible a must then be able to escape in lugger may have found more difficult than thought monsieur flambard said soothingly let be standing here pray come up wife will be glad to welcome for have often heard speak of martin english wife leigh have be standing behind patsey while spoke a merchant closed door eye fell upon ah monsieur now recognize be monsieur leigh stansfield brother of madame welcome also cordially so saying led way upstairs chapter grave risk nothing must be kinder than reception of fugitive by madame flambard have heard so much of patsey said from husband to whom have be married six month before have quite shared anxiety about fate of jean martin who have more than once be mentioned a being one of leader of vendeans soon went off with patsey to put child to bed while be away monsieur flambard took leigh into smoking room before said ask anything about adventure must explain to state of thing here until november last bordeaux indeed whole of gironde be moderate deputy who have now a perhaps know fallen on scaffold be hunted down like wild beast belonged to party be earnest reformer be prominent among leader of revolution went with stream up to certain point voted for most of sanguinary decree although in time strove to mitigate horror inflicted by extreme party after long conflict latter supported by mob of paris obtained ascendency girondist underwent same fate have befallen so many others for can not pity be men of standing of intelligence without perceiving terrible result must follow unchained mob became victim up to time there have be few execution here power remained in hand of moderate party two month since however there be local insurrection party of terror suddenly rose seized member of council threw into prison other prominent citizen be seized guillotine began bloody work in earnest since time citizen of position standing life in momentary danger of arrest not day pass dozen so be seized dragged off grant at present there be nothing like wholesale butchery go on at nantes under fiend carrier be only who have wealth property be seized not only in town in whole department agent of who assumed power be busy be gironde therefore hateful to party of robespierre proprietor of land who have hitherto be left unmolested be being brought in daily trial be of course mere farce prisoner be murdered not because be moderate because be rich wealth be divided among member of council mob who support so far have be unmolested have never taken part in politics business being sufficient to occupy time thing be that employ considerable number of men in addition to crew of ten vessel belong to believe that be popular generally on wharf be knowledge that arrest might promote tumult might reverse present order of thing have led to being left alone so far fortunately servant who let in have be in family for past five thirty year be devoted to have be otherwise position must have be dangerous one report to council that young man in attire of sailor accompanied by lady child have arrived be at once received must suffice to set in motion must be accused of having suspect probably one of emigre hidden here must be difficult for to explain reception must in first place attire in clothes such a be worn by mate of privateer suppose have paper must not have be permitted to land leigh took out pass handed to monsieur flambard glanced through must have managed well to have got hold of pass certainly put matter on safer ground however must find difficulty in explaining how came to show hospitality to two person who by strangely roundabout course have made way from arthenay be little unfortunate that sister kept own name have be otherwise might have said that husband be captain of one of ship be unfortunately not unknown here after martin flight from nantes claim be made by committee of public safety at nantes for henriette fortunately brother in law have dated bill of sale to fortnight before left trial took place here a in day law justice still prevailed in civic court decision be given in favour be urged on other side that transaction be invalid a martin must have parted with vessel knowing well that be traitor to republic that property must be confiscated however got best of there be proof that martin be conscious that be suspected of being disaffected claimed that have only sold a having married have decided to give up sea to settle upon estate in la vendee of course at time la vendee have not risen be not crime worthy of death to own estate there still case attracted attention fact that guest be madame martin might recall circumstance at once awake suspicion that be wife of one of who have led insurgent of la vendee in case life yours must be certainly forfeited receiving must be regarded a amply sufficient evidence of connection with insurgent now for sake a well a yours think that must be strongly advisable that must take up abode elsewhere believe that be want of hospitality measure of precaution for sake tomorrow morning must have to send in statement that two guest have arrived here be therefore most desirable that must move without delay fortunately wife of two three of captain live here one of especially excellent woman have house much larger than need take in lodger generally captain whose family reside here when ship be in port therefore fact that sailor with sister child have taken room there will excite suspicion whatever will a matter of course send in name to police of town together with pass will be marked returned without probably being glanced at think that will be excellent arrangement sir leigh said quite see that stay here might be awkward for a well a will at once go with be a soon a have told sister reason why will be better for to establish yourselves elsewhere than here may tell that have be quietly making preparation for flight be not captain whom can trust henriette expect here shortly have be delayed on arrival propose that will cross channel together hear lady voice in next room be best that got painful business over at once madame flambard be greatly distressed when leigh gave sister account of conversation have have resolution at have arrived patsey at once saw that be most desirable that change must be made assured hostess that fully recognized that safety must be imperilled by staying at house must be cruel kindness on part to insist upon stopping here madame flambard know that be from lack of hospitality that be leaving that be making real sacrifice in order to procure safety will put on thing at once monsieur by mean will go with brother first to see if madame chopin have other lodger if so will go to wife of one of clerk who also let portion of house if must not mind poor accommodation to of captain wife a in brother character of sailor must be more natural for to go to lodging may very well have be recommended to by skipper of lugger in came here when have arranged thing will return be quarter of hour walk for house stand near river above bridge at once set out with leigh on arriving at house found that there be at present lodger there young sailor have brought letter of recommendation to madame chopin have married sister child with be sure that will make very comfortable can supply with what may require have just arrived by sea from length of stay be uncertain young man be looking for berth a mate will have first vacancy on one of vessel sister may stop with for time a be hoping that husband will return here though be so long overdue that fear ship have be either lost captured by english will do best to make comfortable monsieur flambard thank for recommending to leigh saw room consisted of two bedroom third room be similarly furnished madame chopin said that must take down bed put other furniture into so that must use a sitting room must prefer that madame for sister at time be greatly depressed must prefer being alone can quite understand that woman said well will not be troubled with society here a have only three room to let so that unless husband come home before go will be quite alone will return with sister in hour time leigh said will not be too late for monsieur be little past eight o'clock yet will take fully two hour to get everything straight tidy very well then will say ten o'clock monsieur flambard said will keep monsieur porson a have news to give concerning friend who recommended to on return to merchant sat chatting for hour over adventure through leigh sister have passed manner in be separated from jean martin think have reason to hope madame monsieur flambard said cheerfully jean be not sort of fellow to let be caught in hole expect that when found that must not rejoin at once struck north for dunkirk calais have probably managed to be taken over in fishing boat smuggler if failed in doing so must probably make off in boat single handed think that have reason to hope that will find at poole when arrive there even must not be there there will be reason for despair may have have difficulty in getting away may have be impressed for naval service at rate have great faith that will turn up sooner later certainly when have once managed to get seafaring outfit will be safe from fear of detection a one of terrible vendean insurgent at quarter to ten little louis be taken out of bed wrapped up in cloak carried by leigh monsieur flambard insisted on again accompanying street be now almost deserted soon arrived at madame chopin quite forgot to ask if must want anything before going to bed can make cup of good coffee if must like thank have eaten hour ago saying goodnight to monsieur flambard went up to room hostess leading with candle have made most of time since leigh left house white curtain have be put up at window everything looked beautifully clean patsey uttered exclamation of pleasure when entered room doe indeed look fresh homelike said thank for taking so much trouble madame next morning leigh procured jacket waistcoat with brass button cap with gold band then sauntered along wharf went aboard trois freres told skipper that news have be received of sister husband have be agreed that be best that must not go to monsieur flambard house that merchant must call at lodging after dark when leigh returned to midday meal found that paper have come back from mairie duly stamped countersigned that a one have be to house to make inquiry be evident that suspicion have be excited during next four five day leigh went little into town contenting with keeping near wharf watching vessel loading discharging cargo spending much of time on board trois freres on afternoon of fifth day saw lugger approaching a came near made out to great delight that be henriette a soon a dropped anchor in stream boat rowed to wharf lefaux be sitting in stern a soon a landed went off in direction of monsieur flambard office leigh did not go near thought that must be better that honest sailor must learn that sister be there from merchant before spoke to a imprudent remark on sailor part might be caught up by one of spy of committee lead to trouble a expected monsieur flambard came round with lefaux that evening be heartily glad to see again madame said a patsey shook by hand too monsieur stansfield began to think that never must do so only wish that monsieur jean be here too still feel confident that have got safely away trust sailor for getting out of scrape must have gone through lot madame look worse for except anxiety for husband have gone through nothing to speak of have horse to ride generally shelter to sleep under for have little to complain of be terrible to see suffering of peasant woman child of many men broken down by sickness there be too anxiety a to safety of husband brother in battle took place of hardship to myself there be very little well madame hope that will soon have pleasure of sailing into poole again with monsieur leigh on board also with good master monsieur flambard wife when will be off again patsey asked eagerly be what have come to talk with about madame martin monsieur flambard said have pretty good information a to what pass at meeting of wretch who call committee of public safety hear that there will very shortly be seizure of number of prominent citizen name have be mentioned be only hanging back until can decide upon what will be pretext since none of named have taken part in politics here who have done so have be already seized however blow may come at moment henriette have already begun to discharge cargo fortunately there be not much of moment that have finished will drop down below rest of shipping be ready to start at moment if find that matter be not absolutely

if a may possibly happen be suddenly arrested in street will have servant near will have order will be to hurry back home to tell mistress to put on disguise of peasant woman have already be prepared for to go with at once to carriage man whom can also thoroughly trust be to come here say to be bad day then sister child will at once start to join wife have most reluctantly consented to carry out

said who must not do in power for of have be with firm nearly life treat well be happy to say that not one of have taken part in last trouble indeed be told be one of matter that if be arrested will be brought against will be said that be proof of enmity to convention that none of people took side of patriot however tell way have over forty men here have of course friend among porter others working on wharf disturbance might take place be arrested however scoundrel have now got such absolute power that doubt feel that must disregard local rising indeed with plunder of store before must

carriage leigh have in mind very short notice that desailles have have of danger how narrowly escaped being arrested although have friend who kept acquainted with what be going on thought that be
