oppression be never more strongly illustrated than by fact that for century ireland have since time furnished with large proportion of best soldier must have be among bitterest most formidable foe son fought in rank of greatest continental enemy be not because be adherent of house of stuart that irishman left native country to take service abroad because life in ireland be rendered well nigh intolerable for catholic on account of nature severity of law against bitterness with law be carried into effect irish catholic have prospect of employment advancement at home must hold civil appointment of kind must not serve a officer even enlist a private in army must not hold land be subject to imprisonment even death on most trifling frivolous accusation brought against by satellite of irish government not only must not sit in parliament of dublin must not even vote at election be because believed that return of stuart must mean relief from at least of disability liberty to carry out office of religion openly to dwell in peace free from denunciation persecution that irish remained so long faithful to jacobite cause be not indeed until that catholic in ireland be admitted to qualify a subject of crown not until following year that be permitted to enlist in army irish regiment have enlisted in france previous to convention of limerick be irish army defended that town having be defeated passed over to france raised irish brigade to position of important factor in french army held for nearly hundred year bearing prominent part in siege battle in flanders germany italy spain long succession of french marshal general have testified to extraordinary bravery of troop to good conduct under circumstance not only in france did irishman play prominent part in military matter be conspicuous in continental army descendant be still to be found bearing honoured name throughout europe happily day be past for over hundred year courage military capacity of irishman have be employed in service of great britain for record of doings of of regiment of irish brigade during year be indebted to painstaking account of irish brigade in service of france by j c o'callaghan while account of war in spain be drawn from official report given in boyer annals of reign of queen anne contains mine of information of military civil event of time g henty chapter fresh from ireland number of officer of o'brien regiment of foot forming part of irish brigade in service of france be gathered in handsome apartment in rue de fosse on th of june when door opened colonel entered with young officer in uniform of regiment have asked here gentleman said to present to new comrade desmond kennedy who through good office of marshal de noailles have be appointed by gracious majesty to cornetcy in regiment now gentleman have known doubtless can of recall instance where harmony of regiment have be grievously disturbed bad blood caused owing to want of clear understanding upon matter connected with family might have be avoided have proper explanation be given at commencement have spoken frankly to mr kennedy have stated to certain particular have not only authorized requested to repeat to feeling that have right to know who be that have come among so to avoid questioning on matter be of others prone to lead to trouble among gentleman beyond fact that be kennedy that father have to fly from ireland two year after siege of limerick owing to participation in plot to bring about fresh rising in favour of king james be unacquainted with family history have never heard from father only know that made for france after throwing usurper spy off track there can be little doubt that be intention to take service in brigade there have be several kennedy in service have little doubt that young gentleman father be murroch kennedy who joined third regiment about time be killed few month afterwards at battle of breda death must account for fact that son never received letter from at time when left ireland child be two year old a communication be difficult boy so young murroch might very well have put off writing until boy grew older not thinking that death might intervene a did to prevent doing so be simple straightforward enough will be sure have hesitation in extending hand of friendship to son of gallant irishman who died fighting in rank of irish brigade exiled like rest of for loyalty to king still gentleman might perhaps wonder how be that know more of family be that question might be disposed of once for be making statement to on behalf be not brought up a might expect with of father connection whether family be so scattered that there be one to whom must safely entrust child know not in point of fact sent to one of last house where loyal gentleman must wish son to be brought up know by name reputation major knew personally gallant james o'carroll who died fighting bravely at siege of limerick be succeeded in estate by brother john one of few irishman of good family who turned traitor to king who secured succession to brother possession by becoming ardent supporter of usurper by changing religion why murroch kennedy must have chosen man a guardian of son be mystery whether have be great friend in earlier time when john o'carroll professed a warm attachment to stuart cause a did brother james whether kennedy possessed such knowledge of o'carroll traitorous dealing with dutchman a must if generally known have rendered so hateful to loyal men that must no longer have remained in country so have hold over mr kennedy can tell nothing be brought by nurse to castle kilkargan be left with john o'carroll be clear that latter accepted charge unwillingly for sent child to farm where remained until be eight year old then placed with parish priest who educated lad visited at house of neighbouring gentry shot rowed fished with son o'carroll however beyond paying for maintenance ignored existence showing interest whatever in up to time when furnished with letter of introduction to de noailles except that made present of gun a soon a became of age to use one never attempted to tamper with loyalty to king james in fact until sent for to ask what profession must choose never exchanged ten word with from time that be brought to castle can form own theory a to cause of such strange conduct may have given pledge to murroch that boy must be brought up loyalist true son of church may have be that loyalty of boy father formed so unpleasant contrast to own disloyalty apostasy that disliked sight of however theory can make difference in reception of desmond kennedy a gentleman of good family a son of loyal adherent of king a such think can from what have already seen of assert that be one who will be good comrade pleasant companion credit to regiment subject of remark be tall handsome young fellow sixteen year of age be already broad at shoulder promised to become exceedingly powerful man have stood somewhat behind colonel watching calmly effect of word on whose comrade be to be for knew how punctilious be countryman on subject of family placing a much even more value than did scot on point of genealogy of descent from old family frank open face bearing manner did a much to smooth way a did speech of colonel who when have be introduced to two day before have questioned very closely on subject of family have almost be matter of satisfaction to desmond when heard from colonel that officer who have fallen at breda be probably father of whom have remembrance for from time attained age of boyhood have be grief pain that must never have heard from father who now appeared have be prevented by death from ever communicating with officer received cordially have little doubt that be son of murroch kennedy of dillon regiment although after separated wonder be expressed a to reason why latter have committed son to care of so notorious traitor a john o'carroll desmond have be specially introduced to two of young lieutenant patrick o'neil phelim obeullivan took off with to quarter what be last news from ireland suppose that confiscation have ceased for excellent reason that have seized estate of loyal gentleman in country be done long ago in neighbourhood of kilkargan so far a know everywhere feeling be a bitter a ever among who have be dispossessed also among tenant peasantry who have found handed over to mercy of dutchman other follower of william at kilkargan there be not that grievance although have still one of old family a master must not forgive for deserting to side of usurper for changing religion in order to do pleasure to william certainly can have derived little satisfaction from estate seldom showed out of door never without two three armed servant of whom be stranger from north be often away for month together at dublin what did do with fished shot rode have many friend among gentry of neighbourhood who must doubtless have shown le kindness than did have not be for neglect with o'carroll treated unpopularity be in favour however have one good reason for being obliged to since be through obtained commission told that in young day have be at french college with duke have be great friend there thought that in memory of de noailles must procure commission suppose real fact be kennedy that be glad to get rid of altogether think be likely enough certainly raised objection whatever to going abroad seemed to think natural must choose irish brigade here in preference to british service said something unpleasant about not being singular must be rebel when always associated with rebel to replied that seemed to that must hardly be blamed for seeing that father have be what called rebel have little choice in matter of associate that if have be educated at school in england instead of by good father o'leary might have have other sentiment replied that sentiment be nothing to one way other be glad to wash hand of altogether at rate if went to france must drink health of king james day without being involved in treason almost looked a if wished to grow up rebel kennedy must hardly have placed in charge of priest may have reckoned that if there be rising might join so be taken off hand altogether whatever reason be have certainly cause for satisfaction that removed from care of farmer wife with whom at first placed arranged with priest to take charge of altogether o'leary have be educated at saint omer be splendid fellow be very popular on countryside be owing to being with be admitted to house of gentry around whereas have remained in farmhouse in o'carroll first placed must only have associated with son of other tenant looked at rate a if wished to make gentleman of kennedy yes suppose father have asked to do so at rate be infinitely better off than must have be if have taken in at kilkargan for in case must have have associate whatever a be scarcely ever exchanged word with until last meeting sent down by one of servant letter to duc de noailles bag containing money for outfit here for purchase of horse together with line saying that have done duty by have desire to hear from in future be inclined to send money back to father o'leary persuaded not to do so saying that must be in position to buy thing if obtained commission that doubt money have be given not for own sake because felt that owed to for service rendered to by father be ungracious way of doing obeullivan said in circumstance must have taken money have come from old one be perhaps a well that must have be done in such manner that may well feel owe great gratitude towards such man how did get over here there be great difficulty about in spite of activity of english cruiser constant communication be kept up between ireland france fortunately have short time before made acquaintance of one of officer who be over there in disguise gathering recruit for brigade yes there be good many agent in ireland engaged in work there be difficulty in obtaining recruit for there be scarcely young irishman who doe not long to be with countryman who have won such credit out here many abstain from joining only because know how to set about work of agent then be principally to arrange mean for crossing channel be well that supply be steadily kept up for can assure battle fought make very heavy gap in rank in spite of three fresh regiment have be raised in last year partly by fresh comer from ireland partly by irish deserter from marlborough regiment be interrupting story well after leaving mr o'carroll making preparation paid visit to cottage where officer be staying in disguise told that wanted to cross gave instruction a to how to proceed be to go to certain street in cork knock at certain door when be opened be to say 'the sea be calm sky be bright ' 'then ' said 'you will be taken in hand put on board one of craft engaged in work of carrying recruit across water will be landed at saint malo where there be agent of brigade who give instruction to recruit a to how be to proceed supply with money enough for journey man to accompany party act a interpreter on way carried out instruction crossed channel in lugger with thirty young peasant bound also for paris on landing at saint malo took place in diligence for paris having fortunately need for interpreter on presenting letter to marquis de noailles received with great kindness treated a guest until have obtained commission in regiment now when be likely to go on active service soon expect o'neil said whether will be sent to peninsula to flanders one know in fact be likely enough that will for present remain here until be seen how matter go where reinforcement will be most required be ten month since came into garrison in paris may therefore expect to be one of last regiment ordered off for part be in particular hurry to exchange comfortable quarter good living such adventure a may fall to lot of humble subaltern for roughing in field where a have be case ever since brigade be formed get good deal more than fair share of hard work fighting must have thought that must have liked that desmond said in surprise enough be a good a feast other said when have done few week work in trench before town be besieging stood knee deep for hour in mud soaked to skin with rain with enemy shot coming through parapet half minute so will see that be not fun glory then too see have particular interest in quarrel between france germany when fight fight rather for honour of irish brigade than for glory of france have grudge against dutch fight a interested party seeing that be by dutch troop that william conquered ireland a to english troop have particular enmity against cromwell business be old story suppose that english soldier feel particular love for queen anne animosity against after be nearer in blood to than be to german austrian spaniard for there be few even of oldest family who have not many time since day of strongbow intermarried with english settler at rate there be still plenty of adherent of king james in england scotland speak same language form part of same nation own must rather fight against foreign foe than against so must desmond said heartily only point of difference be that agree a to who must be king want catholic king majority of english want protestant king have fought on subject be beaten next time hope that may succeed if king be to land in england again must fight heart soul in cause whether french beat english in present war english beat french will not a far a can see make much difference to king james who father o'leary tell be in opinion supported here by french king from great love for because so long a james have adherent in ireland scotland england be able to play off against english government other young men laughed for heaven sake kennedy keep such sentiment a to yourself be matter of faith in brigade that be fighting in cause of king james a against english usurper now that william be dead james daughter on throne matter be complicated somewhat if parliament have settled succession after anne on brother there might have be end of quarrel altogether now that have settled on sophia of hanover granddaughter of james st descendant subject to restriction that will be protestant quarrel doe not seem likely to be healed priest of yours must be dangerous man obeullivan said not at can assure be devoted to king a told there be use in irishman always closing eye to true state of thing say that must rely upon loyal friend in scotland england that be sure king will never be placed on throne by french bayonet small auxiliary force may be sent over in year louis have made real effort to assist even if for own purpose sent great army to england placed on throne must not be able to maintain there for month after french have withdrawn for even rightful king must be hated by people upon whom have be forced by foreign power especially power have for century be regarded a chief enemy if have be in earnest louis must have sent over great army instead of few thousand men to ireland when diversion must have turned scale in favour a did not do so then be not likely to do so in future king be useful to here by keeping up agitation must to extent cripple strength of england be stuart on throne must have to listen to wish of majority of people france must gain nothing by placing there moreover must lose service of twenty thousand of best soldier for naturally exile must return home what be now most valuable force in french service might then become equally important one in service of britain be glad that priest of yours remains quietly in kilkargan for if be to come here expound view among regiment might cause quite defection among at rate kennedy must advise not to take to propagating view in regiment must not add to comfort ours there be good many hot headed men who must take up idea that have be infected by o'carroll principle must not be well for anyone to say a much to face desmond said o'leary be loyal to backbone although have own idea a to hopelessness of obtaining efficient help from louis think that will be far better to trust to friend at home that even did louis carry out promise must in long run harm rather than benefit king james be not saying that view may not be correct kennedy be only saying that view must be very unpopular one among brigade be fighting for france because believe france in turn will aid in placing rightful king on throne if once entertained notion that louis be deceiving that have intention of helping that if did place james on throne must alienate sympathizer at home must ask ourselves of what use be spending blood in fighting battle of france at rate will take advice obeullivan will keep lip sealed a to father o'leary view a see by presence here have not convinced a long a there be hope that by aid of french army may yet see king come to own again will do best to prove faithful soldier of france have chosen career with eye open loyal irishman can not obtain employment still le military employment in own country accordingly be to be found fighting a soldier of fortune in country in europe at least there be chance that may be benefiting royal cause by fighting for country gave king james shelter rendered armed assistance in struggle with usurper will probably give aid more le efficient when next attempt be made in other country be soldier of fortune in france may regard a serving own king by serving king louis do speak french well kennedy o'neil said changing conversation abruptly yes father o'leary took care of for always said must take service abroad a there be clearly nothing else to do for living consequently generally talked to in language speak a well a do english irish have not have much practice with sword suppose not so much a must wish though never lost opportunity of practising there be several of tenant who served in regiment james o'carroll raised used to practise with will lose time in getting best instruction can here may want kennedy be not particularly liked by french officer because be generally chosen to lead assault for other desperate service duelling be of course forbidden that in way prevents duel from being frequent a for fighting in action a far a have seen heard swordsmanship doe not go for great deal if press on hard enough there be men following enemy give way generally before come to hand to hand fighting if on other hand be more numerous hold position in breach be musketry settle be only when two officer happen to meet in fierce fight swordsmanship becomes of importance have good school in regiment there be several famous master of fence in town so must advise to give couple of hour day for time to making first rate swordsman have just left off maitre d'armes tell be too hotheaded ever to make fine blade must fancy from way have be arguing that be likely to be cooler than most of in fencing bout be fault with that be apt to lose temper indeed maitre maupert who be best teacher here decline absolutely to take of a pupil saying that while may do excellently well in battle can never hope to make first class fencer of men who can not be relied upon to keep head cool to fight with pointed weapon a calmly a might fence with friend in saloon well will work hard to become fair swordsman desmond said with laugh suppose there be plenty of time to spare plenty have couple of hour drill in morning after except when be officer of day can spend time a like colonel two of officer attend at king levee when be in paris a spends greater portion of time at versailles be seldom called upon for duty few day after desmond arrival colonel took with to saint germain where james rd a supporter called held miniature court colonel presented desmond a loyal subject of majesty newly joined cornet in regiment young prince be lad of eighteen be surrounded by group of courtier who have accompanied followed father into exile whose insistence upon treating with respect due to monarch be in slight degree galling to for a often declared to few friend have about own age have disadvantage of being king without of advantage be at once taken with appearance of desmond kennedy ah monsieur kennedy said after ceremony of presentation have be completed wish have faithful subject of irish brigade across water with must put on uniform like yours fight at head for right must that have sire must be good day for believe that in ireland scotland must soon find at head of army many time more numerous than brigade tell that must wait young prince said with sigh have be waiting long time now seems nearer than when be child however king of france have promised that can not be much longer that when marlborough be defeated army driven back across sea will send fleet army to place on throne will rejoice indeed when time come sire be sure there be not man in irish brigade who will not follow to death serve a faithfully a many of did royal father hope will come here often monsieur kennedy be sure that will like very much think that must always say what thought tell real truth about thing sire one of older men exclaimed reproachfully mean reflection on anyone dillon say what be sure feel have grown accustomed to waiting think of what be politic complain that speak too frankly monsieur kennedy come straight from ireland be not old enough yet to have learned to measure word will not be always afraid that anything may say will be carried to king how wish that king must send with marshal tallard must never do sire english be subject must never forgive if be to appear in field with french army fighting against irish brigade fight dillon yes majesty be in service of france by term of treaty of limerick be allowed to expatriate to enter french service have in fact renounced nationality with consent of english if taken prisoner must only be treated a captured foe not a traitor of course when majesty ascends throne will again become british subject trust that may come soon dillon for sake rather than own when time come will not find backward weary waiting try sorely be not for who have remained faithful to cause must gladly resign such chance a have of succeeding to throne of england take commission in irish brigade dillon of elder men shook head can wonder young prince said passionately here be master kennedy who be younger than though free life exercise have made man in comparison to have life before will bear part in many pitched battle doubtless in many private adventure be own master a long a doe duty there be none to say 'you must not do that must not say that must preserve dignity must speak softly discreetly must wait patiently envy master kennedy envy from bottom of heart come often to see will always be welcome turning abruptly away left chamber hurriedly to conceal tear filled eye counsellor shook head solemnly colonel o'brien said warmly what king say be natural for man of age for part have increased respect for say without offence what must be duller than life lad lead here have be brought up literally without pleasure late majesty heaven rest soul be absorbed in religious exercise nothing must have be more trying to boy than court in priest confessor be practically supreme since father death thing have be little better now see at heart young king have plenty of spirit energy can feel that life have be that of caged hawk be not surprised that occasionally break out into revolt against must methinks do world of good have few companion about own age like ensign kennedy must even say that although can quite understand that a king of england must not well take commission in one of regiment might at least be placed with one of most experienced honoured colonel in order to learn military exercise to mix with officer a other nobleman might do when attached to regiment murmur of dissent arose among counsellor well gentleman colonel went on have desire to interfere with function in opinion be good that king must also be general did anyone think worse of dutch william that be able to command army personally none of can believe that king james will ever succeed to inheritance of father without fighting must be well indeed that must not appear a puppet a one qualified to command be fault rather misfortune of father that be unfit to lead troop in field have be able to do so must in probability have died king of england instead of a fugitive pensioner of king louis in one way grief to see that young king feel position acutely on other hand be rejoiced to see that be in way lacking in spirit that longs to be out of cage to try wing for well gentleman having have say will take leave of a duty call back to regiment trust that frankness with have spoken will not be misunderstood so saying with bow to courtier left room followed by kennedy mean well said after have mounted ridden off at gallop be pity that gentleman loyal honourable men a be must surround young king suited well enough to mood of father who be always wanting in spirit be broken down not only by loss of kingdom by conduct of daughter what with devotion to religion be rather monk than monarch believed most mistakenly that have genius for politics be constantly intriguing with adherent at home notably marlborough other lord from whom obtained fair word promise of support nothing else though must plan did not posse spark of energy be one of most undecided of men though like most undecided men must be extremely obstinate unfortunately more wrong be more obstinately held to course however can make difference in devotion to stuart cause hail with satisfaction prospect that in son may have one to whom may feel personally loyal for there can be doubt that men will fight with more vigour for person to whom be attached than for abstract idea have heard father o'leary say same sir opinion be that have late king possessed quality commanded personal admiration fidelity of follower excited something like enthusiasm among people at large must never have lost throne must have led army a did gustavus charles th of sweden must william of orange ever have ventured to cross to england be bad business altogether lad cause be practically lost from day that william set foot upon english soil have in reality personal friend who must have remained faithful to cause be paralysed by indecision feebleness charles martyr made many mistake have passionate adherence of follower personality noble appearance did a much for a goodness of cause while son james repelled rather than attracted personal devotion trust that grandson will inherit of quality outburst today gave hope that will do so one must not build too much on that may have be only pettishness of young man sick of constant tutelage to be subjected ennui of life lead rather than earnestness of noble spirit of course kennedy need not tell that must be well to make mention to anyone of scene that have witnessed will certainly make mention of to anyone sir be sorry indeed for young king life must be dreadful one conscious of impossibility of breaking bond in be held knowing that word action will be reported by spy to king of france for three month desmond kennedy worked hard at drill sword exercise became general favourite in regiment owing to good temper high spirit readiness to join in everything be going on went over several time to saint germain at first king counsellor looked coldly upon must have ceased to come there have not be for unaffected pleasure shown by king at visit in time however two of principal men at little court requested to have conversation with before going into king chamber will understand mr kennedy one of said when have seated in quiet spot in garden that standing in position of majesty counsellor be in position of great responsibility majesty a admit be natural chafe over inaction to be condemned by circumstance be apt at time to express desire for action in term if came to ear of king louis a have reason to believe be sometimes case must do cause serious injury naturally must be glad for to have companion of own age behoves to be most careful that such companionship must not add to difficulty in direction must view with satisfaction friendship between young king one who like be nearly of own age a can see full of spirit energy in matter king be deficient must be better that must for present remain a be rather than that must in acquiring more manly habit grow still more impatient discontented with position have naturally taken little trouble in finding out how stand in regiment hear nothing good of be much liked by comrade pay greatest attention to military exercise be regarded a one who will day do much credit to regiment feel that in most respect influence must not be advantageous to young king good that might do must be more than balanced be to render still more impatient than be for action may well suppose that exile a have be for so many year from country be not le impatient than for day of action know that such action must depend upon king of france not upon ourselves must gladly risk in effort to place on throne of england to repair past injustice cruel wrong be to move without assistance of louis instead of achieving that object might only bring fresh ruin confiscation death upon royalist of england scotland ireland be of opinion completely so sir of course know little of what be passing save in neighbourhood where have be brought up know that there even among king most devoted adherent there be feeling that nothing can possibly be done until france lends aid in english army be far stronger than be when be last in arm when william have to rely almost entirely upon dutch troop dutch general while friend of stuart be almost without arm without leader without organization be good mr kennedy if be to sanction king james forming intimacy with can understand that must rely upon not using influence to add to impatience for action discontent with present position certainly sir being so recently from ireland must assure that even most devoted adherent there be of opinion that rising must be attended with success unless backed by french arm especially by aid of irish brigade have already won such renown for whose appearance must excite greatest enthusiasm among irishman in case mr kennedy so far from throwing difficulty in way of majesty seeking companionship will encourage will be glad to see here a often a military duty will permit chapter valiant band permission be not attended with result that young prince counsellor have hoped for time james showed lively pleasure when desmond rode over to saint germain walked with in garden talked to alone in private apartment professed warm friendship for desmond be not long in discovering that first estimate of prince character have be wholly erroneous that outburst at first meeting have be result of pique irritation rather than real desire to lead more active life upon contrary be constitutionally indolent lethargic there be horse at command be seldom indeed that must take trouble to cross saddle although walking be distasteful to even when speaking of hope of ascending throne of england spoke without enthusiasm said one day be pity that can not be managed without fuss trouble hate trouble nothing can be done worth doing without trouble majesty desmond said sturdily almost seems to that if everything must be have without trouble must not be worth having how do mean mr kennedy may illustrate by saying sire that true fisherman must care about angling in pond close to house so full of fish that have to drop baited hook into water to bring up one immediately pleasure of fishing consists largely in hard work that demand be perhaps mile to stream across hill long day work may produce half dozen fish angler prize in proportion to trouble have have to get think that be born heir to throne must rather that must cost hardship toil danger to obtain than walk into cathedral few day after father death there be crowned agree with at james said shortly if anything must not be have without toil hardship danger a say must willingly go without then sire can only hope that toil danger may be borne by devoted follower that may be spared personally james looked sharply up at companion to gather whether word be spoken sarcastically desmond face though flushed be calm serious nevertheless indolent a be james felt that word be reproof although have at first liked there be in reality little in common between energetic young fellow next time came received with much le cordiality than before while desmond who be beginning to tire of companionship of one who lacked alike fun humour restless activity of comrade patrick phelim who saw that profession of james friendship be short lived came over to saint germain le frequently until at last only rode over with colonel when duty called there so have be failure master kennedy counsellor who have first spoken to said one day when change in king manner became evident to be afraid so sir desmond replied with smile have doubt that be fault perhaps be not patient enough with indeed effort to rouse to take exercise to practise in arm so on be so ill received that felt be doing more harm than good be afraid that must be so other said regretfully see during later year father gave up time almost entirely to religious observance consequently lad life be very dull monotonous constitutionally undoubtedly take after father who with virtue be at once indolent undecided have observed with regret disinclination to bestir in way seeing that who be father companion be too old too much disheartened to be lively companion for have hoped that talk of one of spirit of own age might have roused to make exertion to overcome disinclination for anything like active exercise think now however that be wrong that tonic be too strong that must not feel that abundance of spirit life be too much for that companion need be one who must to extent sympathize with who must perhaps make more allowance for manner in have be brought up blame at be sure that have done best be evident that contrast between have be too strong one that feeling can not hope to emulate soldierly activity have come to resent a sort of reflection upon desmond be by mean sorry at being relieved of necessity of paying frequent visit to saint germain in first place begrudged time be taken from fencing lesson at have worked enthusiastically in next have felt after two three visit between young king there be really nothing in common full of life spirit seemed to nothing short of disgraceful that one who aspired to rule must take pain to fit for throne to cultivate quality must render popular among high spirited people a came to understand james more thoroughly have found visit increasingly irksome more so a felt inutility thank goodness said to two friend when went home that day have done with saint germain be a warm adherent a ever of cause of stuart must be perfectly ready when time come to fight hardest for must vastly rather fight for king than converse with suppose by what have seen of that must be somewhat wearisome phelim obeullivan said with laugh fortunately wit gaiety be not essential quality on part of monarch must own treasonable a may sound fear majesty be lacking in other quality far more essential in monarch must say that be kindly well disposed wish to be fair just may turn out wise ruler be altogether deficient in energy suppose there be occasion for king safely seated upon throne to be energetic prince in exile must posse quality excite enthusiasm bind men to possibly quality king james posse must be highly valued by scotch must certainly fail to inspire people yes patrick o'neil agreed father did more to ruin cause in ireland than william dutch general troop together be disheartening to be risking life possession for man who must hing for whose indecision paralysed leader who moment reverse came sought safety in flight instead of taking place among men who be devoted to cause can understand in england where majority of who professed to be devoted to be betraying be in secret communication with william must be by turn obstinate vacillating in ireland where man who surrounded be risking life in cause must have shown absolute confidence in listened to advice set example of personal gallantry courage at least remained among until be definitely lost be desertion of james rather than loss of battle of boyne ruined cause well be glad be out of for be pity that must be going without work at salle d'armes when be making such progress that master reported in few month must become one of best swordsman in regiment there be in paris many irish officer besides belonging to colonel o'brien regiment be for most part men who have be severely wounded in preceding campaign who now remained in capital with depot of regiment be constantly recruited by fresh arrival from ireland by mean irish brigade be not only kept up to original strength in spite of heavy loss suffered in engagement in have taken part largely increased force new regiment being constantly formed naturally be corp being only complete regiment in paris at time be regarded a headquarters general meeting place of irish officer there a of have campaigned in flanders in italy in spain desmond learned from talk anecdote far more of doings of brigade than have hitherto known from first have by reckless bravery in almost engagement have taken place so distinguished that received highest commendation from french general be almost invariably selected for specially dangerous service think hottest affair be ever engaged in major who have served in burke regiment said one evening when ten twelve of companion have gathered at room be general meeting place of officer of corp be at attack on cremona by eugene have heard how regiment that of dillon distinguished there may not have heard particular place be strong one be garrisoned by men french with exception of two regiment marshal villeroy be in command excellent officer a be often case in french army very badly served by subordinate here a know almost everything go by influence general be surrounded by men who have be forced upon by powerful person whom can not afford to disoblige consequence be that relying upon strength of place proper watch be set there be guard indeed at gate with communication with other soldier on rampart patrol be sent out beyond town maintained in street harm might have come of have not be that treachery be at work there be scoundrel who be brother of priest of one of parish near wall be in favour of enemy priest residence be near sewer communicated with moat outside wall entrance be closed by iron grating be removed troop must enter by sewer into priest wine cellar priest being promised large sum of money set to work first laid complaint before governor that sewer be choked with filth might be source of disease to town unless removed to do be necessary that grating must be taken down being altogether unsuspicious of evil governor granted request a soon a grating be removed eugene despatched eight miner who crossed moat at night made way up

be glad enough when saw coming for be mighty trying work being left there hearing storm of battle going on round knowing at moment might be attacked did not stop long for order came from revel who have captured gate of saint be preparing to attack saint margaret to march again to gate of mantua seemed hopeless enterprise captain dillon of dillon regiment marched out after hard fighting drove austrian from house to house on reaching spot where ground be open be attacked on side for time enemy men be mixed up together in melee must hear by sound of firing that men be returning posted fellow so a to cover retreat a came back hotly pressed by enemy opened so warm fire that passed in through gate of barrier in safety only half a strong a have gone out a soon a be in aided in strengthening

hotly upon there now remained only gate of saint margaret in hand of austrian here large body of troop have be stationed succeeded in repulsing repeated attack made upon by revel force fight have now lasted for eleven hour position of austrian have become critical desperate resistance of men have entirely changed position have repulsed attack upon have given time for scattered french to gather one gate remaining in eugene possession be seriously threatened vaudemont corp be helpless on other side of river must render assistance eugene gave order for troop to retire did in good order have be hot day indeed for be only too glad to see go have lost three hundred fifty men out of six hundred with began fight altogether garrison have lost in killed wounded in prisoner fourteen hundred men officer while eugene loss be between fifteen sixteen hundred personally have have hotter fighting taking day altogether be most terrible through have ever passed throughout day be in total ignorance of what be going on elsewhere though knew by firing in other part of town that french there have not be overpowered time regiment left be expecting moment to be attacked by overwhelming force faith be enough to make one hair white however have reason to grumble obtained great praise for defence of barrier be given majority if have not be for wound received two year ago incapacitated from active service might now be in command of regiment yes indeed officer said be truly gallant affair although men have fought equally a well in many engagement be conduct at cremona attracted greatest attention showed french value of brigade must have always be employed in action on must look back with same pride pleasure a can upon cremona long list of battle where bore brunt of fighting never failed to be specially mentioned with praise by general most unpleasant work that ever did be when under marshal de catinat eight irish battalion be sent up in from pignerolle into valley of la perouse to oppose vaudois who have always offered vigorous resistance to passage of troop through pass be wild mountaineer huguenot to man who have believe generation ago be forced to fly from france take refuge in mountain maintained sturdily against various expedition sent against own business be not at to taste many others of officer shared opinion be too much like what remembered so bitterly at home when william trooper pursued fugitive to hill burning destroying killing above hunting down priest be other way be a cruel barbarous poor people have given offence save that held to own religion irishman must be last to blame for seeing have successfully opposed effort of french to root out be much against will marched with regiment hope that when come to fighting against regular troop of nationality be ready to do work to carry fire sword among quiet people in little mountain village went against grain seemed to that be to be massacre rather than fighting there be mistaken be hardest work ever went through be impossible in such country to move in large body be broken up into small party advanced into hill under own commander without fixed plan save to destroy habitation to capture kill flock of goat afforded inhabitant chief mean of subsistence to give quarter wherever resisted even now shudder at thought of work have to do climbing over pathless hill wading waist deep through mountain torrent clambering along on face of precipice where false step meant death always exposed to dropping fire from invisible foe who when arrived at spot from have fired have vanished taken up fresh position so that whole work have to be done over again sometimes be two even more day without food for a may imagine be impossible to transport provision have nothing save what carried in haversack at starting have to sleep on soaked ground in pitiless storm many men be carried away drowned in crossing swollen torrent clothes be never dry worst of be after six week of such work felt that be nearer to object for have be sent up than be when started be true that have destroyed many of little village a generally consisted of few house only rough building must be rebuilt in few day gain be not substantial one have of course killed of vaudois loss have be much heavier than for active a men be be match in speed for mountaineer who be a nimble a own goat knew everything of country must appear disappear a seemed to almost by magic be wretched business once twice when party be caught in narrow ravine be overwhelmed by rock thrown down from above so that on whole lost almost a many men a must have done in pitched battle gaining credit having satisfaction that be doing good service to france hope may never be employed in business like again be not only vaudois that have to fight for seeing at first be pushing forward steadily duke of savoy under whose protection lived sent six hundred regular troop to assist who be well commanded adopted same tactic a peasant avoiding attempt to bring on engagement never fighting except when have to great advantage a rule men be always dissatisfied when received order to fall back think that there be not man among be heartily glad when be recalled to rejoin catinat at expedition however although altogether unsuccessful in rooting out vaudois created such terrible devastation in mountain valley that irish name nation will long remain odious to vaudois six generation have since passed away time subsequent calamity have obliterated impression made by waste desolation of military incursion be at blenheim be not captain o'donovan tough fight be mismanaged one be in earl of clare regiment with lee dorrington battalion be stationed with force in oberglau in centre of position seemed to to general that position be almost impregnable lay along ridge at foot of be rivulet deep swampy ground on right of position be village of blenheim held by twenty seven battalion of good french infantry twelve squadron twenty four piece of cannon strong entrenchment have be thrown up round position be not altogether completed blenheim moreover have be surrounded by very heavy strong palisade altogether impassable by infantry a ally must not hope to get cannon across stream swamp seemed to defy attack from oberglau army of marshal de marcin elector stretched to village of lutzingen have five twenty cannon at oberglau weak point a afterwards turned out to be be crest between blenheim considering that artillery musketry fire from village swept slope a in number equalled enemy be thought well nigh impossible for to cross swamp advance to attack almost whole of french cavalry be massed on crest in order to charge must succeed in crossing try to ascend slope at first battle went altogether favourably have opposite to english dutch hanoverian danish troop under marlborough while facing left be prussian imperialist other german troop under eugene marlborough danish hanoverian cavalry first crossed be at once charged driven back then tried again supported by english infantry then marlborough led up still stronger force drove back light cavalry began to ascend hill be attacked by ten battalion hanoverian dane prussian while english bore against blenheim fighting at place be desperate must do german justice to say that nothing must have exceeded gallantry showed that in spite of heavy fire maintained pressed up slope remained in entrenchment till must be seen that english be falling back from blenheim whose palisade manned by twenty seven battalion of infantry offered obstacle must have defied best troop in world to penetrate immediately be seen nine battalion headed by three regiment leapt from trench poured down on german enemy must not withstand onslaught two of regiment be utterly destroyed rest suffered terribly be driven back on left marcin held ground against attack of eugene seemed to that battle be won however be not over yet while fierce fighting have be going on in front of oberglau blenheim marlborough have passed whole of cavalry rest of infantry across rivulet in spite of artillery musketry fire moved up in grand order infantry inclining towards two village a before cavalry bearing straight up slope when reached crest charging furiously upon horse stationed there be superior in number on head account differ at rate overthrew cavalry who fled in greatest disorder pursued by allied horse infantry poured into gap thus made blenheim be entirely isolated be exposed to assault in front rear nevertheless repulsed attack until marcin sent order for to retire then sallied out after setting fire to village flung upon enemy succeeded in cutting way through regiment forming rear guard whole of marcin army be now in full retreat harassed by allied cavalry whenever squadron approached faced about gave so warm reception that attacked le formidable foe a for garrison in blenheim know be at last surrounded by marlborough whole force with artillery with danube in rear prospect of succour be forced to surrender be disastrous day have not yet recovered from wound received there have five thousand infantry be posted in redoubt halfway between blenheim oberglau so a to give support to cavalry result of battle must have be very different still suppose that most battle be lost by unlooked for accident mistake in posting troop can only say that have allied force be composed of such troop a eugene commanded must have be beaten decisively have on contrary eugene commanded such troop a under marlborough marcin must never have held ground how many british troop be there in battle captain o'donovan somewhere about twelve thousand while continental troop be forty seven forty eight thousand there be doubt that be backbone of force just a flatter that three regiment be backbone of defence of oberglau chapter strange adventure when party broke up o'neil obeullivan a usual came in for quiet chat to desmond room a may be possibly ordered to spain kennedy said must like to know little about what be going to fight about for although know good deal about war in flanders news about in spain ever reached well know of course o'neil said that philip fifth be grandson of louis be naturally supported by france against archduke charles of austria who be competitor for throne who be of course supported by england six thousand english dutch troop be sent to aid archduke charles in attempt to invade spain dethrone philip king of portugal who be member of allied confederacy promised to have everything ready to cooperate with found however on arrival that preparation have be made be accordingly distributed for time among garrison on frontier philip on part have not be so inactive two army one commanded by duke of berwick other by general villadarias invaded portugal berwick surprised captured two dutch battalion then captured portalagre compelled garrison including english regiment of infantry to surrender ally to make diversion sent general da mina into spain with fifteen thousand men who captured one two town defeated body of french spanish troop hot weather now set in put stop to hostility troop on side went into quarter general forget name who commanded english dutch contingent be so disgusted with proceeding of portuguese that resigned command earl of galway be appointed in place next year crossed frontier captured several town without much fighting invested badajos here however stern resistance be met with galway hand be carried off by shot french general tesse coming up in force to relief of town portuguese not arriving at ally be obliged to fall back upon portugal philip be threatened from fresh quarter in june earl of peterborough sailed from portsmouth with five thousand men at lisbon took on board archduke charles at gibraltar more troop be embarked peterborough set sail for coast of valencia peterborough one of most daring of men possessed of extraordinary military talent be in favour of march upon madrid fortunately for be overruled commenced siege of barcelona strong town garrisoned by five thousand good troop while have thousand more under command nevertheless by sudden daring attack captured strong castle of montjuich commanded town be in consequence obliged to surrender four day later whole of catalonia be then captured saint matteo ninety mile from barcelona have declared for charles be besieged by large force be relieved so brilliant be exploit accomplished by peterborough with most inadequate mean that spaniard came to conclusion that be possessed by evil spirit large reinforcement be sent from france king philip advanced upon barcelona invested by land while french fleet bombarded by sea peterborough hurried with small force from valencia to aid besieged matter being more important since charles be in city before arrival however english fleet appeared fleet retired philip at once raised siege retired to madrid position be indeed serious lord galway be advancing from frontier peterborough have gathered force to cooperate with upon approach of galway philip duke of berwick retreated to frontier there received great reinforcement advanced against madrid be evacuated by galway who marched away to form junction with lord peterborough owing to dilatory habit hesitation of austrian prince junction be not effected for time then in spite of entreaty of two english general must not be persuaded to make movement towards madrid peterborough whose temper be extremely fiery at last lost patience abused charles openly then mounting horse rode down to coast embarked upon english ship of war sailed away to assist duke of savoy after departure ill feeling between english force portuguese leader of spanish adherent of charles increased spent time in quarrelling among be without money magazine almost without provision berwick be near with superior force took only step open of retreating towards valencia reached after suffering great hardship before berwick must overtake french troop be poured into spain while reinforcement be sent from england galway portuguese advanced to meet duke of berwick who be marching with large army to occupy catalonia two force met on plain of almanza on th of april spaniard be superior in number to english dutch portuguese battle be maintained for six hour portuguese infantry did little english dutch repulsed charge after charge even after portuguese spanish ally on wing be defeated in end victory remained with galway da mina portuguese general be wounded five thousand of men killed yet dutch english infantry held together on following day being absolutely without supply effected escape succeeded in reaching portugal while main body surrendered valencia saragossa other town opened gate to for time cause of archduke charles seemed lost success be however balanced by loss in same year of whole of spanish possession in italy a yet in spite of disaster have befallen cause of charles be not altogether lost for received fresh promise of support from england whose interest be to continue war in spain thus compel france to keep considerable body of troop there instead of employing against marlborough in flanders galway da mina be taken back to portugal in english fleet after disaster general stanhope who say be officer of great military experience talent have be sent out to take command a portion of catalonia be still held for charles there may yet be good deal of hard fighting before matter can be considered finally settled thank o'neil feel that know something about now be there of regiment there yes three of there be also irish regiment in spanish service under colonel crofton with talk ended for night after three month work desmond be dismissed from drill have obtained proficiency with rapier that felt that must now relax work see something of city have be hitherto too busy to explore have seen principal street in company of comrade have admired mansion of noble richness of good exposed to view in window gaiety magnificence of dress of upper class friend have warned that if intended to go farther must never do so alone must take with soldier servant trooper named mike callaghan mike be twenty eight year old strong bony hair be red natural colour of face be obscured by host of freckle eye be blue nose have upward turn expression be merry good humoured there be twinkle about eye seemed to show that be by mean wanting in shrewdness even in daytime o'neil said be not safe for man if well dressed likely to carry money in pocket to go into quarter of town paris have always be turbulent city while be abode of richest noblest of frenchman be also resort of rascaldom of france street be such that even city guard must not venture to search for ill doer unless in considerable force prepared for battle there be of course many street on other side of river where life property be a safe a in rue royal by way be not saying much for be only three day ago that man be assassinated there in broad daylight be captain in picardy regiment be supposed that murderer be man who have be dismissed from regiment with ignominy whoever be have got clear away for parisian citizen take good care not to interfere in such matter one thought of laying hand on villain although be said walked quietly off be in street be speaking of adventure may most easily be met with here there be too many hotel of noble with numerous retainer for to be safe to commit crime city guard be generally on alert for be harm to come to one of gentleman attached to great house matter must be represented to king city authority must come in for sharp reproof for failure to keep order in city whereas anything that happens among bourgeois must pas wholly without notice however if keep out of wine shop be not likely to become involved in trouble nine tenth of quarrel tumult originate there there be dispute perhaps between soldier citizen between soldier of different regiment in minute two twenty sword be drawn disturbance grows sometimes until be necessary to call out troop from nearest barrack to suppress however know that be not likely to get into trouble way for be very model of moderation to corp have seen enough of consequence of drink in ireland desmond said to cure of desire for liquor even have love for faction fight involving people of whole barony arising from drunken brawl be common enough while among better class duel be common for most part be result of foolish quarrel between two men heated by wine besides even putting that aside must have given up habit when joined regiment be anxious to become good swordsman if one head be overheated at night one hand must be unsteady one nerve shaken in morning possibly added with smile be quite a much a hotness of temper that prevents best teacher from caring to undertake tuition of officer of brigade possibly phelim laughed though never thought of before there be doubt that french who whatever fault be be far le given to exceeding fair allowance of wine than be countryman must come to morning lesson in saloon in better condition to profit by advice of master than many of men think patrick o'neil said that irishman drink from particular love of liquor from good fellowship joviality one can hardly imagine party of french noble inflaming with wine singing a fellow do frenchman be gay in what may call feeble way there be go in there be spirit in song there be real heartiness in joviality idea of one man playing practical joke upon latter taking in good part must never enter head for be ready to take offence at merest trifle a know there be certain cabaret told off for use of soldier of brigade be allowed to use others french troop be allowed to enter wine shop similarly there be certain establishment be almost exclusively patronized by officer of brigade there be of course absolute rule here can enter cabaret choose be understood that be at own risk that if get into trouble there be sure to be handled over coal pretty sharply a be considered that must deliberately have gone there with intention of picking quarrel cabaret used by men be close to barrack so that in case of fracas guard be sent down to bring concerned in back to barrack fortunately there be need for place frequent being so close to barrack for be understood that anyone who take too much liquor outside own quarter brings discredit on regiment be after adjourn to room of one other of that liquor begin to flow freely make night of ever have quarrel among yourselves angry word pas sometimes present interfere at once honour of regiment be first point with if men want to quarrel there be plenty of french officer who must be quite ready to oblige quarrel among must be regarded a discreditable to corp consequently dispute be always stopped before reach dangerous point if go further than usual party be sent for by colonel in morning get heavily wigged colonel insists upon matter being dropped altogether a blood have have time to cool be always ready to obey order especially a know that must report at once to general if matter be carried further well will certainly not be likely to get into quarrel over wine desmond said indeed in other way unless be absolutely forced into a to adventure such a speak of be still le likely to be concerned in hope that when be ordered on service will have full share of adventure such a may become soldier o'neil smiled time will show said adventure come without being sought may find in thick of one before have idea of what be doing mind if do get into adventure need assistance be bound to let help be compact made two month ago agreed to stand by other to be good comrade to share last sou naturally to give mutual aid under circumstance desmond nodded at rate o'neil adventure can not be so common a represent since neither of so far have called upon for aid assistance have heard last piece of court scandal kennedy obeullivan asked a three friend sat down to breakfast together few day later what be well be said that certain damsel name be at present secret have disappeared there be nothing very strange about o'neil laughed damsel do occasionally disappear sometimes have taken fate into own hand gone off with someone like better than man father have chosen for sometimes again be popped into convent for contumacy well go on obeullivan can not be all well be seems to be certain know went with colonel last night to ball at hotel de rohan nothing else be talked about several there returned from versailles in afternoon came back full of sort of version be current that be rich heiress go without saying if have not be disappearance must have excited attention so may take that be heiress of noble family say that father have chosen a husband man disliked exceedingly that have probably taken refuge in convent think that have be carried off bodily by someone smitten by charm fortune be certain that king have interested much in matter express greatest indignation though a must not seem that be royal ward be not clear why must concern over whisper that king anger be feigned that girl have be carried off by one of favourite why must such thing a be supposed desmond asked indignantly well there be something in support of idea if anyone else be to steal away with without consent young lady of court with influential friend must be likely to pas first two year of married life in one of royal prison therefore none desperate man one so secure of king favour a to feel certain that evil consequence must befall must venture upon step must remember that there be not few noble of court who have ruined to keep up lavish expenditure incumbent upon who bask in royal favour at versailles must be possible that majesty may have endeavoured to obtain hand of young lady for one of favourite that father may be noble of sufficient consequence to hold own to express to majesty regret that be unable to adopt recommendation a have other view for disposal of hand real singularity of matter be that one can tell with certainty who missing lady be early in day dozen be named a believe of put in appearance at reception in afternoon be evident that so far a be concerned there be foundation for rumour may be taken for certain however that friend be powerful people to have be able to impose silence upon acquainted with fact well be impossible to take very much interest in story desmond said carelessly when be in ignorance of very name of lady of important point whether have voluntarily gone away either with lover to convent whether have be carried off against will if latter be talking of adventure o'neil must be just sort of adventure must like for three to discover maiden rescue from abductor others laughed loudly be young officer who other day declared that wished for adventure save came in course of campaign now be declaring that must like to become very knight errant go about rescuing damsel in distress have idea of carrying into execution desmond said be merely expression of wish of course if lady in question went willingly to avoid persecution must rather help than hinder if have be carried off by ruined courtier nothing must please better than to rescue from several day have passed at last be confidently believed that missing lady be daughter of baron pointdexter magnate of languedoc who have recently come up to court on intimation from king that be long time since have be seen there that majesty hoped that must be accompanied by daughter of whose beauty report have reached be certain that father have attended of reception fete at versailles since rumour first spread although baron have have private interview with king few hour afterwards have left chamber with frowning brow showed that interview have not be pleasant one have not again appeared at court whether in consequence of royal command not one knew baron be one of richest proprietor in south of france be specimen of best type of french noble preferring to spend time among own wide estate to coming up to capital where visit have at time be rare during daytime desmond went out little when hour of drill exercise be over spent time in visiting quarter of men of company making personal acquaintance chatting freely with be glad to hear from about native country a of came from own neighbourhood took lively interest in news first have reached for year of family with whom be acquainted spent two three hour in afternoon in salle d'armes of regiment at school of

misfortune have fallen upon of wound be mere graze will tell after parade have be doing desmond said must nurse curiosity till be dismissed few minute after desmond reached quarter surgeon came in

to say no word a to event of night know what course young lady father may take said until do matter have better be kept secret altogether will keep quiet tongue in head one will hear anything from a to how got slice on shoulder will just say that be bit of scrimmage got into with two three of street rascal thing be so common that one be likely to ask further question about after parade be over o'neil obeullivan came up to desmond quarter now master kennedy have come to receive confession gave credit for being quiet decent boy now seems that man of yours have be engaged in disreputable riot out night coming in on two strange horse for aught know have be carried off by force of arm desmond laughed a to horse be not so far wrong a one might expect o'neil rode morning from versailles from versailles o'neil repeated what in name of saint took to versailles be afraid desmond that be falling into very evil course well tell about will be glad to be able to believe that there be redeeming feature in strange business desmond laughed then said more seriously well have have adventure other people be concerned in a well a myself have made up mind to tell because know can depend upon promise to keep absolute secret sound mysterious indeed obeullivan said however have promise o'neil will be a silent a grave well then know how be chaffing other day about finding mademoiselle pointdexter mean to say that have found kennedy o'neil exclaimed incredulously be what mean to say though found be hardly word since be not looking for even thinking of her at time still in point of fact accidentally came across place where be hidden away after sharp skirmish in callaghan have to kill two men carried off delivered safely to father morning two young officer looked hard at desmond to discover if be speaking seriously for tone be so quiet matter of fact that must scarce credit that have passed through exciting adventure three be so accustomed to hoax other that struck a simply invention on part of comrade so absolutely improbable did seem to sure be trying to hoax kennedy obeullivan said must not blame if be desmond said with smile considering cock bull story that be constantly trying to palm off on however be wrong now will tell affair just a happened related in detail story of rescue of mademoiselle pointdexter manner in have conveyed to versailles by saint bridget kennedy be not far wrong when called knight errant well be something like adventure though whether will end well ill for can not say did learn name of person who have girl carried off asked question indeed have little conversation with for a have told put in carriage with old hag who be in charge of rode by side of in case old woman must try to escape truly discreet proceeding kennedy o'neil laughed think if have be in place must have taken seat inside also where of course must at once have watched old woman talked with young one think that must have done anything of sort o'neil desmond said gravely must have seen a did that be better that must travel alone with old woman till reached father house scandal will be busy enough with name in case be a well that must not be said that arrived home in carriage with young officer of o'brien irish regiment by faith kennedy seems to that be saint anthony bayard rolled into one seriously be undoubtedly right well depends upon who be man who carried off a to whether be fortunate unfortunate in thus having thwarted design if be adventurer action will gain heap of credit if on other hand be one of king favourite seeking to mend fortune by marrying be probable that will have made dangerous enemy nay more have drawn upon king displeasure must think likely that before attempting so desperate action a carrying off of baron pointdexter daughter man must have assured that king must not view enterprise with displeasure may assume that must not inform majesty of particular must put hypothetically that a be getting into sore strait thought of mending fortune by carrying off heiress not of course one of of whose hand king have disposal that trusted that if succeeded majesty must not view matter a grave offence from what know of louis must reply gravely must be obliged duke viscount a case might be to express very grave displeasure to order to leave court for time a harm must be done young lady married to might be that in time must pardon offence if be how thing have gone may be sure that king will not view with satisfaction man who have interfered with favourite plan for mending fortune desmond shrugged shoulder king dissatisfaction must matter very little to said especially a must not openly manifest without making apparent that have approved of scheme be not such trifle a think kennedy lettres de cachet be not difficult to obtain by powerful member of court especially when person named be young regimental officer whose disappearance must excite comment curiosity save among officer of own regiment man who carried off mademoiselle pointdexter must be bold fellow be likely to be vindictive one doubt object be to keep young lady prisoner until agreed to marry loss of pretty bride with splendid fortune be trifling one likely to be bitterly resented whether resentment will take form of obtaining order for confinement in bastille other royal prison of getting put out of way by stab in back be unable to say in case must advise strongly to give up fancy for wandering about after dark when do go out keep in frequented portion of town jack farquharson who be at versailles with colonel last week be speaking of mademoiselle pointdexter said that be charming did find so thought nothing about one way other desmond said carelessly only saw face by torchlight be of course agitated by what have happened indeed a be busy helping mike to yoke horse to carriage have scarcely time to look at when reached versailles be barely daylight handed out of carriage left to enter by a thought be better that must meet father alone think must recognize be to meet in street most insensible youth obeullivan said with laugh insensible discreet to point be not assured none must believe that have irish blood in vein so say be going over to versailles tomorrow yes left message with servant who opened door to effect of course will be glad to know if baron intends to take step against daughter abductor whether think best not to add to scandal by stirring up matter to take away at once to estate be in difficult position o'neil said gravely young lady have be missing for fortnight one know whether went of own free will against be father to carry off quietly must excite worst suspicion better by far lodge complaint before king proclaim grievance loudly everywhere tell story in detail whichever course take evil minded people will think worse of two evil latter seems to to be lesser suppose must be desmond agreed though for part must be heartily glad if never heard word about be too modest altogether kennedy whatever rumour may be current concerning young lady there can be doubt that come out splendidly in hear cry of woman in distress scale wall to get in to assistance servant encounter five of guard kill four of bind other rescue maiden carry off with flying colour in carriage of abductor dear kennedy will become object of admiration to lady of court will be absolutely disgusting desmond said angrily be almost enough to make one wish one have never interfered in affair pooh pooh kennedy be sure that obeullivan must give be going to say year pay though how one must exist without know to have be in place why man if have captured standard in battle after feat of superhuman bravery must not attract attention will fall to a consequence of adventure life in court of most christian majesty be one of most artificial possible woman hide face with powder patch lace until be ready to faint walk with mincing air live chiefly upon scandal be woman after woman have spice of romance in nature adventure a yours be very thing to excite admiration know nothing about woman desmond growled want to know of especially lady at court of louis well of course kennedy if baron proclaims wrong publishes circumstance of daughter abduction rescue seal of silence will be taken from lip especially a will almost to certainty be summoned to versailles to confirm lady story be afraid that will be so desmond said despondingly however ca be helped suppose one must make best of to most of officer who dropped in in course of day to see desmond to enquire how got wound abstained from giving particular be merely said that callaghan be suddenly attacked by five ruffian whom managed to beat off much surprise be expressed that such attack must be made upon officer soldier on whom little plunder must be expected who must be sure to defend stoutly several indeed expressed incredulity doubt for moment kennedy that be attacked by five men a say that routed there must have be motive for attack evening stroll of yours be suspicious will warrant that there must have be great deal at bottom of now can deny that admit deny anything desmond said with smile enough that at present have told all that feel justified in telling acknowledge that there be more behind at present mouth be sealed on subject colonel be among who came in to see to desmond said frankly that affair be altogether out of common that be likely that whole fact must be known shortly that a other person be concerned must not speak of until have obtained permission then will ask further colonel o'brien said have seen enough of to know that must not be concerned in affair must bring discredit upon corp be curious to know whole story be quite content to wait until feel at liberty to tell next morning desmond took part in usual work of regiment then mounting horse rode to versailles on ringing bell at house occupied by baron de pointdexter old servitor whom have before seen opened gate baron be expecting monsieur said bowing deeply at call servant ran out took desmond horse led away to stable while desmond followed old man to house door opened a approached baron tall man fifty year of age advanced hastily holding out hand monsieur kennedy said have rendered to greatest service have received during life word can express gratitude feel for one who have restored to only child just when have come to believe that be lost to forever be surely guardian saint who sent to spot at moment might have happened to anyone sir desmond said surely gentleman on hearing appeal for help from woman in distress must have done just what did let go in baron said daughter have be eagerly waiting coming especially a tell that doe not think said even word of thanks to being overpowered by what have gone through by joy at sudden unexpected deliverance indeed say that scarcely exchanged two word with there be opportunity baron for indeed a soon a told that there be carriage horse in stable be too much occupied in getting ready for to depart without delay to think of talking have now entered house a baron led way into sitting room girl rose from fauteuil monsieur kennedy be daughter mademoiselle anne de pointdexter be high time that be formally presented to other anne be officer who rendered such invaluable service meet almost a stranger mademoiselle desmond said deeply bowing for own saw so little of face other night must hardly have recognized have met elsewhere must certainly not have recognized monsieur kennedy what with own fright may say condition of face have faint idea of what be really like certainly did not think that be so young have masterful way with seemed to know so perfectly what ought to be done took to be much older than now look joined regiment little more than three month ago desmond said be youngest ensign monsieur owe to more than life for have not be for must have be forced into marriage with one whom despise can not think that mademoiselle from what saw of must say that must have resisted threat even undergone hopeless imprisonment rather than yield there be saying monsieur kennedy baron said anne be of good blood know that must have be hard to break down will confinement hopelessness will tell on bravest spirit however may be be debtor for life indeed monsieur kennedy girl said pray to believe that be more grateful to than word can express pray to say more about mademoiselle deem most fortunate circumstance be able to come to assistance especially so when found that lady have rescued be one whose disappearance have made so great stir must have be glad to render such service to one in poorest condition daughter said that asked question monsieur kennedy therefore be suppose in ignorance of name of abductor altogether be vicomte de tulle one who stand very high in regard of king who be one of most extravagant dissipated even of courtier here for time have be reported that have nigh ruined by lavish expenditure doubtless thought to reestablish finance by bold stroke plan be well laid waited until have gone to paris on business must keep there for day two messenger arrived with letter purporting to be from saying that wished daughter to join at once have sent carriage to take to anne be young suspecting harm at once threw on mantle hood entered carriage be broad daylight there be nothing to disquiet until on approaching town carriage turned off main road struck a strange be just about to ask question where be being taken when carriage stopped in lonely spot door be opened man stepped in before have even time to recognize threw thick cloak over head struggled in vain to free held fast again again tried to cry out mouth be muffled by wrapping have heard blind of carriage drawn finding that struggle to free be vain receiving answer to supplication to be released remained quiet until carriage stopped then be lifted out carried into house where found wrapping be removed man who have taken off who by attire be gentleman in service of noble said be alarmed mademoiselle harm be intended to master be grieved to be obliged to adopt such mean passion for be so great that be driven to step will entirely depend upon when captivity will end ' 'your master whoever may be anne said contemptible villain 'naturally have poor opinion of at present ' fellow said be convinced that in time will come to excuse fault be wholly due to depth of feeling that entertains towards there be woman here who will wait upon men will not intrude duty be solely to see that escape indeed must be impossibility for seeing that wall surround garden be well nigh fifteen foot high gate barred locked key thereof in pocket ' called old woman whom brought here with anne entered bid ascend to room have be prepared for in respect have nothing to complain of of course did not notice a have other thing to think of be handsomely furnished there be bed in alcove flower on table book even harpsichord evidently be intended that imprisonment must be made a light a might be looking from window anne saw that room be at back of house have probably be chosen because tree shut window off from view of anyone beyond wall next day old woman announced vicomte de tulle bowed profoundly began by excusing step that have taken crediting solely to passion that have conceived for may imagine scorn reproach with answered be quite unmoved by word said calmly when paused may be sure must not have undertaken scheme unless have fully weighed consequence plan have be so laid that search may be made for will be in vain here be here will remain until listen to suit want will be satisfied wish complied with whether be one year five will not leave house until leave a bride ' sir ' said passionately will be prisoner for life ' may think at present mademoiselle said 'and expected nothing else with time reflection may come to think otherwise union with be not so terrible matter rank know standing high a do in favour of most gracious majesty position at court will be such a might gratify daughter of noblest family in france study of life will be to make happy ' will now leave to think over matter will not pester with attention for month will not see again at end of time trust that will have seen futility of condemning to further captivity will be disposed to make more allowance than at present for step to passion for have driven ' be just month since have be carried off very day when rescued old woman have informed that vicomte must do pleasure of calling upon next day for first fortnight have held up bravely in hope must discover place where have be hidden then began to feel imprisonment silence telling upon for old woman only entered to bring in meal never opened lip except on first occasion when told that be strictly forbidden to converse with after began to despair news that abductor must visit next day decided to make attempt to escape have difficulty in letting down from window by aid of bedclothes found that what have be said respecting wall gate be true that be nearer escape than have be before have left room be trying in vain to unbar gate indeed must have be useless must have accomplished a be also locked be striving with energy of desperation when door of house opened men rushed out seized a dragged back to house uttered cry brought to assistance rest know a soon a heard story went to palace asked for private interview with king king received graciously enough asked with appearance of great interest if have obtained news of daughter ' have more than obtained news majesty have daughter back again have come to demand justice at hand congratulate indeed baron ' king said with appearance of warmth saw colour change be convinced that knew something at least of matter where have damsel be hiding ' went on behe have not be hiding at sire ' said behe have be abducted by one of majesty courtier with intention of forcing into marriage name sire be vicomte de tulle demand that justice will be done that will receive punishment due to so gross outrage ' king be silent for minute then said have indeed if have be rightly informed acted most grossly still be evident that repented step that took so suffered to return to ' 'not so majesty ' said owe return to repentance on part to gallantry of young officer who passing house where be confined heard cry for aid with soldier servant climbed gate of enclosure be there attacked by man who have charge of with four others young gentleman servant killed four of bound other then entering house compelled woman who have be appointed to act a servant to lead way to chamber fortunately carriage in have be taken there be still in stable with horse gallant young gentleman at once got carriage in readiness placed daughter in with woman who have be attending on servant drove rode by side of carriage in way brought home morning ' in spite of effort to appear indifferent be evident that king be greatly annoyed however only said 'you did quite right to come to baron be outrageous indeed that young lady of court must be thus carried off will see that justice be done who be officer who have rendered daughter service name be kennedy sire be ensign in o'brien irish regiment will myself send for ' said 'and thank for having defeated disgraceful plot of vicomte de tulle suppose be quite sure of circumstance a have told to ' 'it be impossible that there can be mistake sire ' said 'in first place have daughter account be entirely corroborated by old woman have brought with whose only hope of escaping from punishment lay in telling truth in respect fully confirmed daughter account ' 'but vicomte have not be absent from versailles for past month have be at morning levee on other occasion at breakfast dinner have walked with in garden be always present at evening reception 'that be so sire ' said daughter happily saw once namely on morning after be captured then told frankly that must remain prisoner until consented to marry however long time might be said must return in month hoped by time to find that seeing hopelessness of position must be more inclined to accept suit 'it be on eve of coming again that daughter in desperation made attempt to escape be foiled in effort nevertheless brought about rescue for cry a guard dragged into house attracted attention of monsieur kennedy who forthwith a have told stormed house killed guard brought home to ' king then sent for de tulle spoke to with great sternness latter did not attempt to deny accusation endeavoured to excuse on ground of passion that have conceived for daughter certainly from king tone thought that must at least have sent to bastille to great disappointment wound up reproof by saying ' can of course make allowance for passion for so charming young lady a mademoiselle pointdexter outrage committed be far too serious to be pardoned will at once repair to estate will remain there during pleasure ' vicomte bowed withdrew hour later left versailles king turned to a left room said ' trust monsieur le baron that be content that justice have be done ' be too angry to choose word said firmly ' can not say that be content majesty such outrage a have be perpetrated upon daughter deserves far heavier punishment than banishment from court methinks that imprisonment a long a intended to inflict upon unless consented to be wife must have much more nearly met justice of case ' king rose to foot suddenly thought that boldness must meet with punishment desired for de tulle bit lip then said coldly 'you be not often at court baron pointdexter be doubtless ignorant be not accustomed to be spoken to in tone have used however can make due allowance for great anxiety that have suffered at daughter disappearance trust will see daughter at levee evening ' a be command of course went be bound to say that king did in power to show to court that considered to be wholly blameless of course story have already got about be known that vicomte have be ordered to estate king be markedly civil to anne talked to for time expressed deep regret that must have be subject to outrage while staying at court said in tone loud enough to be heard by standing round 'the only redeeming point in matter be that vicomte de tulle in way troubled molested that only saw for few minute on first day of confinement ' need not say that royal utterance be most valuable to daughter that at once silenced malicious scandal might otherwise have got about king stopped to speak to immediately afterwards said ' trust that will pardon word spoke morning majesty have rendered daughter inestimable service by speech that have just made ' thus although dissatisfied with punishment inflicted on vicomte de tulle believing that king have shrewd idea who abductor be be grateful to for shielding daughter from ill tongue by marked kindness to by declaring openly that de tulle have not seen since day of abduction intended to return home tomorrow king when went morning to pay respect state intention of taking anne home bade standing round to fall back be good enough to say in low voice to ' think baron that must do well to reconsider decision to leave tomorrow sudden departure must give rise to ill natured talk must be wiser to stay here for short time till gossip wonder have passed away saw that majesty be right will stay here for short time longer must certainly have bad effect be to seem to run away hide in province mademoiselle de pointdexter have retired when father began to relate to desmond what have happened know little of life in paris monsieur le baron desmond said certainly seems to monstrous that man who committed foul outrage must escape with what be doubtless short banishment from court know that matter be ended yet monsieur kennedy in spite of edict against duelling must have demanded satisfaction from for attack upon honour of family be at present anne only protector be many year since have drawn sword while de tulle be noted a fencer have have many affair of have escaped consequence owing to royal favour therefore be to challenge chance be must be killed in case daughter must become ward of crown hand estate be bestowed on one of king creature a said matter be not likely to rest a be anne have with full consent approval given love to young gentleman of province be large landed proprietor connection of family be not a yet formally betrothed for have wish to lose so soon in spite of present fashion of early marriage by mean approve of told monsieur de la vallee that must wait for couple of year need scarcely say that after what have happened will reconsider decision for sooner be married beyond reach of repetition of outrage better imagine however that young gentleman will be no better satisfied than be that matter must have be passed over so lightly will take into own hand send challenge immediately to vicomte be high spirited have reputation among of being good fencer doubt whether can posse such skill a de tulle have acquired be not always injured person come off victorious in duel must fortune go against monsieur de la vallee must be terrible blow to daughter indeed to myself for be much attached to be worrying about already of course be impossible that affair can be hidden from be public property now therefore sent off one of groom hour since with letter to hitherto have not written to about daughter disappearance knowing must on hearing of at once hasten here where must do good must only add to trouble thought best to let matter go on a be have be doing everything be possible to have trouble a well a own on hand must have driven to distraction groom be to change horse at post house to use greatest possible speed may be sure that monsieur de la vallee will do same that in six day will be here have given merest outline of affair have not mentioned name of anne abductor have done so be probable that philip must have gone straight to de tulle forced on encounter at once a be trust that anne between may persuade to take step in matter be honour of family not of have be attacked have be betrothed to daughter must have be in position to take up quarrel a be have status except distant relationship now monsieur kennedy have king order to take to palace asked several question about morning said that have not yet seen that be riding over here today said 'bring to when come baron must like to see young fire eater who thrust so boldly into matter in have concern solely because heard woman voice calling for help ' be sorry to hear desmond said bluntly from what say imagine that in spite of what have done king be far from gratified at failure of favourite plan however can not disobey command in matter chapter new friend baron sent servant to request daughter to come down be going now with monsieur kennedy to palace anne said a entered suppose that will be absent very long have be talking matter over with think that agrees with view of have hardly spoken to yet father will have opportunity of doing so when return monsieur kennedy will of course dine with after service that have rendered to have right to consider a belonging to have have idea of desmond said a walked up hill towards palace gate must have put on full uniform undress be scarcely attire in one must appear before king of france who be a have heard most particular in matter of etiquette be so baron said will know that must not be prepared for audience doubtless will receive in private closet on ascending grand staircase baron gave name to one of court chamberlain have order latter said to take at once on presenting to majesty closet instead of entering audience chamber be conducted along private passage of considerable length on arriving at door chamberlain asked to wait while went inside to ascertain whether majesty be disengaged majesty will see in few minute baron said when came out duc d'orleans be with hearing name announced for private audience be taking leave in two three minute handbell sounded in room chamberlain who at once entered returned in moment conducted baron desmond into king private apartment allow to present to former said monsieur desmond kennedy officer in o'brien regiment irish gentleman of good family king who be now far advanced in life looked at young man with surprise have expected to see older man said though told baron be ensign looked to see man of same type a so many of gallant irish officer ready for desperate service so young sir have begun early indeed to play havoc among liege subject for hear that soldier with slew four of hardly liege subject majesty if may venture to say so for assuredly be not engaged in lawful proceeding when came upon slight smile crossed king face be accustomed to adulation simple frankness with young soldier ventured to discus propriety of word used surprised amused be right sir fellow who be ready to undertake service however criminal for be paid certainly deserve to be called liege subject now must hear from own lip how be that thrust into matter with have concern being wholly ignorant understand that lady whose voice heard be mademoiselle pointdexter matter be very simple sire having joined regiment few month being naturally anxious to perfect in exercise in arm have little time to stir out during day of evening frequently go for long ramble taking with soldier servant have that evening gone farther than usual night being fair weather balmy naturally when heard cry of woman in distress determined to see what have happened a might well be that murder be being done then related circumstance of obtaining entrance into garden of attack upon by guard how finally brought mademoiselle pointdexter to versailles king listened attentively be exploit must have loved to perform when be age monsieur kennedy behaved in matter with singular discretion gallantry if intend always to interfere when hear woman cry out be like time will be pretty well occupied that before long there will be vacancy in rank of regiment truly monsieur le baron daughter have reason for gratitude that happened to be passing at time a king of france be glad that outrage on lady of court have failed be perhaps not altogether without blame in matter short time ago vicomte de tulle told that hoped to better fortune by rich marriage named name said aught of measure intended to adopt said must be well that must do so for rumour have reached that finance be in disorder whether took a permission to use mean that thought fit can not tell certainly did not suspect when heard of disappearance of mademoiselle de pointdexter that have hand in be shocked when baron came here denounced to be glad indeed that enterprise be thwarted for be most unworthy one be too young yet for to grant military promotion will be proof of approbation of conduct that king of france be determined to suppress irregularity at court taking diamond ring from finger handed to desmond who went on one knee to receive will please inform colonel that when come to versailles request will always bring with audience be evidently finished baron desmond bowing deeply left king cabinet baron did not speak till left palace louis have fault baron then said one must play part of great monarch more nobly than doe have doubt that de tulle relied implicitly upon obtaining forgiveness have succeeded in forcing anne into marrying though doubtless must have feigned displeasure for time have extricated most gracefully can quite believe that did not imagine favourite intended to adopt so criminal course to accomplish matter of spoke to must not fail to have suspicion when heard of anne disappearance however can consider affair a happily ended except for matter of monsieur de la vallee of whom spoke to now sir that king have expressed gratitude to for saving court from grave scandal how can fitly express own at inestimable service that have rendered must say baron that will be most welcomely expressed if will abstain from saying more of matter be simple one went to assistance of woman in distress succeeded at expense of trifling wound in accomplishing rescue lady happened to be daughter have be daughter of little bourgeois of paris carried off by reckless noble must have be same much more have be made of matter than there be occasion for have gained for approbation thanks of king to say nothing of ring although be judge of such matter must be very valuable one must not have worn have have pleasure of rendering service to mademoiselle de pointdexter therefore feel far more than duly rewarded for service somewhat recklessly undertaken on spur of moment may be very well a far a interest monsieur kennedy not so far a be concerned fear will have to remain debtor till end of life can say at present be that hope that a soon a can obtain leave will come a most honoured guest to chateau there will see under happier circumstance life of country seigneur be poor preparation for existence in court where although there be longer open licentiousness prevailed in king younger day there be yet believe equal amount of profligacy though have be sternly discountenanced since madame maintenon obtained absolute may say well used influence over majesty will be happy indeed to pay visit baron if military duty will permit absenting for time from paris know of france be capital nothing must give greater pleasure than to have opportunity of seeing country life in so pleasant manner pleasure must be no le than own monsieur kennedy there be one thing must warn about be must be careful for time not to go out after dark de tulle have evil reputation be vindictive a well a unscrupulous doubtless have agent here who will by time have discovered who be that brought daring scheme to naught be to mind more than probable that will endeavour to be revenged will be on guard desmond said quietly must be careful indeed baron said against open violence can well defend against blow from behind with dagger skill courage be of little avail when go out after dark pray let army servant follow closely behind see that sword be loose in scabbard desmond nodded believe will take precaution be not likely that there will long be need for for none can doubt that military operation will soon begin on large scale be not likely if be case to be kept in garrison in paris when desmond arrived that evening at barrack found that story of rescue of mademoiselle de pointdexter be already known also that vicomte de tulle have be abductor have in consequence be banished from court baron have indeed related circumstance to of intimate friend story have varied greatly a spread have come to be reported that officer have brought strong body of soldier who have assaulted house where be confined after desperate conflict have annihilated guard have be placed over desmond laughed a story be told to when entered room where officer be gathered narrator concluded a have be to versailles kennedy doubtless will have heard latest particular have learnt who be officer what regiment belonged to how came to have body of soldier with outside town for say that house where be confined be mile half beyond wall there be longer reason for concealment matter have become public baron must certainly mention name indeed visit to palace private audience given to baron must assuredly have be noted story be quite new to said be swollen in telling to undue proportion real fact of case be by mean so romantic truth of story by time be generally known a mademoiselle pointdexter father have many friend at court affair happened to myself to kennedy be exclaimed in astonishment by present exactly so said nothing must have be more simple evening before last be a usual taking walk night being fine passed beyond gate presently heard scream woman cry for help none of gentleman must have be insensible to appeal callaghan climbed over pretty high gate not knowing what force there might be in place occupied at first by unbarring shooting lock of gate bolt be stiff made noise over brought out five men disposed of after short fight in got graze on cheek callaghan sword wound in shoulder how did dispose of kennedy colonel asked ran two of through callaghan cut down one shot fifth man cried for mercy simply tied up then found mademoiselle pointdexter learning from that carriage in have be brought there be with horse still in stable got out harnessed horse put old woman who be be attendant in carriage with mike took rein mounted saddle horse drove to father house at versailles saw fairly inside then a know got back here just a regiment be forming up on parade very pretty adventure indeed colonel said warmly loud expression of approbation rose from other listener why did not tell when came in colonel went on have not seen baron pointdexter did not know what course must take whether must think best to hush matter up altogether to lay complaint before king until knew what be going to do seemed to best must hold tongue altogether when went to versailles today found that have laid complaint before king that vicomte de tulle who be author of outrage have be ordered to estate may say have honour of private interview with majesty who graciously approved of conduct gave ring held out hand a token of approval well gentleman will agree with colonel said that young ensign have made admirable debut be sure that be proud of manner in have behaved anticipation that must prove credit to regiment have be verified sooner than seemed possible have indeed colonel major said be in way risky thing for to have attempted mean because of odds that might have to face because of trouble that might have got into by forcing way into private house scream might have come from mad woman from serving wench receiving whipping for misconduct never thought anything about major woman screamed for help seemed to that help must be given did not think of risk from armed men inside for have reason to believe that there be such of civil indictment for breaking in heard cry made straight for house a turned out went well well indeed colonel said have rescued wealthy heiress from pitiable fate have fleshed maiden sword in body of two villain have earned gratitude of young lady father have received approval of majesty very good night work altogether now tell little more about desmond be compelled to tell story in much further detail than before colonel ordered in dozen of champagne be late before party broke up see be pretty nearly right in guess o'neil said a obeullivan walked across with desmond to quarter said that thought likely might have be carried off by one of court gallant who felt tolerably confident that if successful king must overlook offence fellow thanks to interference did not succeed king have let off lightly enough by only banishing from court if have be anyone one of favourite must by time have be tenant of bastille think that punishment be adequate then be not courtier must be rather glad than not to be sent away to estate might have desmond remarked suppose punishment be severe one to men accustomed to round of pleasure dissipation who consider highest of earthly honour to be in favour with king however one must be kinder than majesty have be on subject at reception last night at ordered baron daughter to appear showed most marked favour particularly put stop to scandal by saying loudly that de tulle have never seen after first morning of capture six day later when desmond be engaged in fencing room callaghan came in told that gentleman be at quarter wishing particularly to see what be name sure know honour did not mention be not for like of to ask ridiculous mike in future when anyone come wish to see will say name will tell mr kennedy ' put on uniform coat reluctantly for be engaged in interesting bout with professor who be old friend of maitre d'armes a entered room young man who have be staring out of window drumming impatiently with finger turned be stranger to desmond be desmond kennedy sir young officer said to what do owe honour of visit other did not reply stood looking at in so strange earnest way that desmond felt almost uneasy sir visitor said at last advancing to holding out hand when tell that name be philip de la vallee will understand what must strike a singular behaviour arrived last night at versailles heard have happened can imagine therefore that heart be almost too full for word with gratitude thankfulness desmond be moved by emotion of visitor hand met in hearty clasp monsieur de la vallee be young man of four five twenty well proportioned active sinewy from devotion to field sport be about same height a desmond latter who have not yet finished growing be larger boned must broaden into much bigger more powerful man henceforth monsieur kennedy de la vallee went on hope that will be a brother more have not be for life must have be ruined one what agony have be saved make mad to think be idling at home ignorant that beloved have be carried away blame baron for not informing acknowledge that reason gave be good one must have done nothing must have added to trouble by anxiety anger still told that in day two must have felt that ought no longer to be kept in dark must have summoned to paris be thankful now that did not do so for believe that impotence to do anything must have driven almost to distraction agree with that baron acted wisely kennedy said have not chance providence taken past house where be imprisoned at very moment when mademoiselle pointdexter cried for help might for aught can say have remained captive there for month even year be providence indeed monsieur kennedy providence not only that must have cried at moment that cry must have reached ear of one so ready able to save now pray call philip allow to call desmond a pledge of close friendship with pleasure kennedy replied compact be sealed with close grasp of hand be strange desmond while king who have little interest in matter must present a be told did with diamond ring baron who owe so much can hing to show gratitude desmond smiled can assure need such token said thanks have received from be infinitely more grateful to than amount of ring jewel now friend philip de la vallee went on own burning desire be to go to de tulle a soon a have accompanied baron anne to home first to publicly chastise villain noble then of course to fight naturally have said nothing of to baron feel after what have happened that in will find adviser sympathizer sympathize with most heartily philip in place must feel same impulse yet must not be wise to give way to say on ground that be notoriously good swordsman that instead of taking vengeance upon might kill feel that argument must not have influence with personally taking position with regard to mademoiselle de pointdexter must have great weight can judge from what must have felt have be aware of disappearance what must feel did hear of death in quarrel be brother must say that must be right nay that must be duty to endeavour to punish outrage against honour of family be openly betrothed to must again have right to punish abductor not being brother betrothed reason public opinion must justify doing so moreover did fight with kill must incur gravest resentment of king for in fact must be impugning justice have considered banishment from court to be sufficient punishment for offence not only be favourite of king belongs understand to powerful family who must may be sure use influence with king to bring about punishment for breach of decree against duelling must be fortunate if escaped long imprisonment other be silent feel that be right said at last indeed be hard must not be able to avenge outrage upon lady who be to be wife may tell that a soon a return home formal betrothal be to take place ere long marriage will be celebrated will feel lowered in own esteem if sit down quietly under injury see that desmond said if abstain from challenging de tulle be from fear of consequence be a have shown because whatever issue of contest must be bad for if be killed life must be spoilt if killed might languish for year in one of royal prison king pride on justice by account rightly so be sure that must feel deepest resentment be anyone to show by action that considered have favoured transgressor be right desmond at rate for present will put intention aside must ever cross path assuredly will have reckoning with how be that who be at least eight year younger than be must argue a old counsellor rather than young ensign suppose in first place be from bringing up lived with be educated by good priest one not wanting in manliness energy who often deplored system of duelling be a strong with a be here denounced a relic of barbarism at rate never to be put in use on account of heated quarrel over wine only if deadly injury have be inflicted even then better left alone of course a officer in one of majesty regiment must be obliged to conform to general usage for did decline must be regarded a having brought dishonour on corp case differs altogether from yours in next place knowing be coming to versailles thought over what course must be likely to pursue considered be probable must lose time in challenging de tulle have thought matter over in light made up mind to endeavour to dissuade from doing so if opportunity offered so see added with smile have prepared array of argument against can not think that opinion of one interested not vitally so on point be rather to be taken than of person smarting under injury now to turn to other matter in three day start for south baron accompanied here went to see colonel while came to quarter object be to ask to grant month leave of absence with provision of course that must return at once if regiment be ordered on service be kind indeed of desmond said doubt whether colonel will assent be not month since be dismissed from drill took place with company doubt whether will consider be sufficiently versed in duty that after being so short time in regiment have right to leave what say be right enough under ordinary circumstance be altogether extraordinary then after what have done will feel natural that must wish to have with for time moreover consider that journey will be altogether unattended by danger from what have heard of de tulle be man who never forgives will pursue object with pertinacity of bloodhound have failed in first attempt there be reason why must not renew confident perhaps that if successful king though may feel necessary to feign much anger for time will finally forgive take into favour again especially a family must bring influence to bear to bring about doubtless will be kept perfectly informed of what be going on here there be several forest to be traversed on way be for most part haunt of robber band must carriage be found overturned baron daughter missing must be put down a work having baron a well a daughter in power de tulle must find easier than before to compel anne to purchase father freedom a well a own by consenting to term therefore see aid of sword like yours must be valuable doubt servant who be also sturdy fighter will accompany can hardly think that de tulle must venture upon so bold stroke a yet might do so men of kind be not accustomed to be thwarted must be satisfaction to resentment at former failure a well a attainment of wide estate of anne be heiress at moment there be knock at door baron entered dear monsieur kennedy said have succeeded colonel o'brien have be pleased to say that have be so assiduous in learning duty that considers a capable of performing a of subaltern that have just brought so much credit on regiment that be pleased to be able to grant favour asked here be furlough duly signed now only rest with to accept refuse invitation accept most gladly baron will give greatest pleasure to accompany mademoiselle monsieur de la vallee whom now regard a dear friend to home be settled then baron said start early on thursday morning must be well therefore if be to ride over on wednesday evening occupy one of many spare chamber there be in house will do so willingly will ask colonel to allow servant to accompany be already settled told colonel o'brien owed much to also at once acceded to request saying that although wound be healing surgeon said that must be fortnight yet before will be fit for service moreover that be custom when officer went on leave that must if wished take soldier servant with thank again baron mike be faithful fellow shrewd one be so accustomed now to service must miss talk very much have heard mike desmond asked when servant came up to room after baron philip de la vallee have left that be to go with to stay for month at pointdexter have honour sure be sent for to colonel quarter there found tall gentleman whom have never seen before a far a knew 'this be mike callaghan mr kennedy servant ' colonel said baron stepped forward shook hand with for world a if have be noble like said bey brave fellow have to thank for aid gave master in rescuing daughter in service received wound still keep arm in sling here be token that be not ungrateful for service if will take advice will hand to agent of mine here in paris who will keep for may find useful when time come for to take discharge ' so saying put heavy purse into hand said 'you will find agent name address on card inside purse will go round to now tell that be coming that be to use money to advantage to hand over to whenever choose to ask for master be coming down to stay for month with colonel o'brien have granted leave for to accompany ' thanked heartily a may believe sir though a said wanted reward for obeying order for share took in little skirmish after came out looked into purse be mighty heavy expecting to find handful of crown fairly staggered when found that be full of gold piece on counting found that there be hundred louis never did dream must be so rich why honour when lave regiment will not be for many long year hope will be able to settle down comfortably for rest of life in snug little shebeen on bit of land with cottage pig maybe cow two be to honour owe for if have given word must never have entered head to attack gentleman house merely because heard woman scream well be heartily glad mike hope that will take straight to agent not break in upon by treating regiment to drink will honour be given to stow away for time when might want though say that own inclination must not lead to trate few of boy feel that ought to do what gentleman told certainly must mike if once began to spend in way be not one louis five more must disappear in few hour be heartily glad that baron have so handsomely rewarded for service if like will go round with afternoon to agent see money safely deposited thank honour sha' feel easy a long a have got in pouch must suspict everyone who came near must never dare take hand off lest someone else might put in be lucky fellow kennedy o'neil said when desmond told two comrade of arrangement have be made if go on like regiment will believe that good fortune may fall to lot be result of luck really like having leave given to when have be short time in regiment doe not seem fair upon others one will grudge that obeullivan said be not a if be at home then of course everyone must like turn here although be soldier of france be a stranger in land here in paris have many acquaintance welcome at most of reception be end of be seldom indeed that be invited into country house of know sort of hospitality be not fashion in france here noble may throw open house to gentleman by birth who happen to be presented to at home be rigidly exclusive moreover be inclined to think regard irishman a detrimental dangerous many irishman make exceedingly good match be regarded a having way with with girl be likely to interfere with arrangement parent have made for marriage now seems to that baron must be very confiding old gentleman must never take to stay in society of young lady who owes so much to faith seems to that have ball at foot that have only to go in win from what hear mademoiselle pointdexter be older than be be glorious chance for desmond broke into laugh dear obeullivan said seems to that be favourite dream of irish soldier of fortune that may improve circumstance by marriage well there be easier more pleasant way friend said stoutly possibly may come to think so in ten year desmond went on at present have more thought of marrying than have of becoming king of france idea be altogether absurd happens to be particularly so in present case since one of object of going down to pointdexter be may be present at formal betrothal of young lady to monsieur de la vallee neighbour of theirs whom have pleasure of meeting afternoon to whom be tenderly attached by power be unlucky kennedy o'neil said have be thinking that fortune be made that regiment must soon lose a must of course settle down a magnate in languedoc now seems that what thought proper sequence of adventure be not to come off after well lad congratulate on putting good face on hiding disappointment what nonsense talk desmond said laughing be who have be building castle not be disappointment that have fallen to piece chapter ambuscade on morning arranged cavalcade started from versailles baron have instructed stable keeper where carriage horse have be placed to notify vicomte de tulle that held at disposal woman who have be brought to versailles have be dismissed after having made before magistrate deposition stating how mademoiselle de pointdexter have be held close prisoner that with exception of one have entered apartment except that vicomte de tulle have paid visit of five minute duration on morning after be brought there copy of be left in magistrate hand for safekeeping while original be kept by baron who regarded a most important document concerning a did honour of daughter anne have travelled to paris in family coach again with maid took place in baron monsieur de la vallee desmond rode on horseback behind two armed retainer rode in front two others with mike took place behind old servitor sat on front seat by side of coachman think desmond philip de la vallee said a baron fell back to talk for while with daughter that have slightest thought of being attacked by of agent of vicomte have made good many enquiry about fellow in past few day from what have heard be still more convinced that before long be likely to renew attempt to get possession of anne hear that circumstance be well nigh desperate have mortgaged income of estate of course be unable to sell a go with title to heir be pressed by many creditor who now that have lost favour of king will give further grace indeed understand that king who be always liberal who not infrequently make considerable gift to gentleman of court to enable to support necessary expense have already assisted several time that be only by such aid that have be able to hold on a long a have done be in fact desperate man only hope be in making wealthy alliance therefore putting aside pique anger at having failed temptation to again obtain possession of anne be great indeed once married to must even if king kept in banishment well maintain position a country magnate mademoiselle de pointdexter can not come into estate until father death not estate of mother who be also wealthy heiress of will enter into possession on coming of age on marrying so see can afford to disregard enmity of father a well a displeasure of king probably must soon abate after marriage took place if have known when left home what have happened that if be found must be returning home must have brought with dozen stout fellow from own estate a be sent off messenger yesterday with order to majordomo to pick out that number of active fellow from among tenantry to start with least possible delay by route that will follow of have given particular be to ride forward until meet so that when join will be too strong party for force that vicomte be likely to gather to intercept very wise precaution philip will be far upon way before reinforcement can come up will be distance admit messenger will take fully five day in going will take day to gather arm tenant so that will not start until two day afterwards then however will travel at least twice a fast a will hampered a be by carriage must have suggested that anne must ride on pillion behind father did not do so because must have be necessary to explain to reason for suggesting change moreover felt sure that must not agree to have done so baron pointdexter be one of largest landowner in languedoc although one of kindest best of men have full share of family pride must consider that be derogatory to position for daughter to be riding about on pillion like wife daughter of small landed proprietor tenant farmer instead of in carriage a becomes station therefore must accept situation carriage can only hope that villain will not attempt to interfere with before men join fortunately even if courier take vicomte word that baron daughter have made adieu to majesty fellow can not hear of for two day however fast messenger may travel of course tulle be nigh hundred mile nearer paris than pointdexter lie between florac sainte afrique of town lie within circle of estate admit that foreseeing baron be likely to return to estate without delay vicomte may have made preparation be ready to start a soon a get news nevertheless will have ride of eighty mile to strike road on will be travelling may then move north until find suitable place for surprise even allowing for exercising greatest speed must be halfway from paris before can possibly meet men must join by time have forgotten one contingency must entirely alter state of thing what be monsieur de la vallee asked sharply give villain noble credit for resource enterprise what more likely than that have left couple of retainer at versailles with order must messenger be sent off by southern road from baron journey be to be cut short paper letter found upon carried with speed to tulle in case chance of being met by reinforcement be very small peste be right desmond never gave matter thought now that mention nothing be more probable be servant who accompanied whom sent off a de tulle must have be notified of arrival man started from baron house must be deemed certain that be either going to pointdexter own estate that message carried be somewhat urgent one well can do be to hope that fellow have not thought of taking such precaution that messenger will arrive unmolested still acknowledge that idea make anxious fear that will not get through without serious trouble there be so many disbanded soldier other knave in forest de tulle must have difficulty in hiring number of carrying scheme out without assistance knowledge of own tenant heavy taxation necessary to keep up expense of court have driven number of people to despair many hitherto law abiding folk be being forced to leave holding to take to unlawful course however be of use telling baron fear be obstinate when have once made up mind to thing nothing short of royal command must induce to change route to stop at one of town that will pas through wait until band arrives must indeed consider honour greatly attainted by allowing to make change of plan on mere chance that suspicion be justified six day passed without anything occurring impatient a philip de la vallee desmond be to get forward must not hurry slow pace at travelled mademoiselle pointdexter be now suffering from reaction after month of captivity anxiety baron therefore travelled with provoking slowness obtaining a did relay of horse at post must without difficulty have travelled at almost double rate at actually proceeded stoppage be made at town at comfortable accommodation must be obtained indeed in place road be so bad that carriage must not proceed at pace beyond walk without inflicting terrible jolting upon within there be one comfort philip said when have be bewailing slowness of pace men must reach at nevers at latest may take a tolerably certain that attempt to interfere with will take place considerably south of town must guess that must be somewhere between moulins thiers if escort doe not come before reach moulins will begin to think that suggestion be correct that messenger have indeed be intercepted slain desmond must not gainsay truth of friend calculation said possibly philip instead of being attacked by way de tulle agent might rob of letter at one of inn at put up did know content yes told that contained order for majordomo to ride with troop of twelve men to meet that be to give what aid must in getting together a quickly a possible so that even if robbed of letter might still be able to fulfil mission not own thought of at time for idea that might be stopped never once entered mind at nevers desmond went round to inn in town to enquire if body of men have put up at place without success when related failure to obtain news to philip latter said well must hope that will meet before arrive at moulins if not will no longer have hope that messenger got through safely then will have to consider whether will not be necessary to inform baron of fear to get to change route make detour cross loire at bourbon make for maison then journey down on other bank of saone a far a pont saint esprit thence over mountain to florac must certainly be safest plan always providing that have not be watched ever since left paris vicomte might well take precaution in case must deviate from regular route sapriste desmond be always full of evil prognostication still a usual can not allow there be reason in see philip have plenty of time a travel at snail pace in evening when stop to think over affair in light always put in position of vicomte de tulle consider what step must take to ensure success in next attempt to carry off mademoiselle de pointdexter then be very glad that be not in position of de tulle for if be must consider that be lost that there be not chink crevice by must escape be monstrous that nobleman can not travel from paris to estate without being obliged to take a many precaution a general of army must have to do against attack of active formidable enemy will tell baron philip hardly know what to do in respect for after have solid foundation for uneasiness beyond fact that men sent for have not met apprehension be due solely to fact that fellow be utterly unscrupulous that whole future depends on carrying out insolent design successfully if have solid fact to work on must urge baron to change route fear that must not only scoff at view that there may be danger might be angry at taking step of sending for party of retainer without being in way consulted in matter at rate feel sure that must refuse to change route without very much stronger reason than can give then must let matter go on a be philip may be that really have be alarming without sufficient cause if worst come to worst can make good fight for be certainly hard on have performed one brave action for at risk of life now be thrust into danger perhaps even greater than first in quarrel in have concern desmond laughed do not see philip that adventure be good training for soldier that if be on duty in command of company will be more useful officer for having served sort of apprenticeship in surprise ambuscade alarm journey have be vastly more interesting than must have be under other circumstance must have found dull without such matter of interest a affair have given even must nothing come of will have served purpose by beguiling journey in truth riding at so slow pace must otherwise scarce have be amusing well then seems that only thing that can do be to see that servant keep pistol charged be prepared to do duty in case of sudden attack of course at present have idea that special danger threatens will tell before start in morning that fear road be dangerous owing to band of robber reported to be in forest that must hold in readiness for action in case fall in with of old eustace coachman have got arquebus will tell must be attacked be to fire at once then coachman be to whip up horse drive at full speed while endeavour to keep off assailant must be of use if assailant must be for most part on foot think more likely that will be mounted however fast lumbering carriage might go must easily keep up with fight a hard a may carriage must be overtaken if be in sufficient force to overpower must think that must be well that must warn mademoiselle de pointdexter that hear road be not very safe that if there be trouble be on account to attempt to leave carriage a long a remains there will run little risk for may be sure that de tulle will have issued strictest order pistol be to be fired in direction have also little doubt that have ordered baron life to be respected because death must greatly add to anger must be excited by attack must also put barrier between mademoiselle who must naturally regard with even more hostility than before a author of father death therefore trust that in case life hers will not be endangered however numerous assailant might be yes have doubt that be so desmond though be sure be wounded on point of death must rather know that anne have fallen by chance shot than be in power of villain next morning started very early for moulins for journey must be longer one than usual road through forest must probably be so rough that pace must necessarily be very slow at two o'clock men riding ahead noticed that tree have fallen across road one of galloped back informed baron of be strange latter said there have be storm for past two day must have fallen quite recently for otherwise news must have be taken to nearest commune whose duty must be to see at once to removal philip de la vallee have a servant be speaking glanced at desmond to seemed that obstacle must scarcely be result of accident will see how large tree be baron said be size be hard if eight men four horse can not drag off road so saying cantered forward followed by retainer whose comrade also fell in a passed look to arquebus philip said to two men on box at same time called up mike two men from behind tree have fallen across road said to be possible that may be ambush that may be attacked so hold yourselves in readiness look to pistol see that priming be right in pan then went to door of carriage be just possible that be going to have trouble anne philip said remember what told last night on account move from seat may take place a spoke there be discharge of firearm in front at same moment score of horseman broke from tree rode down upon carriage leader be masked a came up coachman eustace discharged arquebus emptying two saddle then drawing sword leapt to ground in meantime philip desmond three men dashed at assailant philip made for leader who doubted not be vicomte de tulle latter drew pistol fired when be within horse length of young man swayed in saddle fell heavily to ground while piercing cry from carriage rose in air desmond after cutting down first man encountered turned horse attacked masked figure who met with fury showed be animated by personal animosity skill in fencing however gave slight advantage in such encounter while desmond exercise with sabre in regimental salle d'armes be now most useful to enraged at fall of friend seeing that there be moment to spare for already of other assailant be coming to assistance of chief showered blow with such vehemence fury that opponent have enough to do to guard head without striking blow in return seeing in moment that must be surrounded desmond made last effort vicomte weapon shivered at stroke somewhat diverted direction of blow instead of striking full on head sword shore down cheek inflicting ghastly wound carrying away ear a well a cheek from eye to chin then wheeling horse dashed at two men who be riding at attack be so sudden that one of horse swerved desmond touching charger flank with spur rode at hurled horse rider to ground backhanded blow struck other opponent full in throat then dashed into wood shouting to mike to follow two servitor have fallen greater part of assailant be gathered round carriage mike be engaged in single combat with one of horseman have just run opponent through when desmond shouted to so turning galloped after master be not pursued fall of leader have for moment paralysed band while three four of remained by carriage whose last defender have fallen others dismounting ran to where vicomte be lying have be tough business honour mike said a joined master be right be sir when told that be afraid that rascal must try hinder on way sure have be bad business altogether monsieur philip be killed baron too suppose others miss anne have fallen into hand of villain again think that baron have be hurt mike expect order be only to take prisoner where be going honour mike asked for be still galloping at full speed be going to get into road again try to find help at moulins to recover young lady there be one thing be not likely to be molested by fellow for little time then did not kill honour cut through guard turned sword laid face open will be time before will be fit to show to lady if a expect can get help at moulins will ride on to monsieur de la vallee place men there try to cut party off before get to tulle if be too late will see what can do to rescue from la vallee will go to pointdexter have doubt that can get together force there large enough to besiege de tulle castle after hour ride arrived at moulins desmond rode at once to mairie being in uniform be received with respect by mayor who however on hearing story said that did not see how must interfere in matter seemed to be private quarrel between two noble even if be ready to interpose have force available at same time must send out four men with cart to bring in might find with life in very well sir desmond said indignantly know duty suppose know mine will certainly report to king refusal to give assistance to punish ill doer so saying left room at once rode to stable leaving horse mike there hired others then continued journey south at full speed before evening rode into roanne knew that be useless endeavouring to stir up authority here a must naturally say that be business of mayor at nevers moulins since attack have taken place between town ordering fresh horse to be got ready said to mike do go to inn on left of main street will go to on right enquire if troop of mounted men have come in be afraid there be chance of be at least worth trial at first four five place visited answer be that such party have arrived then seeing one of civic guard asked if have seen heard of troop of men passing through town such troop arrived hour ago monsieur l'officier stopped a passed asked if monsieur le baron pointdexter accompanied by carriage servant have passed through town put up at soleil must think that be there now for have evidently made long journey horse be too worn out to go farther delighted at unexpected news desmond hurried to inn be second class establishment evidently frequented by market people a there be large stable attached to landlord be standing at door bowed profoundly for be seldom that guest of quality visited inn what can do for monsieur enquired have party of traveller who arrived hour ago have business with will find in room monsieur landlord said opening door there be twelve men inside remains of repast be on table of men be still sitting there others be already asleep on bench one who be evidently leader be walking up down room impatiently looked up in surprise when desmond entered be intendant of monsieur de la vallee be not be sir man said still more surprised be friend of master have be expecting to meet for past four five day be travelling south with baron de pointdexter daughter be attacked afternoon on other side of moulins baron daughter be believe carried off servant killed saw master fall whether mortally wounded not can not say servant cut way through assailant who be led by vicomte de tulle who have before carried off mademoiselle de pointdexter be on way south to la vallee with faint hope of meeting on road be bad news indeed sir intendant said trust that master be not killed for loved a to mademoiselle pointdexter be understood thing that one day must be mistress be not fault that be so late master messenger be attacked near nevers be left for dead on road letter bore purse be taken from night air caused wound to stop bleeding managed to crawl to moulins having money be unable to hire horse indeed must not have sat one went to inn frequented by market people there succeeded in convincing honest peasant who have come in with cart of faggot that story be true one promised large pay on arrival at la vallee pace be a may imagine slow one two day ago arrived home told story have alarm bell at castle rung at once in hour tenant came in chose twelve started hour later fortunately master have told messenger be purport of letter have ridden night day since be at service monsieur in first place let men have sleep be eight o'clock now will give seven hour at three in morning will mount there be not bed enough here if get clean straw scattered down in one of shed men can lie there in meantime will go round hire fresh horse leaving own in pledge for safe return have better pick out two of men to ride on to moulins mayor there promised to send out cart to fetch in wounded who might be found at scene of conflict if on arrival find that monsieur de la vallee be not among must ride on till get there be three league from town bring in body together with of servant must arrange to give christian burial there master body will of course take on to la vallee last wish of course must be that mademoiselle de pointdexter must be rescued from power of villain noble who have carried off starting in morning so early will have difficulty in cutting off long before arrives at tulle will probably cross alier at ferry at saint pierre le moutier must look at map see road that be likely to follow be probable that will make by country track till strike main road from moulins well must think sir that must cross near aubusson then pas over mountain by road through felletin come down upon meimac when will be only two league from castle near correze there be good road from here to aubusson might take post on road between town felletin at least sir can avenge murder of dear master though have arrived too late to save can rescue mademoiselle de pointdexter father men who have roused listened to conversation with many ejaculation of fury regret now exclaimed that be ready to ride on at once there be occasion for friend desmond said coach with mademoiselle can travel slowly especially along country road perhaps vicomte may take on saddle behind intendant suggested that will not do desmond said in fight wounded so sorely that will think have to be carried in litter will be in condition for fast long travelling so that certainly be not at present time many league from spot where attacked can not reach aubusson until day after tomorrow might cut off before arrive there know what road may follow might miss whereas from what say there can be doubt that must pas through felletin think that must be sure to come way sir for if followed road on to limoges question might

business a to rest of dare not even think of will die easier for knowing that have escaped escaped for good purpose philip have good news for monsieur le baron mademoiselle be on way to pointdexter under guard of men be possible desmond be only saying to rouse not at philip suppose that even for purpose must hold out false hope to tell untruth on matter so vital to happiness philip eye closed lip moved desmond knew that be returning thanks to god for unlooked for news how did happen philip said after silence of minute voice be much stronger than before there be faint touch of colour in cheek surgeon nodded approvingly to desmond murmured think that will live be too long story to tell in full now desmond said seeing that be lost that be down that further resistance be absolutely fruitless mike cut way out more easily since have struck down leader de tulle most of band have crowded round at roanne found men who have just arrived there matter not now why have be detained got fresh horse for rode for correze placed ambush turned table upon mike vicomte easily defeated follower rescued baron daughter sent to pointdexter under charge of intendant follower rode hither hoping against hope might find still alive two men who came on here must have told that have escaped did not allow to speak to monsieur surgeon said even to see be below greatly grieved at being refused

morning to have objection surgeon said colleague have one other be with since be brought in will be glad of rest desmond returned to soleil where have left mike latter who have just finished supper be delighted to hear that de la vallee be likely to recover after satisfying own hunger desmond returned to couronne went upstairs taking off riding boot stole to door of friend chamber stood little ajar pushing open noiselessly entered surgeon who be sitting at bedside rose at once be asleep already whispered be breathing quietly think likely that will not stir until tomorrow morning will be here at six if wake there be change send for at once after have left room desmond took place on fauteuil by bedside for time thought over singular chain of adventure that have gone through gradually in spite of effort eyelid drooped de la vallee have not moved being dead tired by exertion of past four day fell into deep sleep from did not awake until daylight streamed into room shocked at having thus given way looked anxiously at de la vallee be relieved to find that be lying exactly in same position have evidently slept without once waking hour later philip opened eye looked wonderingly at then said so be not good dream desmond be really here news be true certainly be true philip by time mademoiselle de pointdexter father be far on way home be to have travelled on to argentan then through aurillac striking lozere at entraigues proceeding along bank to mende thence by road over hill to villefort where must be twenty mile from pointdexter carriage be to be left behind at first halting place mademoiselle be then to ride maid to be carried behind one of men by mean must travel more than twice a fast a must do if encumbered by carriage baron said that must spare pain to get home a quickly a possible must send man on hour ahead of to see that fresh horse be in readiness for whole party at town came to now tell about desmond feel man good news long night sleep have done wonder for now please tell about affair seeing that philip be so much stronger that must hear without being overexcited story of rescue desmond related detail to have indeed done wonder philip said seem to know what fatigue be how strange that whose name have never heard until ten day back must have rendered to baron pointdexter two such inestimable service so after exertion fatigue have be keeping watch at bedside night be ashamed to say have not be keeping watch philip desmond replied with smile have intended to be sleeping so quietly everything be so still that went off slept a soundly a have done until within hour of time when opened eye be sure must have awoke at once have moved then be glad did not move desmond for must sorely need long sleep after having passed three day almost three night in saddle surgeon now arrived be delighted at change have taken place in patient when will be fit to travel doctor ah well will talk of in fortnight time need absolute quiet for be to move before wound be fairly healed inflammation might set in must throw back for very long time have have very narrow escape be fortunate indeed to have got off with only trifling detention might be carried in horse litter certainly not at present surgeon said decidedly possibly in ten day might without danger be so carried providing take in short stage with easy paced horse must say that must be still better be to be carried on men shoulder there be never difficulty in hiring men must get relay eight ten mile while must be difficult to get horse accustomed to such work think must be able to ride doctor certainly not in le than month probably not in six week then must be carried philip said must work into fever talk of if be to be kept here what be plan desmond have not thought of yet at rate will stay with till be well enough to start must not think of desmond have say in matter philip in first place will get on faster for being with in next place ten day of leave be already expired be to go on straight to pointdexter must only have few day there before starting back for paris must therefore postpone visit to future time can stay here ten day accompany four day on journey then turn back again nice way of spending month holiday philip grumbled will be holiday that will long look back to desmond said quietly with pleasure say must not have enjoyed at baron chateau for must have done adventure have gone through will remain in mind life a having gained friendship of baron daughter friendship seems to too mild word for desmond have earned gratitude so deep that will be pain to if can not show in deed now philip desmond said changing subject abruptly suppose that will be at once sending off one of men with news that be in fair way towards recovery mademoiselle de pointdexter be suffering at thought that be probably killed did best to give hope without much success two retainer have be fretting greatly that be not allowed to see think now can be brought up can choose one of to act a messenger will of course ride post can arrive at pointdexter very soon after baron if indeed doe not get there first if start at once change horse at place may be there by tomorrow at noon if not earlier for be not more believe than hundred twenty mile to pointdexter if will dictate letter for to take will write for must be short one surgeon said just few word monsieur de la vallee have talked more than be good for hour later messenger started carrying note with few word from philip to anne longer letter from desmond to baron four day later answer be received messenger have arrived at pointdexter two hour before traveller reached home anne joy at news that not only be philip alive might in short time be with be deep indeed baron wrote to desmond a well a to philip again expressing deep gratitude of daughter greatly regretting that must not have opportunity at present of thanking personally with letter messenger brought bag of money concerning wrote have know dear monsieur kennedy expended considerable sum of money in hiring relay of horse for monsieur de la vallee men of course be debt can not object to repaying without knowing exact sum have roughly calculated probable amount forward to by messenger who will bring letter desmond have hesitation in accepting money baron have evidently taken considerable pain to calculate sum that must have laid out in order not to hurt feeling by sending larger sum than have spent for amount contained in bag be few louis over disbursement at once rode over to roanne redeemed ring have proved of more value to than have ever anticipated at end of ten day philip be strong enough to walk across room surgeon gave permission for to start if instead of being carried way must be taken to lyon be twenty mile distant there take boat down rhone to viviers desmond went with to lyon saw comfortably bestowed on board craft going down river there left in charge of own retainer then accompanied by mike whose wound be now well healed rode back to paris by comparatively easy stage arriving there on day before leave be up reported to colonel so have not be to pointdexter after received long letter week ago from baron sent by special messenger giving full account of doings read like chapter of romance mentioned that have also written to king denouncing conduct of vicomte de tulle stating that in fight between own rescuer vicomte band latter be killed doing full justice to part played in affair have message from majesty yesterday ordering that must a soon a returned go at once to versailles in order that might question further on affair have piece of news for have received order to march in three day time be fortunate circumstance for for there can be doubt that however gallantly well have behaved in affair in light majesty may view have incurred enmity of de tulle family connection air of paris must not be healthy for for time need not say have read baron letter to comrade that fully shared with admiration feel at conduct have better start at once for versailles sir think so king be not pleased at being kept waiting be sure to ask when arrived have better take one of horse will order to be brought round will be at quarter by time have put on full uniform king have just returned from hunting when desmond arrived at palace gave name to one of usher five minute later be conducted to king dressing room be serious business young sir in have be engaged king said shortly to desmond a entered be aware of sire yet be well assured that officer in majesty service must have acted a did under similar circumstance baron de pointdexter have written to fully on matter king said wish to hear account from own lip when did return to paris two hour since sire then have lost time in presenting here now tell whole matter omitting detail desmond told story fully be interrupted once by king how be that monsieur de la vallee people be at roanne desmond then related fear that philip have entertained lest vicomte must make attempt to carry off mademoiselle pointdexter how without baron knowledge philip have sent off messenger to intendant for body of men to meet on way how messenger have be intercepted desperately wounded how in consequence instead of being met by party at nevers north of town have only reached roanne after attack have be made on traveller near moulins king asked more question until desmond finished story did well sir then said conduct of vicomte de tulle be outrageous must have visited with heaviest displeasure have not already received desert be intolerable that noble gentleman with daughter can not travel along highroad of kingdom without being thus assaulted be more scandalous when vicomte be banished from court for similar attempt fact that have enjoyed favour must in degree have mitigated indeed must have increased anger at conduct since must have seemed a if have relied upon for immunity for action surely such belief must have be erroneous one law must be observed higher placed man be more be bound to set example of obedience to thank sir for having thwarted so daring villainous scheme have not yet sent answer to baron de pointdexter because wished report of matter before doing so will now cause to be informed of indignation at plot against person that of daughter satisfaction that have escaped from have begun career well indeed young sir regiment be about to start for frontier will direct colonel to report to from time to time a to conduct will see that promotion be in accordance with action will request to offer opportunity may occur for distinguishing desmond rode back to paris well satisfied with result of interview have not be slow in noticing that although king approval of action have be warmly expressed in word there be certain coldness in tone in be spoken showed that although king sense of justice constrained to praise be at heart sore at death of one who have be favoured companion in sport amusement on return found two friend waiting for at quarter gave hearty greeting be perfect paladin kennedy o'neil said though be proud of can not help feeling little envious that such adventure have fallen to lot of junior ensign be evident that if be not born with silver spoon in mouth fortune determined to make up in other way by giving such chance a fall to lot of anyone else yes think have right to consider exceptionally fortunate may have be fortunate kennedy obeullivan remarked thing be that took advantage of opportunity threw into first adventure came way rescued lovely damsel in distress gratitude that of father attracted king notice gained that ring on finger in next place after escaping from ruffian who attacked coach principally a seems by cutting down leader so occupying attention of follower instantly took resolution to attempt to rescue daughter succeeded in doing so man might have stopped at moulins congratulating that have escaped from trap lamenting that must hing towards again rescuing damsel from abductor of course be piece of good fortune meeting de la vallee men at roanne have doubt that if have not done so must still have got to pointdexter gathered force intercepted vicomte party must have be very near thing obeullivan changing horse at post might have got to pointdexter from roanne in twenty four hour doubt whether even allowing that time be lost in getting men together must have got to tulle before have one hundred fifty mile to travel must have have still farther a must have have three day start must have be there before for heard from baron that in addition to four horse in coach have four others ridden by trooper fastened to where road be bad what must have done if have got to vicomte chateau be strong place before must intercept can not say what must have done thought matter over over again a rode seemed absurd to think of attacking chateau with only twelve men besides must have be very serious business to assault noble in own castle there must almost certainly be twenty thirty men there at least ringing of alarm bell must have brought vassal within five mile round to aid at once have doubt must have attempted something in what way must form idea until saw place two young men laughed believe that must have succeeded somehow kennedy o'neil said after what have done have almost unlimited faith in if told must see other plan than carrying off gracious majesty taking down to tulle forcing to order rascal vicomte to deliver up captive must accomplish desmond laughed plan might be a good a though own that have not occurred to must certainly necessitate having held prisoner until have got safely out of france otherwise fate must assuredly be to be broken on wheel yes think gracious majesty must have forgiven indignity even if put upon for good purpose be almost treason even to dream of such thing desmond laughed be purely imaginary case see not having be accustomed a be to country where king be regarded almost a god be afraid have not that awe of be generally entertained here have naturally great respect for king whom serve whose pay be matter of greatest importance to after although in service be not lawful king then must not even imagine thing a to take lawful king james prisoner however much fate of someone in whom be interested be concerned desmond did not answer at once know said at last what must do in case for king james a lawful king of country have deepest respect must freely venture life in service for a man irrespective of crown own admiration be not extreme must not hesitate to join in plan for putting pressure upon on behalf of anyone in whom be extremely interested a certainly be now in mademoiselle de pointdexter monsieur de la vallee be curious fellow kennedy o'neil said with smile must be very much puzzled if be called upon to predict what fate be likely to be seems to that have equal chance of becoming french marshal being broken on wheel here be not yet seventeen have a doubt not somewhat interfered with king plan caused loss of one of personal friend have twice rescued noble lady from hand of abductor have brought disgrace death upon member of one of most powerful family in france have earned gratitude friendship of one of leading noble of southern france that of fiance of daughter of daughter a soon a affair spread abroad will be object of general remark attention have rendered regiment to belong proud of junior ensign made paris emphatically too hot to hold if be done before be seventeen what may expect when ten year have passed over head have better wait for ten year to pas o'neil desmond laughed by time perhaps obeullivan will have learned wisdom will see that because man happens to have gone through very exciting adventure without discredit by mean prof to be anything in smallest degree out of way chapter to scotland two day later regiment be paraded order have be received for start destination be still uncertain officer stood in group awaiting arrival of colonel who entered accompanied by colonel wauchop several other irish officer a there have be notice of official inspection there be general feeling of surprise at appearance of visitor colonel rode up to group of officer gentleman said must ask to accompany to common room have news of importance to give with dismounted followed by wondering officer of regiment went into large room where gathered in evening news that be about to give be of important happy nature most gracious majesty have decided to send expedition to scotland where whole country be ready to rise in favour of lawful king cheer broke from hearer many scottish irish gentleman colonel went on have be selected to accompany among be friend colonel wauchop officer with expedition will consist of six thousand french troop regret to say that irish regiment will accompany groan of disappointment followed announcement must hope colonel said that irish troop be not employed only because be intended that expedition will sail to ireland in case may be sure that of will have opportunity of fighting again on own side of water moreover between france scotland there have long be close connection friendship employment of french troop must therefore better suit scot than must be case with irishman reason perhaps be king of france doe not like to spare best troop when have sore need of in flanders spain however number of irish officer will accompany expedition for purpose of drilling commanding new levy for work will be far better suited by knowledge of english than french officer must be therefore various irish regiment be to furnish certain number of lieutenant general hamilton sheldon dorrington lord galmoy fitzgerald friend colonel wauchop will be in command of newly raised force having with many scotch officer now in service of france secret of expedition have be well kept have known for fortnight have prepared list of fifteen officer who be to go may say that in order to avoid partiality have with one exception selected by lot who be to go will doubtless consider fortunate who be to stay be still more lucky if a hope regiment will form part of similar expedition sent to ireland then read out list of officer chosen obeullivan o'neil be among name of desmond kennedy be last read out will gentleman start in hour time taking northern road through montvidier arras in of town will be joined by officer from other regiment colonel wauchop will accompany name port from be to sail word must be said by a to route be to travel can doubt judge for yourselves by road that be taking what port be destination french troop will be already there fleet be in readiness have horse can take soldier servant with who do so must either hire purchase horse for further detail will learn from colonel wauchop paymaster will have order to issue two month pay to of in advance distance will be about hundred fifty mile will perform in five day colonel wauchop then addressed few word to officer of whom be under rank of captain gentleman said have honourable task before for year have be waiting for day when sword might aid to place king upon throne at last have come need not say that struggle will be severe one that courage will be taxed to utmost have proved that in score of desperate fight task before will need tact to ordinary degree scotch be a peppery race a irish be will be necessary in way to hurt feeling to excite among smallest degree of discontent at being drilled led by men who be not of own race now a have much to do before starting will leave to make arrangement rendezvous for be in barrack yard at nine o'clock will be here colonel now left room officer eagerly excitedly talked over startling news that have just heard greater part of who have be selected for service be delighted to go while others be equally pleased at thought that might shortly be fighting for king james on soil of ireland sure honour wish have be in ould country instead of scotland mike said when heard news can not say that agree with mike in ireland must find ten of thousand of brave heart ready to join be unarmed undrilled undisciplined must be of comparatively slight assistance to against english troop defeat must bring down fresh persecution fresh confiscation greater misery upon land sure must beat honour might mike must remember that failed to do so even when people be armed no doubt will take certain amount of musket ammunition with power of england be more assuredly fixed in ireland now than be then influence of old irish family be broken even if armed who joined must be armed rabble not army in scotland be altogether different scottish clan must join under chief to whom give absolute obedience must turn out armed ready for action thus then think that allowing ireland be a loyal a scotland choice have be wise one sure know best honour will warrant that a soon a scotland rise ireland will be in blaze from one end to other may well be mike there will then be chance of success since english force will be fully occupied by descent in north will threaten london while ireland can be left to until main question be settled be mighty lucky honour must have stuck to horse got when rescued miss pointdexter be very glad too mike for otherwise must have have to buy one be likely enough may want money have before campaign that be starting upon be over o'neil obeullivan at moment burst into room be glorious that three must be going kennedy latter exclaimed be just luck for be only ensign named while regiment will be left with only four lieutenant of course must be still better pleased if be going to ireland still for anything know expedition may not come off so that be fighting for king be one whether be in scotland at home having seen that be ready for departure desmond went to colonel quarter to say goodbye several of officer who be going be already there colonel motioned to to stay until have left when have done so said perhaps guessed kennedy that be one exception mentioned to rule adopted of fixing by lot upon who be to go indeed sir desmond said in surprise thought extraordinary piece of good fortune must be only ensign to go when there be so many others senior to indeed thought for moment of saying must resign in favour of one who be older more experienced than then struck that if did of junior lieutenant might feel obliged to do same in favour of senior must not in case have permitted change to be made have decided that in order to avoid jealousy chance must decide matter indeed be only ensign going with expedition informed colonel wauchop general hamilton of reason for specially included so long a be supposed that regiment be on point of marching to spain considered that if took advice did not leave barrack after harm must befall case be altered now that may remain here for time for doubt will take part in expedition sent to ireland have heard within past forty eight hour that friend of de tulle have made very strong representation to king have urged that proceeding involving what call murder of kinsman be of nature of civil war that if conduct have be reprehensible be for baron de pointdexter to lay matter before majesty ask for redress hear however king received remonstrance coldly told that de tulle have brought fate upon that be duty of gentleman to endeavour to rescue lady so feloniously carried off that approved of readiness energy with have taken step to do so on finding then that have failed in hope of having sent to one of royal prison from must probably never have come out alive have doubt that people will endeavour to take matter into own hand that with mean at disposal will find difficulty in procuring person who must undertake to assassinate a have said if have at once started for army might have looked after safety until crossed frontier here in paris must not be safe for hour must scarce venture between barrack lodging unless under strong guard under such circumstance consider be justified in placing on list of officer who must accompany expedition explained to general hamilton colonel wauchop who happened to be with reason for wishing to include so young officer in rank of selected for service officer heartily agreed with having of course heard story at rate main fact of rescue of mademoiselle de pointdexter be indeed greatly obliged to colonel know that be dangerous thing to incur enmity of one of powerful family though must certainly have taken precaution in power felt must be in constant danger until fairly embarked upon campaign at nine o'clock party started numbered fifty officer scotch irish baggage have started hour before be to join cart with baggage of other officer outside northern gate be under escort of dragoon whose officer have power given to requisition fresh horse at town through passed so to push on to port with two halt once off there be longer necessity for keeping destination secret officer be informed that a have already guessed dunkirk be harbour from be to sail journey be pleasant one be in highest spirit short distance behind marched body of infantry composed entirely of noncommissioned officer of whom o'brien regiment furnished thirty be picked men marching day a far a party of officer rode arrived at dunkirk on fifth day after starting be at once embarked on ship of war colonel wauchop officer of o'brien regiment be told off to salisbury be ship have be taken from english be now loaded with military store arm munition for use of who be expected to join on landing after seeing that officer be properly accommodated colonel went ashore when returned be at once seen by expression of face that something be wrong have very bad news said king james who arrived here two day ago have be taken suddenly ill until be partially recovered can not sail for be absolutely necessary that must be with may mean delay of week ten day may defeat arrangement english government have spy here a well a elsewhere fleet have for last week be hovering off coast may not have known purpose of assembly of troop here for have be kept strictly secret few even of french officer of expedition knew until arrived here for what reason regiment have be ordered to dunkirk arrival of king james of course showed what be intention a soon a news reach london may be sure that english fleet will be sent to intercept be indeed ten day before james be sufficiently recovered to be embarked delay probably cost kingdom for there can be doubt that on landing must have be joined at once by great clan by small proportion of able bodied men of country consequence be so evident to engaged in expedition that despondency took place of enthusiasm with have embarked fact that expedition after being so carefully secretly prepared must at outset meet with so serious misfortune be considered omen of evil at last however james embarked under salute by gun of ship of war a sail be hoisted anchor weighed spirit of again rose have sailed few mile when became evident that salisbury be slowest ship in fleet for although have stitch of canvas set lagged behind rest other vessel be obliged to lower of sail in order to allow to keep up with begin to think kennedy o'neil said that good fortune have hitherto attended have spent obeullivan regarded a good omen that must be one ensign selected to go with miserable delay at dunkirk fact that be on board slowest tub in fleet seems to show that dame fortune be longer going to exercise in favour look like indeed desmond agreed still ca hold responsible for king illness for being allotted to heavy sailing craft perhaps even if fortune must not favour longer will do something for of others have always be favourable to colonel wauchop have be through innumerable engagement though many time wounded have never be seriously so though score of other officer have fallen in enterprise in have taken part in case fortune have not be fickle a be chief officer on board must hope that have not deserted on occasion think there be certain amount of luck in fact that carry large amount of gun ammunition if have not be case be likely that rather than delay squadron must sail on at full speed have left to follow a best might constant watch be maintained at masthead of ship sign be seen of english fleet until on rd of march six day after sailing reached mouth of firth of forth be congratulating that have brought voyage to successful termination at daybreak next morning however just a be about to enter estuary beheld mast of great fleet coming out to meet be squadron of sir george byng have for day be on coast having be despatched a soon a news reached london of gathering of ship troop at dunkirk of arrival of pretender there french admiral at once signalled to ship to put about lay off until english fleet be near enough to discern composition be far superior in force to own seeing impossibility of landing troop store slight chance of success in giving battle hoisted signal for to make way back to dunkirk keeping a much a possible together in order to defend if overtaken if intercepted by hostile fleet in vain james begged that few boat might be given with to land with chief follower french admiral replied that instruction must not justify in doing so that have be ordered to specially protect person of young king whose safety be of highest concern to sovereign be with deepest feeling of disappointment depression that scotch irish officer heard that be determined to sail for dunkirk again have troop on board ship be of own nationality must have ordered to disobey admiral command to insist upon fleet if succeeded in evading pursuit of enemy making effort to effect landing a however soldier be french with exception of two three hundred noncommissioned irish officer be powerless be half mad with rage grief look bad for obeullivan said gravely to two friend think that french ship will outsail english there be little chance that unwieldy craft will do so in case friend be likely that will see inside of english prison probably not few of will be executed colonel must be safe for came over with brigade after limerick therefore by treaty be allowed to enter service of france be different with rest of have joined since day be therefore not covered by treaty so be liable to be tried a traitor o'neil shrugged shoulder well knew that when joined said however hardly think be likely to proceed to extremity very many of brigade have be taken prisoner at blenheim other place have always have same treatment a other prisoner of war may be obeullivan replied be different matter be not question of war on foreign soil be going to attack throne of anne to promote civil war to overthrow government attempt once made can be made again may be sure that news of sailing have created tremendous scare throughout country however be in for there be use grumbling against fate already see rest of fleet be leaving faster think than english fleet be gaining on trust will get safely away into dunkirk fact that so nearly succeeded will perhaps act a inducement to louis to renew expedition loss of colonel fifteen lieutenant thirty noncommissioned officer will not seriously affect anyone except however desmond put in think that after thing may not be a bad a think in first place execution must have extremely bad effect in scotland ireland must add to general hostility to present government in next place louis have many english prisoner in hand might threaten reprisal lastly there be always chance of escape first two argument be good kennedy o'neil said can not say a much for last chance of escape from english prison must be small indeed nevertheless there must always be chance desmond said if will take advice will at once go below conceal money where be going to conceal obeullivan said may be sure that will be searched well took advice in changing silver in be paid into gold though lost pretty heavily by transaction did to prevent lugging about heavy bag of silver now have advantage must not hope to conceal silver may at least hide few piece of gold mike be handy fellow have doubt will be able to help at rate let go below see what can be done mike be summoned to cabin now mike desmond said suppose in campaign good many of carry what money may have about dare say of hide so that if be taken prisoner may have mean of adding to prison fare do honour by same token have score of crown in between sol of boot doe not always succeed for if boot happen to be good chance be that someone take fancy to still on whole be best place there be for be sure to feel lining of clothes well want to hide gold mike in hour will have english within shot of of course fighting be out of question do think that will have time to hide dozen gold piece in of boot mike looked doubtful to do thing properly honour one must take off lower sole take leather out of upper one put money in then sew up again must take more than hour to do one pair thought for moment quickest way must be to get out inside lining of sole then to cut out enough leather for money to lie in then to put in lining again must not be soft walking on twenty mile march think if get lining in tight with few little nail to keep from dropping out if anyone take trouble to turn boot upside down might manage well let commence at once then mike have got riding boot can put on before be taken prisoner do take lining out a say then will help to cut out of leather of upper sole be quickly at work mike cut out enough of thin lining to admit of hole being made large enough to hold ten louis in boot two officer then set to work to cut out sufficient depth of leather for coin to lie side by side hour sufficed for coin be put in mike have in meantime obtained handful of pitch melted at galley fire ran in over gold then replaced piece of lining with hot pitch there honour said when have finished call that neat job must be hard indeed if spalpeens find that there be anything amiss with heavy boot extra weight wo betray that there be anything hidden put on till last moment give time to cool for if of ooze out will stick stocking so tight to that wo get foot out without laving behind leaving high boot in cabin three young men went on deck leading vessel of british fleet be not more than mile astern while french fleet be three mile ahead having gained more than mile since chase began mike have be given four louis said must hide in mouth five minute later there be puff of smoke from pursuer bow ball struck water close to will hold on colonel captain of ship asked colonel wauchop there be use in doing so that ship will be alongside in hour might only cause useless loss of life be to keep on if be alone must say let come alongside with crew officer men might if have luck take by boarding with whole fleet close behind must be madness to think of thing a have twelve gun of small weight accordingly topsail be run down course brailed up ship lay motionless till english frigate came up signal have be exchanged between english vessel a came along six of dropped boat with twenty men in while rowed towards prize fleet pressed on under canvas in pursuit of french squadron english officer in command of boat received sword of french officer noncommissioned officer be sent below into hold sail be at once got on to vessel again followed in wake of fleet english lieutenant then took name of prisoner be irish said seriously be sorry gentleman that must be so for fear that will go harder with than if be french when of course must be merely prisoner of war must be prisoner of war now colonel wauchop said be in service of king of france be obeying order along with french comrade hope may see in light in officer said courteously doubt whether at present moment will take calm view of subject however hope will do so especially a shot have be fired by can not charge with resisting capture at rate gentleman will do best to make comfortable while be under charge must ask few of to shift quarter so a to make room for three officer with beyond will continue a before to use ship a passenger when darkness set in pursuit be discontinued french fleet be fully ten mile ahead be evident that there be chance whatever of overtaking while there be risk of doubling back during night again making way north greater part of sail of men of war be therefore furled while frigate corvette made off on hand to establish a sentry during night to give warning must french fleet be seen returning hour half after pursuit have ceased salisbury joined fleet officer in command went on board admiral ship to report number of prisoner taken nature of cargo officer have at invitation dined with officer in cabin political topic have be avoided one who have looked in must have supposed that majority of present be prisoner of others irish temperament quickly shake off feeling of depression meal be a lively a have be during voyage north lieutenant however omitted precaution dozen men kept guard over prisoner below a many more with loaded musket be always stationed on deck irish officer saw that among many of sailor there be strong feeling of sympathy with fleet have be largely recruited by impressment by handing over to naval authority of number of men imprisoned for comparatively slight offence a be natural have small feeling of kindness towards government who have so seized while many shared in feeling of loyalty towards house of stuart be still so prevalent among population at daybreak cruiser returned none have seen sign of french squadron sir george byng leaving majority of fleet to maintain watch sailed with prize for harwich here prisoner be handed over to military authority while admiral started for london in post chaise to carry news of failure of french to effect landing of return to dunkirk news be received with exuberant delight by supporter of government commercial portion of population who have be threatened by ruin run upon bank have be unprecedented although house of common have relaxed regulation of bank of england panic be so great that must not have kept door open twelve hour treatment of prisoner be now very different from what have be on board ship not only be confined to prison to indignation iron be placed on leg a if have be common malefactor only mitigation allowed to be that servant be permitted to attend upon clothes have be rigorously searched boot taken off suspicion have be entertained that coin have be hidden in of desmond friend two day later order be received from government officer be marched up to town ironed a be under strong guard be imprisoned at newgate callaghan other servant remained in prison at harwich thing be looking bad kennedy o'neil said dolefully for three officer have at own request be allotted cell together look very bright must make allowance for awful fright a hear have be caused by expedition possibly when have got over shock thing may be better will never forgive for putting iron on obeullivan said passionately if have shot at once be suppose what have right to expect to be treated like murderer ruffian of worst kind be too bad well be rid of iron a soon a got here doubt be only put on to prevent possibility of of escaping be sure by look that of escort must willingly have aided only that be impossible to do so knowing how large number of person must sympathize with can not blame so very much for taking step to prevent escape never saw such fellow a for finding excuse for people obeullivan said almost angrily look at thing a calmly a if concerned other people not kennedy smiled if opinion be to be worth anything obeullivan must be impartial one be best to look at matter calmly to form plan whatever may be a if be intended to be carried out by other people obeullivan laughed dear fellow if have not gone through adventure must have said that have mistaken vocation be cut out for philosopher rather than soldier however although luck did not suffice to save salisbury from capture must still hope that have not altogether deserted anyhow be convinced that if be possible for anyone to effect escape from dismal place be man newgate in day stood across street constituted one of entrance to city predecessor have be burnt in great fire of new one be at time le than forty year old though close badly ventilated have not yet arrived at stage of dirt foulness afterwards brought about death of number of prisoner confined there in occasioned outbreak of jail fever not only swept away large proportion of prisoner infected court of old bailey close to causing death of lord mayor several alderman judge many of counsel juryman of public present at trial outward appearance of building be handsome cell be for most part small ill ventilated place be disgraceful o'neil said there be barely room for three pallet air be close unwholesome now in heat of summer must be awful if food be a vile a lodging lookout be bad indeed fancy cell in french jail be better obeullivan said doubt in state prison high born prisoner be made fairly comfortable ordinary prisoner malefactor have be told suffer horribly thank goodness have never entered one even barrack cell can scarcely be called inviting be learning philosophy from kennedy o'neil said with laugh know that will feel philosophic if be served with nothing bread water however turnkey told that until have be tried condemned be at liberty to get food from outside certainly mockery in most case considering that be relieved of money found upon when arrived in harwich be comfort that be a said to take meal together money have in boot will alleviate lot for time probably will last good deal longer than be likely to be here when joined companion in room in be to dine be astonished at seeing excellent dinner on table with eight bottle of wine be way treat prisoner here colonel wauchop asked one of jailer of whom six remained present man smiled indeed have be sent in from tavern outside with message that like meal will be provided a long a be here one of be sent across to enquire a to person who have given order landlord said that be stranger to that have paid fortnight in advance must call in renew order at end of time well gentleman colonel said before begin to eat will drink health of unknown benefactor not only be gift generous expensive one can not be without danger to donor for none strong adherent of king james must have thought of thus relieving necessity be plain that authority suspected that message might have be sent in to prisoner concealed in viand bread have be cut up into small square crust have be lifted from two pasty meat have evidently be carefully searched turnkey placed round table so that must narrowly watch one of prisoner a ate notice movement must seem to indicate that have come across pellet of paper other substance day servant at tavern brought in similar fare continued a long a prisoner be in jail be matter of deep regret to that be never able to discover name of person to whom be so much indebted chapter escape from newgate after being allowed to remain hour at table prisoner be again marched off to cell wish have mike with desmond said a comrade discussed possibility of escape be shrewd fellow must probably be allowed greater freedom in moving about prison than be be sure that must see more of after left harwich of course first question be be to try bribery to work way out of cell think that must be dangerous to try bribery obeullivan remarked turnkey be sour faced rascal be convinced that if be to try to bribe must denounce at once not from principle know because must think that must pay better to do so so obtain promotion reward rather than to accept money run risk of being detected hanged blame o'neil said be a say sour looking rascal think that be fool none fool must run that risk for sake of money that must give for in case must have to retain portion of store in order to obtain disguise maintain ourselves till must find mean of crossing channel then let put idea altogether aside o'neil give whole attention to manner in be to escape manner in be to try to make escape o'neil repeated with laugh well put that way if like now in first place there be window in second door lastly wall floor door must withstand battering ram obeullivan said noticed a went out that be solid oak four inch thick with two bolt a well a lock moreover if must get through must be nearer escaping than be at present what with corridor passage turnkey outer gate course seems to impossible let come to second point window looked up at sill be fully six foot from ground window be little over foot wide with heavy bar running down centre cross bar first point be to see where look out on desmond said will stand against wall a be lighter of two o'neil can stand on shoulder have good look out tell see give hand put foot on o'neil then step on shoulder o'neil be soon in place need not hold said wall be very thick bar be placed in middle there be just room for to take seat on edge then can see thing at ease sat looking out for minute two before spoke well what can see obeullivan asked impatiently room be on outer side of prison said noticed a came in that be built along on side of gate doubt side stand on city wall then what do see see ground sloping steeply down to stream run along bottom of there be good many small house scattered about on slope along by stream over to left there be stone bridge across near be large building look like prison marketplace with stall in house stand thickly on side of road beyond bridge opposite side of slope be covered with among be large building if be once out there must not be much chance of being detected if have something to put over uniform of course must betray to first man met yes of course obeullivan said might possibly obtain plain clothes at one of small house speak of though must be risky might leave coatee behind go only in shirt breech give out that have be attacked robbed of money coat by footpad desmond said be good idea o'neil agreed yes might do especially a after dark must not be likely to notice that breech be of french cut seems to that be beginning at wrong end of business be of use discussing what be to do when escape till have settled upon manner in be to get out let talk over first be bar firmly in o'neil o'neil tried with strength to shake be a firm a wall said there be getting out unless have tool to cut away stonework round suppose there be chance of cutting through obeullivan asked there be not o'neil said have not got thing a knife about if have must never saw through thick bar must take year of sunday be rather job comforter now do get down let kennedy have chance of breath of fresh air to say nothing of view few minute satisfied obeullivan desmond when took place sat there considerably longer while other two throwing on pallet chatted gaily about paris friend there well what conclusion do arrive at asked when leapt down from seat be not very cheering replied recognize fully that can not possibly make escape without aid from without be same a to say that can not make escape at not exactly have found one unknown friend who supplied with dinner there be absolute reason why must not find one who must supply with mean of escape there must be great number of people who sympathize with whose heart be with king james have seen several men come from market stand look up at prison then walk off slowly a if be filled with pity for now propose that one of will always be at window oh be too much obeullivan said that ledge be so narrow that must hardly sit there even holding on by bar a to stopping there hour must almost a soon be on rack there will be occasion for desmond said can easily move one of pallet under pile other straw bed upon standing on must look out comfortably for shoulder must be well above ledge see that must be nearer to then kennedy must have gained much that directly saw person looking up with sympathizing air especially if of class who must afford to do what be necessary for must wave hand attract attention if disposed to help might give sign if not harm must be done might too tie handkerchief to bar in might be taken for indication that there be follower of stuart here supposing turned out a suggest might how must even best disposed friend do anything to help be for after consideration let first find friend will find way to open communication with have paper must write message on piece of linen drop down a far a can see from here there be nothing to prevent anyone coming up to foot of wall below for next four day nothing happened must see that white handkerchief at bar attracted attention for people stopped looked up at continued way without making gesture must seem to show that interested in way in matter on fourth day desmond who be at window said in tone of excitement there be man down there who after looking fixedly in direction be making way towards doe not come straight move about among house continues to approach ca make out face yet there be something about reminds of mike though how must be here when left in prison at harwich be more than can say o'neil obeullivan in turn looked through window not being so much accustomed a be to mike figure walk must not recognize in man in dress of country peasant well set up soldier who attended on desmond admitted however in point of figure might well be man if be desmond said difficulty be at end will wager that will be free in three four day now how be to communicate with have piece of paper in pocket be only old bill threw down contemptuously when searched o'neil said picked up again hardly know why except perhaps that idea occurred to that day might get chance of paying a have ink pen charcoal see how can benefit drew bill from pocket of coatee desmond took stood looking at in silence for minute then idea occurred to have exclaimed presently o'neil see if can get piece of gold wire off facing want five six inch long so that when be doubled up twisted together so a to be inch long will be stiff enough for purpose somewhat puzzled o'neil did a be requested desmond straightened out fine wire wrapped round centre thread doubled again doubled finally twisting together reduced to length of about inch thickness of pin others looked on wondering what be intention held paper out before began pricking small hole through close together continued to work for time then held up to light others understood nature of work must now read come ten tonight under window bring long thin string whistle will lower thread tie end of string to will give further instruction tore off portion of bill on message be written twisted off two of button of coatee folded in paper took place at window again man who have be watching be standing sixty foot from foot of wall back be towards presently turned carelessly looked up at window then a if undecided what to do took off cap scratched head be mike sure enough desmond exclaimed thrusting hand through bar waved for moment then taking little packet dropped mike put on hat again turned round then looked cautiously to see that one be noticing strolled in aimless leisurely way towards wall desmond must no longer see felt sure that must find missive presently came in sight again walking quietly away did not look round when nearly at bottom of hill turned lifted one hand disappeared behind house ca read desmond said have doubt will get someone to do for vigilant watch be kept up nothing be seen of mike till late in afternoon when emerged into one of open space have now taken handkerchief down from window directly saw desmond waved showing that be watching threw up arm turned disappeared again have made out message desmond said may expect here at ten o'clock while have be watching two comrade have under instruction be unravelling portion of one of blanket when enough thread have be obtained strand be tied together doubled desmond have little doubt that be sufficiently strong to draw up string mike must bring with now took portion of bill pricked upon word at nine tomorrow night bring if possible fine steel saw two file small bottle of oil fasten to string will lower with further instruction then opened coatee took out of white wool with be padded formed into loose ball in centre of note be fastened being in readiness waited patiently until just a city clock struck ten heard low whistle ball have already be attached to end of thread desmond at once lowered down presently heard whistle hauling at again found that ball have gone attached to end of thread be very light silken cord drew in there be low whistle be silent so far so good desmond said be fairly on way to liberty how long do suppose will take to cut through bar must take long while to file through o'neil said with fine steel saw must think that couple of night work must do of course be mere guesswork for have not least idea how fast even best saw must cut through iron well there be particular hurry for know that day have be fixed yet for trial so whether be one night six doe not matter much on following evening at nine o'clock whistle be heard ball lowered down at end of string instruction time be when be ready will show handkerchief at window bring with at nine that evening rope strong enough to bear have disguise for three ready for at foot of wall herewith be ten louis to purchase three disguise cord brought up small packet contained two very fine small steel saw two file oil did not lose moment in setting to work oiling saw one began to cut through central bar just above point where lowest cross bar went through a determined to leave to fasten rope to there be not room for two of to work together agreed to take by turn changing quarter of hour to great satisfaction found that saw did work much more quickly than have expected by time have have turn bar be cut through by morning side bar have also all be cut did not attempt to cut main bar higher up a have done so must have be difficult to keep portion cut out in place when be light filled up cut with bread have managed to secrete in palm of hand at dinner kneaded into sort of putty rolled in dust of floor until black then squeezed into interstice there be fear of noticing o'neil said when have finished can not see cut from floor though know where be unless be to climb up there examine place very closely must not see anything wrong will hang out flag today kennedy think have better wait till tomorrow will be hardly expecting to see today may not be ready with rope disguise next morning signal be hung out saw nothing of mike a must be able to make out handkerchief from considerable distance have doubt that have observed thought prudent not to show near prison again a soon a be dark recommenced work have cut through main bar cautiously lowered grating to ground before clock struck nine then on hearing mike signal lowered cord soon brought up rope although small be more than strong enough to support have better tie knot in desmond said will help to avoid sliding down too rapidly if be thick rope think must manage without not being sailor think that must grasp tightly enough how close will put kennedy about two foot apart then can come down hand over hand helping arm by twisting leg round now went on when have finished knot who will go down first have better do so obeullivan said be lightest of fancy strongest too very well think that will make difference for rope be strong enough to hold three of together however here go may a well leave coatee behind might get into difficulty if took so saying took off coat fastened end of rope securely to bar have be left for purpose holding firmly made way through opening swung over with muscle strengthened by military exercise sword practice found easier work than have expected depth be sixty foot in couple of minute foot touched ground mike have be hanging on by rope to steady a desmond descended seized by hand shook enthusiastically murmuring brokenly dear master thank god that be free thanks to also dear fellow now hold on again friend o'neil obeullivan shared cell with be following added weight to of mike be not long before o'neil came down not so quietly a desmond have done for strength have failed rope have slipped rapidly through finger mike desmond narrowly escaped being knocked down by suddenness with descent be made stood for minute wringing hand swearing in undertone in english irish french by power said have taken skin off inside of hand entirely red hot poker must not have done more nately mike rascal what be laughing at have mind to break bone before thanking obeullivan succeeded better be completely exhausted when joined friend now mike where be disguise here be honour be just like own loose coat rough breech white stocking buckled shoe soft hat with wide brim thought that must pas better like than in other way for if be dressed up a citizen tongue might betray for somehow speak english a do whenever open mouth discover that be irishman desmond laughed there must be difficulty about now let put on disguise at once be off sometimes turnkey take into head to look in during night have to keep one on watch while be at work take to bed when heard footstep approaching see have brought shoe forgot to mention jack boot must have attracted attention so have left behind after getting store of money from hiding place be soon dressed what be supposed to be mike be sedan chair men sir most of chair be carried by irishman who seem to be stronger in leg than london folk will have to cut hair short then will pas without observation where be taking to desmond asked a descended hill have got lodging in house out in field said that be irishman who have come to london in search of employment that expected three friend to join that intended to hire chair carry gentry about for here seem too lazy to walk everyone be carried though be small blame to for dirtier street never saw be just full of hole where go in up to knee in mud filth of kind faith there be part of paris ca say much for worst of be better than here except just street call cheapside go on past saint paul along strand to westminster what have brought stick for mike for have handed to heavy bludgeon sure honour 't be not safe to be in street after nightfall be like part of paris where dacent man must walk without being assaulted by thief cutthroat dressed a be be not likely anyone must interfere with in hope of finding money on be not particular at at party of rascal might try to roll in mire just for fun so be a well to be prepared however met with interruption passed out through holborn bar soon arrived at house where mike have taken lodging be not sorry however that be armed for several time heard outburst of drunken shouting sound of fray mike have hired two room in one of be three straw bed for officer slept on blanket on floor of other room served a kitchen sitting room now for first time be able to talk freely mike have not said much to yet desmond began gentleman be fully conscious that have saved from death for hear government be determined to push matter to extremity to have officer captured condemned to be hanged bad ce to mike exclaimed indignantly if have two three of be mighty little must talk of execution after stick have have few minute converse with a to getting out assure honour there be little have done except to carry out order when first saw prison little white flag flying from window said to myself that barring wing there be way of getting to be only when got first letter saw might be managed faith letter bothered entirely took to woman downstairs asked to read for saying that have picked up in street wondered what be about be great scholar made out that be writ in foreign language seemed to to be bit of old bill when took up to room looked at way knew of course that be message somehow devil bit must see where came in fingered for hour looking at in way then saw that there be small hole pricked well must not ask woman what meant a have told picked up so went across to irishman whose acquaintance have made day before who have recommended if wanted work to hire one of chair get comrade to help carry must see that be man who have seen better day expect have come over in time of trouble have be forced to earn living a must so went to ' have got message ' said 'pricked on piece of paper picked up be curious like to know what be about ' so held up to light read out message ' think say 'it be colleen who have made appointment with lover maybe have be shut up by father thought best way to send message 'that be doubt say 'and be plain that never came to hand ' next day went to again with second letter lying have be to ' said

said 'for have suffered for cause if want assistance can depend upon ' 'thank kindly ' say 'just at present be one man job maybe if get out will be able to give advice a to how have best manage ' so that be how stand honour now tell how got away mike may guess how surprised be when first made out believing that be safe under lock key at matter be easy enough mike said took two three day to get to understand position of place with water round except on one side be plain that if be to start running be little chance must have if did not hit upon right road luckily be mounting cannon day after be taken away be ordered to go out lend hand so be not long before learnt enough to know road ought to take be always good runner honour many prize have carried off at fair in old country before trouble began so seemed to that if must have anything of start ought to be able to get off there be nearly mile betwixt town place where narrow ground at whose end stood widened out into country if must only hold own a far a must take to wood lane save guard of soldier with musket bayonet went out with at end of second day managed to slip off hide behind pile of cannonball rest assembled at spot about fifty yard away to be counted before marched to prison again a soon a others have got there guard have gathered round went off a hard a must tear good start must have got if have be that sentry on fort close by fired piece at still have good hundred yard start guard set to to run after when got in sight of fired gun be flurried bullet flew past without one of touching then felt pretty safe if stopped to load musket must get clean away if a expected must not stop for must not have chance with carrying musket cartridge box belt have taken off coatee boot while be waiting for start went up hill like deer did not look round till got to top then found that have gained hundred yard of doubled down lane at once then struck through orchard ran without stopping maybe couple of mile never heard more of soldier knew that for present be safe though maybe must send dragoon to scour country when news came in went on at jog trot till be quite dark then sat down to think what must do next have got four louis with for have found when searched first thing be to get dud walked along till saw light in cottage entered there be two woman there told at once that wanted clothes be ready to pay for that if must not give to for money must take without paying though must see that doubted payment regarded a robber brought out clothes belonged one of woman said to husband took what wanted 'now said 'how much will pay for ' be still terribly frightened said be welcome however put one of louis down on table be certainly more than clothes ever cost so said 'here be gold piece want shilling in change to buy food with ' at first evidently hardly thought be in earnest then at last when found that really intended to give money brightened up not only gave shilling in change offered bread cheese be glad enough to take then put clothes on over own not wishing to lave anything behind must show searcher that be who have be there told woman that coin be french one that be worth about same a english guinea advised to put away for present not to try change for few week a enquiry might be made a to how have obtained have difficulty on way up to london avoided main road till got to colchester after walked boldly on having money to pay for victual when got to town changed of louis at money changer asked where have got when said that be business of that have be paid by french huguenot gentleman who have lately arrived for whom have be doing work a there be many of huguenot in london be satisfied changed for then fell across irish porter told of told whereabouts must get lodging advised to apply to one of men who let out number of sedan chair to hire one out to by week well honour once have taken lodging thought more of chair went about business for have come to london have not be hour in town before made acquaintance of dozen at least of countryman found out be prison in be kept at first thought of going there giving up on condition might be employed a servant then thought perhaps must not keep word to must send back to harwich then thought struck that might way other get honour out of prison when first saw place seemed to that be impossible place be mighty strong window barred have mean of finding out where be lodged spent whole day in prowling round round jail sorra idea came into thick head though bate wid fist till be sore for say to myself there be lock so strong can be picked if do know right way be second day when espied little bit of white stuff at one of window might be signal might not even if be there be reason why must be yours except said to myself ber kennedy be not boy to sit quiet in prison if can see possible way of slipping out of head be crammed full of idea so will walk near investigate matter a came close must make out that there be someone behind bar must not see who be of course did not come straight to spot went about promiscuously for anything must tell there might be someone in tower watching then saw hand drop little white parcel found without much trouble went off with be a much a must do to keep from running like madman for felt somehow sure that be who have dropped of course be not until got read for be certain after honour be easy enough told what to do did there be little difficulty about saw got through one of chair men who told when asked that have acquaintance of cracksman more shame to that must get such thing a wanted through be not surprised for have already heard that many of chair men worked in connection with bad character letting know way be coming with people from entertainment carrying down lane where there be little chance of watch interfering went against grain to have dealing with man for be born of honest people if ould gentleman have offered couple of saw knew must have to give thousand year extra of purgatory must have closed with bargain two saw cost louis cheap enough too after that be plain sailing money lowered to be much more than sufficient for other thing now what be honour going to do next be more than can tell mike must talk over be matter that have already discussed in cell after have once made preparation for flight closely watched a be when with other officer must have be impossible to communicate plan to even if must have done so must see possible way in others must share in escape doubtless door of cell be also strong heavy must all difficulty have be overcome there must have be passage corridor staircase to traverse with certainty of meeting with of night watchman who patrolled must finally have have to force door into cell

will be difficulty about that sailor said will go out warn men that will sail in hour then can get garment that desire for doubtless wish to attract comment by purchase of clothes must seem unfitted

mouth of river put out to sea be fast sir fastest thing sail out of rye need be for gentleman who come to be always in hurry suppose have fear of english cruiser not at have order brought with have only to show to english ship of war that overhaul for to let go on at once be careful when get near french coast for although big craft never venture out far there be number of chasse maree patrolling

better kept in france than be on english side of channel arrived in paris at eleven o'clock next day chapter on frontier on entering barrack yard found that regiment have marched ten day before for frontier that lord galmoy regiment have taken place went at once to quarter told that having effected escape have travelled with speed to inform king of determination of english government to bring irish officer to execution to implore to intervene in favour will go with to versailles at once lord galmoy said a have uniform king be very strict on matter of etiquette three of officer will lend suit sword while be being fetched sit down share meal for doubtless have not waited to eat on road then gave necessary instruction hour later three officer now in uniform started with on horseback for versailles king have just returned from hunting be hour before lord galmoy must obtain audience with have on road told others felt sure that king who be well served by agent in london have already heard of intention of english government a to whether have sent off remonstrance be of course ignorant will press matter strongly upon point out deep feeling will be excited throughout irish scotch troop if nothing be done to save prisoner louis be politic monarch said knowing worth that of scotch soldier think that will on representation bestir wauchop have many time performed brilliant service deserves well of france however will see when be admitted to audience lord galmoy introduced three soldier of o'brien regiment a coming that morning to paris having effected escape from newgate a repeated name king looked sharply at desmond ah ah said so young ensign be in thick of adventure again will hear presently well lord why have come here so hurriedly after arrival came to inform majesty that english government have determined to execute colonel francis wauchop twelve officer of regiment who be on board salisbury captured on coast of scotland desmond who be watching king face closely saw that be news to that be annoyed by being now brought to notice for doubtless fate of colonel dozen young officer be matter affected little have matter not be forced upon must not have troubled about when be too late must have professed entire ignorance of intention of english government only said however be incredible that there can be intention to execute officer in service captured upon warlike expedition be too true sir against colonel wauchop have ground for severity by convention of limerick other officer be formally permitted to enter majesty service young lieutenant have of course joined long since time therefore can not benefit by term of convention must with show of justice be executed a english subject traitor serving against country be afraid that remonstrance must have little effect with english government lord galmoy smiled slightly for be notorious that negotiation have gone on between king james councillor several of member of english ministry marlborough being more than suspected of having secret understanding with little court at saint germain only said however majesty have in hand power of compelling english government to alter determination in matter how so lord king asked in much surprise have sire many prisoner frenchman of reformed religion who have entered service of protestant prince enemy who be taken in dutch flemish town have captured stand in same relation towards majesty a irish officer towards england have then to inform government there that if in way harm irish officer noncommissioned officer in hand will at once execute similar number of french protestant officer whom have hitherto treated a prisoner of war then possibly exchange might be effected majesty will think pardon for saying that unless step be taken to save officer life matter be likely to have very bad effect on irish scotch regiment whose ardour will not be improved by knowledge that in case of reverse will if not killed in field be executed a traitor for nearly half of men who be now serving have joined since formation of brigade be not protected by term of limerick treaty be devoted to majesty service be ready to lay down life freely for cause of france must not be fair that must also run risk of execution if be by misfortune made prisoner there be much in what say lord galmoy certainly point out way by officer can be saved messenger will start in hour time with letter to english government will be delivered at headquarters in flanders by noon tomorrow with request that will be forwarded by special messenger to british minister will have proclamation posted in paris in various camp of army saying that have warned english government unless officer men captured off coast of scotland be treated a prisoner of war will retaliate by treating french officer taken in foreign service in same way that have furthermore offered to exchange equal number of such officer men in hand for held by british government thank majesty most respectfully heartily in name of foreign officer in service even must unfortunately english government refuse to pardon exchange prisoner will be seen that majesty have done in power to save there will be general feeling of reprobation throughout europe at conduct of english ministry beg officer to wait in anteroom while dictate despatch proclamation to secretary must fain question a to how effected escape from prison how have made so speedy journey here lord galmoy bowed retired with others have done well said better indeed than have hoped now having succeeded in saving countryman life doubt not must have be otherwise sacrificed will return at once to paris for there be inspection of regiment afternoon have be fortunate indeed o'neil said when lord galmoy have left have doubt king have heard that english government have resolved to execute prisoner question whether must have stirred in matter have not be for galmoy representation be sure by manner that have received news before desmond said a say have not intended to interfere be suggestion that might threaten retaliation that effect of not moving in matter must be very bad among irish troop decided to interfere may have felt that mere protest made by must have have little effect be not nature to expose to rebuff directly saw that have effective weapon in hand took matter up a warmly a must wish in point of fact king threat have desired effect two month later imprisoned officer men be exchanged for equal number of huguenot in quarter of hour three officer be again summoned to king presence with be tall dark officer of distinguished mien whom o'neil obeullivan recognized a duke of berwick one of most famous general of time have be in command of french force in spain from have be recalled suddenly two day before in order that king who have great confidence in might consult a to general plan of operation in country in north before despatching to join army in flanders be commanded by duke of burgundy duke of vendome jointly a be headstrong obstinate by mean agreed a to operation to be undertaken king have determined to send berwick there in order that might by military genius influence bring matter to better state between two duke arrange with definite plan by tide of fortune have hitherto gone against french might be arrested king appeared now to be in good humour now young sir said have hour at leisure must fain hear true account of adventure omitting nothing have doubt monsieur kennedy that ready wit have small share in matter with permission sire will tell story o'neil said for mr kennedy be not likely to place own share of work in due prominence king nodded o'neil gave detailed account of manner in have made escape succeeded in getting conveyed across channel in vessel in government service explaining that affair be due entirely to desmond initiative ingenuity king listened with great interest even laughed at story of capture of lord godolphin have three behaved extremely well said monsieur kennedy have again shown that posse unusual shrewdness a well a daring what think duke of young subaltern who be may tell hero of whom have doubtless heard who twice rescued mademoiselle de pointdexter from hand of abductor be told story yesterday sire be filled with admiration at boldness resource of rescuer who be heard ensign in o'brien regiment certainly did not expect to find so young man have indeed fertility of invention fill with surprise other officer deserve praise for having so willingly followed leadership of junior generosity in assigning to whole merit of undertaking be highly commendable be easy thing sire to find in young officer especially if may say so among cadet of good family who form for most part staff of general men ready to exercise own discretion when in difficulty to carry out with due diligence order committed to regiment have marched to northern frontier vacancy in rank of officer have be filled up from of other regiment must with majesty permission be glad to take three officer on own staff a leaving spain privately in accordance with majesty order have brought with only captain fromart secretary one young aide de camp must be glad if must promote mr kennedy to rank of lieutenant quite approve of request king said graciously indeed added with smile will not be altogether sorry to see lieutenant kennedy employed outside kingdom for after making war on own account with one of noble kidnapping first minister of england there be saying what enterprise might next undertake must join of who trouble country with plot must feel compelled to double guard in order to hold secure from design well gentleman since duke of berwick have appointed aide de camp least can do be to see that be properly fitted out for expedition have of course lost uniform horse money in service be just that must see to being refitted if will wait in anteroom will receive order on treasury for hundred louis d'ors three officer bowed deeply in acknowledgment to king bowing also to duke of berwick returned to anteroom where presently one of royal attendant brought to three order on treasury also begged in name of duke of berwick to wait until audience with king must be over be highly delighted with change in position post of staff officer be a duke have said considered to belong almost of right to member of noble family be seldom that officer of line must aspire to did not tell kennedy that luck must bring good fortune to by power have done so faith if anyone have said month ago must by now be on duke of berwick staff must have laughed in face if indeed have not quarrelled with for mocking at now here be with money to buy horse outfit with more drilling recruit attending parade not end to work obeullivan desmond kennedy said wo find much idle time when be serving with duke have name of being strict commander sparing soldier have heard that staff have very hard time of however be not afraid of hard work when be done on horseback there be many more chance of promotion on staff than there be in marching regiment well mind being taken prisoner dozen time if be what come of providing always that be taken with kennedy be there to help out of scrape must have to have mike prisoner too desmond laughed for without help must be in newgate at present believe be sure that even if have turned up must have managed somehow in short time duke came out be likely to be detained here week before start for flanders will give time to procure outfit of horse equipment arm will require two horse must be good one doubt whether if get proper outfit sum that majesty have given will suffice to buy two horse have however in stable here plenty of good animal have be taken from enemy one will be given to of therefore will be only necessary for to purchase one be staying here must be obliged when have taken lodging if must send address will then let know where when be to join be there anything else that must ask must ask sir might take servant with desmond said certainly can do so without further question one man more le will make difference to o'brien regiment must be pity that must not have with for be evident that be at once faithful posse large amount of shrewdness after thanking duke for present of horse three officer having drawn money left palace rode back to paris went first to barrack returned horse uniform with many thanks to officer who have lent have interview with lord galmoy informed of new appointment have well won said wish good fortune assuredly be more likely to rise under duke of berwick than a subaltern in irish brigade though promotion be not slow there owing to vacancy battle always make in rank went out took lodging together then went to military tailor who promised undress full dress suit in four day then ordered military saddle bridle equipment on next day after visiting stable in paris purchased three horse for desmond bought in addition serviceable animal for mike with cavalry saddle accoutrement ordered uniform for provided with sword brace of pistol mike be greatly pleased when desmond communicated promotion appointment to will look grand honour a general aide de camp with handsome uniform horse 't be glad be that be going to flanders for from have heard from men who have fought in spain little pleasure be to be have in campaigning there food be vile road be bad be choked with dust smothered with heat a to making lieutenant if have due must be colonel must have made at rate major there be plenty of time mike desmond laughed nice colonel must look too leading thousand men into battle if obtain majority in fifteen year will consider lucky desmond did not share mike gratification that be to campaign with army of north instead of with in spain however a must be fighting against english troop in country concluded must not make much difference especially a being aide de camp must not have to enter into actual conflict with friend be heartily glad that destination be not spain for have like mike heard much of hardship suffered by troop in country know from what have said kennedy that if have have choice must have taken spain putting aside heat there be poor work by account be well nigh starved ca get at enemy who know mountain path over be a difficult to catch a one of flea harasses while be on march shirks fighting a old one shirks holy water there have only be one fight must be called battle since war began a for siege mean that lose lot of men have little credit when take place especially a moment go out one way enemy enter on other side there be work to be done over again admit that will see great deal more of war in north kennedy said marlborough eugene on other side duke of berwick vendome on ours be such skilful commander that there will be far greater interest in operation than in carrying on what be little more than partisan war in spain not only that o'neil put in there will be possibility of getting decent food while in spain there be few great town long distance from other in flanders there be town few mile be sure of decent quarter good cooking why o'neil did not know that be particular a to food desmond laughed can starve a well a kennedy when get good food good wine good lodging own prefer vastly to fare that troop have to put up with in spain can see reason why because be going to risk life in battle must put up with sort of misery inconvenience beforehand if can be avoided a to fighting against english there be english in spain flanders in army form small proportion of force though grant willingly that be backbone of army if look at thing sensibly will see that have gained slight advantage by berwick going to flanders instead of returning to spain three day after preparation be completed orderly brought note from duke of berwick be brief to point rendezvous be at six o'clock tomorrow morning in front of la louvre signed berwick be glad that summons have come have discussed future from point of view be already growing impatient short a stay have be in paris five minute before hour be at rendezvous a clock struck duke rode up with two officer escort of six trooper looked at accoutrement horse nodded head approvingly will do very well said can tell that gloss of uniform will not last long in flanders other officer be captain fromart who acted a duke secretary lieutenant d'eyncourt mike fell in with escort behind also rode body servant of duke two cavalry men who be servant of officer once beyond limit of town party broke into trot duke rode on ahead evidently in deep thought five officer followed in group see monsieur d'eyncourt said that only one of have brought servant with only arrived in paris week ago o'neil said own regiment have left did not care to ask for two soldier from regiment a might have turned out badly thought better therefore to delay until joined army wait till must obtain couple of good men from one of cavalry regiment there a be monsieur kennedy servant can look after three of have doubt two of soldier of escort will not object to earn few livres by looking after horse on way think be right other said if one get good man soldier servant be invaluable if a be often case be bad one well one be far better without be curious how men who have be smart soldier when in rank be apt to go to bad when become servant have more time on hand be free from most of parade have sentry duty to perform consequence be that become slovenly careless in nine case out of ten give way to drink at opportunity if mr kennedy servant be really good one will be better off with third of service than must be with whole of of ordinary soldier servant have just returned from england have not duke told captain fromart that be among who be captured in salisbury that have made escape gave particular for indeed duke be not given to much speech a general be splendid must be more pleasant for staff if be to unbend little yes managed to give slip o'neil said thanks to monsieur kennedy servant did return from spain with general captain fromart yes there be nothing doing at moment gave option of accompanying staying behind vastly preferred trip a considered for of course have idea that duke be about to be sent to flanders hear good deal of climate of spain be said to be lovely vow that be detestable heat when be hot be terrible when be not hot there be bitter wind chill to bone great portion of country be half populated can go day march without coming to village road be villainous there be nothing to buy be a much a transport can do to get will not say enough bread bare sufficiency to maintain troop moreover duke have be constantly thwarted in plan by spaniard who be ready enough to make promise never take single step towards fulfilment duke temper be of shortest have quarrelled openly with most of leading spaniard have threatened four five time to throw up command return to france did do so year ago affair went so badly without that cause of france be seriously imperilled by absence be at urgent request of philip that returned for at time english general peterborough be striking dismay over country if duke advice have not be taken officer acknowledge that must speedily have crossed pyrenees do population incline towards philip austrian a rule incline towards party seems likely to win must shout in madrid a loudly for archduke charles a for philip catalonia valencia be exception there balance of feeling be certainly in favour of austrian be principally because be afraid of peterborough whom regard a almost supernatural fear must take vengeance upon who deserted cause there be accounting for city have held out a stoutly for one candidate a for other without apparent reason so far a can observe fight for philip because be grandson be important in interest of france to stand closely allied with party a for spaniard with can tell that have little trust in of be good be not consider of of much account then spaniard on other side be better seem to have lost military virtue ever since best troop be demolished at rocroi by conde destruction of fleet by english drain of resource in men money entailed by long war in holland altogether deprived people of martial spirit war be to extent between english because of ally england holland austria austrian dutch take great share in struggle dutch be wholly engrossed with defence of fen austrian be fully occupied in italy on rhine frontier be only english who fortunately be not very numerous who be against for portuguese can scarcely be counted in business being if anything slower more stupid than spaniard however at present prospect be good peterborough have gone galway army have be almost destroyed though to do justice english regiment fought magnificently if have be seconded by portuguese result might have be altogether different then found spain much le rich than france there be comparison captain fromart said ought to be fully a rich plain lie almost uncultivated people seem wholly without energy ruling class be always intriguing seem to pay little attention to estate see few castle chateau such a be dotted over france say at present moment france can be considered prosperous country in material matter expense of war have be enormous to say nothing of court people be ground down by taxation misery in part of country be extreme left to people will work work hard soil will grow anything after twenty year of peace france must altogether recover yet alliance of spain be considered a of vital importance to france of great importance certainly spain have still soldier who can fight well a have proved in italy be levy at home equally well drilled disciplined must doubt turn out good soldier be at present almost undrilled desert in number return to home after slightest reverse prefer to act a partisan under leader of own choosing with philip once firmly seated on throne with french adviser officer to assist few regiment to serve a nucleus to army spain must turn out force must be very valuable addition to strength of european power with spain a ally can in addition to force that can put in field neglect altogether southern frontier employ whole army elsewhere with a ally of austria of england must have to keep army in south to guard border two day after leaving party arrived at peronne where considerable body of troop be collected of although aide de camp desmond now learned for first time duke be to take command movement of importance have taken place in field a force at peronne still wanted several regiment to bring up to intended strength week passed before be set in motion four aide de camp however have busy time of main army be stationed in neighbourhood of lille frequent communication passed between berwick vendome ally be inactive eugene have early in april met marlborough at hague have concerted with plan for

life activity looking into detail endeavouring to infuse of own energy into others full of care for comfort of troop though ready to endure hardship then see real man noble character idolized by soldier loved by must not judge in slightest degree by what now be have great deal on mind have so be whispered no small trouble in keeping peace between vendome burgundy failure too of expedition to scotland must have greatly disappointed have doubt expected to be put at head of french army sent over to place james upon throne however may congratulate now that be not with for honour gain have be earned by concerned in that certainly be so desmond agreed be mismanaged affair altogether to begin with twenty thousand men must have be sent instead of six thousand in next place fleet must have assembled at brest bordeaux for in case although news of assembling must assuredly have reached england must not have be known whether be intended that landing must be made in ireland scotland on english coast while by gathering at dunkirk doubt be left a to destination be proved by fact that when english fleet watching port be driven off by gale opportunity be thus given for start instead of coming back again a have hoped only to find that have left sailed straight for north making absolutely certain that be bound for edinburgh well must hope obeullivan said that next time force will a say be fully twenty thousand men will include irish brigade will be led by berwick will land in ireland at moment orderly entered duke requires attendance lieutenant kennedy desmond at once went to duke apartment will start at once for lille mr kennedy will report to marshal vendome have arranged with that one of aide de camp will accompany force be about to advance will keep informed of what be being done have selected because know to be active shrewd marshal be too much occupied to send such full report a must wish look to not only to give fact to convey to impression of what see passing around fear to speak plainly communication will be strictly private view will be thus of far more use to than official expression of marshal staff will of course take servant with have told off three trooper to accompany for purpose of bringing report to there be probability of general engagement at present until obtain idea of marlborough plan extensive operation will be undertaken from manner in spoke desmond have doubt that berwick be in favour of taking initiative without delay that have be overruled be indeed of importance to french that before advancing must secure possession of town of west flanders so that great road must be open to hour after leaving duke desmond be in saddle followed by four soldier rode for vendome camp according to instruction halted for night at arras reached

with pistol rapier made excursion into country dined spent evening a if army be nonexistent few only be men who have served a officer took profession seriously divided among what work have to be done young noble gladly relinquishing to chapter oudenarde desmond did not remain long at marshal camp accompanied expedition be sent to bruges ghent ypres inhabitant of town have for time be in

forward at once duke will ride on with speed in accordance with vendome urgent request four of be to go on with will accompany force here there be time to be lost duke horse be to be at door in quarter of hour will not please to be kept waiting have better leave spare horse for present have already warned escort be short notice by time named four aide de camp be in saddle a be soldier

mile stopped once for two hour to refresh horse rode into vendome camp soon after large tent have be already erected for berwick use close to of marshal close by for use of officer who might come with quarter of hour later soldier entered aide de camp tent with large tray duke of berwick bid say gentleman that be supping with marshal who have sent dish to from own table please to give thanks to duke of vendome for kindness desmond said when soldier have left tent went on have doubt that be result of suggestion on part of berwick greatly obliged to must feel have just be saying that supposed must get nothing to eat till tomorrow morning while here be supper worthy of marshal four flask of wine doubt not be good be ten o'clock before duke returned to tent when at once sent for aide de camp there will be nothing more for to do tonight gentleman sleep soundly for will have hard day work tomorrow be to cross scheldt again at daybreak enemy be on other side of dender next day pitched battle will probably be fought may be surprised that wait until force arrive have heard that eugene reinforcement be within two day march of marlborough a be more numerous than command have be decided to accept battle at once good night general be in good temper d'eyncourt said a reentered tent expect that view have be adopted that there be warm discussion over be indeed case duke of burgundy obstinate man without knowledge of war have be in favour of pushing forward crossing lys a well a scheldt attacking ally a soon a met vendome on other hand be of opinion that army be now collected near ghent have better advance against oudenarde might be carried by coup de main before marlborough must come to assistance might be day in doing seeing that be in command of mixed force composed of dutch dane hanoverian prussian british burgundy then maintained that must retire fight near ypres where must be close to frontier must retire upon lille in case matter went against berwick however at last managed to persuade to agree to vendome plan a capture of oudenarde be matter of utmost importance must be a easy to fall back thence to lille a must be from ypres burgundy have sullenly assented to next morning army marched to position fixed upon be on steeply rising ground with river norken running at foot beyond be two other eminence on of stood windmill on west be called windmill of oycke that on adjoining hill windmill of royegham latter flanking main position oudenarde being found to be strongly garrisoned be decided in spite of opposition of burgundy to cross scheldt at gavre then to give battle to ally between river dender marlborough have however be joined by prince eugene who have like berwick hurried on in advance of army two great general decided instead of attacking french by road from brussels to sweep round across scheldt at oudenarde by other bridge across river so to place between vendome france portion of french army be already in movement when news came that ally be fast coming up early next morning advance guard composed of twelve battalion of infantry whole of cavalry reached scheldt having thrown bridge over river crossed soon came in contact with french advance guard under biron there be severe fighting in party gained great advantage french maintaining possession of village of eynes while conflict be going on marlborough eugene with main body have reached river be engaged in crossing vendome determined to attack while carrying out operation be a usual opposed by burgundy who wished to continue march to ghent marshal vendome pointed out that in country so broken interspersed with hedge army possessing greatest strength for french numbered eighty five thousand while marlborough have eighty thousand under must lose advantage of superiority upon berwick strongly siding with marshal burgundy be forced to give way discussion lasted time enabling ally to pas body of troop across river where be formed up at village few hundred yard north of oudenarde immediately marlborough felt strong enough to risk attack order be sent to cadogan who commanded advance guard to drive enemy out of eynes four english battalion attacked seven french battalion in village while cavalry crossed higher up came down on back of village three of french battalion be surrounded made prisoner while other four be dispersed be now evident even to burgundy that action must not be avoided again angry dispute took place vendome must have stood on defensive with river norken to be crossed before must be attacked be however overruled by burgundy who have nominally chief command marlborough took advantage of delay posted troop in front of castle of bevere sent twelve battalion at eynes to reinforce left against saw main attack of french must be directed then lined hedge with infantry stationed twenty british battalion under argyle in reserve crossing norken french fell upon dutch hanoverian who constituted left wing who though fighting obstinately be driven back marlborough moved from centre with twenty battalion to reinforce despatched eugene to command on right desperate fight now took place on flank ground be broken by enclosure with deep wet ditch bridge wood small village cavalry be unable to act on such ground infantry on side fought with extreme resolution hedge ditch bridge house being defended to last seldom indeed in modern warfare have so obstinate terrible fight taken place frequently combatant be mingled together fought with bayonet butt end of musket gradually however dutch hanoverian battalion won way forward drove french back to village of diepenbeck where latter successfully maintained marlborough then ordered general overkirk to move round seize hill at oycke although flanked enemy position be not held by did with twenty dutch danish battalion who have only just crossed river then pressed on seized mill of royegham thus cutting communication between french at diepenbeck troop still remained on plateau beyond norken eugene then swung round right pressing forward surrounded french on side so completely enveloping that men of overkirk believed other to be french for darkness have now fallen fought for time before mistake be discovered a in such country be impossible to move troop in regular formation in darkness marlborough gave order for troop to halt in position held have light lasted two hour longer whole of french army must have be slain captured under cover of darkness greater portion made way through interval of allied troop many fled to ghent while thousand made for french frontier vendome lost in killed wounded six thousand men nine thousand prisoner total loss exceeded twenty thousand while ally lost five thousand of whom great majority be dutch dane german french troop on plateau withdrew under direction of vendome in good order before morning large number of fugitive have rallied marlborough sent forty squadron of horse in pursuit of french showed so firm attitude that cavalry be unable to seriously interfere with retreat berwick have remained during day near marshal have placed aide de camp at disposal for difficulty of ground distance from plateau of various point at troop be engaged rendered communication much slower than otherwise must have be desmond companion be frequently sent off with order be first time desmond have be under fire effect of roar of musketry whizzing of bullet shout of combatant gave much stronger feeling of discomfort than have expected roar of cannon be not added to other sound for gun of day be clumsy difficult to move owing to rapid march countermarch of army greater portion of artillery have be left behind only few gun be on field in so close confined country be of little use desmond felt now that must far rather be fighting in thick of with o'brien regiment than making way alone along lane impeded constantly by column advancing to front while be met by stream of wounded men making way to rear at first be exultation among troop for a hanoverian dutch be forced to give way before assault of main body of french shout of victory rose be confidently believed that must day avenge two great victory marlborough eugene have gained over having delivered order to officer in command desmond rode back vendome berwick have dismounted be standing together with few of staff at edge of plateau examining field with telescope have delivered message sir said riding up saluting general bade tell be going well enemy be falling back will soon be in full flight very well mr kennedy by time will have found out that be little too sanguine fire have indeed for past few minute broken out with augmented fury marlborough have arrived at threatened point have placed at head of dutch hanoverian animated by presence have not only ceased to fall back be in turn advancing battle be not won yet kennedy obeullivan who have returned few minute before from front said a joined on left be being driven back for large force have reinforced enemy there unless main column defeat allied left push into oudenarde will have night coming on before have finished a cavalry can not act in cramped field marlborough will be able to draw off without great loss for hour there be change then berwick looking round beckoned to desmond mr kennedy said strong force of enemy moved hour ago towards left have lost sight of owing to high hedge tree doe not seem to that can have joined in battle troop be strongly posted at diepenbeck must be able to maintain there against whole allied army enemy can not see disposition must surely have pushed forward made desperate assault on village have be joined by strong force saw moving in direction may be that force have be held in reserve in case line must be reinforced again advance marlborough may be content to hold own on left while prince eugene who have heard command on right turn flank on side wish to ascertain if possible what force be doing where be posted if ride across to mill on eminence behind diepenbeck may be able to get sight of if smoke render impossible to discover matter from point ride on to farther hill descending there on enemy left will be able to make way close enough to ascertain what be going on be well mounted need not greatly fear capture for must hardly care to divert party of cavalry in pursuit of single officer still be a well not to push horse too hard on way out for may possibly need strength minute later desmond be cantering horse down declivity to norken crossing by bridge near mullen turned to right rode up hill of royegham here strong brigade composed of cavalry infantry under general grimaldi be stationed desmond rode up to duke of berwick have sent to ascertain position of strong body of enemy troop whom observed marching from river towards right may ask if have noticed saw move away after crossing river have not seen since must fancy be engaged in front of diepenbeck ground be so undulating view so obscured by smoke that have not caught sight of since issued from oudenarde indeed hill behind diepenbeck prevents seeing down into low land beyond will ride on there sir desmond said certainly better view can be obtained than from side canter of mile took to summit of hill at whose foot diepenbeck stood must see mass of french troop gathered in in front of village beyond veil of smoke covered country entirely obscured contending party whose position must only be guessed by incessant rattle of musketry fire turning again rode down dip separated hill from of oycke have just gained crest when saw large force marching rapidly towards mill seeing at once serious nature of movement turned galloped at full speed to point where general be still watching progress of fight must learn nothing of force spoke of from general grimaldi at royegham on height above diepenbeck riding towards oycke saw advancing at full speed towards windmill at have already almost arrived exclamation of anger broke from duke be what come muttered of placing fool in command of army turning away at once communicated news to vendome who stamped foot furiously on ground just when victory be in grasp said turned glass towards oycke be four mile distant can make out now said there be black mass issuing from village of oycke ascending hill in direction of royegham be too late to reinforce grimaldi there will be upon before can cross norken at rate must send brigade down to henhelm where with grimaldi men can try to keep open road from diepenbeck ten minute later must hear by sudden outburst of fire that grimaldi be engaged sun have already set berwick be able to make out with glass that left be giving way before attack of eugene that twenty battalion under argyle have hitherto remained inactive be advancing by main road leading through mullen to plateau on stood day be lost berwick said bitterly troop at diepenbeck be completely cut off darkness alone can save from annihilation to think that if have not be for burgundy must have maintained here against double force of ally so long a system of giving command of army to royal incapables continues can not hope for success vendome lost time in issuing order troop still on plateau be brought forward whence fire must command approach aide de camp be sent in direction to order general of division to draw off at once to make way up to plateau berwick four aide de camp be told to make way if possible by different route to diepenbeck to give order for troop there to maintain at cost until darkness have completely fallen then to make way a best must to plateau if be impossible to march for ghent lille service be desperate one gentleman berwick said a turned to give order to officer be necessary for if force remain there until morning be irretrievably lost be getting dark already may therefore hope to pas unnoticed between interval of enemy if get there safely try to return at once like rest endeavour to make off during night without waiting for order mike followed master going down met remnant of biron division flying in disorder separated at bridge of mullen with word of adieu to comrade desmond turned to right rode for groenvelde suddenly volley of musketry be fired from hill to right desmond staggered for moment in saddle bridle fell from left hand mike be by side in moment where be hurt master in left wrist fancy by way hand hang down must have smashed bone however there be time to wait now be matter of life death to get to diepenbeck one moment honour let put hand into breast of coatee then if keep elbow tight against body will keep steady although mike carried out suggestion a gently a must desmond almost fainted with pain take drop of brandy from flask master wo take minute then will be off continued journey rattle of musketry ahead of showed that combat have already commenced close by between advancing troop of argyle who have crossed hill of royegham grimaldi brigade be probably endeavouring to hold in check until troop at diepenbeck came back be already too dark to distinguish uniform except at distance of few yard dashing on saw dark mass ahead three officer rode out who be sir shouted be carrying report from general replied in english without drawing rein dashed on passing within twenty yard of column reached diepenbeck without further interruption in centre of village french general be sitting on horse surrounded by staff combat beyond raged a furiously a before desmond rode up saluted be bearer of order from marshal vendome sir said bid tell that large force of enemy have crossed hill of oycke royegham be already in rear enemy right overlapping left while whole british reserve be pressing forward will ere long effect junction with force retreat therefore be entirely cut off order be that will maintain here a long a possible a in darkness confusion be unlikely that ally can attack from rear before morning marshal hold plateau will continue to do so be to make way tonight if possible in battalion in good order through interval between various division of enemy if be not possible singly be to endeavour to join on plateau who can not do be to make for ghent lille order scarcely come a surprise sir general said bitterly have heard firing in rear for time be afraid that thing have gone badly with after at once gave order that troop behind village be to take up position to resist attack made in direction desmond dismounted a did mike latter took two horse fastened to tree then with desmond scarf bound arm firmly against side have made mess of entirely honour said have got terrible bating sure be lucky in getting here faith thought be caught when be hailed be narrow escape mike if have waited till have got little nearer have seen uniform must have surrendered seems to that be like rat in trap mr kennedy something like mike be hard if ca get through in dark that will do sure enough mike said confidently way must go ca tell see be in strength in front marlborough eugene be on left partly behind troop saw come across hill be somewhere in rear if be daylight not man of must escape a be will be hard if can not make way through what be thinking about chiefly at present be safety of obeullivan o'neil d'eyncourt ought to have be here a soon a be may either have lost way in darkness fallen into hand of enemy however will not give up for half hour firing be now abating presently died away completely except for few scattered shot showing that ally have be halted where stood be no longer pressing forward hour passed desmond comrade be still absent in meantime general have called together colonel of several regiment have explained situation to repeated vendome order news came like thunderbolt upon for din of firing round village have completely deadened distant sound be wholly unaware of what be passing in other part of field must leave matter to individual discretion general said of who think men can be relied on can try to escape join marshal in body who have not confidence in regiment indeed of have be almost annihilated have best tell to scatter who remain here will assuredly be made prisoner in morning be possible that may be better plan for be better to surrender than to be cut to piece therefore leave matter entirely in hand will remain here have done that men can do in way of fighting a be told to hold place till last will remain at post desmond be present when conversation took place will wait hour mike said a rejoined follower may be sure that greater part of enemy troop will be asleep by time must have made tremendous march for news last night be that be twenty mile away have be fighting twelve hour after such work a that men will drop down to sleep a soon a have halted will go on horse on foot honour think best plan will be to lead horse mike across country must seem natural to do so once through must then gallop round join troop on plateau must say sir that if be to steal out to where have be fighting for last six hour might get couple of uniform to put over own will be lying thick enough there poor chap if have on might pas through troop might meet a speak english be good idea mike if can carry out sure can do without difficulty honour expect enemy have drawn back little so a to be in sort of order if be to fall upon in night know that men have be recalled will fasten horse to tree perhaps honour will keep eye on will stay with mike soldier at once made off village be now crowded with troop order be at end regiment be considerably mixed up officer went among saying that attempt be going to be made to pas through enemy join force on plateau pointed out that there be at least a much hope in being able to do so a in making off singly many of soldier not having suffered defeat responded to call several body four five hundred strong marched out into darkness majority however decided to shift for stole away in three four of remained broke into village wine beer shop drank to stupefaction while others exhausted by effort of day threw down slept mike be away hour have got officer cloak for helmet with feather think must have be staff officer who be killed while delivering order have got soldier overcoat shako for capital mike now think that can venture will go shortest way might very well lose ourselves among hill if be to try to make circuit having put dutch uniform over own set out taking way to left until came to main road by british reserve have advanced then mounted horse be use trying to make way through broken ground mike there be road go through huerne will strike must so get round on right of enemy even if come upon be not likely to excite suspicion a will be on road leading from oudenarde be noticing that road from height run into again near mullen enemy be not likely to have posted so near to river rode on through huerne village be full of wounded one paid attention again went on until suddenly be challenged with usual who come there staff officer with despatch desmond replied heard butt of soldier musket drop upon ground rode forward can tell man said a reached sentinel where duke of marlborough be to be found know sir man replied only regiment be here know there be number of cavalry away there on left heard someone say that duke be there there be crossroad hundred yard farther on will lead to thanking man desmond rode on few bivouac fire have be lighted be already beginning to burn low troop having dropped asleep almost a soon a halted hope will meet more of mike desmond said a went on at brisk trot sha' feel quite safe till get to mullen met however with further interruption a crossed bridge halted took off borrowed uniform threw away headgear put on own hat carried under cloak then rode on up hill after having first satisfied officer commanding strong guard placed at bridge that be friend ten minute be upon plateau desmond have difficulty in finding out where headquarters be established at hayse riding there at once went into house occupied by berwick reported return be glad to see back again kennedy duke said heartily be something to have recovered one friend from wreck now what be news desmond related what have happened to from time left said that large proportion of troop at diepenbeck have already left a heard outburst of firing hoped most of have got safely away see be wounded have have wrist smashed with musket ball fired by party on hill to right belonging suppose to force came up from oycke have narrow escape of life berwick said if have be hit little farther back ball must have gone through body sit down at once will send for surgeon instantly gave order for surgeon of staff to come to tent then made desmond who be suffering terribly from agony of wound drink tumbler of wine know be busy doctor duke said a surgeon entered must do something for mr kennedy who be badly wounded in arm surgeon examined wound shook head bone be fractured said be afraid that there be nothing for amputation then leave till tomorrow doctor desmond said faintly there must be number of poor fellow who want attention much more than do must do if must make cradle be badly off for surgical appliance must cut one out of one of jack boot capital idea mr kennedy nothing must be better will put in operation at once with of other patient mr kennedy be full of expedient doctor seems to that may be really valuable one cavalry men have jack boot will give order to requisition a many a may be required men can get new one from store at ghent surgeon at once cut off foot of one of desmond boot then divided leg longways there said taking up one of half must not wish for better cradle took out lint that have brought with together with flat splint bound hand in proper position then laid arm from elbow to finger in cradle round tightly put few bandage to keep in position now for scarf said with made sling to support arm whole operation did not take five minute now mr kennedy have best lie down get what sleep can will take other half of boot other boot also will be use without fellow will make three wounded men comparatively comfortable will send for more from trooper yes lie down at once kennedy berwick said be going to march off at daybreak marshal have arranged everything between ourselves have better try eat something if be only wing of chicken few mouthful of meat faintness must be due a much to hunger a to wound for have be at work since early morning can not have have time to eat anything be indeed case desmond managed to swallow few mouthful then lay down upon sofa where in spite of pain of wound presently dozed off being utterly worn out with work excitement of day before morning five thousand of troop from diepenbeck have marched into camp in good order with arm a soon a be daylight whole force started for ghent with deep regret desmond have learned from marshal before lying down none of comrade have returned a have not reached diepenbeck felt sure that be either killed prisoner d'eyncourt will of course be treated a prisoner of war if identity of obeullivan o'neil be proved with officer of name who escaped from newgate be likely to go hard with after repulsing cavalry sent in pursuit army marched away unmolested being joined a went by large number of fugitive who have made way through allied line in small party marlborough army remained on ground have won collecting caring for wounded of army two day later berwick corp joined vendome that of eugene marched into marlborough camp in spite of loss that have suffered at oudenarde reinforcement raised vendome army to over one hundred ten thousand men be about same force a marlborough have under command after eugene have joined standing a did between vendome army paris marlborough proposed that enemy fortress must be neglected that army must march directly on paris movement might have be attended with success be of so daring description even eugene opposed while commander of dutch dane prussian be unanimously against consequently decided to lay siege to lille tremendous undertaking for lille be considered strongest fortress in france vendome with over hundred thousand men be within couple of day march of disposition be made with extreme care tremendous convoy of heavy artillery ammunition provision be brought up from ostend without french being able to interfere with progress marlborough with british contingent hanoverian be to cover operation of siege be to be undertaken by prince eugene with rest of allied army vendome marched at once with army

necessary a be on road for voice to be raised in evening however after partaking of supper desmond without being asked related incident so far a knew of battle of oudenarde of manner in received wound whole disaster be due entirely to duke of burgundy rather to king who placed in command over two general of highest skill reputation if have wanted to accompany army burgundy must have done so just a king james did merely a volunteer be told that king showed great courage in battle for part think presence be altogether mistake claim that english be subject yet take part with foreign army in battle against being present will certainly not add to popularity in england agree with de la vallee said must have be much wiser for to have abstained altogether from interference in matter be of course different thing when attempted to land in scotland then must have be leading loyal portion of subject against whom considers rebel against authority be quite different thing from acting without cause reason a volunteer in french army against whom regard a countryman subject be afraid desmond that though may shock to think so stuart prince of yours be not wise men legitimate monarch of england though may be posse quality endear king to people from what have heard james be heavy pedant rank coward essentially not man to be popular among spirited people charles have noble presence many fine quality although idea of kingly power must have suited well enough in france arbitrary measure alienated large proportion of people brought ruin upon second charles in spite of numerous indiscretion be not unpopular because people be wearied of stern repression of puritan rule be therefore disposed to look leniently upon frailty while appreciated good temper wit fatal mistake be allying so closely with grievous mistake indeed when remember that for century two nation have be bitterly opposed to other a for brother forfeited throne by leaning towards catholic church in whose communion died decidedly stuart king be not success a to james third a call know nothing beyond fact that be protege of king of france have now fought against own people blunder a seems to of worst kind one be certain to alienate many of supporter on other side of water be to mount throne must be partly due to aid of french troop french money men money mind of power at war with england must therefore necessarily like charles second be regarded a protege of france must be bound in gratitude to louis position of england must be altogether changed must become ally of spain france ancient enemy opponent of present ally holland austria protestant germany denmark desmond be silent must not agree with what friend said have considered that be most unwise step for james to appear in field fighting against countryman think be strong enough to argue philip said with smile after long pause mean to give victory when be fighting under disadvantage stuart certainly never did special benefit to ireland assuredly brought ruin misery upon at present moment seem able to explain why must be so devoted to cause of scottish stuart rather than to of anne who be after of same family race however will fight out when brain be not so dull a be at present slept next night at pontoise having made somewhat short journey though desmond protested that felt quite equal to going on to paris be good deal better today desmond there be hurry will take matter quietly if continue to make improvement will be able in day two to travel faster hope that before get to end of journey will be strong enough to sit horse for few mile day made stay in paris proceeded on way morning after arrival melun montargis be next halting place desmond be gaining strength rapidly good spirit be returning at evening halt have be able to recite history of escape from england wound have le angry appearance on day of leaving montargis horse at request occasionally broke into trot for mile two be looking paler think motion be too much for philip said after one of occasion when again settled down to walking pace feel bit tired philip one must make beginning will never get strong unless begin to use muscle at present acknowledge feel a if have be beaten over with stick have doubt that will shake off after bit be indeed case on last three day of journey to pointdexter sat horse for two three hour philip have on last day sent on one of men to inform baron that must arrive that evening with desmond a be seen approaching baron daughter came out from chateau welcomed a alighted upset young fellow by appearing shocked at appearance former have said to anne be certainly blow morning to hear that have lost left hand that greater portion of journey have have to be performed in litter so must expect to find greatly pulled down see be breaking into trot so have evidently gained strength on way in spite of warning girl eye filled with tear a saw desmond thin face wasted figure left arm in sling welcome to pointdexter monsieur kennedy many have entered here since old chateau be built none who have rendered such vital service to race try to speak see that be shaken with journey will soon put that right have be rather longer journey than have previously made desmond said after dismounting shaking hand with baron daughter rode somewhat faster than usual a be of anxious to be here be good indeed of philip to make such journey to find bring to if have not done so assuredly must foot be so bad with villainous gout must not put in stirrup must have have out family coach have mind to do so a be anne be most anxious to try power of nursing philip overruled said that must be with week earlier than must reach in coach moreover be sure journey in open horse litter must be far better for than being jolted in close carriage so a usual have own way though must say that for once anne rebelled strongly against authority be very good baron desmond said indeed think that philip be right can assure that journey have done immense deal of good will tell that be very different now from what be when found at amiens for have begun to think must never get away alive let stay talking here baron said anne have have soup prepared for under own eye glass two of good burgundy will do wonder for desmond indeed be greatly revived be able to join in cheerful conversation with host be dying to hear adventure baron said how managed to escape from jail in england a did also how be that met with dreadful disaster at oudenarde really seems that terrible fellow marlborough prince eugene be invincible be good general baron beyond trouble with commander of force of ally be able to carry out own plan duke of vendome berwick be also able commander be hampered by presence of duke of burgundy who on several occasion overruled opinion ruined plan be to alone that defeat at oudenarde be due french soldier fought a well a ever be position in be placed not superior fighting power of enemy caused defeat how be baron asked that with a hear one hundred ten thousand men vendome doe not raise siege of lille seems incredible that with so great force must remain inactive while enemy be carrying out work for siege can not tell sir heard sort of rumour at amiens seems that marlborough have taken up strong position entrenched there with seventy thousand men while eugene be conducting siege operation understand baron said irritably there must be more way of marching to lille than one if one road be barred why not advance by duke of burgundy be not with army now so blame can not be put on sir berwick army be still a hear under independent command duke excellent soldier a be be not one to be easily led if opinion differs from of vendome must assuredly maintain a manner be not conciliatory opinion be very strongly expressed may well be that there be a be rumoured at amiens constant dissension between vendome well seems to very strange monsieur kennedy after having during last reign defeated best infantry of spain humbled austria subdued bavaria crushed enemy in italy shown ourselves to be best soldier in europe that must now suffer defeat after defeat by army containing men of score of nationality though led by greatest general england have ever produced baron with english troop under who have for hundred of year shown invincible yes baron said hastily know about crecy poitier agincourt how well fought in holland thought kennedy that be enemy of english be here with brave countryman to fight against not in case assuredly baron came over here because there be opening for irish gentleman at home because only by aid of france must lawful king be placed on throne be true that section of english people under oliver cromwell not only conquered divided great portion of land among although be again defeated by usurping dutch king with dutch troop under command be reason why must feel animosity to people at large whose quality admire majority of whom be in heart attached to cause of stuart hate who be keeping king from throne own must rather that have fallen to lot to fight for france against spaniard german italian than against english did lose many friend at oudenarde monsieur kennedy anne asked lost two greatest friend desmond said at least fear that be dead be two who escaped with from english prison with monsieur d'eyncourt of berwick aide de camp started with to carry order to troop who be surrounded by enemy went by different road to increase chance of one of getting there succeeded with comparatively trifling wound pointed to empty sleeve none of other three got through did name appear when list be exchanged of prisoner captured therefore have doubt that fell in performance of duty have be great friend ever since came out loss have greatly affected be young will find fresh friend baron said briskly let dwell on past have now to apply energy to getting strong if show a much vigour in a in other matter hope that in month time will be well on road towards complete recovery mean to try hard baron desmond said with smile if continue to gain strength a quickly a have done during journey will certainly insist before long on being considered convalescent day by day indeed strength increased at first wandered about in park accompanied by philip anne for baron although somewhat recovered from attack of gout still walked with difficulty in week again took to horse exercise be ere long able to join in hunting hawking party house be gay for baron a soon a desmond be able to take share in conversation invited many of neighbouring gentry to chateau introduced to a man who have done so much for daughter several entertainment be given at chateau be thrown open to comer in partly of desmond partly of approaching marriage of baron daughter to monsieur de la vallee have be arranged to take place in september before time arrived desmond have completely recovered strength being now fit for service be anxious to join friend must not hear of departure until after marriage a news came that lille have be captured by ally be certain that army must soon go into winter quarter must fight no more that year allowed to be persuaded to stay siege have be one of most terrible in history place be nobly defended conquest cost ally dearly twelve thousand being killed wounded over seven thousand succumbing to disease while of garrison nearly seventeen thousand strong four thousand five hundred remained alive at time capitulated fall caused general consternation throughout france for opened road to paris during winter louis made strenuous effort to obtain peace term demanded by ally be so onerous that negotiation be broken off in spite of general distress throughout country wedding be gay one desmond have written to duke of berwick who be now in paris saying that be fit for duty must report at end of month on day before be about to leave pointdexter received reply from ran a follows dear monsieur kennedy be heartily glad to hear of restoration to health mentioned to majesty today who be pleased to speak very highly of campaign be virtually at end for present year majesty have informed that various change will be made in spring marshal de villars be to replace duke of vendome in command of northern army latter have be unfortunate misfortune on part of soldier be regarded a next door to crime certainly defeat at oudenarde be not fault have taken advice lille might have be saved doubtless be a much dissatisfied with a be with perhaps with reason for a know be not accustomed to mince phrase however a majesty be pleased to say be evident that having two general acting together with independent command be mistake one must not be again committed therefore next spring be to take command of army in dauphiny to check austrian italian said if can spare duke must be glad if must let have young irishman for time will promote to rank of captain for great service rendered in carrying a say at grievous risk with loss of hand order to troop at diepenbeck to scatter during night thus saving at least ten thousand of soldier will also settle upon pension of fifty louis year for loss of hand will send to spain having have several complaint from duke of orleans who a know be now in command there of incompetence of many of staff said that although have found most zealous useful officer have warm regard for must of course accede to majesty wish in matter enclosed in letter be order for to join duke of orleans private letter from to duke giving sketch of service exploit will doubtless give at once place in favour think that war will last very much longer france be well nigh ruined by sacrifice have made drain upon ally must be almost a great therefore trust campaign will bring to end if not may be assured that when duke no longer requires service be probable that after year campaigning will be heartily tired with difficulty a did will meet with from procrastination general stupidity of spanish will be free to return to will be glad to number again among member of staff desmond be sorry to leave service of duke consoled with hope that must be only temporary prospect of year campaigning in new country be by mean displeasing to therefore after writing suitable letter to duke took leave of baron pointdexter with many thanks for kindness attended by mike started for spain be glad be to be on move again captain kennedy soldier said a rode away sure honour idleness be not good for man especially when have lashing of best of food drink when came to buckle on sword belt morning found must not meet within three inch coatee be so tight feel a if be suffocated will soon work down again mike from what hear of spain there be fear of getting too much food there rough work small ration be rule be ready for good spell then honour hardly know now for be flabby short of wind still be sorry to leave chateau for have have best time ever have in life everyone be mighty kind seemed to think have done great thing in helping to rescue miss anne whereas did nothing at except to follow chapter mission on arriving at madrid in first week in december desmond after putting up at hotel changing uniform in travelled for dress suit proceeded to headquarters of duke of orleans sent in name together with berwick letter of introduction in few minute be shown into room duke looked at in surprise be captain kennedy be royal highness duke of berwick have very strongly recommended to saying that have performed excellent service under that parted with with regret at express wish of majesty speaks of a young officer be hardly prepared to see one so youthful say that be devoted to work active intelligent a well a brave a such arrival be very welcome to for although excellent in battle own that officer be le devoted to hard work detail be a necessary a bravery on general staff by way seem to have heard name before let see be in connection be not with affair of marquis de tulle baron de pointdexter daughter certainly have good fortune to take part in affair sir king be pleased to tell detail of adventure to speak very highly of courage energy in carrying out so be really hero of affair said that be young ensign in o'brien irish regiment have risen rapidly sir for be eighteen month since took place majesty graciously promoted to rank of lieutenant when be appointed by duke of berwick to staff obtained next step after battle of oudenarde for carrying despatch to force cut off in village of diepenbeck in service received wound resulted in loss of left hand be several week in hospital then obtained sick leave went down for two month to baron de pointdexter visit resulted in complete restoration to health at end of time duke of berwick who have also returned from army be good enough to recommend to majesty thereupon promoted appointed to join staff if marshal berwick spoke approvingly of conduct captain kennedy be in sufficient recommendation for duke be not easily satisfied be sure that will find valuable acquisition to staff duke invited desmond to dine with that evening presented to several of staff who be among company be for most part personal friend associate of duke gallant gentleman wholly ignorant of war adverse to hard work be not long before desmond found that service be called into requisition whenever be necessary that despatch must be carried to distance be by mean sorry that must be case for soon tired of stiffness ceremony of spanish court of conversation chiefly relating to lady in paris whose very name be unknown to among french officer be relief to indeed when must get away from attendance at headquarters enjoy evening talk with officer of one other of four irish regiment there many of expedition be attended by considerable danger for war have for year devastated country have resulted in general disorder armed band under pretence of acting in interest of one claimant other to throne traversed country pillaging village driving off flock herd to mountain ruthlessly slaying who ventured to offer smallest opposition catalonia valencia have be scene of greater portion of conflict between rival claimant throughout rest of country population looked on apathetically at struggle for mastery caring little of two foreign prince reigned over in out of way district wilder spirit left home in number enticed by prospect of plunder under leading of one other of partisan chief desmond have from moment of arrival spent greater portion of spare time in study of spanish aided much by knowledge of french have made rapid progress in three month be able to converse fairly in be indeed essential for work a without must not have made way about safely delivered order of be bearer in beginning of march duke sent for have be greatly pleased captain kennedy with activity that have displayed be going to make further call upon mission be of greater importance than on have hitherto be engaged be one ordinarily must be entrusted to officer of higher rank feel can not do better than place in hand from what learn believe that be intention of enemy to commence campaign by crossing frontier near badajos by so doing can either follow valley of guadiana to source of river then come down into valencia must cross sierra come down into valley of tagus march on madrid in first place wish report a to state of fortification of badajos efficiency of garrison be of course acquainted with official report sent by spanish commander of town to government have come to place faith whatever in spanish report for most part be tissue of falsehood first duty then will be to give a complete report a possible of state of thing there of impression of capacity of governor a shown by preparation also of morale of troop in next place will be glad of information can gather of country beyond frontier state of road in neighbourhood here again native report be absolutely untrustworthy line of enemy advance must be direct from lisbon through vicosa up tagus offer great facility for carriage down through portalegre alvas during past four year there have be good deal of fighting near frontier report of officer commanding spanish force there be devoid of practical information a to road on side of boundary a have be resolved to give enemy battle a soon a cross frontier be most important must know best line by troop can move state of bridge position in battle on large scale can best be fought see mission be important one selected for a proof of confidence feel in ability while carrying out duty will have temporary rank of major a will le ruffle susceptibility of spaniard if officer of rank be employed than if captain be sent to institute such enquiry will of course be provided with letter to governor of badajos couched in such term that will not consider mission have reference to object being to discover whether magazine at badajos be sufficiently well supplied to admit of being if necessary drawn upon for subsistence of army also whether garrison need strengthening in case enemy must lay siege to town before army be at hand to give battle thus will ostensibly confine enquiry to amount of provision ammunition consult governor a to whether considers force at disposal sufficient for defence of fortress against vigorous attack fortunately spanish method be so slow that before get particular will have ample time to ascertain point a to be chiefly concerned will be furnished with native guide well acquainted with pass of sierra between tagus guadiana part of journey will not be unattended with danger for mountain swarm with band of partisan be to say bandit will however give order to officer in command of garrison at toledo to furnish with escort of ten trooper under officer to conduct across mountain four of will accompany to badajos remain with until return to toledo once in valley of guadiana must have little chance of falling in with band of guerrilla escort will add to weight importance in eye of spaniard feel greatly honoured royal highness by selecting for mission will carry out to best of ability in hour paper will be ready for can start at daybreak tomorrow be going on long trip time mike back to france honour be going to western frontier by badajos make difference to sir where be going in truth will be glad to go anywhere for be mightily sick of town where people have great love for french best part of seem to look down upon soldier a if be dirt under foot be unsafe to go through street alone at night score of men have since came here be found lying dead with knife between rib yes population here be very much divided mike even who be favourable to philip have love for foreign soldier whose bayonet keep on throne duke have many time made formal complaint to king city authority philip have given strict order for arrest of bad character city civil authority protest that can not lay hand upon believe have never taken slightest trouble to do so how long will be away honour must say month be to have temporary rank a major while engaged on business anyone under grade must receive little courtesy from spaniard be mighty haughty lot mike grumbled believe think that when flood came spanish grandee have ark to a must not be expected to put up with conveyance full of animal desmond laughed have yet taken in fact that spain be no longer great power be when be mistress of half of europe be fine fighter then mike for part own can not understand how be have fallen off in respect for certainly without troop must make poor stand against portuguese backed up by english dutch have not seen fighting yet sir to mind people so fond of using knife be not likely to be of much account when come to manly straightforward fighting well honour if be to go a major will need slight alteration in uniform more gold lace such like so have best see about at once did not think of mike be right know whether a only hold temporary rank have right to wear uniform of field officer a duke wish to be able to speak with authority there can be harm in making change addition can easily be taken off upon return duke ought to have given full rank instead of temporary one sir have done more work since came here than colonel major on staff a far a work go may be so mike a work consisted in carrying despatch about on horseback certainly affords claim for promotion indeed have wish whatever for be already youngest captain in service except young noble who got commission a colonel without even serving day in inferior rank feel uncomfortable now when go to regiment to see men who have be year in service gone through many desperate action still lieutenant while after two year service still under nineteen be captain yes sir know that saved eight ten thousand men to france at oudenarde lost hand in service of country must count for great deal count for something doubt mike many of officer have risked life score of time be wounded frequently though may not have lost limb ah well sir mike said philosophically luck be everything who must go soldiering if be not so when going into battle everyone know that lot of comrade will be killed trust to luck to get through safely one man get promoted doe hope that luck will come way next time say that honour promotion have be luck have have luck in being on staff of duke of berwick everyone know that be staff officer who get credit promotion while men who do most of fighting get passed over there must be nothing to say against if a in honour case man be chosen for staff because have done something showed that be fit for be so here if man belongs to good family have interest get good appointment be mighty seldom that man be taken from regiment put on to staff because have done something showed be good soldier be so mike there be denying believe be one reason why so many disaster have befallen french army general be a rule good soldier be excellent staff be generally altogether incompetent seem to consider that fact that be noble render unnecessary for to give attention to detail to be more than ornamental figure in general train when see authority of vendome overruled by young prince who be grandson of king nothing else one must not be surprised that be same through army that evening desmond received packet containing appointment a major while on special service detail of instruction a to point to be attended to letter from duke to commandant of garrison at toledo from philip to governor at next morning started at daybreak accompanied by mike arrived that evening at toledo here presented letter to commandant very well sir officer said when have read at what hour do wish escort guide to be ready in morning must like to start a early a possible colonel being well mounted might cross sierra in day trooper horse must not do that must not gain anything if must major kennedy for even if horse must carry over sixty seventy mile of mountain road in day must certainly need couple of day rest before proceeding farther if get a far a enmedio be in heart of sierra will have done well will then have long day ride down to ciudad real from place officer with six of trooper will return general say nothing about noncommissioned officer will take upon to send one to accompany with four men will take good deal of trouble off hand be much obliged to colonel now that have finished business officer said can talk of other thing will of course put up here have two three spare room accommodation at inn be wretched be always very glad when officer ride through because hear little enough about what be passing a there be sort of sociability among spaniard life be very dull here one be very glad of change thank colonel will gladly accept invitation colonel rang bell ordered servitor who answered to show major kennedy servant where to put up master horse own to bring up officer valise to make soldier comfortable below will sup in hour said to desmond when man have left two of major be going to share meal a soon a valise be brought up desmond changed uniform got rid of dust of road be just ready when servant knocked at door said that supper be served meal be pleasant one three french officer be anxious to hear last news have reached madrid from france conversation did not flag for moment during meal after be over cigar be lighted for officer have adopted custom of country colonel said courteously must mind telling major kennedy how be that who by name be irish although speak excellent french have made way so rapidly a to be already major not at colonel be a much surprised at a may be really present rank be only temporary be going down to badajos on special mission for duke of orleans a thought must be received better be field officer instead of captain have given temporary rank of major while so employed will briefly tell how obtained other step first be given by king on appointment a aide de camp to duke of berwick majesty being good enough to take interest in owing to little adventure in have become involved concerned may say almost accidental rescue of lady who have be carried off by nobleman of court remember now colonel said lady be mademoiselle de pointdexter abductor vicomte de tulle happened month so before regiment left paris for spain be chief topic of talk recall name now in connection with affair how warmly everyone spoke of gallantry well major how did gain next step have good fortune to be only one who survived of four aide de camp who be sent off by duke of berwick at oudenarde to make way through allied line with order to division cut off from rest of army in village of diepenbeck to disperse make off across country a best must comrade be killed be lucky enough to succeed in reaching village uninjured with exception of ball in wrist caused loss of hand may say almost of life be because of favourable report duke be pleased to make of service received rank a captain be well earned too sir colonel said warmly confess thought when arrived that although irish by name must have have very powerful influence at back to have risen so early unhappily promotion often bear relation to merit one see young noble with other recommendation than of birth placed over head of officer of five twenty year service one be jealous of man who owes rise to brilliant deed of courage signal ability be galling to see young popinjay thrust forward simply by family influence in passing over hill next day large party of armed men made appearance suddenly on height above seeing that attack be likely to meet with stout resistance a little booty must be obtainable did not interfere with passage desmond congratulated on having escort for must have gone hard with have be accompanied only by mike on fifth day after leaving madrid arrived at badajos with sergeant four trooper mike after formality for town being close to frontier be liable at moment to be suddenly attacked desmond be conducted to governor pompous spanish officer be major kennedy asked looking with surprise at young visitor name be kennedy sir have honour of being major to serve on staff of grace duke of orleans be bearer of letter to from majesty king philip spaniard took letter read desmond must see by expression of countenance that be by mean pleased understand said coldly why officer must have be specially despatched to obtain information have already duly furnished understood from duke of orleans sir that a news have be received that enemy plan be to cross frontier near town became matter of special importance to see that be sufficiently supplied with provision munition of war to stand siege have be found more than once that owing to culpable neglect of subordinate fortress when besieged be by mean so well supplied with provision powder shot a have be supposed naturally governor of fortress like with considerable garrison be too much occupied to personally superintend matter must leave in hand of subordinate who on part commit to of sergeant storekeeper so that while everything be reported to be ready there be really deficiency waste often take place in distribution of store matter be so important that king requested duke to send one of staff to give assistance to receive suggestion will be complied with to full extent a last report be sent in three month back necessarily considerable change have taken place in time well sir will obey majesty order give facility officer will be instructed to open such magazine a may select will be then able personally to judge a to quantity condition of store will of course be impossible unless with immense expenditure of labour to go through whole of magazine to reckon up content a many a wish will be opened party of soldier told off to count bale case very few will suffice sir of course in event of battle being fought reverse occurring enemy might sit down before town must be exposed to long siege for might be time before army be again in position to advance fight battle raise siege have little doubt that everything will be found in excellent order must there be deficiency duke assured that must be at once made good if will call tomorrow morning sir governor said will have of official in whose charge matter be placed at disposal be convinced that will find that report on store ammunition in hand be fully borne out governor be a expected good deal put out mike desmond said a rejoined follower who be waiting outside with horse now let find out best hotel did ask to stay with honour mike asked in surprise no be much too grand man for besides may have wife child with however much spaniard may place house within at service be very seldom that invite stranger to enter moreover glad a may be to have french help in fighting battle look with suspicion dislike upon individual frenchman besides fancy will find that store magazine by mean tally with report sent in by governor heard duke of berwick one day speaking about said there be corruption dishonesty among official from highest to lowest be probable that king duke of orleans have same opinion that be for reason that sent here in order to assure that fortress be a well supplied a have be stated with other paper have received copy of governor report although did not think necessary to tell so next morning on going to governor desmond found number of official assembled there be officer in charge of store magazine governor said colonel mendez will accompany will see that everything be done to facilitate examination governor bowed formally desmond returned salute then went down with spanish colonel other official following saw that there be expression of malicious pleasure in colonel face guessed that be by mean sorry at investigation be to take place think sir desmond said that will not be necessary for to have official going round with will be impossible in one day to do more than examine one department a ammunition be most important of store must suggest that take only in charge of war material very good turning to behind said for today save officer in charge of magazine can be relieved from duty turn will come tomorrow next day with exception of five six moved away have three magazine in town colonel went on so a to lessen chance of resource being destroyed by single blow there be central magazine be known a san juan magazine western magazine may a well visit central one first a doubt be most important one a went on party of twenty soldier who have be drawn up there fell in behind while mike two trooper of escort also at order accompanied magazine be formed in what have formerly be old castle be now used for purpose that of store thick wall affording protection against very heavy missile on entering what have be courtyard desmond saw that greater portion of be occupied by storehouse massively built covered by five six foot of earth first of on right contains musketry ammunition colonel mendez said next two contain cannonball powder be stored in three house at farther end three on left side contain hand grenade fuse for mine signal rocket other miscellany such a brimstone will examine number one first desmond said be officer in charge one of official stepped forward with key desmond saw that face be pale that have sullen look will ask before enter said how often do take stock of store suppose when governor sends in half yearly report do way at man said have book be given to by officer succeeded here be will see that handed over so many barrel of cartridge on one side of page put down number of barrel issued on other number receive thus at time without disturbing content of store can state number of barrel contains then how long have held position sir have be in charge of store of used for powder in cellar underneath castle for ten year man whom succeeded how long have be here believe have be here for twenty year more system of keeping account be same a yours precisely handed book to have kept mine in same way then be fact if understand rightly that there have be taking of stock for past thirty year be not necessary officer said in surly tone there can be mistake possible considering way in made entry now entered store be sixty foot long forty foot wide with pillar of masonry along centre to support weight of roof be lighted only by small loophole in thick wall four of soldier carried lantern be about to enter when desmond said there be loose powder lying about suppose none officer replied barrel be carefully examined before being taken into store be a can see strongly made leakage be out of question unless by accident one must fall off pile burst thing have never happened a far a know see by book that there must be three thousand four hundred eighty two barrel containing five hundred cartridge certainly ample supply even for prolonged siege barrel be piled in four tier one above forming wall on side of central path seven foot wide give hand mike desmond said to follower standing upon be able to scramble on to top twelve barrel deep said a descended now let count number in line wall of barrel extended only two third of length of store there be thirty barrel in line made rapid calculation be three thousand two hundred see that in addition there be small pile on side beyond others must about make up correct total record be strictly accurate official took up lantern a if matter be now finished desmond said sir have begun instruction be to see how much musket ammunition there be here at present only know how many barrel there be now colonel will ask to call men in set to work wish two passage made through of pile of barrel three foot wide will be sufficient must be very dangerous to move official said hastily not if be carefully done tell barrel be strong that there be leakage even if must not be case there be little fear of powder coming in contact with candle in lantern besides a powder be in cartridge must not leak out even if one of barrel be to burst soldier have set to work at four point chosen at hazard by desmond barrel a be taken down be ranged along on side of central path when three line have be cleared out one of soldier gave exclamation be lighter than one carried out last said carry out into courtyard desmond said must like to look at content be taken out to courtyard one end carefully taken out see colonel desmond said a looked at content must have be reduced to great strait long before expected colonel who belonged to artillery looked into barrel be full of earth empty out desmond ordered did so there be not single cartridge in be scandalous colonel exclaimed did not expect that everything must be found right have idea of such villainy a turned to men arrest commissary at once said that official be nowhere to be found have slipped away a soon a men began to take down barrel soldier be at once sent off in search of will continue work desmond said see how extensively fraud have be carried on same result be met with in of opening first three line consisted of barrel filled with cartridge seven line behind contained nothing earth see colonel instead of having over three thousand two hundred barrel of cartridge have le than thousand be almost beyond belief be clear that fellow probably man who be in charge before have be in collusion with contractor for cartridge allowed to send in seven barrel of earth for three of cartridge doubt calculated that there be little chance of fraud being detected never indeed until there be prolonged siege for must naturally serve out barrel from front row a be required filling place with fresh one a supply came in other storehouse be now examined number of cannonball alone tallied with account there be large deficiency in store of powder indeed among almost other munition be infinitely worse than thought colonel said fear that storekeeper be not only people concerned in fraud now colonel if mind must like to go to one of provision store at once possibly after what have discovered pretext to stop further examination may be invented if wait till tomorrow great a have be fraud in magazine in supply of provision be even greater there be deficiency of many hundred of sack of flour bean meat store be entirely empty although must have contained large number of tierce of salted beef be matter of minor importance for in case of approach of enemy people of country round must drive cattle into town indeed allowance of meat to spanish soldier be so small that must do well without existing entirely upon bread fried bean of wine there be scarce amount indicated great number of barrel have be filled only with water be late in afternoon when work ceased must require fortnight desmond said to get accurate figure however be comparatively unimportant be quite sufficient to know that in case be there amount of ammunition of provision given in governor last report that fraud on large scale have be carried on can not think that men at least of higher rank than storekeeper must have be privy to affair there have certainly be something wrong in supply of clothes major kennedy men have have new one served out to for past year half although have made repeated application during past two month yes noticed when walked about in town yesterday that many of troop be almost in rag have doubt there have be fraud in clothing department a well a in others well sir a spaniard lament terrible exposure blame however must not be laid entirely upon military supply of provision of kind of cloth for clothing indeed of everything gun ammunition be in hand of junta of province of civil authority here many of member must be concerned in matter have doubt that official here be heavily bribed to shut eye to arrange matter so that fraud may escape attention know once when proposed to governor to examine of barrel of cartridge a came in answered very sharply told that business be to work gun not to meddle with duty of storekeeper then do think colonel think nothing officer replied governor be governor be not for to discus conduct in way even to admit possibility of knowing of affair only two three of storekeeper have be arrested rest have slunk away a soon a saw how matter be going chapter treachery at moment officer came down said that governor wished to see colonel mendez major kennedy at once a entered room saw governor walking up down in state of great agitation hear colonel mendez said stopping before officer that have on own authority placed several of commissariat storekeeper under arrest what doe mean sir mean sir that major kennedy have discovered enormous deficiency in store there can be little doubt that number of person must have be concerned in matter besides in charge of storehouse wholesale bribery must have be practised by who supplied good to whose duty be to receive will order commission of enquiry to sit at once beg that colonel mendez will send in detailed report of matter be need hardly say one of extreme gravity be right colonel mendez said a left governor house suspected that something be wrong ever since refused to allow access to magazine have doubt that have be acting in collusion with contractor though may not have be aware of extent of rascality for subordinate may not only have accepted bribe from contractor to carry out fraud to governor may have consented may also have taken money from to allow of still greater one to be perpetrated what will do do think colonel will endeavour by mean in power to prevent word of discovery from leaking out if may advise must say must be well that must take precaution for own safety position be desperate one for one can not doubt that report will be followed by removal from post dismissal from army confiscation of everything of be possessed therefore be almost matter of life death to to prevent report from being sent to headquarters to have removed altogether done fact might not leak out must be supposed at madrid that have be stabbed by street ruffian although officer might be sent down to report be by mean likely that must go so rigorously into matter a did must be contented merely to count barrel bale without troubling to investigate content evidence must be a strong against a mine yes evidence be not yet given can in first place have doubt will suppress report to in second place must consider unlikely must venture to make matter public for have powerful friend at court be connected with many of leading family in province might rely upon being able to hush matter up so long a be known only to head of army who be not unaware that although pay of commander of fortress be not more than sufficient to maintain position like most other of official generally retire with considerable fortune therefore interference on part must be more disastrous to prospect than to be humiliating to say so major kennedy civil military system be rotten to core there be of course honest men in service a rule corruption be almost universal still although can not fear a must fear be possible may endeavour to make safe by removing also from path for time will take good care to remain in own barrack a much a possible will be careful also desmond said thank much for warning be needed for must never have struck that must even attempt to suppress information have gained see that will be necessary to be very careful especially in manner of sending off report if be in place must mount horse at once with trooper of escort ride straight for madrid can not do colonel for examination into state of store here be only part of instruction must if possible carry out to letter before leaving for madrid might however send off despatch by two of trooper with think may take word for major that must never reach destination even while be speaking messenger may be sent off to one of band in mountain to two three of contractor who be of course a deeply involved a governor for there be doubt of guilt while proof can be given to being party to telling that be matter of life death to to prevent messenger from reaching lookout be certainly far from comfortable desmond admitted must tonight think over in way decide upon what course have best pursue when reached hotel told mike what colonel mendez have said by power honour be nasty scrape that seem to be in almost a bad a when be shut up in prison in london worse mike for then knew that must be tried hoped that louis must interfere in favour by threatening reprisal obtain liberty whereas here have only ourselves to depend upon blow may come at moment well at rate honour will see that none get at unbeknown will lie down in room against door if sergeant place man on guard outside be hard if anyone get at hardly think precaution necessary there be saying what man might not do in so desperate situation so will tell sergeant to place sentry at door to relieve two hour will think matter over by tomorrow morning will decide whether have best remain here complete work ride at once to madrid at about two o'clock in morning desmond who have just dropped off to sleep be aroused by hearing sentry outside door challenge there be answer remained quiet mike leapt to foot opened door what be asked sentry saw two three men at end of corridor be too dark to make out clearly be coming way levelled carbine cried 'who come there ' at once stole away must have be after good for step be noiseless must have come up without boot keep sharp lookout sentry desmond said see that steal up to for if do may be stabbed before have time to turn round be lucky that carried out suggestion mike posted sentry at door of course men sentry saw may not have be coming here at rate conduct be suspicious in few minute desmond be again asleep have have long day work believing that affair be over at least for night did not even try to keep awake a soon a mike heard by breathing that be asleep got up noiselessly seated near open window with loaded pistol hour passed then heard slight stir in street did not look out grasped pistol tightly room be on first floor presently heard grating sound against window be very dark knelt down so that must be able to make out figure showed above windowsill thought first of rousing master a have pistol in belt sword leaned against wall ready to hand thought better to let matter take course have heard no further sound presently round object appeared in sight stretching out arm fired without moment hesitation there be sound of heavy fall below followed by muttered exclamation in moment desmond be on foot pistol have laid by pillow in grasp what be mike be only gentleman who have fancy for looking in at window honour have doubt must have come in without saying by leave if have not cut matter short by putting bullet into forehead have friend down below came up on ladder looked out of window be taking down now honour will give shot mike let go lesson have be good enough sentry have also run into room on hearing shot be over desmond said seeing that prevented from getting in at door tried window mike have shot one of there be sound of foot loud talking in passage a desmond went out landlord two of serving men several of staying at hotel ran up what be senor heard shot yes fellow tried to enter window by mean of ladder fortunately man heard shot before came in doubt be prowling marauder who seeing window open thought that there be chance of plunder carrambo landlord exclaimed then will have enquiry sort of trouble think will desmond said quietly fancy have friend down below will probably carry body ladder away if hold tongue nothing more will be heard of mike do sentry take lantern go down see landlord looked out of window a far a can see everything be quiet there said be sure that servant be not dreaming that will soon ascertain if go down with desmond said fancy that will find trace of affair there landlord followed by two servant went down with soldier then lighting lantern handing to went out keeping carefully behind there mike said when stopped under desmond window doe that look like dream pointed to patch of blood on pavement be true enough landlord said pedro lopez fetch pail of water broom get rid of blood otherwise will be having enquiry made in morning mike returned to master at whose door sergeant other trooper be standing there be occasion sergeant desmond have just said to keep sentry at door longer can be quite sure that will not be disturbed again before morning indeed be not likely to sleep after very well sir if mind will keep sentry on watch just a like sergeant feel sure there be occasion for still after what have happened may perhaps be wise to do so well mike desmond said when be again alone campaign have opened with spirit be something like journey with baron de pointdexter when expected to be attacked minute well got through that right honour be hard if get through at six o'clock volley of musketry be fired be practising early sir mike said ca be that mike be too close must go beyond outer work to practise by sound be certainly much nearer than though possibly just outside wall will go out enquire honour when one be at war be a well to know exactly what enemy be doing take one of trooper with mike pierre speaks spanish well mike returned in hour have shot prisoner took yesterday said hear held sort of court martial in evening at governor did not sit more than ten minute be found guilty of fraud treachery be shot morning worse worse mike evidently governor be determined to get rid of whose evidence might throw light on matter after what have happened here summary execution feel very uncomfortable a to colonel mendez will go to artillery barrack with message from that a have first report to write out will not continue investigation today take pierre with again when mike returned desmond saw that news be bad colonel have not be seen when got there servant went up to room found lying dead stabbed to heart witness gone desmond said honourable gentleman pleasant one well mike matter becomes more more serious after there be one thing open to be to return to madrid at once when relate circumstance to duke will see have endeavoured to carry out rest of instruction chance of report ever coming to hand must have be slight indeed be important that must get question be will mount ride at once will go take leave of governor of course honour can do a like must say that sooner be out of better longer stay here more time will have to take care get back alive there be thing did not tell sir a went to barrack passed cavalry men talking be arguing that enemy must be marching way for at two o'clock last night ten trooper be suddenly called up sent off gate being opened for by order of governor just what expected mike have written to warn various contractor that fraud have be discovered doubt telling that messenger from here must be stopped searched report document taken from that if come be to be put out of way that if can be done matter can be hushed up a have taken measure to silence who know anything about affair well think be right need not mind saying goodbye to scoundrel a must only give time to perfect arrangement have doubt that must pretend to be ill to be engaged in business must detain manage to keep waiting hour before saw order sergeant to saddle up at once let men eat meal a quickly a possible let put bottle of wine loaf of bread into valise so that will be able to ride without stopping anywhere say that will mount in twenty minute must not wait to polish up accoutrement tell to put plenty of forage before horse not to put bridle in mouth until last thing let pour four five feed of corn into forage bag when have given order have own breakfast will go downstairs get something there packed valise while be away exactly twenty minute later little troop started men have at desmond order loaded pistol short gun avoiding principal street rode by narrow lane until emerged close to eastern gate through follower rode without question at quiet pace until beyond exterior fortification across bridge over guadiana then broke into canter sergeant men be not little surprised at sudden departure for have supposed that must remain for time at badajos desmond called sergeant up to side dare say be surprised at sudden move know that two attempt be made upon life last night have doubt that must be repeated perhaps with greater success have stayed there be present yesterday with two of men when discovered that large portion of store be mere dummy filled with earth whether not governor be party to fraud can not say morning have storekeeper who be arrested shot colonel mendez who be present at investigation be murdered during night be evident therefore that many people be interested in preventing discovery made from getting known of course soldier who assisted must be aware of must not venture to speak be only men servant who have still to be silenced tell in order that may impress upon men necessity for greatest vigilance such a must use if travelling through enemy country messenger be hear sent off yesterday evening in various direction have doubt that be to various contractor concerned in plot urging upon necessity of preventing news from reaching madrid perhaps to of robber band in sierra therefore instead of keeping main road up valley will ride by country track avoid large town will not put up anywhere will bivouac in open in way hope that will yet avoid party of men who may be lying in wait for most dangerous part of journey will of course be passage of mountain must there travel by one other of road through defile be possible may be watched if be attacked must endeavour to ride through if be impossible will sell life a dearly a can may trust for major sergeant said have love for spaniard be discontented at being kept down here to fight king of spain battle instead of being up in north where man be wanted to prevent enemy marching to paris struck off from road when nearing merida followed country track until came upon road between town torre mocha avoiding latter place took road to truxillo late in afternoon approached that town halted in wood two mile distant from here desmond consulted map there be two road from truxillo crossing sierra main shorter road came down upon tagus at other passed through deleytoza came down upon bridge at condo beyond deleytoza appeared to be mere mule track if there be party watching said to mike will expect that messenger will travel by main road to almarez for not only be better be shorter again might think that if suspected might be attacked must take road through deleytoza must at rate make matter safe by watching road be difficult question to choose well honour if have got to fight must be best to do so on good road horse must be of use to if be going single file along bad road while on good road must charge spalpeens cut way through be quite right mike will take main road will not be mounted think must stand before charge of seven men may shoot of a come down upon see here mike be report that wrote out yesterday evening took packet from inside of coat when start tomorrow morning will put in left holster if be shot will not wait for moment will snatch out ride on to madrid deliver to duke there have morning added few line relating murder of colonel mendez hurried trial execution of storekeeper attempt upon life said have not least doubt that governor be at bottom of if honour be killed will carry out order if be only wounded be will try to take off with must do a order obey honour order when be reasonable mike said doggedly leave behind to have throat cut by villain must not do thing so there be end of desmond smiled at earnestness of faithful follower well mike must be guided by circumstance remember be of extreme importance that report must reach duke of orleans unless have may lose badajos cause suffer irreparable injury to devil wid cause mike said cause doe trouble one way other care brass farthing whether philip charles reign over spaniard be not nice job will be taking on way not worth drop of irish blood well if honour must have bad fortune to be hit will carry off though there be not breath in body else go down with a there be doubt that mike meant what said desmond did not press matter further next day set out at daybreak in two hour be mounting slope of sierra there be sign of men being about until reached point where road ran between steep hill there be desmond exclaimed reining in horse there be thirty forty of on road now men will ride forward to boulder see hundred yard side of then will dismount give volley if keep that up will soon be too hot for to remain on road while sheltered behind rock will be safe from shot be certain that gun will carry farther shoot straighter than a spanish powder be so much inferior to french accordingly rode forward at canter to heap of boulder then suddenly left road dismounted took cover among rock take steady aim men desmond said then can hardly miss hitting of standing close together a do bandit have waited undecided at sudden disappearance of whom have regarded a certain prey before must form plan five musket flashed out four of number fell cry of rage burst from there be general discharge of gun ball pattering thickly against stone soldier now fired a quickly a must load doing considerable execution foe left road imitated by taking shelter behind stone for ten minute combat continued then party of men be seen mounting hill on side be just what hoped for desmond said fire at so a to force to climb little higher up hill a soon a be pretty well out of gunshot will mount charge down road there can not be many men left there order be followed of men on hillside dropped others continued to mount slope when a believed out of fire moved forward so a to take defender of rock in flank now fire volley among men in front of desmond said be not likely to hit of be sure to draw fire there will not be many unemptied gun a pas a expected volley be answered by general fire from hidden foe then party leapt into saddle pistol in hand galloped up road several hurried shot be fired from front then at shout from leader twenty men leapt from hiding place ran down into road desmond be supported on one side by mike on other by sergeant dropped rein horse have learned to obey motion of knee drawing sword rode straight at bandit only few musket be discharged so hurriedly that ball missed aim with shout party fell upon brigand pistol of trooper mike cracked out have need to draw sword for rush of horse struck panic into spaniard that sprang from road leaving path clear party thundered past without check be anyone wounded desmond asked when have passed beyond gunshot of assailant have ball in shoulder major one of trooper said rest be silent well have be fortunate desmond said will see to wound man when get little farther if fellow have not be so scared with sudden charge that fired almost at random might have lost number stopped mile farther desmond examined trooper arm ball have gone through flesh said without touching bone so will soon have use of again bound wound tightly up with soldier sash then made with own sling may a well put other arm in jacket said will tie round neck air be cold upon hill did well sir sergeant said a rode on again if have not thought of taking shelter shaking up must have be shot down before reached be there chance of attack sir none at must think messenger be sent to yesterday telling strength doubt thought that with sixty men must be certain to overpower be probably whole of band in case a must not imagine that must pas be not likely to have set ambush slept that night at almarez made short journey to oropesa long one on following day to toledo where desmond dismissed escort with handsome reward for service upon next afternoon rode with mike into duke of orleans looked astonished when entered room what back already major kennedy surely can not have carried out work entrusted to by mean royal highness what did carry out be so important that deemed duty to ride back at once to acquaint with what have discovered there be report sir duke took be bulky one said tell purport in a few word a possible have discovered sir that report sent by governor of supply of provision store in badajos be altogether inaccurate that fraud to enormous extent have be perpetrated that supply of powder cartridge be le by two third than be represented that similar deficiency exist in department be indeed serious duke said possession of badajos be essential to block way to enemy advance indeed can scarce move forward until be captured now tell more about will read report then question concerning heavy frown settled on duke brow a perused document infamous exclaimed when have finished say that two attempt be made to murder that night that spanish colonel who gave so much assistance be assassinated commissary shot next morning show how anxious governor be to remove from path who must inculpate how did manage to get out of toil for be clearly of use killing minor witness allowing to ride here to report fact saw that sir a learned that eight ten trooper have be sent off late night before concluded that road must be sure to be beset for doubtless of contractor must feel a essential a governor did that mouth must be silenced report suppressed therefore started early keeping by byroad be not molested until have nearly reached summit of sierra when found party of sixty men barring road have fight with succeeded in getting through with further damage than ball through arm of one of escort that fortunately be only flesh wound tell how be that so small party escaped so easily desmond then recounted incident of fight admirably contrived sir duke said warmly excellent generalship first attack centre drive off road then compel to weaken by throwing out flanking party keep out of musket shot then charge on weakened centre after drawing fire be not surprised that with such generalship got off almost scatheless now sir must ask to come with to king matter be too serious for moment delay must lay whole case before majesty leaving desmond in antechamber went in to king read full report to added detail have heard from desmond have met with many bad case of spanish corruption peculation king said when have finished be by far worst step must be taken instantly to secure governor arrest contractor fill up magazine what do propose think sir that if send forward at once regiment of french soldier from toledo accompanied by colonel crofton regiment of dragoon there be likelihood that resistance will be offered indeed must imagine that governor will have taken to flight a soon a learns that plan for assassination of major kennedy have failed so must think king said certainly will have warned accomplice contractor probably by time be on way into andalusia to north be found will certainly be hanged young officer of yours must be wonderfully shrewd fellow must like to question a to how discovered fraud desmond be called in be major kennedy majesty duke said be temporary rank bestowed upon in order to add weight to mission have noticed before cousin philip said when have gone to quarter wondered to see so young man in uniform of captain now sir will give account of how discovered fraud desmond then related how have caused pile of barrel to be opened out so that must examine next to wall a well a in front how have similarly examined other store very good indeed sir king said most officer must have contented with at most counting number of barrel sack that must have so thoroughly investigated matter show zeal shrewdness have shown that on various occasion duke said a may judge from promotion that have received a see by loss of hand have suffered a well a fought on behalf of france when majesty be at leisure will evening relate to story heard from king of manner in twice rescued fair damsel from evil minded noble who carried off will hear with pleasure cousin say hold only temporary rank think that after signal service have rendered must be made substantial certainly intend to make so duke said pardon sir desmond said while thanking for kindness must beg to be allowed to remain captain already have obtained more promotion than others have done after many year of good service must regret very much passing over head of so many of old companion be first time have have promotion declined duke said smiling however for present at least will let matter remain so with expression of warm thanks desmond retired must lose time over matter king said for aught know scoundrel may be in communication with enemy may be prepared to open gate of fortress at first summons will act at once duke replied will evening send order to toledo for regiment to march at nine o'clock tomorrow morning if will send similar order to colonel crofton will overtake infantry before get to almarez will do so will also send with three field officer with full power to arrest try execute who have taken part in treacherous fraud on duke leaving king desmond joined in antechamber a walked towards french headquarters said hope sir that will permit to start tomorrow with force may be sending a wish to carry out rest of mission with entrusted by mean do so if wish duke said colonel crofton regiment will start at nine o'clock tomorrow morning may accompany on road will overtake one of regiment from toledo chapter captured have job for mike what be honour want to take off mark of field officer from clothes be going to be captain again mike looked with surprise at master well honour be ungrateful baste must be sure thought that least must do be to make full major though if have made colonel must be no more than deserve be offered majority mike declined must be absurd at age to have rank must be ashamed to look officer of brigade who have done nigh twenty year of good service be still only captain in face must much rather remain a be well may be be right sir be disappointed be entirely will get over mike desmond laughed may be mike said doubtfully must have felt mighty proud of being colonel servant suppose will ever be that mike know that after last war be over several of irish regiment be disbanded doubt will be same when war be finished so must not count upon seeing colonel at rate not for twenty year ah honour hope will be back in old ireland year before hope so too mike have only be out here for two year yet be beginning to feel must like quieter life doubt loss of hand have something to do with must give up willingly chance of ever becoming colonel if must settle down in old country though fear there be very little chance of sure there may be fighting there too honour mike said if king james go across water there be sure to be divarsion way hope not mike be not that feel a loyal a ever to cause of stuart if can not come to own without ireland being again deluged with blood must rather must stay away twice ireland have suffered for stuart first when cromwell came over carrying fire sword through land divided country among follower next when dutch william did same be loyal to stuart a said be still more loyal to ireland must rather that king james remained life at saint germain than scene must ever come again be true for sir when come to think of must be just a easy comfortable in snug little cot in killarney be county whether king james queen anne be ruling in england quite so mike if have a say snug little cot to go to income to live comfortably in fear of being hauled off to prison hanged for joining brigade must not be sorry to settle down start back for badajos tomorrow morning faith honour have be so hard getting away from there must not have thought wished to put foot inside place again might not be so lucky in getting off next time be going in different way mike colonel crofton regiment of irish dragoon be going with french infantry regiment from toledo then be well content to go back honour hope will see that murthering governor hung think have good chance of seeing that mike if have not taken off before arrive there think be pretty sure to do directly hears have got through safely for will know that a soon a report be handed in be lost man bad ce to at rate hope will light upon day sir pay out for sending fellow to kill at night to hinder in hill a to cheating spaniard be business can reckon with for must like to pay debt suppose there be much chance of having opportunity of doing then why be going back honour to carry out original order mike survey road pass bridge duke can not rely upon spanish testimony in matter be most important that must ascertain accurately how good be road by must advance with army into portugal where best to oppose enemy if cross guadiana be glad to hear say so sir for be afraid that be going to have long stay here again must rather be on horseback riding over country than walking up down street till foot fairly ache be opinion too mike have have good many ride with despatch between time be stupid work hanging about general quarter waiting for order next morning desmond joined colonel crofton regiment a be on point of starting from barrack be in service of spain have taken brilliant part in several engagement desmond be acquainted with colonel officer good morning kennedy crofton said a rode up saluted have note from duke of orleans last night saying be going on special service must travel with a far a badajos king philip sent for later on gave instruction besides handing written order seems have discovered that governor be mixed up with lot of contractor in swindling state by supplying earth instead of powder flour so far a governor go colonel there be absolute proof have not smallest doubt that be prime mover in matter that commissary only received small portion of bribe paid to be hardly possible that one of must have betrayed trust unless sure of governor protection can not prove that have men shot in order to silence employed men to assassinate colonel mendez set men to murder in hotel afterwards to intercept in crossing sierra still have shadow of doubt in mind that be so however think will find at badajos doubt a soon a heard have got safely down into valley of tagus made off there be just possibility that contractor knowing that life will be forfeited by discovery of fraud might at once have sent in supply of powder flour other thing to take place of cask sack of earth in case must probably deny truth of statement altogether declare have simply invented in order to do credit to myself hardly think that possible in first place there be soldier of escort of colonel mendez who assisted in work of examination besides more than commissary escaped while be taking place on offer of pardon must doubt gladly come forward give evidence especially a execution of comrade will have shown that governor be determined to throw over yes suppose will find arch scoundrel there unless indeed can rely upon support of garrison in case may have ridden to portugal offering to surrender place at once to will close gate against think there be chance of colonel in short time during be there be able to see that troop be deeply discontented be almost in rag landlord of inn told that be kept on scantiest ration of very inferior kind so think for moment must trust to act against royal force desmond anticipation proved to be correct a descended into valley of guadiana met officer of garrison who be bearing despatch from senior military officer saying that governor family have suddenly left without issuing order a have taken portable property with be supposed that did not intend to return under circumstance wrote to ask for order colonel crofton sent back with instruction to colonel commanding troop that be coming with regiment of dragoon one of infantry have full authority from king to take measure seemed to desirable accordingly when arrived at badajos be met at gate by colonel commanding troop party of officer have king authority colonel crofton said to to act a temporary governor until may be appointed know whether be aware of circumstance led to flight of don juan de munos sir have heard nothing rumour be current among men that strange discovery be made when store be examined beyond know nothing in fact at time assassination of colonel mendez of artillery created excitement that nothing else be spoken of well colonel if will accompany to governor house will enter into matter fully with may well believe that be serious a have be despatched here with regiment with one of french infantry for of whom quarter must be found at once there be plenty of room sir barrack will contain ten thousand men at present have four thousand here then beg colonel that instead of coming at once to quarter will tell off officer to conduct troop to most convenient of building now empty after will be glad to see commanding officer of other regiment will of course take up quarter at governor house captain kennedy went on a rode forward a be going to be employed in surveying duty will naturally be good deal away presence here will be absolutely necessary a witness against of rascally contractor can lay hand on when four colonel arrived after seeing that troop be housed colonel crofton obtained from name address of various contractor hour later party of cavalry regiment in garrison be despatched under officer with order to arrest bring into badajos during meal colonel crofton explained to four colonel discovery of fraud naturally excited greatest indignation among then requested desmond to accompany to store did after sending to barrack for party of fifty men for fatigue duty gap made during desmond exploration have be carefully filled up again upon fresh opening being made report be fully borne out hour be spent at central magazine order given that other magazine must be opened examined on following day desmond did not join in search started early with mike to carry out own mission have be furnished with report sent in by provincial local junta a to state of road a have expected soon found to be grossly inaccurate road marked a excellent fit for passage of artillery train be found to be mere bridle road others marked a highroad be almost impassable lane bridge across stream be for most part in such bad condition a to be unsafe for country cart until repaired impossible for passage of artillery carefully noted point at work be required to render in degree practicable for passage of troop reported fully to colonel crofton latter who be provided with full authority despatched greater portion of troop with large number of peasant with material to fill up deep rut repair bridge make road a far a possible fit for passage of army in ten day desmond have surveyed road down valley of guadiana that of tagus have sent off report to madrid together with observation a to point at defensive position must in opinion be best taken up having done prepared to undertake second part of mission to investigate road on portuguese side of frontier now will have to keep eye open mike said so far a have heard there be body of enemy troop anywhere in neighbourhood there be bitter enmity between spanish portuguese will be liable to be attacked by peasant be to ride in uniform honour certainly be mike if be captured in uniform must be dealt with a prisoner of war have right to fair treatment if be taken in disguise will be shot a spy faith alternative be not pleasant one if go a civilian may be shot a spy if go in uniform may be murdered by peasant be so mike see be not likely to fall into hand of peasant be well mounted peasant will be on foot great proportion of unarmed so that beyond chance of being hit by ball risk be not great accordingly on following day rode out for nearly week examined line of route across frontier followed road between foot of mountain frontier a far a portalegre avoided town of campo mayor arronches crossed hill struck upwards by bank of zarina to frontiera thence west a far a lavre met with interference by such peasant a saw working in field by in small village through passed supposing uniform to be of english dutch officer found that road be fully a bad a of spain must present great difficulty to army with artillery long train of waggon in one of place heard from peasant with whom conversed that there be pas over mountain from elvas of course man spoke in portuguese language sufficiently resembled spanish for desmond to understand meaning must investigate that road mike for if be practicable must be most direct for army coming from lisbon of course will have to make wide circle round elvas a there be sure to be strong garrison there soldier riding about country must be certain to know that uniform be french when have done that road will have finished work accordingly passed round fortress at distance presently came upon road showed sign of having lately be repaired in part be so badly done that increased rather than diminished difficulty presented to passage of troop have ridden ten mile be already among mountain when dismounted to rest horse to eat food carried with suddenly looking down road behind saw squadron of cavalry coming along be awkward mike there be nothing for now to ride on when have reached foot of mountain on other side strike across country until come upon road running direct to badajos be good two mile behind so need not blow horse mounting proceeded at trot up road a far a must see cavalry behind did not quicken pace showed that be on ordinary duty not a desmond at first supposed in pursuit of peasant having perhaps taken word that officer soldier in strange uniform have be seen riding round town therefore took matter quietly indeed sometimes road be so steep that must have be impossible for horse to go beyond quick walk suddenly on reaching crest of rise saw at distance of hundred yard ahead of party of officer followed by escort of dragoon be caught time mike desmond exclaimed escape be impossible will ride straight up surrender fortunately be english uniform so be certain to get fair treatment must not be sure of have be portuguese so saying rode forward at trot party have drawn rein at approach rode up to one who be evidently general officer sir surrender a prisoner of war name be kennedy be captain on staff of duke of orleans what be doing here sir be surveying road general by allied army be likely to advance information on score be very defective believe duke wish to ascertain from report state of road by advance must most probably be made general question have be in french replied in same language bear french name sir general said sir be irishman kennedy replied in english belonged before received staff appointment to one of regiment of irish brigade be daring fellow thus to venture so far across frontier simply obeyed order sir have be ordered to reconnoitre lisbon must have attempted to do so well sir will have opportunity of talking to later on a see be engaged in precisely same work a be namely in ascertaining for state of road across mountain then general desmond said with smile must say that investigation be hardly satisfactory general also smiled not so much so a must wish said now may ask why seeing that be well mounted did not turn ride for when first perceived reason be simple general squadron of cavalry be coming up behind there be evidently possibility of escape doubt be sent out to meet well sir if will give word not to attempt to escape can retain sword ride with give parole sir with many thanks for courtesy now captain kennedy other went on be probable that have about result of investigation along road must request to hand to a may be a useful to a must have be to duke of orleans may save good deal of trouble desmond took out notebook in have day jotted down result of observation with suggestion a to point where repair be most needed have night on return to badajos written up report from intending when have completed work to take to madrid general glanced through notebook have done work very thoroughly captain kennedy have rendered considerable service now will move forward again please follow with aide de camp be two pleasant young men who be glad of talk with officer from other side how long have be riding about here if be fair to put question one said a notebook contained particular of journey on side of frontier desmond replied at once eight day think have be up road to portalegre by to lavre if have not unfortunately accidentally heard of road over mountain must now be on way to madrid have be against promotion must be very rapid in army other aide de camp said must hardly be captain already be fortunate enough to attract notice of king of france duke of berwick on various occasion when one have piece of good fortune a promotion be rapid be lucky for that fell into hand of earl of galway instead of into of portuguese general who must probably in spite of uniform have made short work of did not know that general be earl of galway desmond said certainly be lucky that fell into hand indeed if have not seen english uniform must have turned charged squadron behind preferring very much to be killed fighting than to be hanged shot like dog in few minute met squadron of cavalry who have a general supposed be sent out by governor of elvas to meet half of now took place in front remainder drawing aside to let party pas fell in behind mike have without order fallen in with earl escort more than once desmond heard laugh a chatted with trooper on arriving at general directed aide de camp to obtain room for desmond in house in be quartered a one attended to mike undertook usual duty a servant next morning one of aide de camp came in said general wish to speak to captain kennedy on entering general apartment earl asked to take seat must not see yesterday evening began a be learning from governor state of store here must like to have talk with may ask in first place how have so early attained rank of captain aide de camp tell that said have attracted notice of king of france must have be by singular action a have hour to spare before ride out will be glad if can tell particular about unless indeed be of private nature not at sir story be generally known to member of court at versailles indeed to paris then related to earl story of release of anne de pointdexter from imprisonment journey to south attack on party by vicomte de tulle second rescue from thank sir general said when have concluded be not surprised that after so romantic adventure king of france took notice of officer who have shown such courage intelligence see sir that be to certain extent in similar position from motif of religion principally irish have left country be fighting for foreign monarch a be doubtless aware belong to french huguenot family being forced to leave france by severe edict entered service of holland followed fortune of king william be now fighting against troop of country of birth in other respect there be similarity have lost hand in service of adopted country at siege of badajos at sir have be thinking over general went on might of course send to lisbon a prisoner one extra prisoner must not largely benefit government have not be taken in action paper have saved immense deal of trouble for be more able to rely upon information given by portuguese than must think duke of orleans can upon of spaniard therefore sir think that in present case can make exception to rule in hour will mount ride down road to badajos will there restore liberty to permit to recross frontier must be thousand pity so young gallant officer must waste perhaps year of life in english prison for number of prisoner taken in flanders be so great that be impossible for french to find officer to exchange for will understand that dealing with ally so jealous susceptible a portuguese can hardly take step of releasing a must be at once rumoured that have be in communication with french officer doubtless from sinister motive think captain kennedy that must be a well said with smile that must withdraw parole do so before start in presence of officer of staff of course must be placed under very strict guard although so near frontier will find very difficult to escape still such thing be managed thank most deeply sir desmond said understanding tone in earl spoke will ever retain deep feeling of gratitude for generosity when party assembled in readiness to mount desmond walked up to earl said in tone must be heard by officer round sir have changed mind beg to be allowed to withdraw parole be at liberty to do so captain kennedy nevertheless will take with today will not of course ask to give information a to matter on other side of frontier there be point on must inform without detriment to friend that will be happy to do sir earl called up four trooper will place officer servant between said keep vigilant lookout upon movement desmond have not even told mike of conversation with earl thinking better that must remain in ignorance that escape be connived at by english general follower be therefore greatly astonished when heard that master have withdrawn parole that be henceforth to be strictly guarded party rode until reached rise from must obtain view of badajos of country extending far up valley of guadiana ground in front of sloped gradually earl took place with two three officer of staff fifty yard in front of rest dismounting examined badajos with telescope then asked one of aide de camp to bring captain kennedy to may a well bring servant too added doubt know country a well a master doe may not be so unwilling to answer question order be carried out desmond mike rode up with aide de camp followed closely by four trooper earl at once began to question desmond a to name of village visible up valley have remounted now staff who have dismounted when did remained on foot a be evident that have intention of moving forward for time while be speaking earl accompanied by desmond rode forward twenty yard a if to obtain better view mike have followed four trooper remained behind group of officer having order to follow general so closely be good ground for galloping captain kennedy earl said quietly be within two mile of badajos thank deeply sir now mike ride for spurring horse dashed off at headlong gallop there be shout of surprise officer of staff ran to horse be being held by orderly four trooper at once galloped forward snatching carbine from sling fire earl shouted a passed take alive a officer came up general signalled to to stop go farther gentleman said trooper will doubtless overtake for aught know there may be spanish force in village just on other side of frontier instead of capturing two prisoner might be taken shot be not disposed to lose of staff just a be about to commence operation in earnest desmond looked back saw that only four dragoon be following will not overtake mike said horse be certainly better than theirs indeed have increased lead fast few minute later heard trumpet call in rear pursuer at once checked horse rode back in answer to recall tare age mike exclaimed be nately managed who must have thought that must have let give slip so easily well mike must never mention to soul earl gave chance of escape believe have know long talk with said that have so many french officer captured in flanders one more le must make little difference have asked about adventure seemed much interested in remarked that position be somewhat similar being exile on account of religion so serving in foreign army against own countryman at rate be on suggestion that withdrew parole not to attempt to escape then be rale gintleman sir mighty obliged feel to for have have enough of english prison though indeed be only three four day stopped at party on hill have watched pursuit until earl said well gentleman fancy have slipped from hand admit that be hardly sorry for be very fine young fellow must have be pity for to be spending perhaps year of best part of life in prison captain chetwynde will order trumpeter to sound recall be leaving men behind fast be use losing four trooper a well a two prisoner more than one quiet smile be exchanged between english officer for from tone in earl spoke have doubt that be by mean sorry at desmond escape that possibly have even taken forward with to afford chance of making have indeed be little surprised that when desmond withdrew parole earl have not ordered into strict confinement instead of taking with on reconnaissance pursuit over desmond rode on at canter to badajos reported to colonel crofton that have be taken prisoner have managed to effect escape a be carelessly guarded will now sir return to madrid have completed work be told to carry out will finish writing up report afternoon start tomorrow morning congratulate on escape portuguese be not very particular might a likely a not have paid small regard to fact that be in uniform fortunately sir be not by be captured by small party of english dragoon who be fancy like investigating state of road desmond have not be called upon to give evidence before commission of enquiry being found that contractor have left home week before troop arrived at badajos taking portable property with have apparently gone to andalusia while others have made for catalonia have unquestionably made considerable sum of money by fraud must take good care not to fall into hand of french will never be able to return here desmond remarked to colonel crofton latter smiled know people yet captain kennedy must not say so of fellow be certainly among richest men in province may be quite sure that in very short time when affair have blown over will partly by influence more by bribery obtain from central junta order that proceeding will be taken against anything can be done with money in spain there be many upright honourable spaniard very few of take part in public affair must not associate with such men a who be in ascendant in provincial junta even in central body in madrid in france there be distress enough doubt men who farm tax be more scrupulous than be in spain there be not same general corruption french nobility haughty despotic to tenant a may be be not corrupt must scorn to take bribe now that there be french king on throne here there may be when matter have settled down improvement will be long time indeed before nation can be regenerated even king will soon find that if be to reign peaceably must not interfere too violently with method be so common that have come to be accepted a inevitable even by people who suffer by can assure that have be many time approached by men who supply forage other thing to regiment when have indignantly refused to entertain proposal have not be at abashed have said boldly that be general custom believe thought better of for refusing even to listen to offer regarded a sort of don quixote with ridiculously exaggerated idea of honour on morning following return to badajos desmond started on way to madrid although time have apprehension whatever of planned attack thought safer better to travel north from badajos skirt foot of sierra until reached bank of tagus where there be strong garrison in of town country be in consequence free from incursion of band from hill journey passed without incident on reaching madrid presenting report received high commendation from duke of orleans spent long day with general staff explaining report going into detail a to nature of road repair necessary position be in opinion most suitable for battle on following day member of staff be summoned to meet by duke of orleans who informed that have received sudden summons to return to paris that marshal de bay must in absence be in command of french troop announcement came a great surprise to desmond be not unexpected by other officer during winter king of france have be engaged in effort to bring about general peace have offered term showed be ready to make sacrifice to procure ally on contrary be bent upon continuing war victory of oudenarde capture of lille namur other fortress opened way to paris knowing general distress prevailed in france raised demand higher higher a perceived anxiety of louis for peace one of obstacle to be situation in spain be reported that louis be ready to yield on point also not only to consent to cession of spanish dominion in spain to grandson philip surrendering crown to archduke charles that ere long french troop must be withdrawn altogether while during month have elapsed since desmond first left madrid rumour have increased in strength be known that courier be constantly passing to fro between madrid versailles with private communication between louis philip there be great excitement in madrid at rumour of desertion of king by france rumour be indeed correct king have informed philip great a be affection bore for state of france be necessarily chief care must compel ere long to recall troop from spain philip have entreated not to desert declared that in case must remain in spain confiding in support of people who have selected a monarch at present however communication be proceeding nothing definite have be arranged whole of staff be to remain with marshal de bay in same position a have held under duke except for departure of prince matter went on a before chapter old friend command have be effected so suddenly that desmond have not be able to make up mind to request duke of orleans to whom have be attached personally rather than to french army in spain to allow to return with to france in order that might again join duke of berwick before however must decide whether to do so not duke have taken departure desmond spoke to head of staff with whom have be constantly thrown in contact before left madrid whilst explaining to on return detail of report asked for advice must think have better remain here captain kennedy there be likely to be great battle fought in few week if rumour hear be correct may not be here very much longer certainly hope there will be change until then for if win battle so relieve spain from risk of invasion for time can leave country with better grace a philip must then only have to battle with rebellious subject in catalonia must certainly not wish to leave when great battle be about to be fought desmond said will therefore continue to serve under marshal de bay until be certain what be going to be done in short time general movement of troop spanish french began desmond other aide de camp be actively employed in keeping up communication between various column be to assemble near badajos moving forward at same rate a troop march be pleasant one be april now country looked bright heat be not too great for marching marshal have gone on with greater portion of staff desmond having be detailed to accompany division from toledo when within two day march of badajos orderly brought note from marshal requesting to ride forward at once did without loss of time marshal de bay have taken up quarter at badajos on arriving in town desmond alighted at governor house be stupid mistake of mine head of staff said in sending on detached duty forgot at moment when nominated that knowledge of locality must be invaluable to only thought of yesterday when on marshal asking for information on matter pulled out report examined said 'this be very complete valuable colonel whom be made by 'by officer of staff sir captain kennedy 'where be ' 'he be coming down with toledo column sir ' send for at once said 'one of others must have be detached for service be just man want here ' accordingly sent for here be be excellent report of yours sir duke said when colonel introduced desmond to a came down noticed that road have in many case be thoroughly repaired at point mentioned in report a being particularly bad bridge in many place greatly strengthened have not be for know how must have got gun along now sir want to ask few question a to road on other side by report see that consider road through campo mayor to be only one by army must move that large body of workman must be employed to make other road fit for passage of cannon then asked number of question concerning road see said have marked several place in report where enemy coming down road must post strongly others might be defended to advantage by yes sir of course suitability of place must depend largely upon respective strength of army marshal nodded approvingly from hear from agent in lisbon said enemy force will be superior to own in number main portion be portuguese who have shown very little fight hitherto cavalry be almost entirely portuguese only really fighting portion of force be english dutch who be most formidable foe against have french regiment on whose bravery can rely be not that think portuguese will probably a at battle of almanza fly a soon a engagement begin must fall back take up strongly defensive position a be in spite of superior number think can meet on equal field conversation lasted over hour then desmond retired leaving colonel villeroy with marshal a left house officer standing at door seized hand dear kennedy said who must have thought that must have met again here desmond staggered back must not for moment believe evidence of eye ear why o'neil thought be dead be worth good many dead men yet other one laughed let go into wine shop crack bottle can then talk over matter quietly be alive too desmond asked poor fellow have never be heard of since tremendous licking got there be not shadow of hope then many question be asked on side when be answered desmond said now about o'neil thought be only one got through safe so be for other three of be on back did not hear of a among prisoner of whom list be furnished by marlborough name of patrick o'neil did not appear be shot through body during night lay insensible in morning opened eye began to think seemed to that name be not one must be likely to please in first place because be evident by age be not one of limerick men in next place because of little matter of escape from jail in london have fear of being shot must be prisoner of war must not be likely to be over kindly treated when exchanged prisoner must certainly not be one of sent back see what with blenheim ramillies oudenarde have taken ten of officer for one of officer captured by so thought best to pas a french officer be easy to do so a french be good enough to pas anywhere see have on french staff uniform luckily horse have be shot at same time a be be lying dead beside within reach of arm so be able to lean over get flask from one of holster have terrible thirst on must have drunk barrel a heard firing knew that fighting be over in two three hour party came along with stretcher having doctor with when saw that eye be open be alive examined wound shook head 'he be badly hit ' said 'but may a well carry in ' so took into oudenarde have be turned into big hospital 'you be not to speak ' doctor said to before lifted up 'you must keep perfectly quiet ' when got into hospital found hole behind a well a in front heard one of doctor say be good thing dressed wound left must see by face next time came that be surprised to see alive one of said to other 'the bullet must have passed through without touching vital point may do yet bent down asked in french what name be said 'victor dubosc lieutenant ' so stuck card with name

of hut be little better than others be for use of officer regiment of soldier be in tent outside wall hundred men be always on guard with loaded musket said to myself often often 'if kennedy be here must soon hit upon plan for getting away for life of must not see how be to be managed be dull time can tell food be bad cooking be worse only few officer be there most of being sent to place long distance inland a be wounded suppose thought that loss of blood must keep quiet one of officer having little money hidden about bought pack of card from english soldier passed most of time playing be poor work for have nothing to play for at last said to myself 'patrick o'neil there must be end of brain will go altogether be not worth much at best of time must have thought of plan for getting out of place before now at last hit on plan be dangerous one there be doubt of a be desperate did not think much of danger worst must do be to shoot suppose be what must have done idea be to pounce suddenly on one of sentry who kept guard night to gag tie up before must give alarm then to dress up in clothes take matchlock difficulty be what be to do next soldier came on duty for twelve hour coming in at six in morning going out at six in evening be clear to that must only be done in dark have to wait for nearly two month be beginning of october before be dark enough at six in morning for to fall in with others march out without being noticed at last time came stole out of hut hour before change must be made crept along quietly till heard sentry marching up down between hut of soldier have torn up blanket into strip twisted together to make rope with in one hand big piece ready to shove into mouth in other stole up close to when turned back to jumped upon luckily instead of

behind went up long lane brought on to main road crossed that climbed hill beyond came down into wooded country at first cottage came to stopped man woman came out on knocking looked kindly good tempered told pitiful story about how have be unjustly accused of striking officer have be sentenced to two hundred lash have managed in night to cut slit in back of guard tent escape a have be walking along sudden thought have struck at oudenarde be wearing same boot have worn when be captured together when took money out left if remember five piece of gold in one of boot have never thought

clothes man readily consented to do woman set before large bowl of milk bread ate a soon a have put on pair of breech smock broad hat now felt perfectly safe might send news over country of escape of french officer a have never spoken word of english from time be taken one must suspect countryman speaking english to be man whom be in search of after leaving cottage travelled quietly to rye thought best to go there for be likely that must be difficult elsewhere for unknown man to get passage to france struck that man who took across before must carry over first time be going with despatch found easily enough though be not dressed quite in same way a be when called on before recognized at once 'another job for ' asked 'not special one ' said be going across again there be occasion for to make special trip indeed employer forgot to give order upon must have gone back if have remembered thought must not mind giving passage next time sailed across a man remembered that have made ourselves pleasant on board agreed at once to take next time boat must be going laid out pound in getting coat more suitable for travelling in france than peasant smock then took lodging in small inn three day later messenger came down with order for man to take across at once a captain charged nothing for passage have enough left to pay for place in diligence on arriving in paris duly reported at barrack a having returned first enquiry of course be about obeullivan found that have never be heard of that have lost hand have be promoted to captaincy have be very ill have gone to south of france on sick

give letter to duke of orleans asking to employ in capacity when got down here found that duke have left that marshal de bay be in command on reading berwick letter at once appointed one of aide de camp be away found to great disappointment be sent off into catalonia with order for four battalion to be sent at once to badajos arrived here yesterday in time for shindy fortunately o'neil think there be much fear of oudenarde there be royal duke here to interfere with general portuguese be not to be compared with hanoverian dutch other ally fought against there hear from others that have be occupied in reconnoitring country yes be captured be fortunately able to give slip desmond did not care to tell even friend that escape be due to kindness of british general next morning desmond be sent off to hurry up body of troop be still seven eight march away news have come that allied army be in motion must probably concentrate near portalegre seemed to show that intended to invade spain by badajos valley of guadiana for have aim be to advance up valley of tagus to madrid must have marched towards montalvao so on by alcantara to almarez after two day hard riding met column on receiving order from marshal to hasten forward with speed performed double march until arrived at badajos desmond found that ally have not wasted time that advance guard be already at campo mayor spanish army be posted on caya river stream flowed down from sierra fell into guadiana at position be defensive one army of ally be known to be twenty two thousand strong of whom five thousand be cavalry spanish have about same strength of cavalry be inferior in infantry number of gun also be about equal side having about forty cannon on th of may two army faced other on opposite side of river caya a party made movement of advance marshal de bay determined to force on engagement sent order to cavalry to cross river to place on road between enemy campo mayor ally suffered a french have done at oudenarde by conflicting counsel earl of galway be in command of british of two three dutch regiment marquis de frontiera be in command of portuguese who formed by far greater portion of force a soon a movement be seen on other side of river determined to cross attack spaniard earl of galway be strongly of opinion that must not be wise to take offensive that army must remain in present position until intention of enemy be clearly ascertained cavalry urged must do little by be evident that infantry must not be attacked while remained under shelter of gun of fortress marquis de frontiera however other portuguese general be unanimous in insisting that battle must be given at once former gave order for portuguese cavalry with body of foot five field piece to march immediately seeing that if unsupported force must meet with disaster earl of galway reluctantly ordered troop under command to advance river be fordable met with opposition until crossed formed up in order of battle portuguese horse be now divided on wing british be in centre portion of portuguese infantry be on flank rest be in rear captain kennedy will carry order at once to cavalry to charge portuguese horse on right wing desmond saluted be about to ride off when paused moment asked may charge with brigadier crofton dragoon sir marshal nodded desmond galloped off crofton be in command of first line of cavalry own regiment be composed partly of irishman partly of spaniard be in centre of line after delivering order to general commanding cavalry desmond rode on to crofton cavalry be going to charge sir said have permission to ride with crofton waited until order from general arrived then drawing sword shouted first brigade will charge riding forward led way against portuguese horse whose cannon have already opened fire portuguese fell into disorder a soon a saw long line of horseman charging down on like torrent when neared broke fled be soon overtaken great number be cut down remainder galloped off panic stricken mob did not draw rein until reached campo mayor spaniard at once turned five cannon fugitive have left behind upon allied infantry then after few round have be fired cavalry charged british infantry have now foe of different metal to reckon with although three time horseman reformed rank hurled against infantry be time repulsed with heavy loss then swerving round fell on portuguese infantry in second line whom dispersed a easily a have defeated cavalry earl of galway now brought up brigade of brigadier general pierce consisted of two british regiment of barrimore stanwix spanish regiment have be recently raised named after charged enemy with great bravery drove back infantry for distance recovered five gun cavalry have lost still pressing forward fought way deep into centre of spanish rank have be supported by portuguese infantry on flank battle might still have be won latter in spite of persuasion order of officer refused to advance turning back made off in confusion although not yet attacked by enemy order be then sent to portuguese horse on left to charge to assistance of pierce brigade instead of doing also galloped off field after defending with desperate valour for time little brigade being unsupported being surrounded by whole strength of spaniard be forced to surrender in meantime earl of galway seeing that battle be lost through cowardice of portuguese be preparing to withdraw men have only despatched pierce brigade to check advance of enemy while did so seeing that by ardour be irretrievably cut off gave order to marquis montandre to draw off british infantry who alone remained firm against whom whole of french spanish force now advanced while with small body of cavalry charged into midst of enemy in hope of reaching pierce brigade drawing off although weakened by loss of brigade attacked on flank a well a in front frequently charged by spanish horse among crofton dragoon be conspicuous for bravery retreating british maintained admirable order occasionally when severely pressed charged enemy beat back till be able to withdraw from field with comparatively trifling loss thus saving flying portuguese from annihilation a at almanza whole of fighting almost loss fell upon english although considerable number of portuguese be cut down in flight before spanish cavalry returned to join in attack on retiring english ally have altogether seventeen hundred men killed wounded two thousand three hundred taken prisoner of whom fifteen hundred be pierce brigade eight hundred portuguese who be cut off by cavalry among prisoner be earl of barrimore officer of pierce brigade lord pawlet one of earl aide de camp two of page master of horse after battle be over desmond have rejoined marshal be sent to ride over field ascertain who have fallen what prisoner have be taken night be already coming on after fulfilling mission a far a be possible in confusion came upon two spanish soldier with prisoner whom have there asked in spanish know sir found lying under horse in fall have so pinned down leg that must not escape several others have fallen round be only when heard cry for help that turned dead horse over found under then got out standing close there be light enough for desmond to distinguish prisoner feature gave slight start of surprise then said have done well men here be doubloon to get drink with comrade when get into town will look after prisoner men saluted went off well pleased to have got rid of trouble of marching prisoner into town mike rather surprised moved up to take charge of captive lord desmond said will now endeavour to repay kindness showed do see little hut mike just at edge of tree must hide earl there cavalry be still over country hunting down fugitive earl who be scarcely able to walk leg having be injured by weight of horse upon murmured thanks did not speak again until have entered shed when desmond said now general will first cut down riding boot to ease leg then if will lie down in corner will pile firewood over will not be safe for to attempt to go forward for two three hour yet have report to make to marshal de bay when have handed in will return at once mike do stay near hut if searching party must come along be scarcely likely for have gone farther afield can say there be need to search hut a with officer have already examined in few minute earl be completely hidden desmond then rode into badajos delivered report to marshal then went to stable took out spare horse leading rode out to hut again have anyone be here asked mike not soul sir take horse into wood then stay with for present will not be safe for earl to move for couple of hour now general went on a removed firewood fear that have be very uncomfortable can hardly say have be comfortable sir be of consequence pain in leg have abated since cut boot open now how can express gratitude to for thus sheltering be fair return of service sir gave liberty be doing best to restore yours to be very well to say that captain kennedy be general in command of british force in portugal have chosen to openly release none must have questioned be only because magnified report of affair might have reached ear of portuguese government given rise to rumour hostile to that thought best to let appear to be accidental escape see be by mean popular with portuguese in first place be protestant in next place be constantly bringing pressure to bear upon a to supply of provision making of road proper feeding arming of own troop other matter of same kind must be only too glad to have cause of complaint against case be altogether different for be risking even life in thus aiding to escape may be general be nevertheless duty a matter of conscience to endeavour to return kindness that showed a at present army will hardly be in state to take field against for long time feel that be seriously injuring cause well sir will be debtor for life do intend to remain always exile captain kennedy earl of galway went on seems to little short of madness so many gallant gentleman must cut altogether adrift from native country pas life fighting a mercenary use word offensively only in proper meaning of foreigner serving in army of nation not own do mean to insult irish gentleman by even hinting that serve simply for pay fight for france mainly in hope that france will day aid in setting james stuart on british throne forlorn hope for although louis may encourage hope of stuart follower by patronizing cause suit to do because give mean of striking at england by effecting landing in scotland ireland be yet matter upon must be indifferent save in own interest in advantage give of keeping in service dozen so splendid regiment on whose valour can always rely be true sir desmond replied own have great hope that by mean of french assistance stuart will regain throne what must do if be to return to ireland beyond fact that name be kennedy be in absolute ignorance a to what branch of family belong to have practically not friend in country be to land in ireland have mean of earning living must doubtless be denounced a one who have served in irish brigade own must be glad to return there for time in order to make enquiry a to family be sixteen when left be kept a seems to purposely in total ignorance on subject may be be son of brave officer of name who certainly came over to france soon after be born fell fighting year before came out have proof that be so must give great deal to be able to ascertain in ireland think great deal of genealogy be often questioned by irishman of old descent a to family find extremely awkward to be obliged to own know nothing of with certainty have desire to pas life in battle siege if survive risk peril to settle down a frenchman with irish name can well understand earl said 't be life that man must desire for must certainly be wasted one can assure that think chance of james stuart descendant gaining throne of england be remote in extreme when william of orange came over there be standing army a james second have rendered extremely unpopular by catholic leaning became possessed of england without opposition of ireland by mean of dutch troop matter be entirely changed now england have strong army against gathering however strong of undisciplined men must have little chance conceive possible that catholic stuart might regain throne of ireland if backed by french army if people be supplied with french arm money that must retain throne after french be withdrawn regard a next to impossible can not think same sir however a see chance of being able to go to ireland even to push enquiry a to family there be nothing for to remain soldier of france in matter might assist captain kennedy have doubt that influence that of friend in england must without difficulty suffice to gain permission for to visit ireland on private business on undertaking that have political object whatever in desiring to do so that engage to enter into plot scheme for rising furthermore think can promise if succeed in research find that have relation friend there must if desire obtain revocation of pain penalty may have incurred restoration of right a irishman be certainly least can do after vital service that have rendered service that in show share in bitter enmity so many of countryman unfortunately feel against england have such enmity assuredly desmond said choice of coming out here to enter service of france be not of own making be made for reason have never be able to understand by gentleman who have borne expense of bringing up who be strong supporter of english rule therefore must have be expected to place obstacle in way of entering irish brigade chapter war after hearing desmond story earl asked several question obtained further detail of life when boy of interview with john o'carroll be certainly strange said thoughtfully worth enquiring into for must seem that must have interest in thus getting out of way in entering service must render next to impossible that must ever return to native land see possible interest that must have have in sir certainly have never be able to account for conduct be clear that there be mystery about earl said warmly be must certainly take leave of absence for time go over get to bottom of matter at rate will at once write to london obtain safe conduct for can use not a may decide can then if so please return continue service here methinks that war will not last very much longer france be impoverished disaster have befallen arm in flanders have rendered war unpopular in england in spite of success gained by arm heavy taxation be making men ask why war must be continued may benefit holland german ally can result in good to england now captain kennedy will be making way to join remains of army thank again most heartily for generous conduct believe may always command service in direction only regret that unhappy political difficulty must drive so many of brave countryman into service of power have always be so far a can see be likely to remain enemy of england may say sir that lord godolphin have for certain reason promised to befriend that if write to on subject of safe conduct think must rely upon taking favourable view of matter will do so certainly earl said power be great if be favourably disposed towards may consider matter a done chatted for time longer then desmond said think now sir that must be safe to move everything be perfectly quiet without have doubt that by time cavalry have returned to badajos however will accompany for short distance for may be stopped by of advance post have best take cloak hat of follower a be well known question will then be asked by way lord galway added a mike having brought up horse mounted where will send letter to with safe conduct be in communication with many person at madrid can pas letter through line at time when there lodge at house of don pedro sarasta in calle del retiro will request to forward letter to must be absent earl made note of address in pocketbook then putting on mike cloak hat started with desmond who passed without question through line of outpost be indeed carelessly kept a be certain that after signal victory have be gained must be long time before enemy must venture to attack two day after fight marquis de bay moved forward with army with intention of fighting battle galway frontiera have by time reorganized force occupied so strong position near elvas that must not venture to attack however occupied country for considerable distance beyond frontier subsisting army upon provision forage collected by cavalry in village small town a be evident that after proof given of inability of portuguese to withstand attack there be probability of offensive operation being renewed by ally heat becoming intense force be withdrawn across frontier went into quarter general returning to madrid where received enthusiastic welcome from inhabitant by time however knowledge that king of france be entering into negotiation must necessitate desertion of spain greatly excited population against french stationed in capital be hissed hooted when appeared in street for time indignation be so great that troop be ordered to remain in barrack king however gained rather than lost popularity a issued proclamation to people saying that having accepted invitation to be king must remain with until driven from throne by force confided absolutely in affection aid to enable to withstand foe who might attempt to dethrone in autumn change occurred although in order to obtain peace have granted demand however exorbitant of ally have undertaken to withdraw troop from spain louis stood firm when to condition added namely that must undertake by force to dethrone grandson monstrous demand united at once who wished to continue war rather than grant such humiliating term a have be insisted upon party who be in favour of peace even at cost negotiation be abruptly broken off french troop who be already on march towards frontier received order to remain in spain now that have o'neil with time in madrid passed more pleasantly for desmond than before be frequently away for several day carrying despatch to commander of force in valencia barcelona in capital french be

april a marquis de bay be not yet moving offered obeahony who have command of force service of desmond o'neil a aide de camp offer be welcome one for a none of men in newly raised regiment be acquainted with language desmond who now spoke spanish well must be far more valuable to than spanish officer must be for two month little force moved about in catalonia rapidity of march baffling attempt of archduke force to interfere with operation be principally directed against various small fortress held by partisan of charles several of be captured thus clearing road guarded opening country for more important operation philip be about to undertake be not until july that royal army approached lerida where obeahony force joined general stanhope marched with troop under command encamped at balaguer where be joined by baron de wetzel with troop have be brought from italy a stanhope force be insufficient to give battle until joined by main army of charles marched on st of july headed by two english two dutch regiment of dragoon to secure pass near alfaro so check advance of spaniard after performing long difficult march took up defensive position stanhope found however that river in front of be so low that cavalry artillery must pas easily even infantry must cross without difficulty scarcely have taken up position when two brigade of infantry nineteen squadron of cavalry be seen approaching having be detached from spanish army to occupy position have be secured by rapidity of stanhope march therefore waited for main army to come up before did so whole of stanhope force have arrived be prepared for battle although be past six o'clock in evening charles on arrival decided to fall upon enemy before must encamp might do in position in must be difficult to attack fourteen cannon at once opened fire from eminence whence commanded position taken up by advance force of spaniard position be on low ground in front of ridge upon village of almenara stood nothing must be seen of force lay behind ridge advanced force of spaniard ascended ridge a soon a artillery opened upon general stanhope obtained leave from marshal staremberg who commanded archduke army to charge with ten squadron of horse rode up ascent there when gained saw to surprise twenty two squadron facing flanked with infantry supported with line of cavalry equally strong sent back at once for fourteen squadron from second line when six of came up advanced against spaniard who at same time moved forward to meet cavalry on philip left at once gave way centre right aided by fire of infantry made stout fight be driven back by english dutch cavalry fighting be severe for of six english squadron who charged two hundred men twenty one officer be killed wounded philip second line of cavalry gave feeble support stanhope horse soon have in confusion driving from field pursued hotly fugitive dashed into own infantry who be just arriving in force panic communicated to total rout took place pursuit be kept up until be so dark that trooper be unable to see other face then halted having defeated spanish without aid of infantry have not come up in time to take part in fight much of baggage together with tent many cannon quantity of ammunition fell into hand of victor owing to darkness number of prisoner taken be small obeahony troop have taken part in engagement a having arrived late on previous evening after long march be still at lerida have not be deemed necessary to hurry forward a battle be expected to take place for day a indeed must have be case have force sent forward arrived at river before stanhope routed troop arrived under shelter of gun of lerida charles did not attack there making detour seized several place in aragon with intention of cutting line by philip must probably retire forcing to fight again philip however on part marched from lerida in order to retire into castile by way of saragossa charles followed hotly portion of cavalry came up to rear of enemy in defile of penalva here spaniard posted strong force of grenadier defile being too narrow for cavalry to act dismounted hot fight took place in party claimed victory however philip retired same day in great haste charles arriving three hour later ate dinner have be prepared for rival spaniard covered by defence of pas crossed ebro posted in strong position within mile of saragossa on st of august marshal staremberg with general having reconnoitred position gave order for attack to take place next morning at daybreak cannon on side opened fire general stanhope who commanded on left wing found that enemy have greater part of cavalry facing therefore strengthened force by four battalion of foot six squadron of portuguese horse spanish line ran obliquely from river on left to steep hill on right occupied by cavalry battery of artillery be much nearer to attacking force than be on plain battle began at twelve o'clock charles force marching in two line with exception of stanhope cavalry infantry from situation be first to come in contact with enemy four battalion first pushed forward up hill driving spanish cavalry back allowed stanhope horse to ascend hill form on crest battle speedily ranged along whole line spaniard with superior number gained ground on left here be corp be stationed drove portion of ally across ebro again success be more than counterbalanced on other flank where stanhope cavalry infantry carried before latter posted in hollow opened so heavy fire upon spanish infantry a advanced that fell into disorder a cavalry be driven off hotly pursued by stanhope fell back upon centre threw into disorder seeing that battle be lost marquis de bay gave order to retire two hour after first shot be fired rout of spanish centre right be complete considerable portion of troop be rallied by de bay at alagon three league above left wing under general amezaga obeahony be checked in course of victory by disaster befell centre right maintaining discipline fell back in good order rejoined defeated comrade at alagon cannon most of colour of regiment forming centre right fell into hand of victor loss of ally be about two thousand men killed wounded that of spaniard french three thousand killed wounded between five six thousand prisoner philip rode at once to madrid on evening of battle archduke entered saragossa while de bay retired with broken remains of troop towards navarre desmond o'neil who have ridden behind obeahony saw spanish troop of archduke yield before impetuous attack of irish regiment who a pressed foe backwards burst into loud cheering believing victory already won presently obeahony stopped advance must not push too far forward said seems to that thing be not going so well in other direction centre be being pressed back what be going on on right can not say enemy seems to have gained top of hill for cannon there be silent if centre be driven back have now beaten will rally will be taken in flank by fire of centre therefore let be content with what have done wait see how thing turn out elsewhere even before rout of spanish right centre be yielding for opposed to be british dutch regiment whose attack be altogether unable to withstand soon became clear that at other point on field battle be going against spaniard aide de camp presently rode up hastily with order from marshal de bay for left to fall back retire to alagon deep be rage disappointment among troop of obeahony amezaga a faced about set out on march be unmolested troop have beaten be in disposition to follow while allied cavalry infantry of centre be in full pursuit of rest of philip army remnant of little force joined at alagon before nightfall be day before archduke army moved forward again troop be exhausted by long march have made there be difference of opinion among general a to course have best be followed king wished to pursue beaten enemy if possible to intercept march towards france count staremberg stanhope be of opinion that must first occupy madrid then march into navarre so a to bar advance of fresh french troop into spain at same time open communication by sea with england whence must be supplied with reinforcement store of provision finally charles gave way ally marched towards madrid main portion of army halted at alcala day march from capital general stanhope marched on with division to madrid opened gate without resistance philip having retired with army charles entered city on th of september alarm in france at news of defeat at saragossa be great louis at once despatched duke of vendome to command there latter travelling fast gathering up garrison of town through passed crossed frontier at nearly same time a charles entered madrid effected junction with de bay army have by time be increased by fourteen thousand men drawn from garrison of town in navarre castile galicia valencia vendome have doubt that intention of ally in marching upon madrid be to open communication with portuguese determined to throw between capital frontier marching with speed encamped near salamanca on th of october thence moved to plasencia thereby securing bridge of almarez preventing portuguese from joining charles have not be for usual indecision want of energy on part of portuguese government junction might have be effected before vendome arrived at plasencia for charles stanhope have after victory of saragossa written urgently begging that portuguese army must at once advance join at madrid at rate if whole army must not move at least troop in pay of england must push forward instantly stanhope indeed have marched with division to bridge of almarez to facilitate junction have defeated spanish force guarding bridge however portuguese did not arrive when messenger brought alarming news that spanish french army have occupied plasencia stanhope fell back towards madrid a large french reinforcement be known to be approaching frontier philip army be already much superior in number to of ally be decided in council of war to evacuate force have occupied toledo other town be recalled early in december army left capital archduke riding at once to barcelona while army of stanhope division formed rear guard followed in same direction movement have be delayed too long vendome philip be already at hand on th fell upon stanhope division at brihuega force consisting of eight english battalion same number of portuguese horse defended desperately although town be wholly without fortification repulsed attack until ammunition be exhausted be then forced to surrender staremberg on hearing that stanhope be attacked surrounded turned back marched with speed to relieve on arriving within three hour march of town heard that have surrendered duke of vendome hearing of coming drew troop out formed in line of battle next morning attacked vigorously allied right held ground left fled vendome swept right round took centre right of ally in rear three battalion of second line however fell in turn upon french rear repulsed left wing rallying again renewed battle combat be indecisive party claiming victory staremberg wrote to charles that have captured enemy gun have killed six thousand of while french claimed that have totally defeated ally captured cannon killed four thousand taken nine thousand prisoner balance of probability lie to extent with french for day after battle staremberg retired marched to barcelona fact that be not at once pursued show that french spaniard must have suffered very heavily desmond have passed unscathed through battle of saragossa o'neil have be severely wounded have managed to sit horse until division effected junction with marquis de bay shattered force great be wrath among two irish regiment at issue of battle what be use officer said to desmond of throwing away life fighting for spaniard when be useless save when meet portuguese who be still more contemptible here have on level ground fairly beaten enemy while right centre although having great advantage in position allow to be scattered like flock of sheep have stouter foe to meet than have desmond said have only spaniard opposed to while have english dutch to fight a best french troop have found in flanders that be at least match for must not blame spanish too severely for giving way before be attacked there be something in admit kennedy seems to that in war must be much better if spaniard portuguese have remained at home allowed french fight out with english dutch battle must have be small at least must have be desperately fought must be absurd moore for to lay down life in struggle in principally concerned took part whatever be of great interest to to english after way in louis be ready to throw over spain philip at beginning of year spanish alliance can be of great advantage to think that even philip order must induce spanish army to march across frontier to assist france therefore a louis can gain nothing by spanish alliance why must weaken by sending force here to maintain philip on throne with archduke charles here must have enemy on frontier philip might not assist charles must be actively hostile english dutch troop must be pouring into peninsula must have flanders in south of france well desmond said after pause best way can see out of be for philip charles to withdraw allow spanish to elect spaniard for king if must not agree to suppose must do choose foreign prince belonging to petty state stand altogether aloof from european affair seat on throne if again must not accept england france must mutually agree not to interfere in affair let spaniard indulge in civil war a long a plea moore laughed might be good solution kennedy there be more chance of philip charles renouncing pretension indeed of french on one side ally on other permitting to do so than there be of world becoming utopia where war will be unknown people live together in peace amity well desmond said for part be sick of fighting in quarrel that concern when campaign come to end will if possible rejoin berwick cause of stuart be not advanced in slightest by what be taking place in spain if be to fight must rather do so where victory must benefit know that be not right other assented certainly seems pity that best blood of ireland must be spilled in flanders spain in service of foreign country to mind term of surrender of limerick be disadvantageous to ireland england england have gained number of inveterate foe who with good wise treatment might now be fighting in own rank ireland have lost best blood men who be natural leader belonged to old family whom respected be sure be mistake desmond said if term have be absolute equality in matter of religion free pardon of without confiscation of property other disability must have gone far to reconcile people to defeat for must have seen that must not hope for more than right of free exercise of religion if stuart came to throne again perhaps be right kennedy know that have not be for persecution priest hunting closing of chapel must never have thought of leaving ireland taking foreign service now there be going back suppose not desmond said gloomily nothing short of amnesty ensuring freedom of worship perfect civil equality to must induce majority of to return to ireland indeed be not easy to see what must do if got there estate of father be in hand of stranger must soon be altogether without resource must be almost driven to conspire again even though success must in way mend matter however there be chance of such act being passed for even if english ministry desired to do so protestant feeling in england scotland must be too strong for parliament strongly represents that feeling must reject bill by immense majority then there be nothing to do to go on fighting moore said see nothing else for moore own care for life have have three year of now like prospect of thirty have be fortunate too kennedy yes have be fortunate in way of getting promotion fortunate be not long before put under sod be great gratification to be captain though in thirty year if live may be general think even must reconcile to life be just a hard good deal more responsible if thirty year passed over stuart be not restored assuredly never must be must have wasted life for nothing well be very glad moore laughed that fellow look at in same light a do take thing a come bother about future be good thing desmond said be national character to take thing a come dare say will get into same way day just at present suppose partly because have got thrashing feel rather down in dump desmond continued duty a aide de camp to obeahony took share in various operation ended with army going into winter quarter philip making triumphant entry into madrid then went to general general wish to ask leave to return to france at rate for time duke of berwick when despatched to join staff of duke of orleans said must reinstate on staff a soon a duke no longer required service when duke of orleans left be handed over with rest of staff to marshal de bay under whom served in battle of guadiana until a know be detailed to accompany brigade now that campaign be over must at rate like to pay visit to duke of berwick under whom served at oudenarde have therefore come to ask to dispense with service to permit to return to france certainly captain kennedy assistance have be of great value to there be chance of anything being done during winter a many of officer be now beginning to speak spanish will must remain here till spring be able to get on very fairly will be pleased before start to furnish with testimonial stating service have rendered indeed have more than once mentioned in report chapter in search of family on following day desmond left brigade followed by mike rode for madrid where be still lying letter have arrived month before from england have not asked for to be forwarded for if have be killed have be found on might do memory great disservice a must seem that have be in correspondence with british letter contained enclosure be to surprise from lord godolphin ran dear captain kennedy partly at request of earl of galway still more from own remembrance of conduct in affair know of of silence that maintained concerning have pleasure in sending safe conduct to visit ireland on private affair earl tell that have rendered greatest of service alone must cancel fact that have be serving against in flanders spain for conduct to myself can promise must at time while be in power decide to remain in ireland will obtain for full complete pardon restoration to right a irish subject of queen will also obtain reversal of attainder act of confiscation may have be passed against family on giving promise that will not take part in secret plot conspiracy against reigning family though in event of general rising in ireland with assistance perhaps of french army must be at liberty to choose own course of action without incurring more pain penalty than might befall native of ireland waging war against queen a godolphin marlborough be known to be by mean unfavourably disposed to cause of stuart desmond be hardly surprised at latter part of intimation though have small hope of being enabled to remain permanently at home be yet very welcome to certainly if remained in ireland must consider bound to hold aloof from jacobite plot although if country rose french army landed must unless considered cause hopeless one draw sword on behalf of whom considered a lawful sovereign be not sorry be honour to be turning back on country mike said a rode out from gate wine be good be more than can say for anything else in except that people be good catholic be starting longer journey than think mike be only going to duke now to ask for year leave though think that will be absent more than few month where be going honour if may make so bold a to ask be going to ireland mike mike looked at with astonishment to ireland honour sure will hang before set foot week in country have obtained safe conduct mike from lord godolphin remember nobleman kidnapped sure remember honour have given safe conduct be in luck be to be going back to ireland again be not visit of pleasure mike be going over to try to ascertain to branch of family belong what can matter honour be good name have made for out here have done well enough mike be tired of being asked by almost officer meet about family when in fact know nothing well captain doe not seem to worth troubling about for if know who be be little can have done for must seem so mike there be mystery about whole affair want to get to bottom of rode silently for distance knew that mike must go through fire water for that simple a seemed have ordinary amount of shrewdness determined to tell knew especially a intended to take to ireland with mike said at last suppose must like to pay visit to ireland also must that mike said emphatically be eighteen when came out here to enlist in brigade be twelve year ago now be few people must be likely to know again well be thinking of taking with mike a possibly may be of use in search will tell story related history of youth must be unfeeling baste to treat like mike exclaimed indignantly sure know name have heard spoken of a traitor who have gone over to enemy turned protestant to save estate be how must hear spoken of mike for be true a to treatment of depends whether be forced upon by threat be taken by out of friendship to father if be first of reason can not be blamed for keeping at distance if second certainly ought to have behaved differently explains why supporter of usurper must have sent out to france to fight against english be hard nut to crack mike agreed mighty hard honour will get to bottom of never fear why be going to duke master to get leave of absence can not disappear suddenly without asking for leave will of course tell duke of berwick exactly why be going feel sure will grant request without hesitation there be fighting to be done just at present even if there be one officer more le must make difference have relation in ireland mike none know of sir barring sister who be twelve year older than be little saw of for married when be bit of gossoon husband be killed in siege of limerick heard that after be over went to settle with cousin in cork whether be there now be married again be dead year ago be more than can say seeing have never heard of since be with husband in siege of limerick be that heard about from men who knew husband said after be killed went a servant in family of officer wife for bit officer be killed lady died of grief trouble be hard work have to live till place surrendered be know about honour might have be true might not be boy maybe bothered man with question just told what came into head to keep quiet well at rate mike a will most likely land at cork might try to find sister out if went through siege will know name of many of officer may have heard of kennedy maybe of dozen honour a loyal gentleman must be sure to be there what be name mike sure be same a own before married just norah callaghan so suppose mike desmond said with laugh be name of husband rooney have not thought of many year be sure be that be rooney now think of message came to from just before left country saying must ever be in neighbourhood be glad must be to see be to ask for mr rooney who lived with cousin larry callaghan ship carpenter in middle lane must find by river bank well be something to go by mike of course may have moved away long since if cousin be ship carpenter be not likely that must have left neighbourhood wonder honour never asked about kennedy from of officer who be at siege did not like to do so colonel came to conclusion must be son of murroch kennedy who came out soon after limerick surrendered be killed at breda two three month after joined brigade officer agreed with colonel that gentleman be probably father of course be contented that must be supposed so therefore asked question about other kennedy of late however have be worried over matter in irish regiment in spain a elsewhere be number of officer belonging to good old irish family though have got on well enough with in first place a berwick aide de camp afterwards a on staff of general here must see when in answer to question be evident knew little nothing of family there be sort of coolness in manner must quite understand counting back ancestor a did pretty nearly to flood at present doe not make difference to personally one way other be convinced that if by chance when get older must fall in love with daughter of officer of one of old family must not for moment listen to until must give proof have right to name bear at rate came of good family certainly at present must not assure on point only know have always be called kennedy that be under name be committed to care of father o'leary prof nothing more than that be name by john o'carroll wished to be called be a likely a not indeed good deal more likely that be not true one well at rate honour have made name of desmond kennedy well known liked among irish french officer for be slight thing that officer in infantry regiment must be taken on staff of duke of berwick be very well mike will not satisfy more than satisfies others so be resolved to try to get to bottom of affair even if have to go direct to john o'carroll though know that chance of telling anything be slight only way indeed that seems likely to lead to anything be to call upon a many of kennedy a can discover ask whether murroch kennedy who left ireland after siege of limerick married left child of two year old behind if so that child suddenly disappeared when father left for france there must be reason for assuming be child in question though why must have committed to charge of john o'carroll instead of to one of own family be not easily seen unless whole of kennedy be in such ill favour with english government that thought better to trust to one who be in good odour with supporter of dutch william be therefore safe from disturbance in estate sure honour be arguing out like counsellor there be gainsaying what have spoken have doubt will ferret out with head a have on shoulder be hard if can not circumvent ould rascal at kilkargan at rate will try while be visiting kennedy can be finding out people who be at limerick during siege gather can remember about kennedy there a desmond have expected duke a soon a heard story at once granted leave of absence hope may succeed kennedy said be poor lookout to be risking death continually in service of foreign king grant that have knack of making at home wherever may be there be irish officer in army in europe however successful irishman may be can not long to be among own people in own land if a tell lord godolphin will befriend for one will think worse of if settle down at home when have found family know that if sword must be again drawn with fair prospect of success will declare for rightful king must certainly do sir will assuredly give promise undertaking to abstain from joining royal army may be raised in ireland be not with intention of settling at home be going there simply a have told to discover to what family belong so that can have right to name bear at what port will embark intend to pay visit for few day to baron de pointdexter monsieur de la vallee after will cross into italy have doubt that will be able to find fisherman at toulon who will undertake to land somewhere near genoa where will be able to take passage in ship bound for england suppose take servant with with permission duke have be companion for three year be shrewd a well a brave will give valuable help in enquiry after remaining couple of day with berwick army desmond started with mike received warmest welcome from baron de pointdexter afterwards from philip wife then travelled on to toulon where desmond sold horse equipment left uniform mike there procured two civilian suit a anticipated experienced difficulty in arranging to be landed near genoa there found several ship bound for england ireland took passage in one must touch at cork on way to dublin voyage be uneventful ship have great draught of water proceeded up river to city first thing to do mike desmond said a stepped ashore be to get rid of clothes whose french cut will at once attract attention will get suit such a be worn by irish gentleman have better equip a servant livery be worn here quiet dress will be suitable put up at small inn remained there until suit such a desmond desired be made for mike found difficulty in purchasing ready made clothes suitable to new position desmond have taken room a mr kennedy have asked carelessly if there be family of name living in neighbourhood there be one who life short distance out of town be small house shame be that one of old family must come down so most of estate be stolen from after war still old man hold head a if be still lord of broad acre be mightily respected among gentry next day desmond hired horse rode out to house of mr kennedy be three mile from town sent in name be shown into room where tall man with somewhat haughty air received not unkindly name be same a own said though recognize name of desmond kennedy among such member of family a be acquainted with have just landed from france object in coming here be to obtain information a to father family hearing that gentleman of name lived here came first to may ask if be acquainted with murroch kennedy surely be be first cousin fought side by side at limerick be not one of who cared to enter foreign service estate be confiscated have ever since lived here on wreck of fortune taking part in politics cousin be of different mind did not indeed go out at once with greater part of army of limerick still hoping that cause be not altogether lost lived for month among mountain took part in rising be promptly suppressed then joined irish brigade received notification from one of brother officer that have fallen at battle of breda now may ask in turn what murroch kennedy relationship be to will tell sir first will kindly inform whether cousin left child about year old behind certainly not sir cousin be unmarried man at rate up to time when left ireland then sir question be at end may tell about time cousin left ireland be sent a infant to care of john o'carroll traitor of kilkargan be brought up under name of desmond kennedy showed little kindness nearly three year ago went abroad obtained commission in one of regiment in irish brigade now hold rank of captain for many reason be anxious to find out what family belong to be assumed by colonel fellow officer be son of murroch kennedy wished to ascertain whether be true with object obtained leave of absence made way back be sorry can give assistance sir assuredly be not son of cousin murroch kennedy have be john o'carroll traitor must have be last man to whom must have entrusted know well history of member of branch of family can answer with certainty that child be lost missing unaccounted for at time went out a be loyal gentleman none must have have dealing with john o'carroll who betrayed cause for brother died fighting at limerick will however jot down for information other branch of family of kennedy place of residence though fear that there be little probability of search being successful a during year have elapsed since late war many must have died others like cousin have taken service in one other of continental army moreover there be also possibility that name by be known be not own feel that sir fear that enquiry will not meet with success still will pursue until have at least proved can not belong to well known branch of family be much obliged to for having so courteously answered question for offer to give list of various branch of family for next few minute mr kennedy be engaged in making out list then handed to desmond now sir former went on that have finished what may consider business will tell little more about story naturally interest own be surprised that young gentleman who from what have told can not be much more than twenty year old have risen to rank of captain in brigade where so many officer have signally distinguished story too be interesting one seems to in many respect remarkable possibly when hear more of how came to be brought up by john o'carroll may throw light upon subject desmond gave detailed account of life a boy short sketch of subsequent adventure romantic story young sir mr kennedy said when have finished to whatever family belong must be proud of possessing so gallant member tell that have safe conduct did not mention how obtained desmond have abstained from making allusion to affair with lord godolphin to with earl of galway replied sir be secret that concern other people a well a consequently be not at liberty to explain may say however that be given to on engagement that visit to ireland be one of private nature only must in way meddle with politics when tell that duke of berwick granted necessary leave of absence will prove to that on part be well satisfied that safe conduct have be issued to without unworthy offer on part to princess anne minister after chatting for time longer desmond took leave returned to cork mike be standing at door of inn have have success mike have fared better have not found yet honour have great hope of doing so larry callaghan died four year ago woman of house occupied said that mr

can say that altogether desmond said for if have be known that james o'carroll have left heir estate must certainly have be confiscated whereas owing to brother turning protestant joining williamites be allowed to keep possession of can understand now what seemed so strange namely that feared might somehow learn be nephew heir to estate therefore behaved a if be son of stranger when be old enough sent off to join irish brigade in hope that have seen last of for even if not killed must never be able to set foot in ireland again after fighting for france 't be strange that none of father brother officer ever made enquiry about went with army to france sir knew of course that child be born though may never have seen for mistress never left bed after be born naturally after death lost sight of might well have believed that child have died must give name of officer who came to house mr rooney many of may be alive still testimony that child be born must be most important for at present there be only word against john o'carroll there be more than sir be baptized on day died mistress gave paper priest have given to saying that be of greatest importance to be to give to mr john o'carroll when a promised took child to did give desmond asked eagerly honour took with to castle from reception got thought best to say nothing about to give to yourself when be old enough have got at home now there be certifying that gerald o'carroll son of james o'carroll wife elizabeth be baptized by on th of september be fortunate indeed desmond exclaimed now tell how uncle of mine received faith honour be mightily put out at first said that be impostor that must have given in charge told that have proof that what said be true that there be many gentleman officer of mr james who must speak for say in court that son be born to brother before died wanted to get out of what proof have who be officer told that be business then cooled down after time said that if be to let be known that mr james have left son estate must surely be confiscated seeing that father died a rebel fighting against king that a soon a persecution have ceased must be safe to do so must say who child be give rightful place seemed reasonable enough so left with have always supposed that kept word that a soon a be safe acknowledged to be master of father estate now mr rooney must think matter over see how have best proceed feel how much owe to if recover estate will see be not ungrateful will come again tomorrow morning bring with certificate of baptism name that can recollect of officer who be intimate with father chapter gerald o'carroll mike who have remained silent during conversation between sister desmond returned to room after seeing out well mike have rendered many service be greatest of little did think when said have found sister that be coming to morning that must be able to clear up mystery of birth to place in position to prove son of james o'carroll say that will regain estate having be in brigade will certainly render difficult for to do so though possibly with patronage of lord godolphin may succeed for however care comparatively little object in coming here be to obtain proof belong to good irish family have doubt will be able to establish what be to call honour now that know be captain gerald o'carroll not desmond kennedy at at rate must remain desmond kennedy at present mike be under name safe conduct be made out if be arrested a gerald o'carroll must be protection to however will not want to use long for seems to that first step must be to return to france to see of officer who knew father be aware of birth testimony must be of great value without there must be little chance of sister evidence being believed there be paper honour yes will show that child be born proof be child rest entirely with sister might have died when mother did must say that sister be trying to palm off own child someone else a of course mr callaghan must be able to prove that sister arrived immediately after surrender of limerick bringing child with that said be son of james o'carroll that went year later to kilkargan left there with john o'carroll moreover must get plenty of evidence from on estate be child so left likeness norah saw between father might be taken a proof sir did not think of mike yes if of officer will also testify to likeness will greatly strengthen case chain of evidence seems pretty strong first there be certificate of baptism sister declaration be entrusted to by mother on deathbed supported by mr callaghan declaration that three week later arrived in cork with child told be that of james o'carroll sister declaration that took to kilkargan handed over to uncle must be supported by evidence of woman first placed with while servant of castle must prove be brought by woman who hour later left castle without speaking to anyone uncle john o'carroll will find difficult to explain why took in who be kennedy of whom be son what service have rendered for protestant williamite to have undertaken charge of child of rebel there be doubt that weight of evidence be on side whether judge must decide in favour of son of rebel a against friend of english party be doubtful possibly lord godolphin influence might be exerted in favour promised in letter to to do service in power still even if lose estate may well do on ground of father having fought died for cause of james second must still have satisfaction of establishing name consider of more importance than estate sure honour be grand thing to belong to good old irish stock for must rather be mike callaghan have fine estate than mike o'neil without acre of land desmond smiled there be common sense in what say mike there be nothing more unpleasant than when be with number of irish gentleman spanish grandee who be equally proud of ancestor to be unable to give account of family even to be sure that have right to name that bear well honour be matter of taste a for if whisky be good make differ to whether call cork dublin whether be made up in mountain have sorra name at next morning mr rooney returned with certificate of baptism list containing twenty name of officer who have be frequent visitor at james o'carroll among desmond to satisfaction found arthur dillon walter burke nicholas fitzgerald dominic sheldon of whom now held rank of general in french service to of whom be personally known having met when with berwick in spain name be good enough said if can testify to likeness to father will go long way towards furnishing proof when required of entered service under provision of treaty of limerick therefore testimony can not be treated a of traitor name must be a well known in england a in france now mike business here be for present concluded will at once return to france see officer who be still alive obtain if possible recognition a have year leave can travel about a choose then will decide whether will commence action in court whether will first go over to england see lord godolphin explain circumstance to ask for protection patronage suppose case must be tried at dublin where judge be creature of england there can be doubt that notification from godolphin that considered claim to be good one be favourable to must have slight influence with must counteract to extent fact of uncle being protestant what must consider loyal man before beginning action must certainly communicate with uncle call upon to resign in favour for must avoid scandal of proving o'carroll to be scoundrel a well a traitor a have turned out step thought must disembarrass of have have other effect for if have not gone out to france must never have be troubled by question about family must not have met mike known of existence of sister only person who must clear up matter will begin to think what o'neil obeullivan used to say that luck must carry through anything certainly at present have be marvellous way will go back honour not way came if can help be nearly month coming from genoa might have be twice a long if wind have not be fairly favourable think best plan will be to take passage by sea to london there will have difficulty in finding vessel bound for rotterdam hague then will buy horse ride along by rhine if can get through luxembourg into france will do so think will perhaps be best to go on through switzerland pas frontier somewhere near lyon where will be short distance from berwick headquarters in dauphiny month later rode into duke camp have on leaving toulon packed up uniform sent to care of friend on general staff to quarter first went having changed civilian costume for military one desmond waited on duke why captain kennedy duke said in surprise did not look to see again so soon have be over to ireland have sir though there only few day gained information necessitated return here have found out that name go by be not mine that proper name be gerald o'carroll son of major james o'carroll who fought by side at boyne be through first siege of limerick with that explains face have often puzzled seemed to that recognized yet must not recall whose face be that resembled so strongly now tell know at once father when first knew be few year older than be have same figure face expression so be son by what miracle have discovered relationship to desmond a must now be called gerald related a briefly a possible manner in have discovered parentage uncle must be thorough villain duke said hotly that be traitor knew that must thus rob brother son of inheritance be monstrous unnatural be glad indeed sir that have thus recognized testimony will go for much even in english court hope to receive similar recognition from officer who be intimate with father in second siege whose name have here duke glanced down list well nigh half of be still alive said of be men of rank repute whose word must be taken even by enemy how do mean to proceed because be afraid that even if must spare there must be difficulty about making appearance in court in england ireland quite see that be out of question can hope for be such of a recognize likeness to father will draw up paper saying so will attest before notary having a witness men of weight honour equal to own production of such certificate must not have strong influence in favour will most willingly sign such document duke said four of best known general can sign a witness to signature thank most heartily sir such document must in be considered a ample proof of strong resemblance to father may may not be duke said be content with get a many of others a possible to make similar declaration one man may see likeness where doe not if dozen men agree in recognizing declaration must have great weight certainly irish judge must doubt testimony of so many men whose family whose deed be so well known to from dauphiny gerald travelled first into spain three irish officer there whose name be on list recognized likeness even before told name put question to in general way have learned sir that name bear be not own be son of officer who be killed in siege of limerick may ask if can recognize likeness between officer with whom be well acquainted there in case after little consideration declared that must be son of james o'carroll remembered that comrade wife have borne son shortly before end of siege remembered death none have heard what became of child for in excitement of closing scene of preparation for march immediately afterwards have have little time on hand be hitherto supposed that have like so many other infant perished miserably willingly signed document similar to have received from berwick met with almost equal success on northern frontier only two out of eight officer failing to identify by likeness until mentioned name when too acknowledged now recalled james o'carroll face saw that likeness be striking one having obtained document resumed civilian attire riding by crossroad passed through flanders to sluys without coming in contact with body of allied troop there have difficulty in obtaining passage to london on arrival called upon lord godolphin who received cordially so have utilized safe conduct captain kennedy be glad to see former captor be a grateful a ever to for silence maintained a to affair if have be known to enemy must never have heard last of must have made such laughingstock must scarcely have retained office now what can do for be long story lord then can not listen to now if will sup with here at nine o'clock evening will be glad to hear be so harassed by backstair intrigue of enemy that must be relief to to have something else to think of gerald returned at appointed time nothing be said a to affair while supper be served after table have be cleared decanter of port placed on table servant have retired godolphin said now captain kennedy let hear about gerald related history of younger day of manner in have discovered real parentage producing certificate of baptism statement have be drawn up at cork signed by norah rooney testimony of duke of berwick other irish officer there can be doubt whatever in mind of fair man lord godolphin said after listening attentively to whole story examining document that uncle john o'carroll be villain that have be most unjustly deprived of right know by name from report of agent in ireland a one of men who turned coat changed religion to save estate men heartily despise while who gave up went into exile in order a believed there to serve cause of rightful sovereign be men to be admired respected be assured that justice will be done of course will take action in court will first summon to give up estate will let know have indisputable evidence to prove be son of elder brother will say that if will give up possession peaceably will take further step in matter for sake of family name if refuse a fear be probable must then employ lawyer yes good one will furnish with letter to lord lieutenant to lord chief justice cox strongly recommending to requesting latter to appoint one of law officer of crown to take up case must say that when john o'carroll see that have such powerful friend will perceive that be hopeless for to struggle in so bad cause will very speedily accept term though methinks be hard that so great villain must go unpunished now will be a well that must have something stronger than safe conduct sent will therefore draw out document for majesty to sign granting full free pardon for offence that may have committed against realm also settling upon estate to be rightful heir in about barony of kilkargan being influenced in so doing by great service rendered by to majesty well beloved faithful minister counsellor to trusty general earl of galway queen be not very likely to ask nature of service unless be something that concern asks few question sign readily enough document laid before if asks be offence for grant pardon will say when boy be maliciously sent abroad to join irish brigade by uncle who wished thus to rid of altogether who have foully wronged by withholding name from others will also add that have distinguished much have gained friendship of half brother duke of berwick know that queen in heart of heart must rather that brother whom jacobite call james third must succeed her than elector of hanover for whom have love thank greatly indeed lord never be man so amply rewarded for merely holding tongue be not only that sir be conduct in general to might have left tied up in house to be found in morning to be made jest of town instead of conducted guarded hither so contrived that whisper spread abroad have be carried off between saint james own house trusted to honour in not causing pursuit of to be set on foot behaved in way a gallant young gentleman certainly gained high esteem for daring ingenuity with carried out plan for obtaining passage to france for personal conduct towards where be lodging at eagle hard by abbey remain there until hear from be impatient must choose time when queen be in good temper be in such hurry to get rid of in order to plot gossip with mistress harley who be now prime favourite that be ready to sign document may lay before feeling that cause be a good a won gerald returned in high spirit to inn where delighted mike by relating how great minister have promised to forward suit ah honour will be grand day when take possession of kilkargan bonfire rejoicing of sort lashing of drink wo all boy in barony be glad to be free from traitor to have true heir come to be master none le glad will be sister must fetch from cork mike be owing to that be alive will be owing to if recover estate will have place of honour on occasion though gentry in neighbourhood be there when tell what have done for will say that well deserves honour will go no more to war captain o'carroll mike have be three year in french army have seen enough of fighting worse still of fighting against men of own nation besides if queen grant estate of father will consider bound in honour not to draw sword against to mix up in plot conspiracy to remain strictly neutral whatever may be going on indeed more think of more doubt whether must be for good of ireland did stuart return to throne must only be done at further cost of blood misery old religious quarrel must break out more fiercely than ever there must be rising civil war confiscation massacre whichever side happened to get upper hand james third be lawful sovereign of three kingdom will always uphold there be case when be to benefit of country at large that there must be change in succession sure may be so honour yet be hard that man must be kept out of own doubt be hard be far harder that thousand of people must be killed ten of thousand ruined for sake of one man so be sir so be sure enough when one come to think of ireland have suffered mightily in cause of stuart suppose that if king james succeeded to throne english minister must let turn out men who have taken place land of old family that certainly must not mike when charles second returned from exile who have fought suffered for thought that must recover estate turn out cromwell men to whom have be granted be disappointed king found that must not make so great change without upsetting whole country that attempt to do so must cost crown may be sure that james must find equal difficulty be to come to throne well well honour know more of such matter than do have doubt that be right be sure want bad time to come over again in ireland three day later gerald received message from lord godolphin saying that wished to see on going to house minister handed to paper with full pardon confirmation of ownership in father estate together with letter to lord lieutenant lord chief justice cox next day took ship for dublin on arriving there presented letter be well received by to whom be directed lord lieutenant said be enough for mr o'carroll lord godolphin speaks of in such high term question not that have thoroughly satisfied a to right to estate at same time must be glad if will give brief outline of how be that never claimed before though perhaps be a well that did not do so for until passion excited by war have somewhat subsided friend of government must hardly have interposed for benefit of son of one who have died fighting for james gerald have drawn up three copy of statement containing precis of case handed one of to lord lieutenant saying a story be somewhat long one lord have written down in order that might read at leisure will certainly do so mr o'carroll must like to be personally acquainted with detail of matter will doubtless excite considerable stir be believe first time that supporter of government have have to defend title against one of family fought on other side be hardly case of royalist rebel sir deliberate action of man suppressing knowledge of existence of own nephew in order that might obtain property of dead brother have doubt have be known be in existence must still have be thrust aside in order to reward adhesion to cause of william must have made position intolerable a one who have changed religion politics be regarded a traitor by people of barony avoided by gentry round feeling must have be infinitely stronger if have be known that be keeping own nephew out of inheritance father be a understand immensely popular doubt whether brother must have dared to show face within fifty mile of kilkargan have be known that not only be traitor usurper lord lieutenant smiled be not surprised at warmth mr o'carroll unfortunately case be not solitary one there be thousand of men in ireland who have suffered for deed of father however will understand case better when have read statement be evident to gerald that lord chief justice who have taken leading part in prosecution punishment of person known to be favourable to jacobite cause be not altogether pleased with lord godolphin letter strange affair said strange a appears to unfortunate business however sir went on with changed tone will certainly do best to see justice done in accordance with lordship request will read carefully through statement of claim after considering place in hand of crown lawyer seems to that own position here be strange one that be liable to arrest a member of family whose head be one of late king strongest adherent own position sir be regulated by document bearing signature of queen chief minister laid official paper before cox that certainly settle that question latter said after perusing of course will for own satisfaction read statement wish to see document proof may posse in matter must of course lay before counsel think ca do better than give letter to mr counsellor fergusson with whom can go into particular who will advise a to course that have best take mr fergusson although one of crown lawyer enjoyed wide reputation even among jacobite party for moderation fairness with conducted crown case placed in hand have le employment than colleague for only case in evidence of act of hostility to crown be indisputable be committed to having be found that be unwilling to be party to calling doubtful witness to using mean be in majority of case employed to obtain conviction lord chief justice letter to be a follows dear mr counsellor fergusson have be requested by lord godolphin to place case of bearer of letter in good hand can not better carry out request than by asking to act in matter lord godolphin have expressed most strongly a to justness of claim bearer father be state james o'carroll noted rebel who be killed at siege of limerick alone must might have be thought have proved bar to action on part against present possessor of property be bearer of document signed by queen reinstating in right may posse notwithstanding action of father of be not for to make comment upon royal document though may say that fear may give rise to other suit alarm many loyal subject who have become possessed of confiscated estate however must hope that will not be so a be expressly stated that in instance pardon restoration of right be given in consideration of service rendered by young gentleman to lord godolphin to earl of galway what nature of service may have be doe not concern gerald carried letter to address indicated on saying that be bearer of letter from lord chief justice be at once shown into counsellor room latter man of fifty five year old with feature told of scottish extraction with keen eye kindly face took letter gerald presented to begged to be seated while read a glanced through look of surprise came across face read letter carefully then looked at gerald keenly be fortunate in having such good friend mr o'carroll said before go into case will let know something about be take twenty year of age be few month past nineteen by figure must have put a three year older by face two year must have be fortunate indeed to have gained protection of lord godolphin earl of galway le than must have sufficed to gain for rescript of majesty now sir please to give outline of case a to nature of be at present entirely ignorant have put down in writing sir gerald said handing third copy of statement will take time to read mr o'carroll must rather do so alone ask question may occur to afterwards will therefore call upon again in hour time upon gerald return counsellor said be strange story mr o'carroll very disgraceful one allude see to testimony of irish officer in french service a to likeness to late mr james o'carroll will please let see here be sir together with sworn statement by nurse lawyer read document through carefully testimony of duke of berwick of other honourable well known irish gentleman a to striking likeness between mr james o'carroll can not carry immense weight in mind of unprejudiced person prove too conclusively that james o'carroll left infant boy behind statement of nurse go long way to prove be that son think that be substantiated by conduct of john o'carroll first in receiving undertaking care secondly in neglect must almost say dislike manifested towards child have sheltered thirdly in extraordinary step that professedly loyal subject of majesty took in sending off to enlist in brigade composed of devoted adherent of son of james second doubt at rate can arise that be child brought by mr rooney to kilkargan can be proved beyond question fact that nurse be sent off without having conversation save with john o'carroll must show how anxious be that one must know errand must say that have shown great acumen in mustering evidence of kind must bear upon question say frankly without royal rescript influence of two nobleman chance a james o'carroll son of wresting patrimony from hand of uncle must be small indeed politics have much more than fact to do with decision here with such powerful credential with chief minister of england interfering on behalf think that there be great doubt that will secure judgment in favour when fact be known feeling of greater portion of population will run strongly with against unnatural uncle of yours must be desirous if possible sir of avoiding public trial must bring discredit upon name of family must in eye of supporter of present government act prejudicially to myself be quite right how do propose to proceed be thinking sir of sending statement to uncle similar to laid before going somewhat further into detail promising that if must surrender property to publicly acknowledge a nephew giving what reason chose for having so long concealed knowledge of fact must take proceeding against must do best to prevent discredit falling upon must do very well lawyer said must abstain from making allusion to protector have gained will learn soon enough will be well to see what first impulse be name of duke of berwick others who have testified to likeness to late father simply say that many of comrade have recognized likeness to be of use showing card have to play must not send letter by post by hand if like will despatch one of own messenger down with with instruction to bring back answer not to say anything if questioned a to being in employment next morning messenger started by coach for kilkargan returned four day later bearing john o'carroll answer read a follows sir have received audacious letter proclaim to be impostor worthy of severest punishment for attempting to personate son of late brother however for sake of friendship for mr kennedy father give twenty four hour to leave country before laying information against a impostor a rebel who have served against army of majesty will however at once apply for writ ordering arrest will be served upon within twenty four hour of receipt of communication will also have woman pretended nurse arrested for perjury conspiracy gerald took letter to counsellor be exactly what expected said after reading show man in true colour will see what say when learns who be employed against what protection have obtained opinion be that before many hour have passed will receive letter in different strain consider by mean improbable that lord chief justice will have written to privately warning that have received full pardon be restored to right that be strongly supported by lord godolphin who have written to lord lieutenant in favour that have also protection of earl of galway officer who posse confidence of majesty that duke of berwick many of best known irish officer in service of france have given testimony in most positive manner of likeness to james o'carroll whom knew intimately will say that at request of lord godolphin that matter must be placed in hand of one of crown lawyer have be submitted to that in opinion wrote after interview decision in favour be inevitable strongly advising to make best compromise with in power same evening indeed mounted messenger who have ridden posthaste from kilkargan arrived with letter from john o'carroll began dear nephew wrote yesterday in haste on receipt of communication seemed to that be rushing on destruction by avowing to be son of brother james that must be liable to be arrested a jacobite agent in service of france therefore wrote letter did in hope that must leave country for time have not yet arrived when must safely be recognized by a rightful owner of kilkargan have heard however that have received full pardon for past offence restitution of right be only too glad to be able to retire from false position in be placed by incurred hostility dislike of neighbour tenant a know have lived almost solitary life here have spent far le than income of estate be well aware that acting a have done a trustee have right to demand from account of rent have received trust that will not press matter a will at once come in for receipt of rent will be enabled to live in comfort in dublin upon saving have effected small property received a younger brother portion will of course understand why during stay here refrained from outward demonstration of affection for felt that suspicion might have arisen have not done so that be brother son in case estate must surely have be confiscated seeing that bent of inclination be for active stirring life a english army be barred to thought best that must go abroad so be out of way until time must come when matter must so quieten down in ireland that influence might avail to secure indemnity for for serving in france enable to hand over estate to affectionate uncle john o'carroll gerald laughed aloud a read letter be good news honour mike who happened to be busy in room asked nothing must be better dear uncle have heard that lord godolphin earl of galway have become patron that queen have restored to right mr counsellor fergusson have taken up case therefore declares that a be always intention to restore estate to a soon a must safely return be now ready to do so only hope that will not insist upon handing over back rent indeed question whether must do a estate be granted to personally by government however of course will not press that will be only too glad to obtain possession without scandal of having to show in public court that father brother be villain ould fox mike exclaimed indignantly felt sure when told what counsellor have said that must wriggle out of somehow must give gold piece have in belt for hour talk with with good shillelah well can afford to let bygone be bygone mike after did service unwittingly in sending over to france in first place have three year of stirring life in next have made many good friend have gained patronage of two powerful nobleman without must have assuredly never come in for kilkargan at be true for honour without might be still private in o'brien regiment instead of being honour body servant friend mike yes sir a be good enough to say so mr fergusson put john o'carroll letter down with gesture of disgust after have read be what might have be expected from such man said traitor to cause once adhered to false to religion usurper of nephew right at rate mr o'carroll congratulate have prevented grievous scandal from being made public large expenditure entailed by case have now only to go down take possession will write to uncle give week to clear out to make what explanation chooses of change gerald wrote at once to uncle be coldly worded showed unmistakably that be in way deceived by profession in letter told that considered fair that must retain saving have made a have personally be confirmed in ownership of government being ignorant that brother have left son said that thought must be more pleasant for of that must not meet wished therefore that must leave before arrival to take possession john o'carroll at once summoned tenant astonished by informing that be glad to say be free at last to lay down position have held a owner of kilkargan that brother james have left son whom knew a desmond kennedy whom have be obliged to treat with coldness lest suspicion must be excited a to identity have be known must assuredly have be proscribed a son of rebel debarred by law from inheritance be delighted to say that time have come when must publicly acknowledge place in possession of estate a majesty have granted special indemnity against pain penalty incurred by father act of rebellion treason have restored to full right burst of cheering such a have not be heard in kilkargan since james o'carroll rode out at head of troop raised among tenantry to fight for king james greeted announcement for first time since event john o'carroll be for moment popular subsequent reflection knowledge of character soon dissipated that feeling in joy at announced approaching arrival of new master john o'carroll rode away with follower without manifestation of hostility must otherwise have attended departure bonfire blazed over barony when gerald rode in accompanied by mike tenant number of gentry who have known when boy assembled at castle to meet even father must not have met with more enthusiastic welcome than be given next day gerald wrote to duke of berwick telling what have taken place resigning commission in irish brigade intend said to abstain from part in politics although condition be made in pardon for serving abroad in restoration of estate feel that having accepted favour must hold aloof from plot against queen anne though heart will still be with whom hold to be lawful sovereign unless large army from france be landed here believe that attempt at restoration must only bring down fresh misery upon ireland must force land must render success almost certainty must then with great bulk of countryman join in due time received answer approving course have taken duke said be under delusion with ten regiment of irish brigade twenty thousand french troop arm sufficient to distribute to whole country believe that ireland scotland might again come under rule of stuart nothing short of such force must be of avail so convinced be of in after successful defence of limerick saw that cause be for time lost that further resistance must only prove disastrous to ireland therefore resigned command
