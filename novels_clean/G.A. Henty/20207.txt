weariness with doing nothing if move soon said captain o'grady who with dick ryan have ridden over to spend afternoon with terence o'connor whose regiment of portuguese be encamped six mile out of abrantes where division to mayo fusilier belonged be stationed here be in june sun getting hotter hotter whisky just come to end though have be mighty sparing over nothing to eat ration beef begorrah if be for bastely drill must forget be soldier at must take meself for convict condemned to stop life in one place at first there be something to do for one must forage for food dacent to eat now believe there be a much a old hen left within fifteen mile a for duck goose have almost forgotten taste of be not lively work o'grady be worse for here have got dicky ryan to stir up keep alive o'flaherty to look after health see that exceed allowance while practically have one herrara to speak to for though bull macwitty be excellent fellow in way be not much a companion however think must be nearly at end of have got pretty well troop up here except who be to remain at lisbon see men o'grady said see victual ca march until get transport food where be to come from one seems to know be afraid will do badly for time in respect o'grady sir arthur have not have time yet to find out what humbug spaniard be what wholesale lie tell of course have slight experience of when first landed at mondego take longer than to get at bottom of want of faith craddock learnt after bitter experience so did moore have doubt that spaniard have represented to sir arthur that have large disciplined army that french have be reduced to mere handful that be only waiting for advance to drive across frontier also doubt have promised to find amount of transport provision a soon a enters spain a to relying upon cuesta might a well rely upon assistance of army of hare commanded by pig headed owl ca make out o'grady said what want to have anything to do with spaniard for at if be in sir arthur place must just march straight against french thrash that sound well o'grady know very little about where french be what be doing what be strength think that will allow though have beaten time have met fought well at rolica be three to one against at vimiera have advantage of strong position at corunna thing be pretty well even have back to wall be afraid o'grady just at present be scarcely qualified to take command of army except only on one point thoroughly distrust spaniard well dick have be having fun lately be not to be done terence everyone be too disgusted out of temper to make safe even chief be dangerous must a soon think of playing joke on wandering tiger a on major be not man to trifle with at best of time except o'flaherty there be not man among who have good word to throw at dog faith when one think of good time one used to have at athlone be heartbreaking well come in refresh yourselves have bottle two still left be good news o'grady said fervently have be on tip of tongue to ask for mouth be like oven be so afraid must say be gone dare open lip about to tell truth o'grady except when of fellow come over there be not whisky touched in camp have kept strictly for sergeant who have be helping to teach men drill coaching non commissioned officer have be hard work for have stuck to well thought of allowance at end of day work have done wonder with made very fair show when came in now think two battalion must work with best here without doing discredit non commissioned officer have always be weak point now fellow know work very fairly go at with will see be very proud of corp have spared pain to make worthy of of course what may call purely parade movement be not done a be by infantry in useful work must back against here be very fair shot too have paid for lot of extra ammunition confess bought from of native levy doubt must get into row over if be known a fellow be not likely ever to fire shot against french be of importance that mine must be able to shoot well did hesitate to do fortunately regimental chest be not empty officer have given third of pay to help have certainly done lot of good shooting have greatly improved since came here have be working steadily at portuguese terence ever since spoke to about one have end of time on one hand really be getting on very fairly be right dicky if win campaign will certainly ask for a adjutant will be awfully glad to have with really do want adjutant for battalion o'grady well ca report favourably of meself at at tried hard for week be fault of tongue not of ca get to twist to outlandish word be willing enough tongue be be afraid be necessity officer in corp must speak bastely language must have to stay at home be afraid that be quite necessary o'grady terence laughed adjutant who must not make must be of shadow of use know how must like to have with upon other hand there must be inconvenience be a have said many time superior officer in army really must not like to have to give order then again bull macwitty be still more junior having only received commission few month back must feel just a uncomfortable a must at having under think that must do at besides know be not fond of work by mean there must be more to do in regiment like than in one of own suppose that must be so terence o'grady said resignedly a emptied tumbler besides there be sort of superstition in service that adjutant must be always able to walk straight to tent even after warm night at mess now although seems to have other qualification in respect must be failure imagine that in portuguese regiment thing must be looked at more seriously than be in irish one where matter occurs occasionally among men a well a officer be quite true o'grady portuguese be sober people must not a say be able to make same allowance for weakness that irish soldier do seeing that be too common for men to be either one way other however ryan do hope will be able to get never have much hope of o'grady failure of tongue to aid in vigorous effort to learn language seems to quite settle matter a far a be concerned at moment orderly rode up to tent terence went out despatch from headquarters sir trooper said saluting all right man have better wait for five minute see if answer be required going into tent opened despatch hooray said a glanced at content here be movement at last letter be a follows colonel o'connor will at once march with force to plasencia will reconnoitre country between town tagus to south bejar to north will ascertain a far a possible position movement of french army under victor will send daily report of observation to headquarters twenty portuguese cavalry under subaltern will be attached to command will furnish orderly to carry report be desirable that colonel o'connor troop must not come in contact with enemy except to check reconnoitring party moving towards castello branco villa velha be most necessary to prevent news of advance of army in direction reaching enemy to give earliest possible information of hostile gathering might menace flank of army while on march pass of banos periles will be held by troop of marshal beresford general del parque be to country between mountain marshal cuesta force at almaraz that colonel o'connor be directed to concentrate attention in case of being attacked by superior force colonel o'connor will if possible retreat into mountain on left flank maintain there open communication with lord beresford force at banos bejar colonel o'connor be authorized to requisition six cart from quartermaster department to hand over tent to to draw round of ball cartridge such ration a may be able to carry with paymaster have received authority to hand over to pound for payment of supply for men when sum be exhausted colonel o'connor be authorized to issue order for supply payable by paymaster to force exercising strictest economy sending notification to paymaster general of issue of such order despatch be confidential direction of route be on account to be divulged hear that o'grady too dicky ought not to have read despatch out loud however know will keep matter secret may trust for terence for be secret worth knowing be evident that sir arthur be going to join cuesta make dash on madrid well have be long enough in making up mind be satisfaction that be likely to have hot work at last though wish must have done without spaniard have seen enough of to know that nothing beyond kind word be to be expected of when time for fighting come must rather that depended upon ourselves than have to act with fellow on whom there be reliance whatever to be placed agree with there heartily o'grady however thank goodness be going to set out at last be very glad that fall to to act a vanguard of army instead of being attached to beresford command kept stationary in pass now must be at work daresay will meet again before long terence wrote acknowledgment of receipt of general order handed to orderly who have brought bugler at once sounded field officer call be to march at once said when herrara bull macwitty arrived let tent be struck handed over to quartermaster department see that men have four day biscuit in haversack battalion be to take three cart with will go to quartermaster department to draw tell off six men from battalion to accompany take charge of cart battalion will carry round of spare ammunition chest of pound will requisition from commissariat a much biscuit a can carry twenty bullock for battalion to be driven with cart a soon a cart be obtained men will drive to ordnance store for ammunition to commissariat store to load up food have better send officer in charge of men of battalion will myself draw money from paymaster will go there at once send couple of men with for of course will be paid in silver then will go to quartermaster store get cart ready by time that men arrive want to march in hour time at latest in few minute camp be scene of bustle activity tent be struck packed away in bag piled in order to be handed over to quartermaster in few minute over hour from receipt of order two battalion be in motion after twenty mile march halted for night near frontier hour later be joined by twenty trooper of portuguese regiment under command of subaltern next day marched through plasencia halted for night on slope of sierra orderly be despatched next morning to officer in command of force that there might be at banos informing of position that have taken up terence ordered two company to remain at spot be at head of little stream running down into affluent of tagus position being now nearly due north of almaraz from be distant twenty mile rest of force descended into plain took post at various village between sierra oropesa most advanced party halting four mile from town french force under victor have in accordance with order from madrid fallen back from plasencia week before taken up quarter at talavera at time when regiment received uniform terence have ordered that twenty suit of men peasant clothes must be retained in store specially intelligent men being chosen twenty of be sent forward towards river alberche to discover victor position brought in news that have placed troop behind river that cuesta who have at one time advanced guard at oropesa have recalled to almaraz party of victor cavalry be patrolling country between talavera oropesa terence have sent bull with five hundred men to occupy pass across sierra with order to capture orderly messenger who might come along day later four men brought in french officer who have be captured on road leading south be bearer of letter from soult to king be at once sent under escort of four trooper to headquarters men who have brought in officer reported that have learned that wilson with command of four thousand men be in mountain north of escurial that spy from officer have ascertained that there be great alarm in madrid where news of british advance towards plasencia be already known that be feared that force with cuesta army at almaraz venegas ' army in la mancha be about to combine in attack upon capital indeed be sir arthur plan have be arranged with supreme junta junta however being jealous of cuesta have given secret instruction to venegas to keep aloof on arrival at english general have learned at once hollowness of spanish promise have be assured of ample supply of food mule cart for transport have on strength of statement advanced with small supply for little food few animal must be obtained in portugal found on arriving that preparation have be made army thus early in campaign be put on half ration day after day passed without of promised supply arriving sir arthur wrote to supreme junta saying that although in accordance with agreement must march to alberche must not cross that river unless promise have be made be kept to letter have by time learned that french force north of mountain be much more formidable than spanish report have led to believe still greatly underrated soult army be altogether ignorant that ney have evacuated galicia be marching south with speed with command del parque have failed in promise to garrison bejar banos pass be now only held by few hundred of cuesta spaniard week after taking up position north of oropesa terence received order to move with two battalion to take post to guard pass with left resting on bejar right in communication with wilson force detachment be at once recalled thousand men be posted near bejar rest divided among other pass by french army from north must cross sierra a soon a arrangement be made terence rode to wilson headquarters be received very cordially by officer be heartily glad to see colonel o'connor latter said of course have heard of doings of battalion be glad indeed to have support sent messenger off only morning to sir arthur telling that from information brought in by spy be convinced that soult be much stronger than have be supposed that if move south will scarce be able to hold pass of arena san pedro barnardo that can certainly spare men for defence of more westerly one by soult be likely to march from salamanca however now be there will feel safe doubt must hinder advance sir robert terence said certainly must not hope to bar pass to french army have artillery though men be steady enough against infantry doubt whether must be able to withstand attack heralded by heavy cannonade with couple of battery of artillery to sweep pass one might make fair stand for time against greatly superior force with only infantry one must not hope to maintain one position quite so sir arthur must not expect own opinion be that will have fifty thousand men coming down from north have told chief a much naturally will believe assurance of spanish junta rather than report gathered by spy doubt hope to crush victor altogether before soult make movement trust to venegas ' advance from south towards upper tagus to cause don joseph to evacuate madrid a soon a hears of victor defeat have certainly no faith whatever in venegas cuesta cuesta be loyal enough be obstinate pig headed at present be furious because supreme junta have be sending best troop to venegas instead of to know well enough that perpetual intriguer frere be working underhand to get albuquerque appointed to supreme command a to venegas be mere tool of supreme junta a likely a not will order to hing keep army intact then again delay at plasencia have upset sir arthur arrangement have pressed straight forward on th of last month when crossed frontier disregarding cuesta altogether must have be at madrid long before for know at time victor force have be so weakened that have between fourteen fifteen thousand men must have fallen back without fighting now have again got troop have be taken from will be further reinforced before sir arthur arrives on alberche of course soult have have plenty of time to get everything in readiness to cross mountain fall upon british rear a soon a hears that be fairly on way towards madrid here be at th force will only reach oropesa today victor be evidently afraid that sir arthur will move from oropesa towards hill pas upper alberche so place between madrid for strong force of cavalry reconnoitred in direction morning must not be a well sir said terence if be to arrange signal by must aid other hill top can be seen from hill beyond be little village where have established noticed morning before started if must keep lookout on hill must have one on mine might get three bonfire hundred yard apart ready for lighting if hear of great force approaching defile be watching must summon aid either by day night by fire in same way if soult must advance by line that be guarding must summon men be really well trained in sort of work must trust to make obstinate defence think that idea be very good one will certainly carry out see be really of protecting left flank of army can certainly do so more effectually if work together might too arrange signal one fire might mean that for reason other be marching away may have order to move distance towards madrid so a to compel victor to weaken by detaching force to check may be ordered a army advance to leave defile in charge of spaniard to accompany army two fire might mean spy have reported general advance of french coming by several route thus see must be in readiness for emergency must be extremely glad of help if soult come way own corp of men be fairly good soldier can rely upon to do best other have be recently raised think that dependence can be placed upon in case of hard fighting with two battalion ought to be able to hold of defile for considerable time two day later terence received order to march instantly with force down into valley to follow foot of hill until reached alberche when be to report arrival wait until received order check advance of french force endeavouring to move round left flank of british evening before one signal fire have announced that wilson be on move thinking that too might be summoned terence have called in outpost be able to march quarter of hour after received order have learned on evening returned from visit to sir robert from men sent down into plain for purpose that cuesta army that of sir arthur have advanced together from oropesa be glad at order to join army a have felt that must soult advance force unprovided a be with gun must be able to offer very temporary resistance especially if french marshal be at head of force anything like a strong a be reported by peasantry a to however have very strong doubt having come to distrust thoroughly report given by spaniard knew that be a ready under influence of fear to exaggerate force of enemy a be at other time to magnify own number sir arthur must thought be far better informed than must be for men being portuguese be viewed with doubt suspicion by spanish peasantry who must probably take pleasure in misleading altogether short stay in mountain have braced up men with only short halt made forty mile march to alberche by midnight scarcely have lit fire when hussar officer trooper rode up halted hundred yard away officer shouted in english what corp be terence at once left fire advanced towards two portuguese battalion answered under colonel o'connor officer at once rode forward be not quite sure said a came close that question must not be answered by volley by direction from saw coming thought that must be friend still might have be advanced party of force have come down through defile however a soon a saw light fire made sure be right for frenchman must not likely have ventured to do so unless indeed be altogether ignorant of advance at ten o'clock morning received order from headquarters to move to point at once a have marched from banos see have lost very little time on way indeed have not suppose be about forty mile distance in fourteen hour be certainly first rate marching will send off one of men to report who be two squadron of regiment be quarter of mile away awaiting return have reason to believe that enemy be near particular reason know of cavalry have be in great force along upper part of river for last two day victor have retired from talavera for fancy that be afraid might move round way cut off from madrid spaniard might have harassed a fell back dared not even make charge on rear guard though have cavalry be not quite sure where french be of course get information from people here either stupidity be something astounding sympathy be entirely with french experience be terence said that best way be to get a much information a can from then to act with certainty that real fact be just reverse of statement made to a soon a force halted picket have be sent out terence when men finished supper established cordon of advanced picket with strong support at distance of mile from front flank so a to ensure against surprise to detect movement upon part of enemy cavalry who might be pressing round to obtain information of british position at daybreak mounted rode to talavera reported arrival of command position where have halted for night have wasted time over colonel o'connor can only have received order yesterday morning scarcely expected that must be here till evening men be excellent marcher sir did forty mile in fourteen hour might have done hour quicker have be pressed not man fell out duty will now be to cover left flank know whether be aware that wilson have moved forward will take post on slope near escurial have be directed to spread force a much a possible so a to give appearance of greater strength than have knew that have left former position terence said have arranged code of smoke signal by must ask other for assistance must defile be attacked learned yesterday morning in way that be marching away have news of what be taking place on other side of hill since sent off word two day ago sir at least hear be of same character a before hear that soult be moving force be certainly put down a being considerably larger than be supposed have deemed duty to state in report spaniard be so inclined to exaggerate everything always receive statement of kind with great doubt news from junta from mr frere from other quarter be quite other way officer said be assured that soult have not fifteen thousand men in condition to take field that must not venture to move a know that whole country must rise did do so have specific order to give will keep in touch with general hill brigade form left a move forward will advance along lower slope of sierra prevent attempt on part of french to turn flank dare say know exactly what be going on colonel o'connor may be of assistance to in taking up position to know that fighting be likely to take place on line between talavera mountain cuesta have fallen back in great haste to talavera will advance today take up line with spaniard will hold low marshy ground near town right will rest on eminence on left flank will extend to group of hill separated by valley from sierra cavalry will probably check attempt by french to turn flank there spaniard will do best to hold slope of sierra must french move force along there may say that victor have be largely reinforced by sebastiani be likely to take offensive indeed hear that be already moving in direction be not aware of exact strength believe that must approach if not equal that of ourselves cuesta united cuesta have indeed be already roughly handled by french disregarding sir arthur entreaty believing victor to be in full retreat marched on alone impelled by desire to be first to enter madrid at two o'clock on morning of th of july french suddenly fell upon drove spanish cavalry back from advanced position chased hotly fled in great disorder panic must have spread to whole army have not albuquerque brought up fresh cavalry held french in check while cuesta retreated in great disorder have french pressed forward must have fled in utter rout sherbrooke division be in advance of british army moved forward took up position in front of panic stricken spaniard then french drew off cuesta then yielded to sir arthur entreaty recrossed alberche took up position near talavera here even worst troop must be able to make stand against best ground be marshy traversed by rivulet on left be strong redoubt be armed with spanish artillery on right be very strong battery on rise close to talavera while other battery sweep road to madrid sir arthur have strengthened front by felling tree forming abattis so that have good reason to hope poor a spanish troop may be must be able to hold part of line campbell division form british right sherbrooke come next german legion be in centre donkin be to take place on hill rise two third of way across valley while general hill division be to hold face looking north separated from sierra only by comparatively narrow valley in have bivouacked at present however troop of donkin have not taken up position country between position on allied army have now fallen back be covered with olive cork tree whole line from talavera to hill be to be held by hill division be two mile in length valley between sierra be mile in width extremely broken rugged be intersected by ravine through ran rivulet fell into tagus at talavera chapter talavera on leaving adjutant general terence knowing that mackenzie brigade be two mile in advance on alberche river that enemy be not in sight sent off one of orderly who accompanied with message to herrara to fall back take up station on lower slope of sierra facing rounded hill then went to restaurant have breakfast be crowded with spanish officer with few british scattered among a ate food be greatly amused at boasting of spaniard a to what must accomplish if french ventured to attack knowing a did how shamefully have behaved two day before when whole of cuesta army have be thrown into utter disorder by two three thousand french cavalry have only be saved from utter rout by interposition of british brigade when have finished breakfast mounted horse rode to camp of old regiment hooroo terence captain o'grady shouted a rode up thought must be turning up when there be going to be something to do be have knack of always getting into thick of orderly take colonel be horse lead up down come on terence most of boy be in tent over there have just be dismissed from parade shout of welcome rose a entered tent where dozen officer be sitting on ground on empty box sit down if can find room terence colonel corcoran said must like to be back with again for shindy that be likely to have tomorrow must hope to have share in in own way where be men o'connor will be in hour at foot of mountain over there to left business will be to prevent of french moving along there coming down on rear be pleased to hear believe that there be spanish division there be glad to know that business be not to be left entirely to now what have be doing since left month ago have be doing nothing colonel watching defile a one have come up have not fired shot doubt got news that be there terence o'grady said not likely must be to come up to be destroyed by perhaps be terence said when laughter have subsided at rate did show up be very pleased when order came at ten o'clock yesterday for to leave banos march to join army did forty mile in fourteen hour good marching colonel corcoran said then where did halt about three mile farther off at foot of hill saw lot of campfire to right thought that be in line with army of course be only of mackenzie division sent off orderly hour ago to tell to fall back to slope facing hill where left be to be posted be lucky fellow to have be away from terence for be downright starving have be soldier have only have mouthful of meat served out to a ration most day have got so thin that clothes be hanging loose about if have be for man doolan two three others who always manage by hook by crook to get hold of anything there be within two three mile round must have be a badly off a be be jabers have have to take in sword belt good two inch to think that while fellow be well nigh starving spaniard came to help who will do fighting have more food than must eat be enough to enrage saint wonder sir arthur put up with must have seized that stuck up old fool cuesta popped into guard tent kept there until provision be handed over for whole army might come to rescue o'grady what if have must have turned out corporal guard sent whole of trotting off in time did hear what took place two day ago yes heard that behaved shamefully o'grady still think corporal guard must hardly be sufficient to turn do believe that regiment might answer purpose can tell that there be nothing must please troop more than to attack spaniard if go on many more day men will be too weak to march believe that before lie down give up altogether will pitch into spaniard in spite of what may try to do to prevent colonel said here be in country abounding with food be starving while spaniard be feasting in plenty by saint patrick beard terence be mighty little must do to prevent men from pitching into there be one thing may be sure will never cooperate with in future a to relying upon promise faith be not worth breath take to make a everything be profoundly quiet terence have hesitation in stopping to lunch with old friend a there be difficulty in buying be required in talavera table be well supplied officer made up for enforced privation during past three week at three o'clock terence left rode across to command found posted exactly where have directed be lucky that filled up with flour at banos before starting colonel bull said for from what hear soldier be getting next to nothing to eat cattle bought at village halfway yesterday will come in very handy at rate with flour can hold out for week if need be still have better begin at once to be economical bull there be saying what may happen after battle have be fought while be talking sudden burst of firing at distance be heard mackenzie brigade be engaged terence exclaimed have better get men under arm at once if whole of victor command be upon will have to fall back when men be ready may a well come few hundred foot higher up hill with then will see over country be in readiness to do anything be wanted be not likely french will attempt anything serious today will probably content with driving mackenzie in terence went at once up hill to point whence must look well over round hill on other side of valley make out british spanish line stretching to talavera troop be already formed up in readiness for action away to left came roll of heavy firing from cork wood near alberche just a three officer joined british troop issued pell mell from wood have in fact be taken entirely by surprise have be attacked so suddenly vigorously that for time young soldier of of regiment fell into confusion sir arthur who be at large house named casa narrowly escaped capture th however regiment have seen much service company of th rifle presented stout front to enemy sir arthur speedily restored order among rest of troop enemy advance be checked division then fell back in good order of flank being covered by brigade of cavalry from height at terence officer stood must plainly make out retiring division must see heavy mass of french troop descending from high ground beyond alberche whole french army be on macwitty said if advance guard have not be in such hurry to attack have waited until others came up not many of mackenzie division must have got back to line be not long before french debouched from wood a soon a did so division rapidly crossed plain towards ally left seized isolated hill facing spur on to donkin have just hurried up brigade at once opened heavy cannonade at same time division moved towards right squadron of light cavalry must be seen riding along road from madrid towards spanish division wo do much good there terence said for country be so swampy that can not leave road still suppose want to reconnoitre position draw fire of spaniard to ascertain whereabouts be getting very close to when spaniard begin ought to wipe out completely at moment heavy rattle of distant musketry be heard light wreath of smoke rose from spanish line french cavalry have in fact ridden up so close to spaniard that discharged pistol in bravado at to spaniard have replied by general wild discharge of musket moment later party on hill saw right of spanish line break up a if by magic to astonishment rage made out that whole plain behind be thickly dotted by fugitive why whole lot have bolted sir bull exclaimed horse foot be making off did anyone ever hear of such thing that portion of spanish line nearest to talavera have indeed broken fled in wildest panic infantry having taken to heel instant discharged musket while artillery cut trace leaving gun behind followed example french cavalry charged along road sir arthur opposed with british squadron spanish who still held ground opened fire french drew back fugitive continued flight to oropesa spreading panic alarm everywhere with news that ally be totally defeated sir arthur wellesley killed lost cuesta have for time accompanied soon recovered from panic sent several cavalry regiment to bring back fugitive part of artillery thousand of infantry be collected before morning men be still absent at battle great redoubt on left be silent from want of gun in point of number there have be little difference between two army prior to loss of men cuesta army have be strong with seventy gun british with german legion numbered with thirty gun french be strong with eighty gun be veteran troop while on side of ally there be who must be called fighting men be what come of putting faith in spaniard bull said savagely if have be sir arthur must have turned gun on given something to run for must do thousand time better by ourselves then must know what have to expect be evident that there wo be fighting until tomorrow macwitty will place battalion on hillside from point to bottom of slope think that will come so high up hill a will of course throw picket out above other wing of battalion will hold in reserve couple of hundred yard behind centre of line choose sheltered spot for for gun victor be placing on height will sweep face of hill little watercourse will give capital cover to advanced line can not do better than occupy lying down must be completely sheltered from french artillery if attacked must line bank fire without showing more than head of course will throw out picket along face of slope in front of do bull march battalion down to foot of hill take up post there ground be very uneven broken must be able to find spot where men must be in shelter move couple of hundred yard back then macwitty must flank force advancing against sun will set in few minute so have better lose time in taking up ground a soon a have chosen place go on with captain of company across valley make yourselves thoroughly acquainted with ground mark best spot at to post men to resist force may come along valley be quite possible that victor may make attempt to turn general flank tonight will reconnoitre ground in front of will then with colonel join position terence have chosen be quarter of mile west of spur held by donkin brigade have selected in order that if attacked in force might have assistance of gun there must thus be able to play on advancing french without risk of own men being injured by fire bull marched battalion down hill a terence herrara be about to mount sudden burst of musketry fire from crest of opposite hill showed that french be attempting to carry position victor indeed seeing force stationed there to be small one that from confusion among spaniard on british right moment be very favourable have ordered one division to attack to move to support while third be to engage german division posted on plain to right of hill thus prevent succour being sent to donkin from position where terence be standing front of steep slope that french be climbing must not be seen almost at same moment dense mass of men began to swarm up hill on donkin flank having unperceived made way in at mouth of valley form up battalion macwitty shouted double down hill then rode after bull whose battalion have now reached valley halted there must go to assistance of brigade on hill bull will be overpowered before reinforcement can reach bring on macwitty after a soon a get down take battalion forward at double bull order be given with cheer battalion set out across valley on reaching other side began to climb steep ascent bearing towards left so a to reach summit near spot where french be ascending twilight be already closing in approach of portuguese be unobserved by french whose leading battalion have reached top of hill be pressing heavily on donkin weak brigade have however checked advance of french on front macwitty battalion be short distance behind when marching straight along on face of hill bull arrived within hundred yard of french here terence halted for minute while hastily formed up in line macwitty came up din on top of hill just above bull right company be prodigious rattle of musketry incessant exulting shout of french must be plainly heard comrade behind be pressing hotly up hill to join in strife there be plainly not moment to be lost advancing to within fifty yard of french battalion struggling up hill in confused mass tremendous volley be poured in french astonished at sudden attack upon flank paused endeavoured to form up wheel round to oppose front to heavy fire of portuguese broken nature of ground prevented doing ignorant of strength of force have thus suddenly attacked recoiled keeping up irregular fire while portuguese pouring in steady volley pressed upon in five minute gave way retired rapidly down hill leading battalion have gained crest where joining who have ascended by other face of hill fell upon already outnumbered defender donkin men though fighting fiercely be pressed back must have be driven from position have not general hill brought up th th with battalion of detachment composed of sir john moore straggler charged french so furiously that be unable to withstand assault although aided by fresh battalion ascending front of hill in retreat french instead of going straight down hill bore away to right although fell to fire of portuguese greater portion passed unseen in darkness firing now ceased terence ordered bull macwitty to take troop back to ground originally selected while ascended to crest with difficulty discovered whereabouts of general hill to whom be well known found in act of having wound temporarily dressed by light of fire have just be replenished having ridden in dark into midst of french battalion believing to be one of own regiment colonel donkin be in conversation with have be very close affair sir said certainly thought that must be rolled down hill believe that owe safety in small degree to couple of battalion of spaniard fancy who took up post on opposite hill morning just before brought up reinforcement while thing be at worst heard heavy volley firing somewhere just over crest know who must have be if be not for there be certainly no other troop on left be portuguese battalion sir terence said quietly oh be o'connor general hill exclaimed if be two battalion of yours can quite understand be colonel o'connor donkin who checked soult passage at mouth of minho have performed other admirable service illustration may a well make report to o'connor ' may a well make report to o'connor will include in own to sir arthur terence related how just a be taking up position for night along slope of sierra heard outbreak of firing on front of hill seeing large force mounting northern slope knowing that only one brigade be posted there thought duty to move to assistance crossing valley at double have taken in flank being unperceived in gathering darkness have checked advance compelled to retire down hill at what strength do estimate force so retired colonel fancy there be eight battalion of three have gained crest before arrived others be necessarily broken up followed so close upon other that be difficult to separate fancy there be eight of being in such confusion of course unaware of strength be unable to form to offer effectual resistance volley from distance of fifty yard must have done heavy execution upon then there be doubt donkin colonel be force did save for if five battalion have gained crest must have be driven off before brigade brought up arrived indeed even with aid must have be so outnumbered that must scarcely have held ground be hot work a be certainly five more battalion must have turned scale against of course o'connor will send in written report of reason for quitting position to headquarters will myself do full justice to service that have rendered so promptly efficaciously where be command now will by time have taken up former position on opposite slope one battalion be extended there other be at foot of hill prepared to check force may attempt to make way up valley line be about quarter of mile in rear of spur selected position in order must french make attempt in force gun here might take in flank while held in check in front general nodded well thought of said now donkin have better muster brigade ascertain what be loss be afraid be very heavy terence now returned across valley on joining command told herrara two major how warmly general hill have commended action what have be loss asked fifteen killed five forty wounded of great proportion be not serious brushwood be now collected in short time number of fire be blazing men be in high spirit be proud of having overthrown far superior force of enemy be gratified at expression of great satisfaction conveyed to by captain by terence order at steadiness with have fought illustration plan of battle of talavera at daybreak next morning enemy be seen to be again in motion victor having obtained king consent to again try to carry hill occupied by british time terence did not leave position being able to see that whole of hill division now occupied height moreover being threatened by two regiment of light troop crossed mouth of valley ascended slope on side proceeded to work way along whole of macwitty battalion be now placed in line while bull be held in reserve behind centre be not long before macwitty be hotly engaged french who be coming along in skirmishing order among rock broken ground be soon brought to standstill for time heavy fire be exchanged three time french gathered for rush time steady volley from almost invisible foe drove back again with loss to shelter have left in interval terence must see how fight be going on across valley whole hillside be dotted with fire a french worked way up british troop on crest fired down upon several time party of french gained brow only to be hurled back again by troop held in reserve in readiness to move to point where enemy might gain footing for forty minute battle continued then having lost men french retreated down hill again covered by fire of battery opened with fury on crest a soon a be seen to be descending slope at same time light troop opposed to terence also drew off seeing pertinacity with french have tried to turn left sir arthur wellesley moved cavalry round to head of valley obtaining bassecour division of spanish from cuesta sent to take post on hillside short distance in rear of terence portuguese previous evening fighting have cost victor men while british have be killed wounded want of success then attack on following morning tended to depress spirit of french to raise of british be thought that after two repulse victor must not again give battle indeed french general jourdan sebastiani be opposed to renewal of hostility victor be in favour of general attack so opinion be finally adopted by king in spite of fact that knew that soult be in full march towards british rear have implored not to fight battle till have cut british line of retreat when in case must be forced to retire at once king be influenced more by fear for safety of madrid than by victor argument wilson force have be greatly exaggerated by rumour venegas be known to be at last approaching toledo king feared that one of force might fall upon madrid in absence that military store must fall into hand therefore earnestly desired to force british to retreat in order that might hurry back to protect madrid doubtless gross cowardice exhibited by spaniard on previous day have shown victor that have really only british troop to contend against a force exceeded theirs by two to one might well regard victory a certain believe must not fail to beat up to midday perfect quiet reigned along line british french soldier went down alike to rivulet separated two army exchanged joke a drank filled canteen albuquerque being altogether dissatisfied with cuesta arrangement moved across plain with own cavalry took post behind british german horse so that le than cavalry be now ready to pour down upon french force attempting to turn british position by valley day be intensely hot soldier after eating scanty ration for most part stretched down to sleep for night have be broken one owing to fact that spaniard whenever heard thought heard anyone moving in front poured in tremendous fire roused whole camp be so wild ill directed that several british officer men on left be killed by soon after midday drum be heard to beat along whole length of french line troop be seen to be falling in then british be also called to arm soldier cheerfully took place in rank glad that matter be to be brought to issue at once a thought that victory must at least put end to state of starvation in have for time be kept french have by time learned how impossible be to surmount obstacle in front of portion of ally line occupied by spaniard therefore neglected altogether sebastiani advanced against british division in plain while victor a before prepared to assail british left supported time by great mass of cavalry french be soon in readiness for attack ruffin division be to cross valley move along foot of mountain turn british left villatte be to guard mouth of valley with one brigade to threaten hill with other to make attempt to carry be to be aided by division of lapisse while other half assisted sebastiani in attack on british centre milhaud dragoon be placed on main road to talavera so a to keep spaniard from moving to assistance of british battle began with furious attack on british right french be withstood by campbell division mackenzie brigade aided by two spanish column be finally pushed back with great loss ten of gun captured a campbell wisely refused to break line pursue french rallied on reserve prepared to renew attack in meantime lapisse crossed rivulet attacked sherbrooke division composed of german guard brigade be however driven back in disorder guard followed hotly in pursuit french reserve came up battery opened with fury drove guard back while german be so hotly pressed by lapisse that fell into confusion th however fell upon flank of advancing french guard german rallied british artillery swept french column again fell back thus british centre right have succeeded in finally repelling attack made upon on left a french advanced rd light dragoon st german hussar charged head of ruffin column before reached however encountered ravine through rivulet here ran german checked horse when came upon almost impassable obstacle rd however kept on men horse rolled over other many crossed chasm forming again dashed in between square into french infantry have thrown charged brigade of light infantry in rear victor hurled two regiment of cavalry upon rd hopelessly over matched be driven back with loss of men officer being fully number have ridden forward rest galloped back to shelter of bassecour division yet effort have not be in vain french astonished at furious charge seeing four distinct line of cavalry still drawn up facing made further movement hill easily repulsed attack upon position battle ceased a suddenly a have begun french having failed at point have attacked terence have on seeing ruffin division marching towards advanced along slope until reached entrance to valley then scattering on hillside have opened heavy continuous fire upon french doing much execution among column still more when threw into square to resist cavalry have given order must ruffin send of battalion up hill against be to retire up slope taking advantage of shelter not to attempt to meet enemy in close contact such attack be however made french battalion most exposed threw out large number of skirmisher endeavoured to keep down galling fire maintained from hillside a portuguese took advantage of stone bush scarcely man be visible to french there be few casualty among loss of british be in during two day fighting including taken prisoner that of french be ten gun be captured by campbell division seven left in wood by french a drew off next morning at daybreak to take up position behind alberche during day crauford brigade came up after tremendous march three regiment have after tramp of twenty mile encamped near plasencia when alarm spread by spanish fugitive reached that place crauford allowed men two hour rest then started to join army did not halt until reached camp having in twenty six hour during hottest season of year marched sixty two mile carrying kit arm ammunition weight of from fifty to sixty pound only twenty five men out of three regiment fell out immediately brigade arrived took up outpost duty in front of army terence be much gratified by appearance in general order that day of following notice general commander in chief express warm approbation of conduct of two battalion of minho regiment of portuguese commanded by colonel o'connor officer on own discretion moved from position assigned to on seeing serious attack made on colonel donkin brigade on evening of th scaling hill opened so heavy fire on french ascending that five battalion fell back without taking part in attack took place at crisis of engagement have decisive effect on result at eight o'clock staff officer rode up with order for minho regiment to return at once to pas of banos a news have come in enemy beyond hill be in movement terence be to act in concert with spanish force there hold pas a long a possible if enemy be in too great strength to be withstood be given discretion a to movement being guided only by fact that british army must probably march down valley of tagus if soult crossed force order added be estimated a not exceeding men chapter prisoner on st of july terence reached neighbourhood of banos learned from peasantry that french army have passed through town early on preceding day resistance have be offered to passage through pas of bejar spanish at banos have retreated hastily after exchanging few shot with french advanced guard peasantry have deserted village have have skirmish with small foraging party of cavalry several french straggler have be killed in pas hoping to find of still alive to obtain information from terence continued march for banos sending on two of best mounted of portuguese horseman to ascertain if there be considerable french force left there be within mile of town when saw returning at full speed chased by party of french dragoon who however fell back when saw advancing infantry what be news terence asked a trooper rode up banos be full of french troop one of replied column be marching down pas from what can see must think that there must be of in fact be soult second army corp first have preceded having that morning reached plasencia where captured sick in hospital large quantity of store have be left there from want of carriage when british army advanced terence lost time in retreating from so dangerous neighbourhood at once made for mountain have just left two regiment of french cavalry set out in pursuit a soon a party have chased portuguese trooper entered banos with news that body of infantry strong be close at hand came up before portuguese have marched more than mile two battalion be halted thrown into square french rode fearlessly down upon be received with so hot steady fire that speedily drew off with considerable loss then regiment ascended hill hour later halted question be what be to be done terence said to herrara two major be evident that for once information obtained from spaniard be correct soult must have at least men with possibly full strength be not up yet by time force passed yesterday must be at plasencia by tomorrow may be on tagus sir arthur position must be one of great danger putting cuesta spaniard altogether aside a worthless have even with brigade saw marching in soon after started only men on one side of be victor with on other be soult with perhaps a many more with starving exhausted troop chance be small indeed unless can cross tagus might beat one marshal other can hardly beat two of first thing to do be to send two trooper off with duplicate despatch telling sir arthur of soult passage might not otherwise hear of for time then might be too late peasantry village authority will be too busy carrying off effect driving animal to hill to think for moment of sending information be evidently first thing to be done until see what be going to happen think can do better than cross sierra encamp at spot where can make out movement of french on plain at same time can keep eye on road to plasencia be able to send information to sir arthur if further body of french troop come down into valley position be evidently dangerous one if news have reached sir arthur will have fallen back from talavera at once victor will doubt follow on heel cavalry of soult will speedily meet other therefore will be in way best to see how matter develop before moving down into plain accordingly two of trooper be sent off with information that french be already in valley that a many more must be there on following day then regiment marched across sierra took post high up on slope with plasencia ten mile away on right spire of oropesa visible across valley on following day army corp be seen descending from banos to plasencia while large body of troop marched from town to navalmoral thus cutting off retreat of british by bridge of boat at almaraz cloud of dust on distant plain showed that portion at least of allied army have arrived at oropesa body of french cavalry be made out traversing plain scattering among village two more trooper be sent off with report warned like others to take different route make wide circuit so a to avoid french then to come down upon oropesa if troop there be british be to deliver report to general in command if be occupied by spaniard be to proceed to talavera hand in at headquarters on following day still army corp marched down to plasencia raising soult force to on day cuesta who have undertaken to hold talavera retreated suddenly alarmed by victor army making advance leaving to fate british wounded in hospital however be benefited by change have be dying of hunger for although there be abundance of provision in talavera inhabitant refused to sell to british jealously concealed store in house must cuesta do anything to aid thus men who have fought suffered for spanish cause be left to perish while there be abundance around conduct of spaniard from moment british crossed frontier to time of leaving spain be never forgotten forgiven by british troop who have henceforth absolute hatred for spanish contributed in small degree to excess perpetrated by upon inhabitant of badajos other place taken subsequently by storm french on entering talavera treated british wounded with greatest kindness henceforth be well fed cared for first report sent by terence reached sir arthur safely ten hour after be sent out apprised for first time of serious storm be gathering in rear have without hour delay given order for army to march to oropesa intending to give battle to soult before victor must come up to join fellow marshal second report informed of real strength of army towards be marching showed real extent of danger so at once seized only plan of escape offered to marching with speed to arzobispo crossing tagus by bridge there cuesta army following a soon a tagus be passed crauford brigade be hurried on to seize bridge of boat at almaraz prevent french from crossing there fortunately soult be a ignorant of position of ally a sir arthur be of believing that british be following victor pressing forward towards madrid have conducted operation in comparatively leisurely manner therefore be not until british be safely across tagus that ascertained real state of affair put in communication with victor on morning following crossing terence be apprised by note sent back by one of trooper of movement have taken place be written upon small piece of paper so that must be destroyed at once by bearer if must be threatened with capture contained only following word report invaluable allied army move to arzobispo will cross tagus there must act according to judgment can give advice thank british army have escaped terence said after reading despatch to officer now have only to think of a to rejoining sir arthur be out of question valley be full of french troop ney have joined soult there be frenchman between army if have idea where wilson be might endeavour to join for must be in same plight a only chance so far a can see be to cross line of communication to endeavour to join beresford who be reported a marching down frontier from almeida must propose to pas through banos colonel herrara asked mountain there be almost if not quite impassable might get peasant to guide like going near banos herrara french be almost sure to have left strong body there chance be against finding peasant for inhabitant of village for ten mile round have almost certainly fled taken to hill think must be safer to follow along side of sierra cross road few mile above plasencia then make for mountain come down on head of river coa beresford be probably in valley of river be more likely to find guide way than be by going through banos will have tough work of way go even if be lucky enough to get past without running against single frenchman must not be better to wait till colonel bull asked terence shook head there be moon said a to climbing about among mountain in dark must be worse than running risk of fight with french besides must have chance whatever of coming across peasant think must try a soon a get light tomorrow morning have better dress up score of men in peasant clothes send off in couple to search among hill come across man must bring in whether like not spaniard be so desperately afraid of french that will give information unless forced to do so will have even more difficulty than british there must have be thousand of peasant others who knew that soult have come down upon plasencia yet sir arthur obtained news there be one comfort there can be little doubt that soult be just a much in dark a to position of british army by three peasant have be brought in shook head stolidly when questioned in portuguese upon terence having placed against rock twelve men brought up ordered to load musket one of said in spanish know where path across mountain leaf road have never be over hill know nothing of how run ah thought must make out question terence said well have saved life of comrade take to path tomorrow set fairly on will be allowed to go free be paid five dollar for trouble then turned to bull put four men to guard said let guard be changed once two hour order will be to shoot fellow down if endeavour to make escape be quite capable of going down into plasencia bringing french upon at daybreak be on march two hour later came down into valley through road from banos ran down to plasencia have just crossed when head of column of cavalry appeared coming down valley at once broke into gallop how far be to where path begin to ascend mountain terence asked holding pistol to peasant head four mile man replied sullenly looking with apprehension at french terence shouted order to bull macwitty to throw men into square a have be marching since reached level ground in column of company movement be carried out before enemy arrived french cavalry believing that battalion be spanish must break at once charged furiously down upon be however received with so heavy fire that drew off discomfited leaving many men horse on ground be strong body terence said quietly to bull in centre of whose square have taken up position must say there be of be afraid be head of division yes there be infantry coming down valley must press on will be caught before get into hill battalion be soon in motion immediately started cavalry prepared to charge again will never do bull if form square time will be delayed so much that infantry will soon be up must do now quickly will start next time in column eight abreast face men round in line four deep way if charge again french time drew off without pressing charge home then trotting on took place between portuguese mountain form leading company in line four deep bull column will follow formation be quickly altered preceded by line to cover from charge in front column advanced at rapid pace cavalry moved forward to meet a two party approached other line opened so heavy fire that french drew off from front to right left bull at once threw back wing of company to prevent attack in flank so in form of capital t column kept on way several time french cavalry charged down compelling to halt time after repulsing attack column went on must be all right if have only fellow to deal with terence said to bull infantry be coming on plain behind be indeed covered with swarm of skirmisher coming along at double must go at double too bull terence said will be up long before get to hill be not halfway yet keep men well in hand let fall into confusion if do cavalry will be down in minute cavalry however be equally conscious of importance of checking portuguese again again dashed down upon with reckless bravery suffering heavily whenever did so causing delay time charged will go back to rear bull mind order be precise that happens behind to be to push forward until begin to climb hill then without waiting for answer galloped back although column pressed on steadily at double delay caused by cavalry fact that french infantry be broken up able therefore to run more quickly be bringing enemy up fast herrara be riding at head of second battalion to terence repeated instruction have given bull what be going to do colonel latter asked there be very broken ground quarter of mile ahead replied intend to hold that spot with rear company will be little time before french infantry will be able to form attack ground look to too broken for cavalry to act a soon a can see that be far enough ahead to gain hill before can overtake again will follow with company mind must not do so must take command of two battalion cross mountain join beresford galloped on to macwitty who be riding in rear repeated order to well colonel let stop behind with company instead of macwitty be post of danger a commanding officer must take be question of saving two battalion at cost of company there be doubt a to course to be taken do ride on at once take post at rear of company ahead of keep steady here come cavalry down again on flank there be charge three four heavy volley then french drew off again bullet of infantry be now whistling overhead hundred yard farther terence shouted then will face in front lay upheaval of rock stretching almost like wall across line be following be sort of natural outwork pushed out by nature in front of hill rose fifty foot above level of plain there be many place at must be climbed up one of track ran obliquely hitherto have be ill defined path here effort have be made to render practicable by cutting away ground on upper side to enable laden mule to pas up terence reined up at bottom of ascent directed men to take up post on crest leading half of company to right other half to left of path before be up french light troop be clustering round rush be prevented by heavy fire opened from brow above company be soon scattered along crest yard apart in five minute two thousand french infantry be assembled mounted officer rode distance to right left to examine ground be evident that considered that position held by determined men be formidable one lying down a be only head of portuguese must be seen while force attacking must have to march across level ground affording shelter from defender fire then to climb very steep ascent moreover whole force have be pursuing might be gathered just behind after five minute delay battalion broke up into skirmisher while rest divided into two party marched parallel to rock left right terence saw that movement must be successful for with men must not defend line of indefinite length however object have now be achieved descent behind be even regular must see column winding up hill somewhat over mile away of french cavalry must see nothing have after last charge ridden off a if leaving matter in hand of infantry ordered bugler to sound retreat in open order portuguese rising to foot went down gentle slope at trot be halfway to hill when long line of french cavalry be seen sweeping down upon from right having evidently ridden along foot of steep declivity until came to spot where be able to ascend at sound of bugle rear company instantly ran together formed square a french cavalry came up opened continuous fire upon unable to break line of bayonet horseman rode round round square discharging pistol into occasionally making desperate effort to break in suddenly cavalry drew apart battalion of infantry marched forward poured fire into portuguese terence felt that more must be done main body be safe from pursuit must be throwing away life of brave fellow did continue hopeless fight therefore waved white handkerchief in token of surrender shouted to men to cease fire riding through with sheathed sword made way to officer who appeared to be in command of cavalry illustration surrender sir a prisoner of war surrender sir said a prisoner of war have done that must do must speak few word of french officer understood have done more than enough sir said order men to lay down arm will guarantee safety ordered cavalry to draw back riding up to infantry halted terence at once ordered men to lay down arm have done men must do said have saved comrade be dishonour to yield to twenty time own force form up in column ready to march commander of cavalry again rode up time accompanied by officer general wish to know latter said in english who be what force be be colonel o'connor holding that rank in lord beresford army have honour to be on staff of sir arthur wellesley though at present detached on special service two battalion have marched up hill be minho regiment of portuguese under command be posted on sierra being cut off from rejoining british by advance of marshal soult army be endeavouring to retire across mountain into portugal when cut off officer translated word to general tell latter said that if portuguese fought a well a troop there must have be occasion for british to come here to aid have never seen troop better handled more steady can not be first time have be under fire terence bowed when compliment be translated to fought general in campaign last year said regiment take name from fact that prevented marshal soult from crossing at mouth of minho first encounter with cavalry be near orense remember well general said for be in command of cavalry attacked men be not in uniform then must have known again how did come to be there for at time british have not advanced beyond cintra have be sent with message to romana happening to come across newly raised levy without officer commander took command aided by two british trooper portuguese lieutenant succeeded in getting into shape did best to hold pas to braga peste general exclaimed that be again be be one piece of dash determination shown by portuguese during advance to oporto cost a many men a rest of fighting put together now colonel must be marching major portalis here will take charge of in few minute french cavalry infantry be on march towards plasencia portuguese prisoner guarded on side by cavalry marching with captain being like terence placed in charge of officer portuguese marched with head erect be prisoner felt that have done well have sacrificed to cover retreat of comrade have not be for french infantry coming up might have beaten off attack of great body of cavalry on arrival at troop be placed in large building have be converted into prison here be hundred of other prisoner for most part spaniard who have be captured when soult have suddenly arrived terence be taken to quarter of general foy who be in command there here be again questioned through officer who spoke english after

guard how be that there be only one officer be in fact one company terence said company be about strong officer captured with be captain general heron also report to that retreat be admirably carried out general foy said that body of french veteran must have done better well sir if be ready to give parole not to escape will be at liberty to move about town freely until there be opportunity of sending batch of prisoner to france thank general be ready to give parole not to make attempt to escape be obliged to for courtesy terence have already thought over what course have best take must be offered freedom on parole have resolved to accept probability of making escape be extremely small there must be chance whatever of rejoining army passage alone across impassable mountain be not to be thought of therefore decided that at rate for present must give promise not to attempt to escape quarter be assigned to in town in house where several french officer be staying showed great courtesy kindness between english french war be throughout conducted on honourable term prisoner be well treated there be national animosity between officer men when went out into town one of french officer

officer who have commanded escort on march from plasencia spoke in high term of terence to officer in charge of two hundred men who be to go on with party have be directed not to pas through madrid a sight of over two hundred british prisoner might give rise to popular demonstration by excitable spaniard must possibly lead to disorder be therefore directed to march by road to escurial then over sierra to segovia then up through valladolid burgos escort be entirely composed of infantry a terence must not therefore take horse with joined other officer on foot to great surprise joy found that one of be chum dick ryan be unexpected pleasure dicky exclaimed well yes be a pleased a be at meeting terence must own that condition might have be more pleasant oh never mind condition terence said

have fallen into hand be well done terence there be pleasure in being taken prisoner in sort of way what will become of regiment do suppose have idea herrara may be appointed to command must think that most likely must be of course sir arthur may put english officer at head however must say that there be likelihood of more fighting year ney corp have gone north be sign that there will be invasion of portugal at present certainly sir arthur be not likely to take offensive again now that eye have be thoroughly opened to rascality cowardice of spaniard by next spring two may be back

there will be end to marching not very pleasant one terence said at present one scarcely recognizes that one be prisoner french officer certainly do in power to make forget soldier ours try best to hold sort of conversation together feel that be making great progress in french be especially jolly when halt for night get bivouac fire burning chat laugh with french officer a though be best friend in world march be indeed conducted in comfortable easy fashion at starting prisoner marched four abreast french two abreast at side before mile have be passed order be no longer strictly observed men trudged along smoking pipe laughing talking french english alternately breaking into marching song there be fear of prisoner trying to escape must at night have got away from guard easily enough there be nowhere for to go if have done so english smarting from cruelty ill faith of inhabitant of talavera spanish authority felt burning hatred of spanish while spaniard on side deceived by lying representation of junta have love for english though ready enough to receive money arm from on leaving french officer in command said to terence now colonel will have to be more careful during march keeping sharp lookout at night country here be infested by guerilla whom effort can not eradicate mountain of navarre biscay be full of sometimes be in band of fifteen twenty strong sometimes be in hundred of be at ordinary time goatherd shepherd muleteer peasant number of be disbanded soldier remains of army have defeated broken up who prefer wild life in mountain to returning to home convoy be constantly attacked have always to be accompanied by strong guard a have waggon with must think that must hardly care to molest terence said that render le likely certainly colonel fight from hatred a much a for booty french soldier who fall into hand be ever spared generally be put to death with atrocious torture at first there be such feeling here when regiment be quartered at vittoria three year ago thing be quiet enough see feeling gradually grew doubt of men plundered many of regiment be composed of young conscript with very slight notion of discipline from country district be a rule quiet lad enough among from town especially such place a toulouse lyon marseille be young scoundrel ready for wickedness be to that trouble now have be largely due of course peasant when be able to do so retaliated upon marauder feeling of hatred grew on side straggling party of men be surrounded captured then hung shot burnt alive then on side village be destroyed peasant shot down lately be after defeat of army number of fugitive took to hill threw away uniform obtained peasant dress set up a what called guerilla be only term for bandit for although effort be chiefly directed against hesitate to plunder own people when need provision be perfect scourge to village among hill between bay of biscay mediterranean of course be strongest along line of communication with france may be said that roughly where there be mountain there be guerilla though there be few of along hill crossed between valley of tagus that of douro be for two reason in first place there be very few village must have difficulty in maintaining in second place because hitherto leon old castile on north of sierra have always be under different command to in tagus valley therefore there have be small communication between except by messenger with despatch from madrid pass have scarcely be used indeed in winter be practically altogether impassable except along valley of ebro found that to cost when marched with napoleon to cut off british general moore lost nearly two day getting through delay saved army yes be very close thing terence said a have told be with moore if troop from south have come up six hour earlier must have gone very hard with be awful time officer said think army must have suffered quite a much a yours did soult force be reduced fully to half strength when first arrived on hill near corunna of course straggler came in rapidly great number never returned to colour again died of cold hardship others be cut off murdered by peasantry altogether have awful time of men be in one respect better off than ours for straggler be not regarded with hostility by peasant whereas mercy be shown to ours yes major one of battalion fought at talavera be entirely composed of men who have straggled in retreat who afterwards succeeded in gaining portuguese frontier that evening halted for night at small village high up in pass french officer took precaution against surprise twenty sentry be placed at various point round village a many more be posted in pair three four hundred yard farther out at three in morning several shot be fired troop got under arm party be sent out to outpost at two of post both sentry be found stabbed to heart at others men have be seen crawling up towards shot have aroused troop have be fired outpost be recalled to village soldier remained under arm until morning a soon a be daybreak scattered fire opened from hill on side of valley be evident that be occupied by strong party villager on being questioned denied knowledge of band under threat said that have heard that mina with very strong force be in neighbourhood that impecinado have be reported to be among hill between pas that of roncesvalles what strength do put down at colonel major asked terence must say from what can see of that there must be four five hundred on hill must have have information from spy at zadorra colonel dozen band must have united to crush diable be good shot exclaimed a shako be struck from head by bullet be worst of fellow be uncommonly good shot see almost mountain men be accustomed to carry gun charcoal burner shepherd eke out living by shooting game sending down to town what be thinking of doing major will hold village latter replied might get through pas doubt whether must do so if did men yours must suffer terribly can rely upon fellow keeping quiet think so at rate will go round order to do so there be however necessity to impress on men two of have already be wounded by guerilla fire why sir one of said if have musket here must turn out help french to drive fellow off french have behaved very well to while spaniard did best to starve to death there ai one of who must jump at chance of paying out all right men said terence agree with a to treatment have received however be not here to fight be prisoner have nothing to do with fray one way other though mean to say must not myself be glad to see french beat guerilla off other officer found same spirit among soldier questioned quite agree with one of officer said if there be musket handy must not mind leading if be not for uniform sir arthur must scarcely be pleased if among other worry got despatch from central junta complaining that large number of innocent peasant have be killed by english troop fighting by side of french gradually guerilla drew in towards village taking advantage of stone bush rarely giving chance to french infantry aim be exceedingly accurate whenever french soldier showed from behind hut to fire be fortunate if got back again without receiving bullet be getting serious french major said coming into cottage where english officer be gathered have lost thirty eight killed wounded already have have wounded carried into church of men be unloading provision waggon taking content inside have requisitioned utensil will hold water in village doubt will be able to hold out there till other detachment come along road think that be very good plan major terence said must hardly be able to carry by assault unless burnt down door ought to be able to prevent from doing that hour later whole french force be collected in church a soon a spaniard found what have happened speedily entered village opened fire from window giving view of church from loophole that quickly made in wall terence noticed that when british soldier entered church most of carried heavy stave sergeant came up saluted have have four men killed eight wounded men declare that be not going to stand still see french murdered by fellow doubt if order will keep back very well sergeant will speak to presently now gentleman said to other officer three of be senior to in own army though own know how matter must stand holding a do lord beresford commission a colonel be perfectly willing to place under order of whoever may be senior of believe be senior one of captain said must imagine that lord beresford commission must for time rank just a if have be signed by own authority moreover be on wellesley staff have seen more service out here than of think that be certainly entitled to command though really see what can do in uniform quite agree with captain travers therefore proposal be that will take off fight in shirt sleeve guerilla will then not be able to affirm that there be men in english uniform assisting french think idea be excellent one captain travers said then in case will act upon terence went up to english soldier who be standing in group in middle of church be sure quite understand men said that must never do for to be fighting in british uniform against spaniard otherwise leave matter in hand may mention that be intention of myself other officer to defend church without coat cap if of like to do same of course can join give order on subject see that must get rid of inconvenience of soldier in british uniform fighting against spaniard men answered with shout of satisfaction mingled with laughter in le than minute scarlet uniform have disappeared musket of french killed wounded be appropriated rest of english prisoner seized club for hour fight continued from roof of church belfry window hot fire answered incessant fusillade of spaniard french english officer be obliged constantly to impress upon men that must husband ammunition a there be saying how long might be besieged before detachment strong enough to turn scale arrived maintain fire heavy enough to make keep at ammunition be likely to run short a soon a ours there be not much chance of being able to replenish fire at random let bullet tell take steady aim at window through be firing late in afternoon fire of guerilla slackened good deal be evident that leader be enjoining not to waste ammunition a became dark officer gathered again in body of church total loss have risen to thirty two killed fifty wounded english casualty being about third of whole be heavy loss major said have noticed that a fire slackened proportion of men hit have be larger suppose that be only keeping best shot at work must fancy terence said that if be to make sortie must scatter altogether a soon a be dark might get out by sacristy door at rear gave up attack on side time ago a must not get shelter when found be so betook to house where be better covered if be to go out noiselessly sweep round village so a to fall upon in two body one at end will take for body of troop just arrived even if do hear a go out can go straight at must have doubt be able to clear place with rush only thing be major must be glad if soldier must take off coatee too so that there must be nothing to distinguish men from yours what do think think that will be much best plan captain travers said in first place be probable that will try to burn out tonight must not hope to prevent piling faggot against door in dark for reason alone think that will be much better to attack than wait for to attack need only leave twenty of le seriously wounded men to guard place when sally out guerilla will have plenty to do without making attack on church certainly think that be not likely to lose so many life in sortie a must do in defence here against night attack certainly be of opinion colonel french major said if men will join have doubt that will be able to clear village a soon a became quite dark men on roof be called down with exception of one two who be ordered to continue to fire from various spot there in belfry so that spaniard must not discover that garrison have be withdrawn then french be drawn up divided into two party english who have musket be told off in equal number to of party a be who have nothing club major then ordered soldier to take off coat to leave shako behind french major took command of one party asked terence to take command of other declined sir be better that one of own officer must be in command will divide between two party major now impressed upon men necessity for absolute quiet for marching a lightly silently a possible english officer gave similar instruction to men be arranged that when door be opened two party must issue out simultaneously two abreast so that if alarm be given before be out must be able to turn right left attack in direction at once french lieutenant be appointed to remain in church command little garrison of wounded men who sallied out be to stoop low a went be to keep few pace apart hanging in church be pulled down torn up into strip with men be directed to muffle boot there be mistaking ardour with soldier prepared for sortie english french be indignant at being pent up by foe thoroughly despised be eager to be at enemy casualty added to wrath one of french officer have be killed hurt seriously while three of english have also be wounded though in case slightly bolt of door be noiselessly drawn that of lock forced back then two little party stole out in order in have be directed guerilla have just begun to fire heavily a prelude terence have doubt to serious attack upon church fortunately there be house at back of church shout indicated that party be seen therefore kept together until fifty sixty yard from door then separated continued way to end of village to have be respectively assigned then at one end of village french trumpeter sounded charge two drummer at other beat same order vigorously with loud cheer rushed down street french english alike shouting have be arranged that while french held way straight on shooting down spaniard a poured out into street british must break up into small detachment burst way into house overpower enemy there found first house entered deserted soldier uttered exclamation of impatience a heard heavy roll of firing in main street a approached centre of village however came upon number of spaniard rushing from house men who have arm opened fire at once upon while with club dashed forward levelling panic stricken guerilla to ground with heavy blow arming with musket bandoleer thus firing soon became general spaniard struck with utter dismay believing that have be attacked by heavy column have just arrived speedily took to headlong flight most of throwing away arm a fled in of house there be short desperate conflict in quarter of hour after first shot be fired there be not guerilla remaining alive in village upwards of hundred fifty having be killed while on side of assailant only fifteen have be killed twenty eight wounded soon formed up in street be told off in party of twelve to house in outskirt of village three in party be to keep watch by turn while rest slept english officer be to remain in charge on one side of street french officer on other rest went back to church whose door be now thrown open thank most heartily gentleman french officer said to terence to other british officer for immense service that have rendered have not be for aid position must have be very precarious one before morning a be think need fear further interruption be now armed a with wounded fit for work be still three hundred strong must beat off force likely to attack though indeed have belief that will rally again at rate loss have be extremely heavy street be completely strewn with gun so that doubt whether half of who got away have carried weapon with next morning indeed be found that in about musket have be left behind remained over after arming british soldier be broken up thrown down well enough provision be collected among house to furnish whole with three four day ration dead be buried in field near village wounded too severely to march be placed in waggon rest who have now resumed uniform set out in high spirit be in same order a before prisoner be told to carry musket at trail while french shouldered theirs so that viewed from distance british must appear unarmed have be grand bit of excitement terence dick ryan said gleefully to friend a marched along together fellow certainly fight good deal more pluckily than regular troop do be capital idea to make men take off uniform for suppose spaniard even for moment dreamt that be among assailant at rate have proof that be really must get a adjutant terence see there be very much more fun to be got out of sort of fighting than there be with regiment be very pleased now that stuck to portuguese a advised though be great bore at first hope dicky sha' find when get back in spring that corp have be turned over to beresford a part of regular command for must say that quite appreciate advantage of independence well business ought to do good doubt major will report in warm term assistance have rendered will get good treatment of course of prison must be better than others if will confine in place near frontier instead of marching half through france will make easier for to get away be not getting out of prison be difficulty travelling through country be getting on well with french there be hope of being able to speak well enough to pas a native a for will have to keep mouth shut altogether will be mightily difficult will manage somehow terence have fear of getting through country be getting out of country seems to difficulty there be one thing dicky need be in hurry about there be little chance of fighting beginning for six seven month directly come to end of march wherever may be must begin to pick up a much french a can from guard in three four month ought at least to be able to answer question not perhaps in good french in french a good a say savoyard workman musician might be able to muster oh lor dick ryan said with deep sigh mean to say must begin to work on language just after have be slaving for last six month at portuguese not unless like dicky can either start alone with someone else who have knowledge of french be not going to run risk of being recaptured by taking anyone with who care so little for liberty that grudge three four hour work day to get up mean of making escape oh of course will learn ryan said pettishly always get own way terence be so at athlone first of began by asking opinion then carried out thing exactly a proposed learning language be horrid nuisance see that have to be done expect dicky will have to make up a woman see be not much taller than tallish woman well must be rather lark ryan said only think must be almost too good looking for french woman might be that dicky be certainly drawback if must get hold of good sized monkey skin might sew up in bear skin must be better must say dick laughed think anyone must think that be real bear saw chap with one once at athlone man must open mouth a wide a beast did a to tongue must be four time a long a mine think woman idea must be best must have to shave very close shave terence repeated scornfully why must not see hair on face with magnifying glass if be only drawback matter must be arranged without difficulty without farther adventure crossed mountain came down to bayonne at halting place where french troop be stationed british prisoner be received with warm hospitality by when learned from comrade that british have fought side by side with french against guerilla have saved from what might have be very serious disaster french shook hand with warmly patted on shoulder with many exclamation of brave garcons be led away to cafe treated a hero of day while officer be entertained by of garrison at bayonne escort parted on most cordial term french exclaiming that be shame such brave fellow must be held a prisoner that ought to be released at once sent back in ship with flag of truce to portugal major after handing over soldier to prison authority took terence other british officer to headquarters of governor of town introduced to giving lively account of fight with guerilla manner in prisoner armed only with club musket of soldier no longer able to use have made common cause with french joining in sortie defeated spanish with heavy loss governor expressed courteously thanks to officer for part have taken will forward major marcy report to headquarters gentleman will be happy to give liberty of town on parole have doubt that if other good come of adventure will be placed among early list of officer to be exchanged be very much obliged to general terence said lieutenant ryan must prefer not to give parole say be likely to make escape at rate must like to be able to take opportunity if saw one general smiled of course must be a like sir think that be wrong however at time if like to change mind will give instruction to officer in command of prison to release immediately give parole not to leave town matter have be talked over on march others now expressed willingness to give parole have told terence thought be wrong that must be impossible to make escape a must be necessary to traverse either whole of spain whole of france before must find mean of rejoining army that before long might be exchanged think there be prospect of early exchange terence said there can not have be many prisoner taken during short campaign suppose there will be talk of exchange for time to come be particularly anxious to get back again if possibly can a be afraid regiment will be broken up that unless get back before campaign begin in spring will not get command again so mean to get away if can anyhow must just a soon be in prison a walking about street of bayonne so have quite made up mind not to give parole officer returned to prison quarter assigned to difference being that on parole must go in out a chose must at will take meal in town while terence ryan be placed together in room with sentry at door whose instruction be to accompany whenever wished to go beyond door to walk in prison yard on wall surrounding chapter escape well here be terence ryan said cheerfully a door of cell closed behind now what next next thing be to look round dick other matter can wait one can not form remotest idea a to possibility of escape until one have found out everything about place must say that will be quite soon enough to discus in couple of month now a to room there be nothing to grumble at here two truckle bed not altogether luxurious in appearance at rate good deal softer than ground on have be sleeping for month past couple of chair designed for use rather than comfort will do to sit on while take meal at other time can use bed a sofa good sized piece of carpet table what look like pudding dish to wash in thing might have be better might have be great deal worse a to food must reserve comment until bring now a to fund have only twenty five crown on when be captured be rather better off a have ten pound in gold eight crown in silver see have given parole like others gone in for luxurious feeding outside stock must soon have given out money be essential for carrying out escape when escape involves perhaps week of travelling certainly disguise of different kind have not penny too much for must resolve to eschew luxury except tobacco perhaps bottle of wine on sunday window a observe be very strongly barred look westward that range of building opposite prevents getting view of sea one thing be evident at once that be manner of use for to think of cutting through bar dislodging for must only on lowering be in courtyard nearer escape than be before began job be good thing to get at least one point off mind now dick before go further let make agreement that will always talk in french know enough of to be able to assist will be amusement a well a help to accustom to talk in right ryan said resignedly bargain that for hour day drop altogether will be awful nuisance one must give one tongue rest occasionally by letting straighten out bit door now opened one of warder entered with two large bowl of broth fair sized piece of meat from be made dish of vegetable large piece of bread bottle of wine be supper monsieur in morning have coffee piece of bread at twelve o'clock meal like with bottle of wine between thank terence said cheerfully will do extremely well be there other british officer here none except comrade there be naval officer here last week have be sent into interior have many prisoner here captured at sea by warship privateer be generally taken to brest so far have not have many of nation sent from spain there be spaniard sometimes count be taken be generally drafted into spanish corp of army can buy tobacco terence asked certainly monsieur there be canteen in courtyard be open from eight till nine o'clock in morning from five to six in evening be not allowed to get thing in from town nevertheless smiled a comrade be on parole doubtless must need anything beyond what be sold in canteen may chance that may bring just thing want thank have better get something from canteen for terence said handing crown thank monsieur have heard from soldier who came in with that fought bravely with against spanish brigand think that be very hard that companion must be shut up here after having proved such good comrade have cousin among like be native of bayonne must be in power be sure that comrade must do anything must for monsieur a far of course a duty a french soldier will allow thanks by way what be name jean monier monsieur well jean will please tell cousin that be obliged to for goodwill be pleasure to fight side by side with such brave soldier must occasion offer will gladly avail myself of service detachment be not going farther be monsieur will remain here for perhaps two three month till good french air have invigorated then will join column marching south again there be nothing more that will want tonight monsieur thank jean good evening good evening good sleep warder retired what be that jabber about terence very satisfactory jabber jabber be likely to lead to very good result cousin of be one of guard came down with have told warder about fight asked to say that comrade be very angry at being shut up here a much a said that must aid to escape if be in power so may consider that first difficulty be a good a arranged doubt in short time will be put on regular garrison duty will take turn in furnishing prison guard warder be evidently ready to do anything can so that may look upon escape from prison a matter of certainty suppose that in case guard be very vigilant one for must not expect that prisoner of war here must try to escape at verdun other prison within few day journey of frontier must be different well be good news terence though see that difficulty will really begin only when get out there be doubt that fight with guerilla be lucky thing for must not have missed for anything for must say there be much more excitement in than in battle at least a far a experience of battle go at talavera have nothing to do stick up on top of hill watch french column climbing up then give volley two roll down hill again between time stand to be shelled by victor battery on opposite hill can not see that there be fun about fight too have turned out very good thing for expect must not have be so well treated if have not be for fact that of french soldier be ready to give helping hand be first rate see be luck terence there never be such fellow for luck a be there be doubt about terence agreed now dick must really break into french tomorrow morning will be time enough for ryan said in tone of determination want to talk now really talk ca do in french especially after what have just told by way see why must make journey through france why not try to get boat land somewhere on coast of spain have be thinking of dick seemed to before altogether too difficult still if can get help from outside know why must not be able to manage must have to go distance along spanish coast for there be sure to be french garrison at bilbao santander beyond must think might land at little village galicia must certainly have be evacuated by french for know ney corp be down in tagus valley must think that can not have great force in asturias worst of be have not got enough money to buy boat if have soldier must hardly bargain with fisherman for one of course if be free might arrange with man to go with in boat pay so much for hire for three four day might make way down river steal one terence yes might do must be heavy loss to poor fellow well will look forward to morning when can go out see about prison arrangement then have given up idea of waiting for two month before do anything terence ryan remarked certainly see french convalescent may be marched back again in month time at present plan must be formed upon supposition that be ready to help must never do to throw away such opportunity a that must be little short of madness to try get out unless have disguise of sort staff officer uniform scarlet must lead to arrest at first village came to besides before news one be willing to wait contentedly for time till good opportunity presented now that have such unexpected offer of assistance sooner get out of place better next morning went out into courtyard of prison soldier who have be captured with be walking about in group sentry who accompanied two british officer led through took up to top of wall surrounding prison monsieur said when others be shut up can go where please order be that be not to communicate with soldier then fell back distance left free to wander about on wall from point have view over city bayonne be strongly fortified place standing on junction of nive adour on south side of latter river two mile from mouth nive ran through town water supplied ditch of encircling wall bastion prison be situated on nive at three four hundred yard from spot where entered adour must say quite decides terence said when have made circuit of wall upon sentry be placed at short interval once out of town river must be open to must be next to impossible to pas semicircle of fortification on side of town can see mast of craft lying at quay though must not like to rob fisherman of boat must not feel smallest scruple in taking ship boat must be comparatively small loss to owner worst of must be that directly be found to be missing owner of boat reported loss might send out of gunboat in search of must very soon be overtaken discipline be not very strict in french army except when in enemy country sentry knowing well that there be really occasion for watchfulness answered willingly question terence asked a to name of place within sight must be rather tedious work for on wall here terence said to one whose post be shielded by building close by from observation from below very dull soldier said will be glad enough when be relieved marched into spain here be doing good there be chance whatever of prisoner attempting escape for if did get out of here must get further say that will not stop here long will be heartily glad when order come say convalescent who came in yesterday will take over prison duty next week terence motive for speaking to men be to discover whether be forbidden to talk be satisfactory to find that if there be such rule be by mean strictly observed leaning on parapet ryan stood for time looking at sea there be many fishing boat dotting surface tapering mast of two schooner must be seen near mouth of river have doubt that be privateer terence said have just appearance of fellow captured on way out one must not have much chance of getting far in boat with fellow after seems to that if must possibly be managed safest plan must be to lie quiet in town for week so after got out then must be comparatively safe to get hold of boat make off in yes if must be managed certainly must be safest plan if changed mind about making off by sea might then be able to pas out through fortification without question of course must be vigilant for short time after be missing suppose that at ordinary time country people must go in out unquestioned just a in other town for with enemy nearer than portugal there must be occasion whatever for watchfulness terence companion have seen nothing of friend on parole a found although lodged in prison for own convenience be not permitted to have communication with other prisoner ten day after arrived at bayonne warder who have since first spoke to said nothing beyond usual salutation remarked carelessly soldier who came down with took up prison duty last night cousin told to say that will know four five of comrade of nd of line of whom be thoroughly in agreement with by saying a pas 'the morning be fair colonel to of can speak when find opportunity of doing so unobserved thank will not be safer for be to carry message can not do that warder said think that be quite right that cousin comrade must do anything in power to aid who stood by when attacked wish to know nothing about must be between for must be able to swear have hand in matter that locked up safely at night be quite right jean be much best plan that must be so certainly must not myself like to know in making escape might endanger life of one who have acted simply from kindness of heart trust that suspicion will fall upon thank most heartily for having brought message from cousin for goodwill that have shown when terence ryan went out a usual after breakfast sentry passed saluted a if to one of own officer of course returned salute made cheery remark to such a rather change from work up in hill lad to gave short respectful answer three of prefacing with word morning be fair mon colonel two of have number of regiment on shako other who have deep scarcely healed scar over ear only wore forage cap having evidently lost shako when wounded what do mean by saluting prisoner french staff officer when be passing angrily asked old soldier have be long enough in service surely to know that prisoner be not saluted soldier stood at attention monsieur le capitaine said be not saluting prisoner be saluting brave officer whose order have obeyed in hard fight to whom comrade probably owed life mark of respect be due to brave man whether prisoner of war not officer passed on without answering arriving at headquarters reported circumstance to general be not surprised captain espel latter replied with slight smile french soldier know how to respect bravery in case there be little doubt for assistance of prisoner must have gone very hard with detachment that young officer who strangely enough be colonel be prisoner when fought side by side with men be natural that scarcely regard a one now have refused to give parole be afraid mean to try to make escape be sorry for must do so be sure to be captured again third one of nd men one with forage cap chanced to be posted at point of wall be not overlooked after have repeated formula agreed upon terence said to be one of lad who sent message that must assist if must be so mon colonel assisted when be somewhat hotly pressed ti good comradeship to repay service if one can have be thinking over although must not be difficult for to escape from here see how be to be got out of town be difficulty see terence replied must not hope to pas through circle of fortification be to take boat make off must be pursued recaptured to certainty for of course a soon a escape be known there must be hot search made for there be two thing needed first be disguise second be shelter until search for slackens after must be comparatively easy for to make off what sort of disguise must want monsieur if go by land peasant dress if by water of fisherman have money can give to purchase that must do for monsieur hiding place be more difficult however that will see about be native here have of course many friend acquaintance in town when have made plan will let know will manage that when be turn for duty will always be posted here then can tell what be arranged give be necessary to aid to make escape cousin jean monier will shut eye will not do anything think that be right for of course will be first to be suspected a for will be matter everyone know how stood by will guess that of have have hand in will never find out of be chiefly concerned expect that soon will be taken off prison duty for will not be sorry sent back to spain with first detachment come along after one be not so badly off in spain certainly madrid be good deal more lively than bayonne suppose terence said nodding towards guard who be standing few pace away gazing over country know nothing about monsieur have kept to just men of own regiment feel same about being kept prisoner there be fear of telling anyone spoke to one man more than when be found out that have escaped still might be a well that must not speak to again until tell that be fine morning for although own men can be trusted if of regular prison warder be to notice anything must not be slow in mentioning in hope of getting promotion accordingly terence made point of only passing along part of wall once day merely saying word to soldier a did to others on occasion when be on duty ten day later man replied to salutation by remarking that be fair day happened that man told off to guard on occasion be of nd there be therefore nothing to be feared from have arranged matter monsieur soldier said sister husband jules varlin will shelter be fisherman can be safely hidden in loft where keep net gear be honest fellow sister have talked over into lending aid so far although have not promised yet think will get to go down river with so a to reply if be challenged can put ashore mile two along coast now a to escape monsieur here be sharp saw with can cut round lock of door there be two outside bolt whose position dare say have noticed by cutting hole close to of can get hand through draw here be short handled augur to make hole for saw to go through there be four sentry at night in courtyard will manage to get men on duty tomorrow evening sergeant be good fellow if guess anything will hold tongue for have heard say more than once that be monstrous that must be kept prisoner therefore need not be afraid of will take care to keep eye shut will be on sentry duty here will get disguise up rope when have got down will let rope drop will carry off take away with thus there will be evidence where descended here be two sharp file with can cut through bar of window remove of then will not be known whether escaped way down stair men on sentry in courtyard at bottom can not be blamed because for aught governor will know may have gone out through window into other courtyard got over wall on side so must have proof a to set of men be negligent doubt will be talked to perhaps kept in guardroom few day wo hurt soldier be scarce enough so will hardly keep ten twelve men long from duty there be not enough in town now to furnish guard properly so need not worry about will give instruction how to find sister house tomorrow night must not escape until hear bell strike midnight party will relieve guard at hour see have four hour on duty a may have gone either on first watch second third will not be able to pitch on more than on others so that in fact blame will be divided between forty of will of course put on disguise over uniform destroy clothes when get to jules house thank very warmly good fellow for running risk for here be two hundred franc to pay for disguise will be more than enough soldier said jules put down at hundred fifty thing may cost more than expects at rate please hand to can arrange matter with when see then at about quarter past twelve will sally out will walk on now lest of warder must happen to notice that have be long time on part of wall ryan have understood little of what be happening when terence told what have be arranged exclaimed well after terence will never say word against frenchman here be soldier going to run lot of risk certainty of getting into row for merely because did best must against wretched spaniard without getting reward for must know that prisoner be not likely to have money to spare about quite so ryan what be more if have hundred pound in pocket must not offer penny for certainly must take a insult if did so must feel that must be sort of bribe though be ready to help a comrade be sure must not do for money sincerely hope wo get into serious row a said authority wo be able to tell party be on guard at time went must hardly put whole of under arrest at least not keep under arrest doubt there will be close search in

giving up said at end of third day saw jacques today for first time tell there be tremendous row when escape be discovered warder soldier who have be on duty night be arrested questioned warder be one

did on behalf that must be kept prisoner of might have furnished with tool for cutting door filing bar be so clear that be released at once soldier be kept for two day under arrest morning governor came down to prison men under arrest be drawn up spoke to very sharply to begin with 'one more of be assuredly concerned in matter breach of trust of kind be punishable with death ' then stopped looked fiercely up down line went on in different tone 'at same time admit that allowance be to be made for crime can understand that a soldier felt sympathy with soldier who although prisoner at time did not hesitate to cast in lot with to fight side by side with still soldier must never allow private sentiment to interfere with duty must have be glad when arrived here heard of what have happened to have be able to place british officer soldier in ship to have sent back to own country must have be breach of duty be forced to detain here a prisoner of course if must find out among have be concerned in affair must be duty to punish for there must have be more than one severely however although have done best to discover be not sorry men have be unable to do so for although men may have failed in duty a soldier have shown true hearted fellow to run risk not be sure from thought of reward to help who have helped 'you can return to duty hope that will in future remember that duty be first thing with soldier that must allow other feeling to interfere with ' jacques comrade be satisfied that although general felt be duty to reprimand be at heart by mean sorry that have got off gendarme be still making inquiry of course have learned nothing nobody be about on wharf at time of night think that will trouble much longer about will come to believe that must somehow have managed to get through line of fortification that will be caught trying to make way across country in three four day will be quite safe for to go down river for first two day boat went down be stopped examined of vessel be searched by gunboat hatch taken off hear that boat have be stopped today so fancy will soon be able to go down without fear although at night terence ryan be able to emerge from place of concealment walk up down little yard for two three hour be heartily glad when week after confinement jules told that thought might start at daybreak next morning now monsieur if will tell what want will buy thing for have already made out list consisted of nine gallon breaker for water dozen bottle of cheap wine thirty pound of biscuit fifteen pound of salt meat jules wife be to cook calculated that must be sufficient to last easily until have passed along spanish coast to point well beyond town garrisoned by french if not to corunna how about boat terence asked after other arrangement have be decided upon a told wish to take boat belonging to anyone who must feel loss therefore must be ship boat not one of fisherman if have money to pay for must be matter have scarcely enough now to maintain on way through spain there be mean of sending money here when rejoin army understand that monsieur have be along quay morning taking look at boat there be at least dozen must choose from mean ship boat of course many of craft keep boat hauled up at davit on deck most of keep one in water so that can row off to ship to stair simply leave in water because be too lazy to hoist up be case think with one boat belongs to vessel came in four day since from west indie be good sized ship dinghy such a be used for running out warp putting sailor ashore to bring off anything required other boat be better suited for voyage be for most part too large heavy to be rowed by two oar moreover have not mast sail on board a have therefore be one fixed eye on ship be lying alongside there be not craft outside boat be fastened to bowsprit can take off boot get on board drop into without difficulty push along to foot of stair be ten yard away of course will have water food that bundle of old net ready at top of stair can be out into stream five minute after have cut loose must start just before daylight be breaking so a to be off before fisherman put out for if of be about must at once notice have not got own boat at same time want to be far ahead of to pas gunboat at mouth of river in dark for must look suspicious now jules about of course know well that money must repay for kindness have shown risking so much for stranger know that have not with mean of making return for service want return monsieur fisherman said went into matter good deal against will because wife have set mind upon since came here have got to have just a much interest in matter a have must not take sou from now if day when war be over will send letter to marie with little present to just to show that have not forgotten must be great pleasure to will certainly do jules may be time before there will be opportunity of doing may be sure that will not forget wife cease to be grateful for kindness directly peace be made there be chance in other way of sending letter to will do so that evening jacques paid visit to sister have abstained from doing so before because thought that soldier who be suspected of being concerned in escape might all be watched that if of be seen to enter house visit might be paid to by gendarme did not come until be quite dark made long detour in town before venturing to approach before entered lane took good care that one be in sight when after chatting for hour rose to leave terence told that when wrote to sister must inclose letter to a must be impossible to write to direct for there must be no saying where might be stationed begged to convey heartiest thanks of ryan to comrade for share have taken in matter on saying good night terence insisted on marie accepting a parting gift watch chain be handsome one of french manufacture terence having bought from soldier who have taken from body of french officer killed during soult retreat from portugal must therefore be shown by to friend without exciting suspicion that have be obtained from english source marie accepted very unwillingly only after terence declaring that must feel very grieved if must not take one present be capable of making besides added one can tell what fortune may bring about husband might lose boat have long illness be well to have something that can part with without discomfort in time of need jules although desiring pay for service risk be very much gratified at present for part say monsieur said what say be right be careful people have laid by little money a say one can not tell what may happen if weather be bad there be risk of never getting back home again must be consolation to to know in addition to few hundred franc have laid by since be married two year ago there be something must bring marie must say seven eight hundred franc more at least must enable to set up shop laundry to earn own living thank from heart monsieur for for terence ryan slept a soundly a usual until aroused by jules then put on sea boot again loaded with net bag with provision wine while jules took water barrel after saying goodbye to marie started there be not soul on wharf putting store down at top of step watched jules who after taking off boot went across plank to ship made way noiselessly out on to bow swinging down into boat loosening head rope before did so push with oar against ship bow sent boat alongside quay then worked along with hand against wall until reached step store be at once transferred to boat pushed out into stream tide have just turned to run out for mile allowed to drift down river by time light be broadening out in sky jules stepped mast hoisted sail then seated in stern put oar out in hole cut for to steer with terence watched operation carefully wind be nearly due aft boat ran rapidly through water be just right a to time jules said a looked back where river made bend there be two others coming down mile behind so that will only seem to be rather earlier bird than rest near mouth of river two gunboat be anchored passed within short distance of one of solitary sailor keeping anchor watch on deck remarked be going to have fine day for fishing comrade yes think so maybe there will be more wind presently time before reaching gunboat ryan have lain down net be thrown loosely over a must be better that there must not seem to be more than two hand be generally carried in small fishing boat once out of river steered south laying course parallel to shore about mile out after hour sail jules directed head into little bay took out empty basket that have brought with stepped ashore after cordial shake of hand have already advised to bear very gradually to southwest have left small compass on board for guidance be thing often carry said in boat of size will be well for to take if be blown out of sight of land must find useful keep well out from spanish coast at rate until be well past bilbao after that can keep close in if like for will be taken for fishing boat from one of small village will walk straight back now to town question be asked at gate if anyone did happen to take notice of must suppose have be round peddling fish at farmhouse coming along have given instruction to terence a to sailing boat when running before wind sheet be to be loose while be to be tightened a much a might be necessary to make sail stand just full when wind be on beam forward of will understand said that when wind be right ahead can not sail against must then get sail in a flat a can sail a near a can to wind then when have gone distance must bring head round till sail go over on other side sail on tack so make zigzag course if wind must come dead ahead think best course must be to lower sail row against however at present with wind from east will be able to sail free on proper course then pushed boat off have better put oar out get head round said before hoisting sail again goodbye bon voyage since leaving river terence have be sailing under instruction a soon a boat be under way again said to companion here be free men again dicky call splendid terence go along well only hope will keep on like till get to corunna better still to mouth of douro must not count chicken before be hatched dicky there be storm french privateer to be reckoned with be not out of wood yet by long way however need not bother about at present be quite enough that have got stout boat favouring wind plenty to eat drink terence forget that be very important item especially a dare not land to buy anything for day what rate be going through water do think jules said be sailing about four knot hour when be going down river about three when have turned south pulled sail in suppose be about halfway between two now so can count a three knot half must make ryan said after making calculation eighty four mile in twenty four hour bravo dicky doubted whether mental power be equal to so difficult calculation well jules said that be about four hundred mile to corunna about hundred fifty to santander beyond thought must land safely at village oh let stick to boat a long a can ryan exclaimed certainly have more desire to be tramping among mountain taking chance with peasant than have if wind keep a be now must be at corunna in something like five day must be almost too much to hope for so that doe keep in present direction till be past santander will be very well satisfied mountain of navarre biscay be within sight from time have left river did not need compass to show way must steer there be many fishing boat from nivelle urumia saint sebastian to be seen dotted over sea on left kept out than majority of did not pas of nearer than mile after steering for couple of hour terence relinquished oar to companion must get accustomed to a well a said for must take in turn at night by twelve o'clock be abreast of town be have doubt san sebastian be now four mile from spanish coast be travelling at about same rate a at have started wind came off high land sometimes in such strong puff that have to loosen sheet fisherman have shown how to shorten sail by tying down reef point shifting tack in afternoon squall came so heavily that thought best to lower sail reef towards wind have risen so much that made for land when darkness came on threw out little grapnel boat carried hundred yard so from shore at point where village be visible here be sheltered from wind spreading out net to form bed laid down in bottom of boat pulling sail partly over be jolly enough ryan said be certainly pleasanter to lie here look at star than to be shut up in hiding place of jules be great nuisance having to stop though terence replied be loss of forty mile mind how long last ryan said cheerfully must go on for month at work providing provision must hold out much like look of weather dicky there be cloud on top of of hill though can manage boat well enough in such weather a have have today will be different thing altogether if bad weather set in must not mind if must talk spanish a well a can portuguese then must land fearlessly if weather be too bad to hold on see spanish hate portuguese a much a do french must a likely a not hand over at once at nearest french post slept fairly at daybreak got up grapnel hoisted sail again inshore scarcely felt wind a soon a made out couple of mile from land felt that be blowing hard wo go farther out dick lay boat head to west again will hold sheet while steer then can let sail fly if stronger gust than usual strike sit well over side illustration behe be walking along now be walking along now ryan said joyously have idea that sailing be a jolly a be sped along day before noon have passed bilbao a afternoon wore on wind increased in force cloud began to pas rapidly overhead from southeast have better get in to shore terence said even with scrap of sail keep on taking water in on lower side expect santander lie beyond point run out ahead of will land somewhere side of a soon a turned boat head towards shore hauled in sheet a tightly a must found try a must must not get to lie course sha' make point at terence said hour after have changed course besides have be nearly over two three time dare say fellow who understood boat well must manage if hold on like will end by drowning think best plan will be to lower sail mast row straight to shore quite agree with ryan said sailing be pleasant enough in fair wind can not say care for a be now with difficulty for sea be getting up lowered sail mast getting out oar turned head straight for shore be accustomed to rowing in still water found that be very different work after struggling at oar for couple of hour agreed that be good deal farther away from land than when began be of use dick terence said if can not make against wind while be fresh certainly can not do so when be tired arm feel a if must come out of socket so do mine ryan said with groan be aching over hand be raw with rough handle what be to do then terence there be nothing to do can see to get head round run before wind be nuisance perhaps gale wo last long when be over can get up sail make for northwestern point of spain have got provision enough to last for week be more comfortable added a got boat in required direction now take steering oar dick see that keep a straight a can before wind while set to bale be nearly half full of water took hour work with little bowl found in boat before be completely cleared of water relief given to be very apparent for rose much more lightly on wave will sit down at bottom of boat take by turn to hold steering oar have brought with lantern in lighted candle be kept burning in order to be able to light pipe be stowed away in locker in stern with store of biscuit after eating of dividing bottle of wine lighting pipe felt comparatively comfortable be of course drenched to skin a wind be cold pulled sail partly over doe not ship water now terence if go on like will be right expect will be right dick though be sure to be very much rougher than when get farther out still fancy open boat will live through almost anything providing be light in water suppose must have much chance if have dozen men on board with only two think there be hope that will get through must be different thing if wind be from west have great wave coming in from atlantic a have in heavy gale when came out from ireland a be nothing big wave breaking right over stern must damage very seriously there be not least fear of capsizing with lying in bottom did not attempt to keep alternate watch night only changing occasionally at steering oar one not occupied dozing off occasionally boat required little steering for a be lying in stern tendency be to run straight before wind a wave however became higher needed keeping straight when be in hollow between two sea seemed sometimes that wave following behind boat must break on to swamp a time after time rose over anxiety on score lessened grew more more confident that must go safely through occasionally baler be used to keep clear of water came in in shape of spray at time chatted cheerfully for be blessed with good spirit faculty of looking on best side of thing smoked pipe in turn getting fire from other so a to avoid necessity of resorting to lantern might very well blow out in spite of care have at first exercised by getting under sail with when wanted light be heartily glad when morning broke scene be wild one seemed to be in centre of circle of mist closed in at distance of mile so round at time rain fell sweeping along with stinging force wet a be mattered little to must give something for big glass of hot punch ryan said a munched piece of biscuit yes must not be bad terence agreed must rather have big bowl of hot coffee have changed opinion of seafaring life ryan said after pause seemed delightful morning started have drawback to be at sea in open boat during strong gale in bay of biscay be distinctly unpleasant position fancy be own fault dicky if have known how to manage boat have doubt that must have be able to get to shore when wind first began to freshen ought not to have waited so long a did before made for shelter well will know better next time terence think that now that be light have better get sleep by turn do lie down for four hour then will take turn all right be sure wake up mind go to sleep for if did might get broadside on to wave have doubt must roll over over so mind if before four hour be up feel can not keep eye open wake at once hour will do wonder for will be perfectly ready to take oar again chapter french privateer terence went off into deep sleep a soon a have pulled sail over head seemed to a if minute have elapsed when companion began to stir up with foot what be asked be awfully sorry to wake ryan shouted have have two hour of really can not keep eye open longer have felt going off two three time mean to say have be asleep for two hour have few minute over looked at watch a lay down right give oar say be blowing hard must think be seems to be getting up rather than going down well be right so far terence said cheerfully for be now wide awake again besides be getting quite skilful mariner have better spend few minute at baling before lie down for water be good three inch over board day storm continued when darkness began to close in seemed to that be blowing harder than ever have have two spell of sleep agreed that must now keep awake throughout night be bad enough having one to speak to day at night felt that companionship be absolutely needed during day have lashed together spar sail barrel of water be now nearly half empty so that if boat must be swamped must cling to support be terrible night towards morning be of opinion that gale be somewhat abating about eight o'clock there be break in cloud by noon sun be shining brightly wind be still blowing strong nothing to what have be evening before by sea be beginning to go down wave be a high a before be no longer broken crested with head of foam at ten o'clock felt that must both safely lie down till morning steering oar be lashed in position sail spread over whole of stern of boat drop of water be baled out lying down side by side be soon fast asleep when woke sun be high wind have dropped to gentle breeze boat be rising falling gently on smooth roller hurrah ryan shouted a stood up looked round be over vote terence that strip take swim then spread out clothes to dry after will breakfast comfortably then get up sail be very good programme dicky will carry out at once while be eating meal ryan asked where do suppose be terence beyond fact that be right out in bay of biscay have not most remote idea by way water went past must say that have be going at pretty nearly same rate a did when be sailing say four mile hour have be running for forty eight hour so that must have got nearly two hundred mile from santander question be must be best to make for england now for portugal have be going nearly northwest so must think that be pretty nearly north of finisterre may lie hundred twenty mile from suppose be two three time a much a from england wind be pretty nearly due east again now so can point head way must be nearly in ship course be likely to be picked up long before make land do vote for vote for nearest may get storm one of be quite enough at rate spain will be shortest by great deal if be picked up be just a likely to be by french privateer a by english vessel be quite of opinion be anxious to be back again a soon a can if got to england reported might be sent to depot not get out again for month so here go for south sail be hoisted boat sped merrily along in couple of hour clothes be dry think have better put ourselves on short ration terence said may be farther off than calculate upon at rate have better hold on to mouth of tagus if can there be sure to be british official there will be able to get money rejoin regiment without loss of time while might have sort of trouble with spaniard be to land at corunna vigo sail appeared in sight during day must think can not have come a far west a calculated terence said ought to have seen vessel in distance however will keep due south will be better to strike coast of spain have to run along shore round cape finisterre than to risk missing land altogether that night kept regular watch wind be very light now be not going more than two knot hour through water ryan be steering when morning broke wake up terence exclaimed suddenly here be ship within mile so of a be lugger be afraid be french privateer terence sprang to foot light be still faint felt sure that companion be right that vessel be french privateer have put foot in now mistake ryan said be french prison time without friendly soldier to help to get out look like dicky in hour will be broad daylight can not help seeing still there be hope for must give out that be spanish fisherman who have be blown off coast be not likely have anyone on board that speaks spanish portuguese will sound right in ear so very likely after overhauling will let go on way at rate be of use trying to escape will hold on course for few minute then head suddenly towards a if have only just seen will hail in portuguese be sure to tell to come on board then will try to make understand by sign by using few french word that have be blown out to sea by gale want to know course for santander a french have be there for time must be natural enough for to have picked up little of language in few minute altered course sailed towards lugger also soon turned towards when approached within vessel length terence stood up shouted in portuguese what be bearing of santander reply be in french come alongside given with gesture of arm explaining word let sail run down a came alongside terence climbed up by channel to deck espagnol said to captain who be standing close to a jumped down on to deck espagnole capitaine poisson santander grand tempete motioned with arm to signify that have be blown offshore at santander then pointed in several direction towards south looked interrogatively be spanish fisherman who have be blown off coast captain said to officer have be lucky in living out well be short of hand having so many away in prize boat will be useful in place of one have smashed up in gale let couple of men throw net thing overboard then run up to davit then said to terence prisoner go forward make useful pointed towards forecastle terence gave yell of despair threw hat down on deck in volley of portuguese begged captain to let go latter however only waved hand angrily two sailor coming up seized terence by arm dragged forward ryan be called upon deck also ordered forward too remonstrated be cut short by threatening gesture from captain for time preserved appearance of deep dejection terence tugging hair a if in utter despair till ryan whispered for heaven sake terence go on like will break out in shout of laughter be monstrous be inhuman terence exclaimed in portuguese thus to seize harmless fisherman who have so narrowly escaped drowning sea be le cruel than men have taken boat too dear good boat what will mother think when return that have be swallowed up by sea how will watch for in vain fortunately for success of story lugger hailed from northern french port a not one on board understood spanish portuguese have idea that latter be language in prisoner be speaking after hour of pretended despair rose from deck on have be sitting on order being given to trim sail went to rope aided privateersman to haul at before end of day be doing duty a regular member of crew be active young fellow captain said to first mate a watched supposed spaniard making useful be lucky for that have fair store of provision water in boat be very short handed will be useful must have let go if have not be for boat a have only one left can swim be too lucky find to give up craft have be heading north when ryan have first seen held that course day terence gathered from talk of sailor that be bound for brest to port belonged frenchman be congratulating that cruise be so nearly over that have be so successful one from time to time sailor be sent up into cross tree scanned horizon to north west in afternoon reported that must make out upper sail of large ship going captain went up to look at think be english ship of war said when descended to deck be long way off with light wind must run away from will not trouble about must know well enough that must not get within ten mile of before got dark turned out to be case for lookout from time to time reported that distant sail be keeping on course slight feeling of hope have be felt by terence ryan faded away be placed in same watch be below when a daylight broke heard sudden exclamation tramping of foot overhead moment later watch be summoned on deck hope that have have same luck that have have run into arm of one of cruiser terence whispered in portuguese to ryan a ran up on deck together a reached deck boom of cannon be heard at same instant ball passed through mainsail half mile away be british sloop of war have evidently made out lugger before watch on board latter have seen captain be foaming with rage shouting order crew hurried to execute on deck near foremast lay man who have be on lookout who have be felled with handspike by captain when ran out on deck at first alarm although at first flurried alarmed crew speedily recovered executed with promptitude order be given there be haze on water light wind be stirring vessel be moving through water at three knot hour a soon a course have be changed so a to bring wind forward of beam be best point of sailing men be sent to gun first mate placing at long eighteen pounder be mounted a pivot gun aft similar weapon being in bow took four five minute shot after shot from sloop hummed overhead firing now ceased a change of course of lugger have placed sloop dead astern of latter be unable therefore to fire even bow chaser without yawing be now turn of lugger gun in stern be carefully trained a be fired patch of white splinter appeared in sloop bulwark cheer broke from french effect of shot must have raked from stem to stern be at once evident sloop bore off wind until whole broadside must be seen flat on face captain shouted there be roar of ten gun storm of shot screamed overhead four of passed through sail one ploughed up deck killing two sailor injuring three others with splinter two three rope of minor importance be cut serious damage inflicted crew a leapt to foot gave cheer knew that with light wind lugger must run away from heavier craft that latter must only hope for success by crippling steady with helm captain went on a pivot gun be again ready to deliver fire wait till three mast show like one jacques aim little bit higher see if can not knock away spar sloop be coming up again to wind a be nearly stem on gun cracked out again cheer broke from lugger a opponent foretop mast fell over side with hamper round sloop

up into wind lower foresail captain shouted quick men lash spare spar to yard be busy cutting away topmast will be off again before be ready to move have lost nearly mile will soon be out of range be sharp with gun again sloop have indeed fallen greatly astern while delivering broadside commander have evidently seen that unless wind sprang up lugger must get away from unless must cripple that might seriously damage perhaps knock one of mast out of by stern chaser only chance therefore of capturing be to take spar out of did not attempt to come about again after firing second broadside kept up fire a fast a gun must be loaded lugger however be stealing rapidly away from in ten minute have increased lead by half mile without having suffered serious damage sloop soon ceased fire a be now almost out of range seven eight of crew have be more le injured by splinter with exception of three killed none be badly hurt lugger be now put on former course gun lashed into place again three men killed sewn up in hammock laid between two of gun in order to be handed to friend on arrival in port be slip between cup lip terence remarked to companion a sloop ceased firing certainly thought when came on deck that trouble be over must say for friend french captain showed good sailor got out of scrape uncommonly well good deal too well ryan grumbled be very unpleasant while lasted be very well to be shot at by enemy to be shot at by one friend be more than one bargained for coolness under fire displayed by two spaniard have carried off pleased captain who patted on shoulder a came along good temper being now completely restored by escape be brave fellow said will make good privateersman can not do better than stay with will make a much money in month a must in year fishing terence smiled vaguely a if understood that captain be pleased with did not otherwise catch meaning arrived at brest without further adventure a neared port captain asked terence if companion must enter upon book of privateer after much difficulty made a believed terence understand question latter affected to consult ryan then answered that must be willing to do so captain then put name gave down on ship roll handed of paper certifying that juan monte sebastian peral belonged to crew of belle jeanne naming rate of wage that be to receive share in value of prize taken then gave eighty franc a advance on pay from date of coming on board signified to that must buy clothes similar to worn by crew instead of heavy fisherman garment have on will soon learn language said to mate be sure will make good sailor have put down wage share of prize money at of own men be sure will be well worth when get to speak language learn duty a soon a be alongside greater portion of men went ashore in evening boatswain landed with terence ryan proceeded with to slop shop where bought clothes similar to worn by crew beyond fact that be of nautical appearance there be distinctive dress then returned to lugger changed clothes at once boatswain telling to stow away boot other thing a must be useful to in bad weather next day privateer commenced to unload for most valuable portion of cargo of captured ship have be taken on board when vessel with greater portion of good carried have be sent into port under charge of prize crew remained on board for ten day going freely into town sometimes with sailor sometimes alone terence pretended to make considerable progress in french be able though with difficulty to make understood by crew first mate have gone with to mairie where official stamp have be affixed to ship paper found that question be asked of person entering leaving town on land side twice strolled out went distance into country have agreed that must be better to defer attempt to escape until day before lugger sailed a there must then be little time for captain to make inquiry after to institute search bought pocket map of north of france carefully studied road be plain enough what best course be dick must go along projecting point of brittany through dinan to avranches then follow coast up till get to coutances see be nearly opposite jersey island doe not look to be more than fifteen mile away so that if can get hold of boat there must be able to run across in three hour so with favourable wind look easy enough ryan agreed seems to be about one hundred twenty mile from here to avranches thirty forty up to coutances so must do in week easily what story will make up if be questioned suppose peasant may meet on road be likely to question at for most of breton speak only own language have better always sleep out in open if do run across official can show paper give out that have be ill treated on board lugger be going to saint malo where mean to ship on privateer know be port from lot of sail think will have difficulty in buying provision at small village french will pas muster very well in such place can easily remark that be on way to saint malo to join ship there if village functionary question paper will be good enough for can say that got left ashore by accident when craft sailed from brest be going to rejoin at saint malo where be going to put in think perhaps that must be better story than that have run away know that authority interest in runaway seaman from privateer at rate be likely tale drunken seaman doubt often do get left ashore yes must be very good story terence think that there must be no great fear even if be to go boldly into town think there must still be better to be on safe side avoid risk accordingly afternoon before belle jeanne be to sail went ashore bought enough bread cold meat to last for couple of day two thick blanket a be now november night be bitterly cold then left town followed road for dinan on approaching village of landerneau left road lay down until be quite dark then made detour through field round village came down on road again walked night passing through huelgoat then a morning be breaking left road again after going quarter of mile through field lay down in dry ditch by side of thick hedge ate meal went to sleep did not start again until be getting dusk when returned to road followed night in morning went boldly into little village terence went into shop bought couple of loaf french be quite good enough for so simple operation suppose be going to saint woman said yes have have holiday to see friend at brest be going to rejoin be only question asked after walking two mile lay up for day a before have met several peasant on road have exchanged salutation with found by map that be now within twenty mile of dinan having made over thirty mile night a be somewhat footsore from unaccustomed exercise travelled only sixteen seventeen mile following night next evening at about ten o'clock walked boldly through dinan most of inhabitant be already asleep few who be still in street paid heed to two sailor going have doubt to saint malo crossing river rance by bridge took road in direction of port after following for mile two struck off to east before morning arrived on river running up from bay of mount saint michael lay down until late in afternoon then crossed river at ferry kept along by coast until reached sebine river be getting on first rate ryan said a lay down for few hour sleep have only got avranches to pas now hope sha' be questioned at dick for have now no good story to tell for be going away from saint malo instead of to of course a long a question be right be simply two sailor on way home for time if have to show paper with spanish name on must be in fix of course might have run away from ship at saint malo must not explain coming up way however hope french be good enough to answer casual question without exciting attention will cross by ferry boat a soon a begin to ply a avranches stand little distance up river can avoid altogether by keeping along coastline score of peasant have assembled by time ferry boat man made appearance from cottage terence companion who have be lying down yard away joined just a be going down to boat be from saint malo suppose old peasant said to terence latter nodded have got month leave from ship said have be knocked about by english cruiser will be in shipwright hand for five six week before be ready for sea again be not from part of country peasant who be speaking in patois of normandy remarked

peasant terence continued chatting with until landed need to go through avranches latter said take road by coast through granville to coutances how far be to coutances about twenty mile at least so have heard for have never be there after walking few mile went down on to seashore lay down among rock until evening at eight o'clock started again walked boldly through granville where sailor dress must felt sure attract attention be about nine o'clock when entered place reason for doing so at hour be that wished to lay in stock of provision a did not intend to enter coutances until late at night when hoped to be able to get hold of boat at once have just made purchase when met fat little man with red sash showed to be maire of place other public functionary where be going what ship do belong to asked pompously be sailor on way from saint malo to cherbourg terence replied have paper of course of course monsieur le maire must see maire said come with to house close by there be several person near man in civil uniform be with maire therefore terence gave apparently willing assent followed by functionary went into house close by lamp be burning on table in hall light candle in office maire said woman have gone up to bed man turned key went in bringing out two candle lighted at lamp then went into room maire seated in armchair at table minor functionary placed two suspected person on side facing took place standing by side a be going in terence whispered if there be trouble will take fellow manage maire now that functionary said let see paper why exclaimed looking at name be not frenchman terence said quietly pretend to be a see be sailor who have done service on board french privateer where be privateer know monsieur le maire be not satisfied with treatment so left at brest be very serious maire said be spaniard have deserted ship at brest have travelled hundred fifty mile through france now what be doing here be a say monsieur travelling through france desire to see france have heard that be greatest country in world frenchman visit spain in large number why must not spaniard visit france tone of sarcasm in terence spoke be not lost upon maire who rose from seat purple with anger will take men into custody said to assistant be very grave business now dick terence exclaimed turning to man who stood next to grasped suddenly by throat at same moment ryan caught up heavy inkstand threw across table at maire striking functionary in stomach doubling completely up then ran round table bound man who have not yet recovered breath tightly in chair thrust handkerchief into mouth man whom terence be holding have scarcely struggled terence a gripped have said keep quiet will choke prisoner felt that assailant must do so in moment if chose hand be fastened tightly behind with own belt by ryan short ruler be thrust between teeth fastened there by handkerchief going round back of head so far so good dick now look round for something with can bind more firmly several hank of red tape lay upon table with portion of one of back of chair in maire sat be lashed to handle of heavy bureau then foot be fastened to two leg of chair so that must neither kick upset other man be then fastened a securely done blew out candle left room locked door behind taking key then sallied out into street be good shot of yours with inkstand terence said have eye on time be speaking ryan replied saw that if be to move to get round table at little man must have time to shout that if must hit in wind must be right well there must be no more stopping now know whether there be mr maire if not there will certainly be alarm until morning if there be depends upon what sort of woman be a to how long start will get if be sleepy woman be probably dreaming by time may not discover until morning that lord master be not by side if be bad tempered woman will probably lie for hour two thinking over what will say to when come in if be nervous woman will get up go downstairs left lamp burning in hall on purpose seeing there will naturally think that have not come in will go upstairs again for hour two then will probably call up servant may send out to look for finally may go to police office wake up constable be not probable there be of on night duty in quiet place like altogether calculate that will be at least four hour before think of breaking open door of office to see if be there so at worst have got four hour start at best ten hour be only half past nine now will be at mouth of sienne in three hour le doe not look above nine ten mile on map directly get fairly out of town will go a quickly a can for minute be of importance if can get hold of boat at once ought to be at jersey soon after daybreak although be not very sure of for believe there be sort of strong current along coast remember one of officer saying so a came down channel on voyage out of course will make difference whether can get boat with sail not if can not find boat will have to hide up may be sure that there will be hot search for in morning must get off tonight if can most likely there be fishing village somewhere near mouth of river a soon a be out of town broke into trot continued with scarcely intermission until approached small village expect stand on bank of river terence said there be chance of anyone being up so can go through fearlessly couple of hundred yard farther reached river large ferry boat be moored here keeping along bank to left be not long before came upon several boat hauled up on shore while three four others lay at mooring short distance out thank goodness terence exclaimed will have difficulty now selected boat lying nearest water edge moon be half full be now sinking towards west light however be of assistance to there be mast sail in boat a well a pair of oar at first be unable to move down to water getting oar out of other boat laid down a roller with managed after great exertion to get afloat chapter smart engagement after pushing boat out into stream terence companion allowed to drift quietly for distance then getting out oar rowed hard until be beyond mouth of river tide be thought by level of water where have embarked within hour two of flood therefore determined to shape course to north of point where believed jersey to lie so that when tide turned must sweep down upon wind be too light to be of assistance star be bright position of north star served a guide to direction must take have taken considerable time to launch boat calculated that be nearly midnight when left mouth of river there be occasion to row hard for until became daylight must see island of jersey must not shape course with certainty must only hope that by keeping to north of must not find in morning that tide have taken too far to south be very lucky in weather terence said a after labouring at heavy oar for couple of hour paused for few minute rest if have be strong wind must never have done for to have started believe in bad weather there be tremendous current about island desperately rough water fog must have be even worse for a be seems to can not go very far wrong suppose tide be about turning now if by daylight find that have be carried long way past island will soon have tide turning again will take back to be more afraid of falling in with french privateer than be of missing island there be sure to be of at granville to say nothing of saint malo suppose of at granville will put out in search of merely to please maire if be going to sea must be sure to keep lookout for if did see must have chance of getting away terence boat be not so big a one stole at bayonne row much heavier there be one thing even privateer must not sail very fast in light wind if freshens in morning can get up sail then hope will get up bit ryan said for after five six hour rowing with beastly oar hand will be raw be sure back arm will be nearly broken must risk that dick calculated fifteen mile in straight line across to jersey so that must jog along at rate of couple of mile hour to get far enough to west now then let be moving again night seemed interminable to felt relieved indeed when morning began to break in half hour must be light enough for to see for considerable distance unshipping oar stood up looked round that must be jersey terence exclaimed pointing to north current must have taken past a be afraid must what time be dick nearly eight then tide must be turning already island must be six mile away now if row hard will know in hour whether be being carried north south must be going north if tide have turned terence know remember that mate of sea horse said that in channel course of current did not change at high low water so there be saying what way be going at present well there be little more wind suppose have better get up sail there be jersey whether get there little sooner little later can not make much difference be sure be too tired to row much faster than can sail terence agreed accordingly stepped mast hoisted sail at first boat moved slowly through water wind be freshening in hour be foaming along tide be against still terence said presently think be nearer jersey that when first saw look there ryan exclaimed few minute later there be lugger coming out from direction of granville so there be dick with wind behind wo be very long before be here must say that be about six seven mile off hour will bring up to will get out oar terence will help bit can change about occasionally terence be steering with other oar while held sheet boat be travelling at good rate lugger be fast running down towards there be schooner coming out from jersey terence exclaimed joyously if be british privateer may be saved yet have just made up mind that be in for french prison ryan looked over shoulder be farther off than lugger said yes current be keeping back be helping on towards will be close thing agree with be afraid that lugger will be here first change seat with will have spell at oar be good deal stronger than ryan felt comparatively fresh after hour rest so there be perceptible increase in boat speed after change have be effected when lugger be within mile of schooner about double that distance former changed course little bore up a if to meet schooner hurrah ryan shouted frenchman be making for schooner if jersey boat turn run there will be fight lugger look to bigger boat terence said a stopped rowing for moment however be likely to be able to slip off while be at rapidly two vessel approached other when within mile puff of smoke broke out from lugger bow be answered almost instantly by one from schooner running fast through water vessel be soon within short distance of other terence have ceased rowing for there be fear that lugger be now abeam of must give thought to small boat fight be going on in earnest two vessel poured broadside into other a passed lugger wearing round at once engaging schooner broadside to broadside frenchman have heavier metal terence said be afraid schooner will get worst of lugger be crowded with men too what do say dick will do best to help schooner think ought to ryan agreed at once have certainly saved think ought to do what can accordingly brought boat nearer to wind two vessel be now close hauled be moving slowly through water boat passed two three hundred yard astern of lugger sailed little farther then when able to lay course for schooner went about bore down towards just a did so halliard of schooner mainsail be shot asunder sail ran down mast there be shout of triumph from lugger at once closed in towards crippled adversary be going to try carry schooner by boarding terence exclaimed keep a close a will go dick seizing oar again began to row with might by time came up two vessel be side by side gun have ceased fire there be rattle of pistol shot mingled with clash of arm shout of combatant running up to schooner side terence ryan clambered on channel sprung on to deck of schooner desperate fight be going on forward where two vessel touched other there be one aft here fifteen twenty foot of water separated ship even helmsman have left wheel to join in fight about half of lugger crew have made way on to deck of schooner jersey men be still fighting stoutly rest of lugger crew be gathered in bow of own vessel waiting until there must be clear enough space left for to join comrade thing look bad terence exclaimed french crew be great deal stronger lend hand to turn two of eight pounder round there be plenty of cartridge handy drew cannon back from place turned round loaded with charge of powder then rammed in two of bag of bullet be lying beside schooner stood higher out of water than lugger be able to train two cannon so that bore upon mass of frenchman in latter bow take steady aim terence said be only just in time fellow be being beaten back moment later two piece be fired discharge took terrible effect among french sweeping away more than half of gathered in lugger bow load again terence exclaimed be too strong for jersey men still for moment french boarder have paused now with shout of fury fell upon crew of schooner driving back foot by foot towards stern cannon be now trained directly forward when crowd of fighting men approached terence shouted in french to jersey men to fall back on side captain turning round seeing gun pointing forward repeated order in stentorian shout jersey men leapt to one side other moment be clear two cannon poured content into midst of french who have paused for moment surprised at sudden cessation of resistance two clear lane be swept through crowd then with shout captain of schooner crew fell upon frenchman ryan be about to rush forward when terence said ryan load again better make sure heavy loss have suffered however so discouraged french that many at once turned running back jumped on to deck of lugger while others though still resisting be driven after a soon a gun be reloaded be trained a before to bear on lugger bow a french be driven back be again fired completed discomfiture of enemy with loud shout jersey men followed on to deck of own ship terence ryan now ran forward snatched up couple of cutlass joined friend be soon fighting in front line french resistance be now almost over captain have fallen in five minute last of threw down arm surrendered while great shout went up from crew of schooner french flag be hauled down a soon a prisoner have be sent below ensign be brought from schooner fixed to flag halliard above tricolor two hoisted together captain have already turned to two men who have come so opportunely to assistance know who be where come from men have certainly saved from capture did not know be annette until be too late to draw off must not have engaged for be strongest lugger sail out of granville carry double weight of metal with twice a strong crew whoever be thank most heartily be half owner of schooner must have lost be worth to say nothing of perhaps having to pas next five year in french prison be two british officer terence said have escaped from french prison be making way to jersey when saw that lugger coming after must certainly have be captured have not come up so thought least must do be to lend hand well gentleman have certainly saved jacques bontemps captain of annette be old acquaintance of mine commanded smaller craft before got annette have have two three fight together so be whom saw in little boat of course made out that lugger be chasing though why must be doing so must not tell thought more about after fight once began be a astonished a frenchman when swept bow just glanced round saw what looked like two french fisherman thought that must be two of lugger crew who for reason other have turned gun against own ship will be triumph indeed for when enter saint helier annette have be terror of privateer fortunately be generally away cruising many prize have taken into granville have have luck to recapture two of when be known to be at home most of keep in port for be good deal more than match for craft sail out from saint helier only went into granville yesterday thought that there be fear of being out again for week so when saw took for smaller lugger sail from port be more than match for fact be be looking at chasing wondering if must be in time instead of noticing size be not until fired that first broadside that found have caught tartar must have run if there have be chance of getting away be wonderfully fast boat knew that only chance be to knock away one of mast now will be making sail again must excuse for few minute in hour main halliard have be repaired sail hoisted when other damage be made good captain with crew went on board lugger two vessel sailed together for jersey terence companion have accompanied captain now gentleman may a well come down with into cabin be likely enough that will be able to find clothes in bontemps chest will fit be dandy in way at rate clothes will suit better than have on found indeed that lugger captain have so large store of clothing that have difficulty whatever in rigging out while be changing captain have left returned presently with beaming face be more valuable prize than hoped for said be full almost to hatch with plunder have taken in last cruise can not make out what led to come out of granville unless be in pursuit of expect be that terence said be arrested by maire of granville have to tie one of official up be pompous little man doubt when got free went down to port persuaded captain of lugger to put out at once to endeavour to find expect told that be prisoner of importance english spy french emigre well captain be glad that capture have turned out well for certainly ought to share captain said for if have not be for matter must have gone other way must have undoubtedly be captured oh want to share have helped to avoid french prison have certainly saved from same thing so be fairly quits well will have time to talk about when get into port in meantime will search jacques locker like enough there may be something worth having there of course may have taken ashore directly landed be hardly likely a have evidently captured several british merchantman while have be out be sure to have gold valuable in locker search indeed brought to light four bag of money marked with name of english ship contained in over pound with several gold watch ring other valuable now gentleman captain said at least will divide money with annette cargo below hatch be certainly worth ten time a much must insist upon going share with will feel very hurt if will not do so thank captain terence said will not refuse offer will have to provide with new uniform take passage out to portugal be where regiment be at present so money will be very useful see have not watch monsieur have better take one of thanks parted with mine to good woman who helped to escape from bayonne so will accept offer also in two hour schooner entered port of saint helier lugger under easy sail following in wake be greeted with enthusiastic cheer by crowd gathered on quay a soon a be seen that prize be dreaded annette have for month past be terror to privateer fisherman of place that must have be captured by cerf seemed marvellous indeed british officer be on quay when got alongside came on board at once governor have sent to congratulate in name captain teniers said on having captured vessel double own size have for time be terror of water will be glad if will give particular of action will when can spare time afterwards go up give full report of owe capture entirely to two gentleman who be officer in army have escaped from french prison be making for port when first saw morning with annette in hot chase after did not strike that be for be only last night that news came in have be seen yesterday sailing towards granville thought that be lionne be boat own size came up before have overhauled boat directly fight began must see mistake have made a be good deal faster than be be of use running there be just chance might cripple get away then related incident of fight well congratulate gentleman officer said heartily have indeed done good turn to captain teniers to whom have pleasure of speaking name be o'connor replied terence have honour to be on sir arthur wellesley staff have rank of captain in army be colonel in portuguese service be lieutenant ryan of majesty mayo fusilier officer looked little doubtful while terence be speaking be difficult to believe that young fellow of one two twenty at outside must be captain on lord wellington staff for sir arthur have be raised to peerage after battle of talavera still le that must be colonel in portuguese service however bowed gravely said name be major chalmers of th be adjutant to governor if will not be inconvenient will be glad if will return with report yourselves to be quite ready terence said have nothing to do in way of packing up for have only clothes stand in be indeed property of captain of lugger who be killed in action telling captain teniers that must be coming down again when have seen governor two friend accompanied officer very few word be said on way for major entertained strong doubt whether terence have not be hoaxing whether account have given of be not altogether fictitious on arriving at governor left for few minute in anteroom while went in gave account have received from captain of manner in lugger have be captured said that two gentleman who have played so important part in matter be a said one of officer on staff of lord wellington colonel in portuguese army other subaltern in mayo fusilier why do say a said major have doubt about only reason for doubting be that be young fellow of about twenty must accord well enough with claim of one of to be lieutenant that other must be captain on lord wellington staff colonel in portuguese service be quite incredible must seem so certainly major however be evident that have behaved extraordinarily well in fight with annette can not imagine that story young fellow might tell to civilian must venture to assume military title to have claim on arrival at military station will please ask to come in at rate story will be worth hearing good day gentleman went on a terence ryan entered have to congratulate very heartily upon very efficient manner in assisted in capture of french privateer have for time be doing great damage among island have be much more than match for of privateer here although have be chased several time by cruiser have always managed to get away now may ask how happened to be approaching island in small boat at time that encounter took place certainly sir be prisoner at bayonne have be captured by french when endeavouring to cross frontier into portugal with regiment while lieutenant ryan be wounded at talavera be in hospital there when spaniard left town french marched in what be regiment colonel o'connor be called minho regiment sir consists of two battalion have have honour of being mentioned in general order more than once be so on day after first attack of victor upon donkin brigade stationed on hill forming left of british position at talavera governor looked at adjutant who rising went to table on be pile of official gazette picking out one handed to governor who glanced through here be general order of day said assuredly lord wellington speaks in very highest term of service colonel o'connor minho regiment under command rendered certainly very high praise indeed will understand sir that be obliged to be cautious here seemed so strange that so young officer must have attained rank of colonel be curious to know how must have occurred be by mean surprised that must seem strange to must hold rank claim be like friend lieutenant ryan in mayo fusilier when have good fortune to be mentioned in despatch in connection with affair in transport took out to portugal be engaged with two french privateer in consequence of mention general fane appointed one of aide de camp acted in capacity during campaign ended at corunna be left on field insensible on night after battle when came to myself army be embarking so made way through galicia into portugal on reaching lisbon be appointed by sir john craddock to staff be sent by on mission to northern frontier of portugal on way took command of body of freshly raised portuguese levy who be without officer leader of kind with aid of small escort with formed into reliable regiment have good fortune to do service with be therefore confirmed in command be given portuguese rank sir arthur wellesley on succeeding sir john craddock in supreme command still kept name on headquarter staff thereby adding greatly to authority continued in independent command of regiment after talavera be despatched to aid spaniard in holding pas of banos before arrived there soult have crossed pas being cut off by force from rejoining army determined to cross mountain into portugal in so doing came upon french division on march to plasencia company of regiment with be be cut off taken prisoner forgive for having doubted colonel o'connor must of course have remembered name in report of operation before subsequent to battle of talavera lord wellington mention more than once that left during advance be covered by partisan corp of wilson o'connor mention too that be by messenger from colonel o'connor that first learned how formidable force be in rear be therefore able to cross tagus escape from perilous position of course never entered mind that officer who have rendered such valuable service be so young man there be only one mystery left how be when mr ryan escaped from bayonne that be found in boat in bay of saint malo doe seem rather roundabout way of rejoining terence said with smile escaped in boat made along north coast of spain when off santander be blown out to sea in gale be picked up by french privateer be supposed to be two spanish fisherman a privateer be short of boat took ours enrolled among crew be on way to brest took opportunity to desert made way on foot until reached mouth of river sienne made off in boat last night morning saw privateer in chase of must certainly have be recaptured have not cerf come up engaged while fight be going on have gone on board schooner unperceived by party took what seemed to best way of aiding friend who be getting somewhat worst of crew of lugger being very much stronger than crew of schooner well hope that will both at once take up quarter with a long a stay here will then have opportunity of hearing of adventure more in detail thank very much sir will be very happy to accept kind invitation hope will not trespass upon hospitality long for be anxious to be off a soon a possible so a to rejoin without loss of time be particularly so for although will be two three month before there be movement of troop be afraid of finding someone else appointed to command of regiment have be so long with now must be sorry indeed to be put to other work can quite understand well there be regular communication from here there be not week pass without craft other sailing from here to weymouth must rather if possible be put on board ship on way to portugal terence said if landed in england must have to report ourselves might be sent to depot be month before got out there again spoke to captain of cerf about morning be good enough to promise a soon a have repaired damage must run out into bay put on board first ship overhauled bound for peninsula must be excellent plan from point of view governor said teniers be one of best sailor on island have several time carried despatch for to weymouth must not be in better hand four day later schooner be ready to sail again will be last voyage in captain said have have offer for will sell a soon a come back again a will take command of annette ought to do well in for rig build be so evidently french that will be able to creep up close to french vessel making along coast returning from abroad without being suspected of being enemy of

general hill to whose division regiment be attached until operation must commence in spring put up at inn having eaten meal walked out into town be full of british soldier be not long before found cafe be set apart for use of officer on entering terence at once joined party of three belonging to regiment with of whose officer be acquainted a have be encamped next to mayo fusilier during long month preceding advance up valley of tagus ryan be of course equally known to three officer rose with exclamation of surprise a newcomer walked up to table why o'connor how in world did get here how be ryan thought that be prisoner so be terence said a see gave slip here be drew up chair to little table may consider lucky in regiment being on river o'connor will be much better off than ryan will be at portalegre be seconded ryan said have be appointed o'connor adjutant with temporary rank of captain congratulate chance be will have much better time of than if be with own regiment mean now when campaign begin in spring o'connor always seems to be in thick of while division may remain here while fighting be going on somewhere else besides always manages to dine good deal better than do fellow being portuguese be able to get supply when peasant be ready to take oath that have not so much a loaf of bread fowl in village how will manage to get on with ryan without speaking language oh remember be grinding up portuguese spring so suppose can get on pretty well now yes o'connor promised that must ask for a soon a must speak language so stuck at hard now see have got reward can tell that troop here be good deal better off than be elsewhere there be fearful want of land carriage get supply up by boat be why portuguese regiment be encamped on river well how did get away from french be curious that when saw o'grady last be fortnight ago when came in to get conveyance to take over sundry case of whisky have come up river for use of mess said ' expect that o'connor dick ryan will turn up here before spring be sure will if have got together be too long story to tell here ryan said be full of hairbreadth escape danger by sea land end up with naval battle officer laughed well will come to quarter one of said have got decent wine really good cigar came up from lisbon last week there be lot of fellow who will be glad to see accordingly adjourned to large building where officer of regiment be quartered in apartment have be turned into mess room found dozen officer of whom be known to terence ryan after many question be asked answered on side ryan be requested to tell story of adventure after being taken prisoner told in exaggerated style elicited roar of laughter making most of what called battle of shirt sleeve with guerilla exaggerating danger of escape horror of imprisonment for week among sail net o'connor said have hardly got back sense of smell yet stink of tar mixed with fishy odour will be vivid in remembrance for rest of life when have at last finished one of said now how much of be true ryan fact be just a have told replied gravely may think have exaggerated for did irishman ever tell story without exaggeration give honour that never did one keep nearer to truth than have done say that fisherman wife took quite such strong fancy to a have stated although can hardly have be insensible to personal advantage really otherwise know have diverged far from narrow path of truth tell two day that be running before gale be thing never wish to go through again really tied up maire of granville ryan did so dicky said miserable object poor little fat man looked a sat in chair trussed up like fowl now about sea fight ryan word be a happened o'connor turned gunner very decent shot made too proof of be that if must have taken believe captain of schooner must have given booty found in lugger hold be modest self denying contented ourselves with third of cash found in captain cabin must not have refused if wanted to captain made point of came to nearly three hundred pound apiece mighty useful be for have of course to get new uniform rig out horse saddlery at lisbon know what must have done without for family finance must not have stood drawing upon mortgage must have ruined entirely well certainly be substantial proof of truth of incident in story think that rather than have passed forty eight hour in storm must have stopped at bayonne taken chance of exchange then be afraid forester that be deficient in martial ardour terence said gravely desire to be back fighting french be so great that danger must have appalled there be general laugh well at rate managed uncommonly well ryan whether be martial ardour animated not o'grady be not far wrong when said that o'connor must creep out through mouse hole if there be other way of doing now what have be doing since have be away terence asked well to begin with andalusia have be captured by soult suchet have occupied valencia lerida be captured by after scandalously weak resistance for there be over nine thousand troop there place surrendered after only have fallen gerona on other hand be only captured by augereau after resistance a gallant a of saragossa be extraordinary thing about spaniard sometimes show cowardly beyond expression at others fight like hero just at present even junta pretend that have army capable of driving french out of pyrenees be comfort for will have to rely upon ourselves not be humbugged by spaniard worthlessness of whose promise lord wellington have ascertained by bitter experience portuguese government be a troublesome a truthless a of spain wellington be able to hold own with there be little doubt that regular regiment will fight be really of valuable assistance to have be raised in spite of constant opposition of junta at lisbon there be doubt that next campaign will be hot one for now spain have be a completely subdued a such vainglorious excitable people can be subdued french marshal be free to join against be hard to see how with men be going to defend portugal against ten time that number of french still suppose will do somehow french have large army on other side of aqueda there be doubt will besiege ciudad rodrigo a soon a winter be over doubt whether will be strong enough to march to relief fancy that in direction coa will be about limit at rate be likely to be stirring campaign absurdity of thing be that have army in sicily might a well be at jericho for use be if joined here must make difference in world though certainly till campaign open must have to be quartered at lisbon for be a much a wretched transport can do to feed now truth be portugal be miserably poor country at best of time doe not produce enough for want of people of course have be terribly impoverished by war field in most place have be untilled in fact greater portion of population a well a army have to be fed from england altogether wellington must have enough worry to drive ordinary man out of mind never heard of such difficulty a have to meet come to help people who wo help to fight for people who not only wo fight for want to dictate how will fight instead of being fed by country have to feed whole object of junta in spain portugal seems to be to throw difficulty in way to thwart at turn first step towards success must be to hang member of junta in place occupy general chorus of hear hear showed how deeply be feeling excited by conduct of portuguese spanish authority after chatting until late hour terence companion returned to inn next morning terence reported to general hill be glad to see again colonel o'connor general said last time met be when surgeon be dressing wound on height near talavera be hot business for time yes sir have to thank very much for very kind report sent in a to conduct of regiment deserved general said if have not come up at time did must have have hard work to retake hill regiment have be behaving very well since have be here like other portuguese regiment have often be on short ration pay be very much in arrear there have be grumbling know herrara will be extremely glad to have back again in command have said a much several time when have be in here be good man not strong enough for position can see that feel that be conscious that be not equal to responsibility intended to recommend that british officer must be placed in command of regiment before campaign open in spring two major do best have scarcely sufficient weight for men know that be trooper when regiment be first raised will be glad to be back again sir be pleased to say have be given adjutant lieutenant ryan of mayo fusilier have acting rank of captain be old friend of mine be good officer have just effected escape from bayonne with yes will be of great assistance to general said with two battalion to command must want right hand man very much will be glad if regiment remains in division when campaign reopens suppose that a before will be sent ahead at present be only attached to command for convenience of rationing pay have inspected twice be by far finest of portuguese regiment here can see certain deterioration be sure that want back badly still be not loss only be telling on soldier like to go without pay lord wellington be always kept short of fund portuguese ministry declare that have none of course be lie true false be certain that portuguese regiment be greatly in arrears of pay ill provided with clothes indeed must be starved be not that be fed by commissariat after interview with general terence went back to inn five minute later started with ryan to join regiment two battalion be engaged in drill when rode up a men recognized terence there be sudden movement then tremendous cheer breaking rank ran towards waving shako shouting loudly while herrara bull macwitty galloped up to shake by hand be not very military proceeding terence laughed can not help being gratified held up hand for silence form men into hollow square said to major in very short time order be carried out then terence addressed men said be deeply gratified by hearty reception can assure that be quite a glad to be back in regiment a regiment can be to have with again while be prisoner one of thing troubled most be that when returned might find that someone else have be appointed commander be glad indeed when upon landing at lisbon heard that have not be case must resume command of body of men of whom be proud at time more proud than when beat off attack of whole brigade of french cavalry made good escape to mountain regret that of comrade failed to do manner in did duty sacrificed to cover retreat be worthy of praise reflects highest credit upon regiment have be fortunate enough to make escape from french prison in company with friend here captain ryan who have at request be appointed by commander in chief to be adjutant be sorry to hear that there have be difficulty in way of ration that pay be in arrears however know well that be not serving for sake of pay to defend country from invasion by french that whether get pay day by day receive in lump sum later on will make difference to indeed in respect will be better off for delay for getting daily be spent a soon a obtained whereas if come in lump sum will be useful to when return to home after work be done be confident that in regiment at least have borne so well from day that be raised there will be grumbling discontent that will suffer hardship privation may come in way a trifling incident in great work that have undertaken to defend at cost of life if need be country from invader regiment be dismissed drill for day loud cheer at once broke from men falling out proceeded to tent well terence there be doubt about enthusiasm of fellow ryan remarked a said be hardly military be better be real affection be sure men must follow anywhere ryan shook hand with herrara bull macwitty of whom knew well from frequent visit to terence in spring be very glad that have come to captain ryan bull said regiment seem like regiment without adjutant will take lot of work off colonel hand wish there must have be one for battalion how have regiment be going on bull nothing much to grumble about sir must say that have be more slack than be have done best have missed terribly men seem to take quite a much pain with drill a used to do when be in command however will be right now that have come back again have always found that when battalion be not working well men have pulled together at once when said 'this wo do lad colonel will be grievously disappointed when come back again if find that have lost smartness ' be a much a must do to hold in hand when saw surrounded by french must have rushed back again to man if must have let own felt hard to be marching away leaving behind in few minute couple of tent be erected by side of of herrara while be being got ready for occupation terence ryan with two major entered that of herrara latter produced two three bottle of wine from private store box of cigar so for time sat chatting terence giving outline of event have happened since have be away from regiment ryan have ordered dozen small cask of wine two case of whisky to be sent up with trunk by water now asked regarding ration of men get bread regularly herrara said have put up large bakery at abrantes a flour be brought up in boat there be difficulty way get meat pretty regularly wine always there be ground of complaint a to ration here though from what hear be very different at station where everything have to be taken up by waggon mule difficulty be with uniform not one have be served out be really difficult to get men to look smart when many of be dressed almost in rag be still worse in matter of boot great many of be badly cut when be in mountain especially in rough march have over hill after left men must greatly prefer sandal to boot being more accustomed to must certainly march farther in than in stiff english boot of course must be of use sending in requisition for see why must not wear sandal terence said at rate until there be issue of boot suppose men can make in most case doubt must at rate who must must make for others of course will have to wear of one colour a most of cattle be black there must be difficulty about have doubt that must get number of hide at nominal price from commissariat at rate will see about suppose be made good deal like indian moccasin noticed that many of spanish troop wore did not examine particularly be very easily made herrara said put foot on piece of hide of right size be drawn right up over foot laced thickness of hide be sewn at bottom to form sole there be of course for work in hill might be well to use double thickness of hide for sole upper part be made of thinnest portion of hide if grease be rubbed well inside so a to soften leather a much a possible make most comfortable footgear possible well will try anyhow terence said may look so soldierly at rate must look a well a boot with toe out if general inspects object to can say that will be perfectly ready to give up a soon a boot be issued to by using black hide really think that will look bad there must certainly be advantage for night attack tread must be much more noiseless than of heavy boot really like idea very much best plan will be to pick out two three score of men who be shoemaker by trade pay trifle for making of pair in way must get much greater uniformity than be man to make own a to clothes see that anything can be done about beyond getting supply of needle thread seeing that hole be mended a well a possible daresay new uniform will be served out before spring doe not matter much in camp suppose be worse than other portuguese regiment next week be spent in steady drill by end of time exercise be all done a smartly a before terence have already tried experiment of sandal commissariat at abrantes be glad enough to supply hide at nominal price began by taking dozen be first handed to number of men relieved from other duty who after scraping under side rubbed with fat kneaded until be perfectly soft pliable shoemaker then took in hand after few sample of various shape be tried one be fixed upon in sandal be bound to foot by strap of same material with double thickness of sole terence tried found extremely comfortable for walking gave order that one company must be entirely provided with a to appearance be vastly superior to cracked bulged boot men be wearing after week of sharp drill terence be satisfied proposed to ryan that must now ride over to portalegre pay visit to friend of fusilier accordingly next day went over be most heartily received sure terence knew well enough that dicky ryan must be back here before long so have taken from well be relief to regiment only hope that now be adjutant will learn manner behave with little more discretion than have ever shown before how must have saddled with hare brained lad be more than can imagine be very well o'grady ryan laughed be question of pot calling kettle black only in case pot be good deal blacker than kettle there may be excuse for subaltern like none for war scarred veteran like dick will do very well o'grady terence said can tell sits in tent doe office work a steadily a if have be at life if have seen drilling battalion must be delighted be just jealousy that make run down o'grady be too lazy to learn portuguese be lazy say that be terence there be more active officer in regiment know a for heathen language be not fit for honest tongue ought to have sent over supply of grammar dictionary taught whole nation to speak english when did get back week ago have be too busy drilling regiment to come over before how be getting on here colonel be not getting on at o'connor be worse than stationary be ought to put on double number of cart allow time be on short ration except wine thank commissariat can buy in country be evil time that have fallen upon how will do when snow begin to fall heavily be more than can tell at rate colonel from what hear be good deal better off than division at guarda for be day march from river cart take two day over colonel said then bring next to nothing for poor baste that draw be half starved be a much a can do to crawl along might just a well keep whole division at abrantes instead of sticking half of out here just a if french be going to attack now there be luncheon bugle after have done may tell how ryan got out of hand of french for suppose be not exchanged chapter almeida winter be long tedious whenever weather permitted terence set men at work taking twice week for long march so a to keep power in direction unabated sandal turned out great success men have greatcoat supplied want by cutting slit in centre of black blanket passing head through answered purpose hid shabby condition of uniform general hill occasionally rode over to inspect other portuguese regiment encamped near be very good plan of yours colonel o'connor said first time whole regiment turned out in sandal be much more sensible footgear than boot must not have adopted general if men have have boot to put on have became absolutely unwearable of sol be completely off upper leather be so cut worn that be literally of use in many case be falling to piece men like sandal much better certainly march with greater ease yesterday did thirty mile came in comparatively fresh wish whole army be shod so general said must improve marching power must not have so many men laid up footsore must say that boot supplied to army be very worst that soldier be ever cursed with be heavy be nearly a hard a iron when weather be dry be a rotten a blotting paper when be wet be quite accident if man get pair to fit properly believe must be better if be trained to march barefooted foot must soon get hardened at rate must be improvement on boot now served out to wish other portuguese regiment be a well drilled a well set up a fellow of course men look smart at present must not make good show on parade ground hear that there be large quantity of uniform coming out shortly hope long before campaign open will be served out british regiment be almost a badly off a native one however suppose matter will right before spring be almost a badly off now a be when marched into corunna absurdity of whole thing be that newly raised portuguese levy who will certainly not be called upon to cross frontier until next year have got uniform while men who have to do work be almost in rag two three of officer of fusilier rode over frequently to stop for night so with terence latter found time pas much more pleasantly than have done before ryan have joined during day hand be full evening be very pleasant now that have dick a well a herrara to talk to feeling of responsibility on shoulder steadied ryan good deal be turning out far more useful assistant than terence have expected when work be over spirit be a high a ever conversation in terence tent seldom languished spring came there be movement on part of troop ney with men began siege of ciudad rodrigo in agueda have now become fordable crawford with light brigade strong be exposed to sudden attack at time on st of june terence received order to march with regiment to guarda where wellington be concentrating greater portion of army leaving hill with men to guard southern portion of frontier spanish portuguese urged general to relieve ciudad rodrigo wellington refused steadily to hazard whole fortune of campaign on enterprise be unlikely to succeed total force be men of whom be untried portuguese garrison have to be placed at several point portuguese be posted at thomar day march from abrantes a reserve for hill be not only infantry cavalry of massena who now commanded in front of ciudad rodrigo that have to reckon with regnier division be at corium must in three easy march reach guarda in four fall on hill at abrantes with men in line must have be desperate enterprise indeed to attack veteran french soldier merely for sake of carrying off undisciplined portuguese besieged at ciudad minho regiment have only received new uniform month before order came made good show a marched into guarda where wellington headquarters be now established when terence reported to adjutant general latter said at present colonel o'connor can not be employed in former work of scouting french be altogether too powerful for couple of battalion to approach with cavalry must make short work of crawford must soon fall back behind coa position already be very hazardous one have therefore be decided to place of men along on side of coa with battalion will march at once to almeida to strengthen garrison of place a soon a crawford retires be certain to be besieged must be able to offer long stout resistance will of course be under general order of commandant will receive authorization to take independent action must think fit be to say if find place can be no longer defended commandant be intending to surrender be at liberty to withdraw command if find possible to do so on following morning corp left guarda leaving battalion half on coa under herrara terence with men after long march entered almeida night town be fortified be occupied only by portuguese troop be capable of repulsing sudden attack be in condition to withstand regular siege be deficient in magazine bomb proof powder of there be large supply be stored in old castle in middle of town on entering place terence at once called upon colonel cox who be in command be glad that have come colonel o'connor latter said know that lord wellington expects to make long defence to keep massena here for at least month although mean to do best can not conceal from that defence be terribly defective then too more than half force be newly levied militia in whom very little dependence can be placed men will be invaluable in case of assault be not assault fear so much a having place tumbling about ear by artillery can be so placed a to command from several point be very short of artillery gun be well nigh a old a fortification will do best colonel in direction may point out think that must defend breach against reasonable force brought against may say have be ordered if worst come to worst to endeavour to make way out of town before surrender for fortnight place be left unmolested crawford division still kept beyond coa cavalry have have several engagement with french reconnoitring party on nd of july however news came that after most gallant resistance ciudad rodrigo have surrendered be now certain that storm must roll westward in very short time massena however delayed strangely be not until daylight on th that sudden roll of musketry followed almost immediately by heavy artillery fire told garrison of almeida that light division be suddenly attacked by enemy crawford have received strictest order not to fight beyond coa be obstinate man have so long maintained position across river that believed that if attacked must be able to withdraw over bridge before very strong force must be brought up to attack in be mistaken country be wooded french march be unsuspected until be close upon crawford force light division have however be well trained indeed be composed of veteran regiment have be practised to get under arm with least possible delay be therefore already drawn up when french fell upon fighting hard sternly repelled effort of enemy cavalry to cut off from bridge driving back french light infantry light division crossed in safety although with considerable loss repulsed with great slaughter attempt of french to cross bridge almeida be now left to fate again massena delayed be not until th of august that siege be begun on th sixty five heavy gun have be used in siege of ciudad rodrigo opened fire upon town more terence saw of place more convinced be that must not long be held after french siege gun have be placed in position moreover there be great lukewarmness on part of several of portuguese officer while rank file be dispirited by fate of ciudad rodrigo by fact that have a seemed to be deserted by british army like look of thing at have said to bull ryan evening before siege gun began work in first place defence will crumble in time under french fire in second place think that portuguese with exception of own men have fight in da costa lieutenant governor openly declares that place be indefensible that be simply throwing away life of men to resist be very intimate observe with chief of artillery altogether thing look very bad of course will stay here a long a place resists be afraid that wo be for very long be speaking to colonel cox afternoon be brave man with trustworthy troop must be sure hold town until last unsupported a be be in hand of rascally portuguese officer told that if ordered to do so must undertake with men to arrest whole of said that must bring on mutiny of troop bad a situation already be must only make matter much worse then suggested that a french be driving trench towards two old redoubt outside wall must if liked place force in must undertake to hold pointing out that if fell into hand of enemy must soon mount cannon there bring down whole wall facing in direction quite agreed with view of case said that must be very exposed position still a fellow be certainly only trustworthy troop have must be very glad if must undertake defence at once a french be pushing approach very fast towards said that be sure must hold for little time that indeed seemed to that french intended to bombard town rather than to breach wall knowing composition of garrison perhaps having intelligence that courage must be so shaken by heavy fire that place must surrender in much shorter time than must take to breach wall accordingly have given leave to march men up there at daybreak tomorrow taking with ten day provision said that if have trouble with other portuguese regiment must on hoisting red flag on church steeple march in at once to seize shoot leader of mutiny if wished of course one of reason for wanting to take charge of redoubt be that must have more chance of withdrawing from than must of getting out of town in confusion panic of approaching surrender bull ryan agreed with terence at daybreak next morning half battalion marched out relieved portuguese troop holding two redoubt established there have brought with number of intrenching tool be accompanied by engineer officer so a soon a reached redoubt several party of men be set to work to begin to sink pit for driving gallery in direction of approach that french be pushing forward while others assisted party of artilleryman to work gun of best shot in corp took place on rampart be directed to maintain steady fire on french working party roar of cannon when french battery opened fire on town be prodigious be not long before be evident that there be present design on part of french to effect breach expect have lot of friend in town terence said to dick ryan a watched result of fire make sure that garrison will very soon lose heart do see how many shot be striking old castle look a if french knew that be magazine be dropping shell there too that alone be enough to cause scare in town for if one of dropped into magazine consequence must be terrific be not pushing on trench against with anything like energy with have be working for past week be certainly curious that must not keep up heavier fire from battery upon for be evident that can not make assault on side of town at rate until have captured redoubt wish be well out of ryan exclaimed be quite certain that place must fall sooner later though might beat french back several time must come to same in end thing be most concerned about at present be how be to get away quite agree with dick know have have several look at french line from roof of church battery be chiefly on side of town most of troop be encamped on other side so a to be in readiness to meet attempt of wellington to succour place also to show garrison that there be chance whatever of being able to draw off agreed that chance must be much better of getting out on side than on other yes also agreed terence that there must be good deal more difficulty in getting safely back for practically whole of army must be between wellington will be difficult business dicky whichever way go suppose that at last will have to be guided by circumstance in very short time fire broke out at several point in town gun on wall made very feeble reply to french battery one two bastion where alone brisk fire be at first maintained drew upon storm of missile from french gun that be soon silenced be quite evident that portuguese gunner have not much fight in bull said be afraid be disaffection among officer be paralysing terence said quite admit that may be good policy to keep men under cover really must do good against french battery have advantage of position a well a number weight of metal must certainly be well to reserve troop till french drive trench close up if thought that silence of gun on wall be due to must be well content be afraid be nothing of sort if french keep up fire a at present for forty eight hour place will throw open gate inhabitant must be suffering frightfully of course if colonel cox have men must thoroughly rely upon must be obliged to harden heart disregard clamour of townspeople for surrender a garrison be pretty certain to make common cause with seems to that place be lost if bombardment continues in short time seeing that working party in enemy trench made attempt to push farther forward terence withdrew men from exposed position on rampart leaving only few there on lookout told rest to lie down on inner slope so a to be in shelter from french fire bull be in command of force in other redoubt be quarter of mile away redoubt be however connected by deep ditch so communication must be kept up between reinforcement sent from one to other unobserved by enemy except by on one two elevated spot day roar of cannon continued from dozen point smoke flame rose from city towards french battery chiefly directed fire in order to hinder effort of garrison to check progress of conflagration just after dark a ryan terence be sitting down in angle of bastion to eat supper there be tremendous roar accompanied by so terrible shock that be thrown prostrate upon ground with force for moment half stunned broad glare of light illuminated sky there be rumble roar of falling building wall then came dull crashing sound a mass of brickwork hurled high up into air fell over town surrounding country then came dead silence be speedily broken by sound of loud scream shout from town be just a feared terence said a bruised bewildered struggled to foot magazine in castle have exploded ordered bugler to sound assembly a men gathered be found that although many of have be hurt severely by violence with have be thrown down none have be killed either by shock falling fragment officer be at once sent to other redoubt to inquire how have fared to give order to bull to keep men under arm lest french must take advantage of catastrophe make sudden attack ryan do take command of men here until come back will go into town see colonel cox fear that damage will be so great that town will be really no longer defensible even if be portuguese troop will be so cowed that there will be no more fight left in be five hundred yard to wall terence be unchallenged a ran up gate be open on entering saw that disaster greatly exceeded expectation castle have be shattered into fragment church levelled to ground of whole town only six house remained standing five hundred people have be killed wildest confusion prevailed soldier be running about without object purpose apparently scared out of sens woman be shrieking wringing hand by ruin of house men be frantically tugging at beam mass of brickwork to endeavour to rescue friend buried under ruin presently came upon colonel cox who have just be joined by captain hewitt only british officer with who have instantly gone off to see amount of damage done to defence have brought back news that wall have be levelled in several place gun thrown into ditch da costa bareiros several other portuguese officer be loudly clamouring for instant surrender french shell again beginning to fall into town added to prevailing terror in vain commandant endeavoured to still tumult to assure around that defence might yet be continued for short time better term be obtained than if be at once to surrender can do anything colonel terence said men be still available officer shook head massena will see in morning said that have to march in if men must fight must still perhaps defend breach for day two must only be useless slaughter however a wo fight must send flag of truce out endeavour to make term at rate colonel o'connor if can manage to get off with command by mean do so of course will endeavour to obtain term for garrison to march out fear that massena will hear of nothing unconditional surrender thank colonel then will at once return to corp endeavour to make way through on returning to redoubt terence sent message to bull to come to at once when arrived told ryan state of thing in town certainty that must surrender at once portuguese be so clamorous said that flag of truce may be despatched to massena in hour time portuguese be right so far that if place must be surrendered there be reason for longer exposing troop townsfolk to french bombardment therefore be imperative that if be to make way out must do so before place surrender agreed yesterday a to best line to take french force here be by mean considerable main body being between coa massena knowing composition of garrison here did not deem requisite to send larger force than be necessary to protect battery major portion of be on height behind city between road leading to escalon that through fort conception there be french camp be by line must make escape know that there be considerable force somewhere near villa puerca when reach river turones can follow bank down with very little fear be probable that have force at bridge near san felices believe river be fordable in many place now at rate be not likely to be keeping sharp watch anywhere tonight must know that tremendous explosion will have rendered place untenable except at battery be still firing there will be no great vigilance especially on side for must hardly be supposed that even if garrison did attempt to escape must take road to east so cut off from ally enter country wholly french of course with case be different can march farther faster than french infantry wood afford abundant place of concealment be perfectly capable of driving off small body of cavalry that may meet fortunately have eight day provision of biscuit of course be with view to proposed that must bring out so large supply with now think have better start at once quite agree with colonel bull said will return to other redoubt form men up at once will be ready in quarter of hour very well bull will move out from here in quarter of hour from present time march across join a come out must move round between redoubt town in way will avoid enemy trench altogether men be at once ordered to fall in fortunately none be so seriously disabled a to be unfit to take place in rank necessity for absolute silence be impressed upon be told to march very carefully a fall over stone crash of musket on rock might at once call attention of french sentinel a troop filed out through entrance to redoubt terence congratulated upon having sandal for sound of tread be faint indeed to what must have be have be marching in heavy boot at other redoubt be joined by bull with party there be momentary halt while six men picked for intelligence went on ahead under command of ryan be to move twenty pace apart if came upon solitary sentinel one man be to be sent back instantly to stop column while two others crawled forward surprised silenced sentry must way be arrested by strong picket be to reconnoitre ground on side then one be to be sent back to guide column so a to avoid picket when calculated that ryan must be nearly quarter of mile in advance terence gave order for column to move forward when short distance have be traversed one of scout came in with news that there be cordon of sentry across path be fifty pace apart must be silenced before march must be continued ten minute later scout brought in news that four of french sentry have be surprised killed without alarm being given column resumed way necessity for silence being again impressed upon men a went forward received news that two more of sentry have be killed that there be in consequence gap of yard between scout led way through opening thus formed be anxious ten minute passage be effected without alarm being given booming of gun engaged in bombarding town helping to cover sound of footstep have be settled that ryan column be to march straight for star low down on horizon so that there be fear of taking wrong direction in half hour be sure that be well beyond french line whose position indeed must be made out by light of bivouac fire for three hour continued march at rapid pace without check then halted for hour then held on way till daybreak when entered large village have left redoubt at about nine o'clock be now five so that have marched at least twenty five mile be within ten mile of aqueda sentry be posted at edge of wood troop then lay down to sleep several time during day party of french cavalry be seen moving about be going at leisurely pace there be appearance of being engaged in search at troop got under arm again made way to aqueda peasant whom fell in with soon after started have undertaken to show ford be breast deep stream be not strong crossed without difficulty holding arm ammunition well above water learned that there be indeed french brigade at bridge of san felices marching north now came before daybreak upon douro here again lay up during day that evening obtained two boat at village near mouth of tormes crossed into portuguese province of tras o nontes men joined in hearty cheer on finding safe in own country after halting for couple of day terence marched to castel rodrigo then learning that main body of regiment be at pinhel marched there joined arrival causing great rejoicing among men for have be supposed that half battalion have be captured at fall of almeida portuguese regular troop at place have at surrender at daybreak after explosion taken service with french while militia regiment have be disbanded by massena allowed to return to home from here terence sent off report to headquarters asked for order adjutant general wrote back congratulating on having successfully brought off command ordering corp to take post at linares found that disaster similar to at almeida have taken place magazine at albuquerque having be blown up by lightning causing loss of four hundred men french army be still behind coa occupied in restoring fortification of almeida ciudad rodrigo be not until th of september that massena crossed coa began invasion of portugal in earnest march being directed towards coimbra by taking line hoped to prevent hill in south from effecting junction with latter however have made preparation for retreat a soon a found that massena be in earnest sent word to hill to join on alva fell back in direction terence received order to co operate with of portuguese militia under command of trant wilson miller be to harass massena right flank rear have wellington order be carried out massena must have found country deserted by inhabitant entirely destitute of provision a usual order have be thwarted by portuguese government who sent secret instruction to local authority to take step to carry out result be massena a advanced found ample store for provisioning army speed with wellington fell back baffled calculation by time approached viseu whole british army be united near coimbra march have be delayed two day by attack made by trant terence upon advanced guard a be making way through defile hundred prisoner be taken with baggage serious blow must have be struck at french have not new portuguese levy be seized with panic fled in confusion trant be consequently obliged to draw off attack however have be so resolute well directed that massena not knowing strength of force opposing halted for two day until whole army came up thus afforded time for british to concentrate make arrangement illustration plan of battle of ground chosen by wellington to oppose massena advance be on edge of sierra busaco be separated by deep narrow valley from series of hill across french be marching there be four road by french must advance one from mortagao be narrow little used passed through royalva other three led to position occupied by british force between village of busaco pena cova trant command be posted at royalva terence with regiment took post with portuguese brigade of cavalry on height above santa marcella where road leading south to espinel forked branch leading from across mondego in rear of british position to coimbra here must be aided if necessary by gun at pena cova on opposite side of river while british be taking up ground between busaco pena cova ney regnier arrived on crest of opposite hill have attacked at once a ney wished might have succeeded for division of spenser leith hill have not yet arrived massena be ten mile in rear did not come up until next day with junot corp by time whole of british army be ranged along opposite height force must be plainly made out from french position so formidable be height have to be scaled by attacking force ney impetuous brave a be no longer advocated attack massena however be bent upon fighting have confidence in valour of troop be averse to retiring from portugal baffled by long rugged road have travelled therefore disposition be at once made for attack ney regnier be to storm british position while junot corp be to be held in reserve at daybreak on th french descended hill ney troop in three column of attack moving against large convent towards british left centre while regnier in two column advanced against centre regnier men be first engaged mounting hill with great gallantry resolution pushed skirmisher of picton division before in spite of grape fire of battery of six gun almost gained summit of hill leading battalion establishing among rock there while behind wheeled to right wellington who be on spot swept flank of force with grape th wing of th charged down upon furiously french exhausted by effort in climbing hill be unable to resist onslaught english french mixed up together went down hill french still resisting unable to check opponent who favoured by steep descent swept before in meantime battalion have gained crest held own against rest of third division have be followed by troop who have wheeled off towards right british position must have be cut in two general leith seeing critical state of affair have a soon a saw third division pressed back despatched brigade to assistance have to make considerable detour round ravine now arrived attacking with fury drove french grenadier from rock pursued with continuous fire of musketry until be out of range rest of leith division soon arrived general hill moved division to position before occupied by leith thus so formidable force be concentrated at point where regnier made effort that having reserve did not venture to renew attack on right french have met with better success in front of convent on lower ground be plateau on crawford posted rd nd regiment of line in slight dip concealed from observation by french quarter of mile behind on high ground close to convent be regiment of german infantry be in full sight of enemy other regiment of light division be placed lower down hill supported by gun of battery two of ney column advanced up hill with great speed gallantry never pausing for moment although rank be swept by grape from artillery heavy musketry fire by light troop latter be forced to fall back before advance gun be withdrawn french be within few yard of edge of plateau when crawford launched rd nd regiment against wholly unprepared for such attack french be hurled down hill only one of column attempted to retrieve disaster advanced against right of light division here however met pack brigade while crawford artillery swept wood through be ascending finally be forced to retire down hill action came to end never did french fight more bravely position held by determined troop be practically impregnable french loss in killed wounded be that of ally only difference being caused by fact that french rank throughout action be swept with grape by british battery while french artillery must hing to aid infantry chapter french advance a there be sign of french force approaching position held by portuguese terence moved regiment short distance forward to point enabled to obtain view right down valley in conflict be taking place then allowed to fall out of rank knowing that in le than minute from call being sounded must be under arm again in readiness to move in direction required then with herrara three english officer moved short distance away watched scene a soon a regnier column have crossed bottom of ravine gun along crest opened fire on british position facing be too far off for grape terence said remember ryan at corunna how french battery pounded from crest how little real damage did round shot doe not do much more harm than bullet unless strike column in motion troop massed in solid formation fellow be mounting hill very fast be indeed ryan agreed can see how line of smoke of skirmisher on hillside get higher higher wish regiment be there colonel bull said might do good while here be of more use than if be hundred mile away bull be not case if french have not seen that position be strongly held might have moved division by road if have done so must have turned main position altogether forced wellington to fall back at once so see be doing good here though say must not like to be over there french will soon be at top of hill herrara exclaimed see how be pushing upwards certainly be gaining ground fast macwitty said be within hundred yard of top men seem to be able to make stand against at colonel lower column be turning off more towards left have better have kept together macwitty be evident that picton division be hard pressed a be if two column have united thrown upon must have broken right through line a be second party will have leith division to deal with do see one of brigade marching swiftly to meet gun sweeping french flank wish be nearer scene have become too exciting for further conversation watched almost breathlessly line of smoke on top of crest showed that head of column have made good footing there while quick puff of smoke rattle of musketry denoted that other column be also within short distance of summit leith regiment be approaching spot at double presently there be crash of tremendous volley then leading regiment disappeared over brow of hill into brushwood roar of musketry be heavy continuous then ryan gave joyous shout a must be seen that two long smoke wreath be becoming mixed together that movement be downwards ere long dark mass of troop must be seen descending hill even more rapidly than have climbed be second brigade be now approaching scene of struggle be near at hand hill division be seen in motion towards same spot be right now terence said there be big fight going on further up valley be too far off to make out movement of troop even at distance smoke rolling up from hillside gave idea of course of fight here too after mounting more than halfway up slope must be seen that tide of war be rolling down again though more slowly with harder fighting than have done in struggle nearer to when at last firing gradually ceased knew that french have be repulsed along line men have better open haversack eat meal terence said may get order to move at moment order came however troop remained in position that occupied until following morning then heavy skirmishing fire broke out for time seemed a if battle be to be renewed heavy mass of french however came down from hill on side to support light troop in valley in afternoon firing died away towards evening staff officer rode up at full speed handed note to terence french have turned left by royalva pas trant have failed to check whole army must fall back be instruction mishap have not be trant fault have be sent by portuguese general on tremendous detour when arrived at position assigned to troop be utterly exhausted by long fatiguing march large proportion have deserted fallen out with wearied dispirited men must offer little resistance to french advance being attacked by cavalry have be driven away with loss terence opened note will march at once keep along on side of mondego breaking up command into small party who will visit village within reach of inhabitant who have not obeyed proclamation retired be to leave at once destroy provision that can find set fire to mill where be not practicable smash machinery bearing south a go spread out over country between zezere sea continue to carry on duty assigned to compelling peasant to drive animal before along road to lisbon understand sir terence said after reading note will carry out order to best of ability five minute later regiment be under arm terence called whole of officer together explained instruction that have received two battalion be broken up into half company a marched along mondego be to be left behind one by one party when left turning south proceeding to carry out order received in few case only be company to keep intact a although hundred men must be ample for duty at large village two hundred must not be too much in town like leiria on reaching foz d'aronce battalion moved to east to work down by river zezere rest turned to right to follow course of mondego down to sea for convenience in order to keep troop in hand bull macwitty ryan herrara took command of battalion with order to supervise work of company belonging to to keep in touch with nearest company of next battalion so that two thousand men must advance to certain extent abreast of other foz d'aronce have already be evacuated by inhabitant in other village order be carried out by daybreak last company in two battalion reached sea coast after two hour rest began march south others have long be at work be painful duty frightened villager have to be roused in darkness told that french be approaching that must fly at once taking animal what must carry off in cart away with while terrified people be harnessing horse to cart piling few valuable into packing child on top troop went from house to house searching for destroying provision setting fire to barn stored with corn burning disabling flour mill met with then a soon a work be done forced villager to take southern road there be difficulty in doing for although have stolidly opposed measure ordered by wellington trusting that french must not come now that have heard be near wild panic seized have orderly retreat be made before almost belonging might have be saved now little must be taken even by most fortunate child sick aged have to be carried in cart in haste terror left behind many thing might well have be saved peasantry in village suffered le than townspeople a horse cart afforded mean of transport even here scene be most painful in town however be vastly more so mean for carriage for large number of people being wanting greater number of inhabitant be forced to make way on foot along road so crowded with vehicle of kind that british division be frequently brought to standstill for hour where nature of country prevented quitting road making way across field on th greater portion of british troop passed mondego hill retired upon thomar rest of troop be concentrated at commissariat store followed coast road down to peniche be embarked there light division cavalry remained after main body have be drawn across mondego north of river soon after starting on work terence learned that british troop have passed through pombal leiria thomar be consequently unnecessary for to endeavour to clear town delay caused at village rendered work slow a well a arduous french drove light division through coimbra following pressed so hotly that number of minor combat took place between cavalry british rear guard before leiria rear guard have to fight strongly to enable gun to quit town before french entered terence presently received order to collect regiment again crossing zezere to endeavour to join trant other leader of irregular band to harass massena rear have already knowing that great body of french cavalry have crossed mondego called in company be working leiria coast a might otherwise have be cut up in detail by french cavalry with marched east picking up other company a went on same evening regiment be collected on zezere having followed river up reached foz d'aronce then finding that several body of french troop have already passed through village turned to left camped close to mondego sending ten of men over river in peasant clothes to ascertain movement of enemy one of returned with news that have come upon party of trant men who told that main body be two mile away that there be french north of coimbra regiment have made march of upwards of forty mile day therefore leaving to rest terence forded mondego rode with ryan to trant village be glad indeed to see o'connor partisan leader said a terence entered cottage where have established be regiment with yes be three mile away on other side of river have marched something like eighty mile in two day have be busy burning mill destroying provision french cavalry be over country so be ordered to join aid to harass french line of communication to do what damage must there be not much to be done in way of cutting communication at least there be nothing to be done to north east of place for massena brought baggage everything else with cut loose altogether from base at ciudad if people have carried out wellington order massena must have suffered fearful disaster have learned from straggler have taken that fourteen day provision with marched be altogether exhausted that have be unable to obtain here must have have to retreat instantly hear that in coimbra alone there be enough food for whole army for at least two month must not have destroyed a retreated of course ought to have done so trant said from what hear affair be very badly managed instead of first division went through burning magazine store be left to crawford to do so a usual stopped so long facing enemy at last be regularly chased through coimbra road being blocked with cart brigade must have be destroyed have french infantry pushed strongly after thing be just a bad in way of provision on other side of river have done great deal in way of destroying mill magazine be afraid massena will find enough provision to last army winter be bad have only be coimbra very great harm must have be done for french troop got altogether out of hand when entered plundered place a hear destroyed enough provision to have lasted month of course hold town oh yes be full of sick wounded what force have terence asked have men of own miller wilson with of northern militia will be here shortly expect in few day will have eight thousand men great thing must be to act before french know that there be so strong force in neighbourhood terence said because a soon a hear that be sure to send strong force back to coimbra how do mean to act trant asked in surprise propose that must capture coimbra at once have men have suppose have left above couple of thousand in town perhaps even le if take by surprise must think ought to be able to manage number without difficulty certainly consider own men to be match for equal number of french be grand idea trant said see why must not carry out a say sooner better may know that be here will never dream of making such attempt with force must own be not always to be relied upon be always shifting changing after long march half of will desert then in few day rank swell again consequently men have little discipline confidence in other be little better than raw levy for rough street fighting have doubt must be all right especially when backed by good troop like yours how must proceed a yours be real fighting body must have command not at terence said warmly be senior officer not only in rank in age experience order be to assist a far a must while be together be ready to carry out order in way will men be able to attack in morning certainly will have good night rest will be quite ready for work say at four o'clock in morning be not more than two hour march to coimbra so that will be there by daybreak have troop between town have post at village mile side o'connor do know how far army be on other side of river know that have division close to leiria day before yesterday whether have large body just across mondego can not say then will first surprise post will undertake will march force down river close to town have hundred cavalry a soon a have captured post will send on at gallop with order to ride straight through to bridge prevent mounted messenger passing across a soon a hear come along road do at once enter town will bring men on at double will not be many minute after must be a well for to enter by several street a will cause greater confusion than if be in solid body principal point be great convent of santa clara have be converted into hospital doubt portion of garrison be there rest will be scattered about in public building can be overpowered in detail think be certain of success hope will stop for time take supper with in meantime will send down order for men to be under arm here at half past three illustration 'good news be going to take coimbra ' terence ryan remained for hour then rode back to regiment men be sound asleep herrara two major be sitting round campfire what news colonel former asked a terence rode up good news be going to take coimbra tomorrow morning massena sick wounded heavy baggage be there have suspicion that force be yet assembled in neighbourhood expect will have easy work of have post mile out of town trant will surprise capture at five in morning just before daybreak will enter town must march from here at half past three be something like news colonel macwitty exclaimed will cut french off from line of retreat altogether must either fall back by line of tagus through badajoz merida terence laughed be counting chicken before be hatched macwitty at present moment seems more likely that wellington will have to embark troop than massena will have to retreat must have nearly hundred thousand men counting who fought with at busaco two division that marched down through foz d'aronce while wellington told can not have above certainly of peasant told have heard that great many men be employed in fortifying height of torres vedras wellington may be able to make stand there a have never heard anything about before be afraid that can not be anything very formidable however just at present have nothing to do with if can take coimbra will certainly hamper massena if worst come to worst can fall back across douro let bugle sound in morning be not likely be possible that french may send out cavalry patrol at night if bugle be heard might ride back report that force be in neighbourhood must find garrison prepared for now have better do more talking be past eleven have four half hour to sleep at half past three troop be roused be surprised at early call for have expected two three day rest after heavy work of last eight day company officer soon learned news from major a quickly spread through rank men be at once alert ready fording river marched at rapid pace by road to coimbra soon after five o'clock arrived within few hundred yard of town then be halted broken up into four column be to enter town at different point signal for moving be to be sound of body of cavalry galloping along road terence listened attentively for rattle of musketry in distance be quiet have little doubt that french have be surprised captured without shot being fired soon after half past five heard dull sound before long grew louder in five minute body of horseman swept past at gallop troop at once got into motion entered town there be longer motive for concealment bugle sounded with loud shout portuguese ran forward french officer ran out of private house be at once seized captured several body of troop be taken in public building before be fairly awake of inhabitant of whom many unable to make escape have remained behind who have returned from village to have at first fled came out acted a guide to various building where french troop be quartered in little over quarter of hour whole town with exception of convent of santa clara be in hand by time trant have come up with command troop rapidly formed up again issuing from several street advanced against convent astonished enemy fired few shot then on being formally summoned to surrender laid down arm thus on third day after massena quitted mondego hospital depot nearly prisoner wounded unwounded among company of imperial guard fell into hand of portuguese next day miller wilson came up men crossing bridge spreading over country gathered in more prisoner while trant marched with have captured to oporto illustration plan of line of torres vedras on th of october whole of wellington army be safely posted on tremendously strong position that have unknown to army carefully prepared fortified for protection of lisbon consisted of three line of battery intrenchment second be most formidable first be so strong also that wellington determined to defend instead of falling back to stronger line at foot of line of mountain on army be posted stretching from tagus to sea ran two stream zandre deep river extended nearly halfway along twenty nine mile of line covered left of position while stream running into tagus protected right centre therefore be almost only part at line must be attacked with chance of success be defended by such tremendous fortification a to be almost impregnable massena who have only heard vague rumour of existence of fortification four day before be astounded at unexpected obstacle barred way british troop a soon a arrived be set to work to strengthen intrenchment tree be felled accessible point be covered by formidable abattis face of rock be scarped so that enemy who won way partly up hill must find farther progress arrested by perpendicular wall of rock soon eminence on crest bristled with gun massena after carefully reconnoitring whole position came to conclusion that must not be attacked disposed troop in permanent position facing british centre right from sobral to villafranca on tagus sent cavalry out over country to bring in provision to lessen district available for operation wellington sent order for northern militia to advance crossing mondego to drive in foraging party trant wilson other partisan corp be also employed in work strong force took up position between castello branco abrantes while militia partisan occupied whole country north of leiria french be thus completely surrounded nevertheless store of provision left behind in town village be so large that french cavalry be able to bring in sufficient supply for army during week followed minho regiment be engaged in watching defile by massena might communicate with ciudad rodrigo through reinforcement might reach wilson trant be engaged on similar service one farther to north while other who be on south bank of tagus with number of portuguese militia irregular endeavoured to prevent french from crossing river carrying off flock herd corn in spite of wellington entreaty order portuguese government have permitted to remain a if in handiness for french foraging party owing to exhausted state of british portuguese treasury be impossible to supply corp acting in rear of french with money for purchase of food terence have received authority to take what provision be absolutely necessary for troop to give order must at time other be honoured by military chest comparatively small proportion of men be needed to guard defile against such body of troop a must be likely to traverse in order to keep up massena communication leaving therefore hundred men in of principal defile ordering to entrench in place where commanded road must only be attacked with greatest difficulty while road be barred by tree felled across so a to form impassable abattis behind twenty men be stationed terence marched with men towards frontier five hundred of be placed along coa guarding road with remainder forded river placed in wood in plain between almeida ciudad rodrigo here captured several convoy of waggon proceeding with provision for garrison of former place portion of despatched under guard for use of troop on coa for in pass thus rendering unnecessary to harass people who have returned to village after massena have advanced against lisbon growing bolder with success crossed aqueda marching round to rear of ciudad rodrigo cut off destroyed convoy intended for town causing great alarm to garrison be absolutely ignorant of operation of massena for so active be partisan in french rear that single messenger succeeded in getting through even when accompanied by strong escort opposition encountered be so determined that french be obliged to fall back without having accomplished purpose thus then garrison at ciudad rodrigo be ignorant of massena whereabouts of nature of force have thrown in rear several time strong party of troop be sent out when be composed of cavalry only be boldly met driven in when be mixed force of cavalry infantry artillery searched in vain for foe so seriously alarmed annoyed be governor troop be withdrawn from salamanca to strengthen garrison in december massena having exhausted country round fell back to very strong position at santarem terence withdrew whole force save guarding defile to neighbourhood of abrantes so that must either assist force stationed there must massena retire up tagus prevent messenger passing through country between river range of mountain south of alva by castello branco velha posting strong party to guard ford of zezere so thoroughly be service of watching frontier line carried out that be not until general foy be sent off by massena that napoleon be informed of state of thing be accompanied by strong cavalry force french infantry across zezere ravaged country for considerable distance before such strength terence be obliged to fall back foy be accompanied by cavalry until have passed through castello branco be then able to ride without further opposition to ciudad rodrigo beresford be guarding line of tagus between mouth of zezere point occupied on opposite bank by wellington sending portion of force up zezere harassed french marauding party extending devastation along line of mondego although minho regiment have suffered loss during operation rank be kept up to full strength without difficulty great number of portuguese army deserted during winter owing to hardship endured from want of food irregularity of pay many of made for minho regiment have learned be well fed received pay with degree of regularity latter circumstance being due to fact that terence have good luck to capture with one of convoy behind ciudad rodrigo considerable sum of money intended for pay of garrison from have without hesitation paid men arrears due to have still dollar with be able to continue to feed pay after moving to line of zezere only enrolled sufficient recruit to fill gap made by war disease refusing to raise number above a be a many a must be readily handled for have found that larger number have increased difficulty of rationing paying chapter fuentes d'onoro in early spring soult who be besieging cadiz received order from napoleon to cooperate with massena although ignorant of latter plan even of position prepared to do so at once crushed spanish force on gebora captured badajoz owing to treachery cowardice of commander be moving north when news reached that massena be falling back latter position have indeed become untenable army be wasted by sickness famine threatened for supply obtainable from country round have now be exhausted wellington be a knew from agent in portuguese government receiving reinforcement must shortly be in position to assume offensive discipline in french army under massena have be greatly injured by long inactivity only news received a to soult movement be that be near badajoz therefore first week in march began retreat by sending off sick store to thomar then began to fall back thick weather favoured ney assembled large force near leiria a if to advance against british position two other corp left santarem on night of fifth retired to thomar rest of army moved by other route for four day wellington although discovering that retreat be in progress be unable to ascertain by line massena be really retiring a soon a point be cleared up ordered beresford to concentrate near abrantes while followed line main body of french army seemed to be taking be soon found that be concentrating at pombal with apparent intention of crossing mondego at coimbra whereby must have obtained fresh formidable position behind mondego with rich untouched country between river douro upon must have subsisted for long time therefore calling back troop be already on march to relieve badajos have not yet surrendered advanced with speed upon pombal object being to force french to take line of retreat through miranda for frontier so to prevent from crossing mondego ney commanded rear guard carried out operation with same mixture of vigour valour prudence with afterwards performed same duty to french army on retreat from moscow fought at pombal at redinha so strenuously that have not be for trant wilson other partisan who defended ford bridge massena must have be able to have crossed mondego wellington however turned one by one position occupied by ney massena believing that force at coimbra be far stronger than really be changed plan took up position at cazal nova here left ney marched for miranda although ney covered movement with admirable skill disputing ridge post of vantage british pressed forward so hotly that massena be obliged to destroy baggage ammunition ney rashly remained on east side of river cerra in front of village of foz d'aronce being attacked suddenly be driven across river with loss of men many being drowned by missing ford others crushed to death in passage however ney held line of river blew up bridge division withdrew in good order massena tarnished reputation gained by manner in have drawn off army from dangerous position by ruthless spirit with operation be conducted covering retreat by burning village through passed even ordering town of leiria to be destroyed although altogether out of line be following after fight british pursuit slackened somewhat for wellington received news of surrender of badajoz seeing that portugal be thus open to invasion by soult on south despatched cole division to join that of beresford although left inferior in force to army be pursuing advance be retarded by necessity of making bridge across cerra be now in flood delay enabled massena to fall back unmolested to guarda where intended to halt then to move to corium whence must have marched to tagus effected junction with soult be in position to advance again upon lisbon with larger force than ever have however throughout be thwarted by factious disobedience of lieutenant ney regnier brouet montbrun junot feeling now broke into open disobedience while ney absolutely defied authority others be so disobedient that fierce angry personal altercation took place massena removed ney from command own movement be however altogether disarranged by two british division marching over mountain by path deemed altogether impassable for troop compelled to abandon intention of marching south to retire to sabuga on coa here be attacked regnier corp covered position be beaten with heavy loss owing to combination must have cut massena off from ciudad rodrigo failing from of column going altogether astray in thick fog massena gained that town with army have lost in battle from disease taken prisoner men since day when confident that be going to drive wellington to take refuge on board ship have advanced from town even now did not feel safe though rejoined by large number of convalescent drawing ration for troop from store of citadel retired with army to salamanca having reorganized force procured fresh horse for gun rested troop for few day massena advanced to cover ciudad rodrigo to raise siege of almeida wellington have begun without loss of time with upwards of men massena attacked british at fuentes d'onoro illustration plan of battle of fuentes d'onoro fight be long obstinate french succeeded in driving back british right failed in series of desperate attempt to carry village of fuentes side claimed battle a victory british with greater ground for massena fell back across aqueda having failed to relieve almeida whose garrison by well planned night march succeeded in passing through besieging force effected retreat with small loss town falling into possession of british terence have come up after series of long march on day before battle arrival be very opportune for portuguese troop with wellington be completely demoralized exhausted by failure of government to supply with food pay clothes so deplorable be state that wellington have be obliged to disband militia regiment great number of desertion have taken place from regular troop regiment have be stationed on british right here fighting have be very severe french cavalry force be enormously superior to british who have thousand trooper in field be driven back by french ramsay battery of horse artillery be cut off ramsay placed at head of battery at full gallop dashed through french infantry cavalry succeeded in regaining friend two battalion of minho regiment who be posted in wood defended with greatest resolution against attack by vastly superior number until french advancing on side of wood have cut off from rest of division then bugle call summoned men to assemble at rear of wood forming square two battalion marched out twelve french gun played upon time after time mass of cavalry swept down on filling up gap in rank pressed on charged two french regiment at double endeavoured to block way burst path through succeeded in rejoining retiring division received with burst of hearty cheering two hundred have fallen in short time have elapsed since left wood terence have be in

blow have felled for in hurry of striking trooper sword have partly turned be with flat rather than edge that be struck although half stunned with blow heavy fall did not altogether lose consciousness heard a lay crashing volley must felt sure repulse horseman fearing that in retreat might ride over trampling to death struggled to foot french however though repulsed did not retire far followed upon retreating regiment until joined british when battery opened upon commander called upon to fall back be done in good order at steady trot on seeing terence standing in path officer rode up to surrender terence said trooper be called out ordered to conduct to rear where many other prisoner who have be taken during french advance be gathered here english soldier bound up terence wound from blood be streaming freely portion of scalp having be shorn clean off be narrow escape sir man said yes know how be that did not sever skull suppose that be hasty blow sword must have turned might have be worse by good deal be afraid thing be going badly with badly enough here soldier said think be holding own in centre there be tremendous roar of fire going on round that village there be captured hour ago have be growing louder louder ever since for two hour battle continued a still centred round village spirit of prisoner rose for be evident that although right have be driven back centre be at least holding position against effort of french in afternoon fire slackened only few shot be fired next morning at daybreak prisoner in number be marched away under strong escort army still occupied same position have held day before there seemed probability of battle being renewed when however have marched several mile sound of heavy firing be heard prisoner concluded that wellington have retired that massena seeing inability to drive british from position intended to fall back upon ciudad convoy marched twenty mile then halted for night two hour after did so great train of waggon containing wounded came up halted at same place wounded be lifted out laid on ground where surgeon attended to more serious case pardon monsieur terence said in french to one of doctor who be near be there of countryman among wounded sir be french doctor replied be good sign terence said to english officer who be standing by when asked question why so colonel because if massena intended to attack again tomorrow must have sent british wounded back a well a own men french like ourselves make distinction between friend foe that have not sent seems to to show that intends to fall back to leave british wounded to care of own surgeon rather than embarrass with yes have doubt be case officer said seems then that must have won day after be comfort anyhow will sleep more soundly than expected if have be beaten there must have be nothing for for army to fall back again to line of torres vedras wellington must have have to fight very hard to regain if massena doe fall back almeida will have to surrender be inside last time surrendered terence said managed to make way out with regiment after explosion wonder whether massena mean to leave at ciudad to send on to salamanca must think that must send on terence replied will not want to have men eating up store at ciudad besides requiring certain portion of garrison to look after terence idea proved correct without stopping at ciudad convoy of prisoner wounded continued march until arrived at salamanca terence must not help smiling a be marched through street thought of wild panic that dicky ryan have caused when be last in town convent mayo fusilier have occupied be now turned into prison here prisoner taken at fuentes d'onoro be marched joined who have fallen into hand of french during massena retreat among be several officer of acquaintance a discipline be not very strict be able to make fairly comfortable together french indeed along whole of portuguese frontier have hand full force at salamanca be so small that few men must be spared for prison duty so long a captive showed sign of giving trouble guard be satisfied to leave good deal to own device watching gate carefully leaving much of interior work of prison to be done by spanish warder for violent a native be in expression of hatred for french be always ready to serve under in capacity in money must be earned there can be difficulty whatever in making one escape from here terence said to party of four five officer who be lodged with in room from whose window view over city be obtainable be not getting out of convent be difficult making one way across country to rejoin have doubt that one must bribe one of spaniard to bring in rope even if must not be obtained might manage to make one from blanket question be what to do when have got out massena lie between ciudad from what hear french soldier say whole line be guarded down to badajoz where soult army be lying victor be somewhere farther to south convoy cavalry will be traversing whole country speak portuguese well know enough of spanish to pas a spaniard among frenchman to anyone who doe not speak language must be next to impossible to get along quite see that one of officer said for part must rather stay where be than run risk of attempt know word of spanish must be recaptured before have be out hour if got away from town must be better off for must not obtain disguise a to making one way from here to almeida must be altogether hopeless others agreed one of said let be hindrance to o'connor if be disposed to try by mean do so if can help in way will will certainly try terence said will wait little to see how thing go may be by time wellington have fallen back again in case doubt massena will advance heard a came along that marmont with six division be approaching frontier even if wellington must maintain on aqueda soult be likely to crush beresford may advance from badajoz towards lisbon when british will be obliged to retire at once to make one way across open country between ciudad must be easy enough while must be dangerous in extreme to enter pass while french troop be pressing through on wellington rear portuguese must of course be hindrance rather than benefit to on side of frontier for spaniard hate portuguese very much more heartily than do french know that when be supplying army with grain spanish muleteer must not bring for use of portuguese brigade be only by taking a if for british division distributing afterwards to portuguese that latter must be kept alive a british officer must feel quite safe if fell into hand of spanish guerilla a portuguese officer life must not be worth hour purchase two day later came news that desperate battle have be fought by beresford at albuera near badajoz have be attacked by soult after tremendous fighting in french first obtained great advantage have be at last beaten off by british troop ended drawn battle loss on side being extraordinarily heavy be not until time afterwards terence learned particular of desperate engagement beresford have infantry cavalry gun british infantry did not exceed soult have veteran cavalry infantry gun battle began badly blake with spaniard be soon disposed of by french in hour battle be lost brigade of british infantry being involved in confusion caused by spanish retreat two third of number being destroyed whole brunt of battle now fell upon small british force remaining french column pushed up hill held by cannon on side swept ground with grape heavy french column suffered terribly from fire from english line pressed forward gained crest of rise confident of victory be still advancing when cole houghton brigade came up restored battle british line charging through storm of grape musketry fell upon french column drove down hill again in confusion portuguese battalion have fought well a have german regiment be upon british that whole brunt of fight have fallen in four hour that combat lasted of ally over of french have be killed wounded of british infantry only remained standing when battle be over being killed wounded german portuguese be placed hors de combat while of spaniard who formed great mass of army be killed wounded by french artillery musketry cut down while in disorder by french cavalry never be indomitable valour of british infantry more markedly shown than at battle of albuera battle have be brought on in small degree by anxiety for action regiment have be disappointed that while comrade be sharing in wellington pursuit of massena be far away from scene of conflict when beresford must have fallen back a must have be prudent to do became so insubordinate that gave way to desire to meet french so fought battle where defeat must have upset wellington plan for campaign victory must have brought advantage with like inkerman be soldier battle beresford disposition be faulty in extreme tactically day be lost before fighting began spanish portion of army did real fighting in confusion involved loss of nearly whole of british brigade be only by unconquerable valour of remainder of british force victory be gained against enormous odds against of best troop of france terence be in habit of often going down chatting with french guard at gate duty be tedious be glad of talk with young british officer who be only prisoner in keeping who spoke language fluently from obtained what news have of what be going on fortnight later gathered that british force on aqueda have be greatly weakened that there be intention of laying siege to ciudad be believed that wellington main body have marched south to join beresford be indeed only operation left open to british general regnier division of marmont army have joined massena must be impossible to besiege ciudad while force greatly superior to own be within easy striking distance on other hand beresford be in position to fight battle a long a badajoz remained in hand of french must at time advance into portugal possession be therefore of paramount importance marmont have succeeded massena in command latter marshal having be recalled to france great bulk of french army be now concentrated round salamanca from must either march against british force at ciudad unite with soult in overwhelming strength move against cadiz advance into portugal wellington therefore left spencer to guard line of coa make demonstration against ciudad while with main body of army marched south news decided terence to attempt to make escape in direction did not know whether own regiment must be with spencer wellington be clear that more important event must be likely to take place near badajoz than on coa french must be unlikely to choose latter route for advance into portugal country have be stripped bare by two army have marched across road be extremely bad must be next to impossible for army to carry with sustenance for march still le for maintaining after have traversed pass moreover spencer falling back before must retire to line of torres vedras invader must find a massena have done baffled by tremendous line of fortification where might find also wellington army who must have shorter road to follow established before arrived of townspeople be allowed to pas in out of convent to sell fruit other article to british prisoner terence thought better to open negotiation with one of rather than one of warder in french pay be not

careful never fear man said however there must only be harm done if there happened to be frenchman one of spaniard who be worse present a to own comrade must not matter at muleteer be heart soul against french will do anything to injure be obliged to work for for trade be at end must live many have joined partisan who have good mule can not go away give up only mean of earning living for although french pay for carriage by mule cart if come upon animal be not being used take without single scruple besides there be not many partisan in part of spain french have be too long in valley here be too strong in castile for operation be different in navarre aragon catalonia in valencia mercia there french have never have firm footing most of strong place be still in spanish hand in mountainous part in fact there be guerilla here be too dangerous there be band over country be really robber honest man must join be house turned in at small doorway unlocked door closing after put hand on shoulder juan said have light upstairs led way in darkness up stone staircase then unlocked door entered small room where candle be burning be home when be here said most of sleep at stable where mule be put up like having place to mate look after mule nothing must have be simpler than furniture of room consisted of low pallet small table single chair in corner be pair of saddlebag two three coloured blanket thick coat lined with sheepskin hung against wall in corner be brightly coloured picture of saint with two sconce for candle by side of muleteer have crossed bowed to a came in terence doubted not that be picture of saint who be supposed to take special interest in muleteer from small cupboard man brought out flask of wine two drinking cup be good said a placed on table go down to xeres sometimes always bring up half octave of something special for friend here after pouring out two cup handed chair politely to terence sat down on edge of pallet then taking out tobacco bag roll of paper made cigarette handed to terence then rolled one for chapter from salamanca to cadiz now let talk about journey muleteer said when have taken two three whiff at cigarette nita tell that wish if possible to join army near badajoz that suit well for have order from merchant here to fetch twelve mule load of sherry from xeres badajoz be therefore on way merchant have permit signed by marmont for to pas unmolested by french troop saying that wine be intended for use that of staff if be not for that there must be small chance indeed of ever getting there be so little trade now that be scarce possible to buy flask of white wine of south here of course pas will be equally useful going down to fetch for without mule must be certain to be impressed for service by french so see nothing must have happened more fortunately for anywhere between tagus badajoz can turn off from estremadura into portugal must not be safe to try near badajoz for soult army be scattered over there though pas must be doubtless respected by superior officer if fell in with foraging party must have hesitation in shooting tearing up pas carrying off mule for sake a well a own therefore must turn off cross mountain say to portalegre go down to elvas there must be with friend must cross again further south make way down to xeres say that two of marmont division started south yesterday that be unfortunate for will leave little behind in way of food drink will find better to travel by by road must not mind being impressed if be only for march down to badajoz once with army there be saying how long one may be kept if find difficulty in crossing into portugal side of badajoz will not mind going down to cadiz must have difficulty there in getting ship to lisbon well will see muleteer said will go short way if can hate portuguese be fonder of with with of course must not be afraid of interference from portuguese be fighting on side aiding to help yes because think be better that war must be carried on here than in own country besides from what hear be with goodwill that fight under british general only because tell that unless furnish so many troop will have nothing more to do with will sail away with army to england may be true garcia know that when be here for be with british army marched through salamanca spanish authority be more willing to assist than be portuguese not single soldier with exception of two three thousand half armed men under romana joined from day crossed frontier to on embarked to corunna authority be bad garcia said scornfully only think of feathering own nest of quarrelling among people be patriot what can do when junta keep arm english have sent in magazine divide money among then general know nothing of business have own ambition rivalry be ready to fight when drum be beaten be called out go willingly enough what do do when go out be marched backwards forward without motive officer be good when at last do see french be always beaten general officer be first to run away ought in first place to rise not against french against junta councillor hidalgos then when have done with ought to choose officer from among men have done good service a leader of partisan then must meet french be brave enough when be well led see how people fought at saragossa since then at gerona many other place be not afraid of being killed have confidence in chief have doubt be so garcia that if regiment be trained by british officer a of portuguese now be must fight well unfortunately a say general officer be chosen not for merit from influence with junta whose object be to have army filled with men who will be subservient to order then there be thing against be jealousy of various province there be common effort when valencia be invaded for example valencians fight have idea of going out from home to assist castile catalonia so one after province be conquered by french be so garcia said thoughtfully if be to rise here must fight take chance of being killed must not care to risk life in defence of valencia with have nothing to do see how be to get over so long a be divided into province do garcia in time of peace various government may work well enough nothing must be worse than system when country be invaded what time do start tomorrow a soon a gate be open will be at five o'clock be eleven now so have better get sleep in morning must see that dress be right nita have given bottle of walnut juice to stain face hand do lie down on bed senor will wrap up in cloak be more accustomed to sleep on than on bed terence removed outer garment in few minute be sound asleep at four o'clock garcia roused morning be breaking with assistance of muleteer made toilet stained face neck hand darkened hair then ate piece of bread with bunch of grape took drink of red wine then sallied out garcia carrying sheepskin cloak terence three coloured blanket quarter of mile farther came to inn frequented by muleteer have told mate about garcia said so need not be afraid of indeed of of there be not muleteer who must not do what must to aid escape of british officer most of mule be already saddled garcia went up with terence to man who be buckling strap sanchez said be new comrade juan who told must accompany journey man nodded will be better said twelve mule be rather too much for two men to manage when get among mountain garcia terence at once set to work to assist in ten minute cavalcade started garcia rode leading mule three others being tied in single file behind terence came next sanchez brought up rear animal be fine one garcia be evidently proud of showing good point to terence telling name mule be very fond of master turning head at once when addressed by name flapping long ear in enjoyment a rubbed head patted neck town be already astir a reached gate country cart be pouring in laden with fruit vegetable for market garcia stopped for moment a old man came along with cart how be father how be garcia off again yes be going to xeres for wine for french general see that have got new comrade yes journey be long one thought that be a well to have mate yes be dangerous travelling old man said well goodbye good fortune to garcia put mule in motion again passed through gate soon left salamanca behind there be little conversation on way two spaniard made smoked cigarette continually terence endeavoured to imitate by addressing endearing word used to animal having learned name of four of be in charge at first did not respond to strange voice a became accustomed to answered when name be called by quickening pace by sharp whisk of tail showed understood that be addressed terence knew that escape must not be discovered until eight o'clock when door be opened prisoner assembled in yard for roll call must pursuit be organized be unlikely must be in direction of ciudad a might be supposed that escaped prisoner must naturally make for nearest spot where must join friend one prisoner more le must however make little difference authority must probably content with sending message by trooper to town village on road to arrest suspicious person travelling without proper paper on line be pursuing risk of interference be very small marshal pas must be certainly respected by officer of corp under command be not until fell in with party of soult troop that unpleasantness be to be apprehended though even here worst must be looked for if met large body of troop must be that mule might be taken for time for service in army after long day journey halted for night at village here found that troop marching south have encamped close at hand for night resource of place have be completely exhausted mattered little a carried week store of bread black sausage cheese onion garlic capsicum landlord of little inn furnished with cooking pot sort of stew terence found by mean unpalatable be concocted mule be hobbled turned out on to plain to graze for whole of forage of village have be requisitioned for use of cavalry baggage animal of french column on following morning struck off from road have be following travelling for sixteen hour came down on again at foot of pas of bejar learned from peasant that have got ahead of french column be encamped two three mile down road before daybreak be on way again reached banos in afternoon there be few inhabitant remaining here for requisition for food forage made by troop have so frequently passed through defile be such that position of inhabitant have become intolerable when learned from garcia that two division of french troop must most probably arrive that evening that marmont whole army must follow most of inhabitant who remained hastily packed most valuable belonging in cart drove away into hill landlord of largest inn however stood ground be doing well principal officer of troop passing through always took up quarter with paid fairly for meal saw that exaction be placed upon town be exempted from therefore muleteer be able to obtain comfortable meal after resting animal for three hour giving good feed of corn went on few mile farther then turning off encamped among hill be about to wrap in cloak blanket to lie down for night when number of armed men suddenly appeared who be be going one who appeared to be leader asked be bound for xeres garcia replied rising to foot be commissioned by senor moldeno well known wine merchant of salamanca to procure for a much good xeres wine a mule will carry be pity that did not meet on way back instead of on journey there must appreciate wine quite a thoroughly a customer must do how do propose to bring wine back when whole country south swarm with soult cavalry don moldeno obtained pas for from marmont who suppose be one of customer must not think of allowing wine to pas for use of french marshal man said be not likely that will drink for time garcia said carelessly for be marching in direction two of division have probably by time reached banos heard at salamanca that with rest of will follow in day two be bad news man said there will be traveller along here while army be on march be mule carrying nothing now nothing at mule must have be requisitioned two day ago a be most of others in salamanca marmont pas saved be carrying money to buy wine with don moldeno knew better than have only letter from to house of simon peron at xeres told that must be sufficient must furnish with wine at once on handing letter to well comrade man said to others gathered round be evident that will get booty tonight may a well be off to own fire where supper be waiting for move away from here at daybreak french may have party of horse over hill tomorrow searching for provision cattle sheep be narrow escape garcia said a brigand moved off wonder did not take mule suppose have a many a want three four must be sufficient to carry food anything may have stolen more than must only be hindrance to in moving about especially now know that french may be in neighbourhood in few hour if have not arrived already well senor what be next thing to be done terence did not answer for little time be not easy to say replied at length seeing that marmont soult be practically united there can be doubt that troop will have to fall back again to portugal whole country be covered with french cavalry in addition have to run risk from brigand who may not always prove so easy to deal with a men who have just left do think know country can judge far better than can a to chance of getting through think will be possible senor to carry out plan of trying to cross into portugal in direction seems to now that soult be engaged there can be large body of french near seville best plan must be to make for town whence so far a know country be clear of enemy down to cadiz when reach that port can take ship to lisbon in case will not be able to get money to pay for will not be known although must doubtless get passage think must obtain fund speak of senor british will be in salamanca one of day then will be able to pay if must not be there at time can leave money for with nita father be for sake undertook business have doubt whatever that will discharge debt when enter salamanca that certainly will to make more certain will ask one of officer of old regiment to undertake to find out to pay money in case may be with own men in other part of country will be quite enough senor trouble further on matter will start for seville at daybreak travelling rapidly little party kept along range of sierra then proceeded by valley of tagus crossed river at talavera then keeping nearly due south struck guadiana at ciudad real crossing la mancha gained sierra morena held west for distance along southern slope then turned south struck guadalquivir between cordova seville arrived safely at latter town have be obliged to make great number of detour to avoid body of enemy muleteer have difficulty in obtaining information from peasant a to whereabouts of french after reaching plain always travelled at night fell in twice with large party of guerilla be not brigand for a country be still unconquered french only held ground occupied band have not degenerated into brigandage be in communication with local authority acted in conformity with instruction in concert with spanish troop be however nearly month from date of leaving salamanca before arrived at cadiz terence have during journey greatly improved knowledge of spanish by conversation with muleteer a language be so similar to portuguese soon acquired facility in speaking put up at small fonda inn frequented by muleteer terence at once made way to house where heard that british agent resided latter on hearing story be surprised indeed that must have made way through spain from point so far away a salamanca occupied for greater portion of distance by french sloop of war be sailing tomorrow for tagus said will give letter to captain who will of course give passage terence informed of great service muleteer have rendered asked if must advance sufficient money to repay man certainly have fund at disposal for purpose captain o'connor for terence have said nothing about portuguese rank finding that announcement always caused certain amount of doubt will strain point grant thirty pound on bill upon agent at lisbon have doubt that will be met on presentation must for example vessel be wrecked captured be by mean contemplating a likely amount must go down among subsidy to spaniard who have rendered good service thank sir will be sufficient not to reward man for risk have run fidelity that have shown will at least pay for service of mule suppose that must earn more will be satisfaction to to know that be at least not out of pocket agent at once handed bag of silver together with letter to officer in command of daphne hired boat be rowed off to ship be lying with several other small british warship in port when ascended side officer on duty asked somewhat roughly in bad spanish what wanted have letter for captain fry replied in english to surprise of lieutenant be british officer who be taken prisoner at battle of fuentes d'onoro must not blame for having taken for spaniard lieutenant said in surprise a handed letter terence held out to midshipman with request to deliver to captain disguise be certainly excellent if speak spanish a well a look part can quite understand getting safely through country unfortunately speak quite well enough for ordinary purpose not well enough to pas a native travelled with muleteer who did talking be necessary have be month on journey have greatly improved spanish knew little of when started must not have got on so quickly have not be thoroughly up in portuguese of course helped immensely midshipman now came up requested terence to follow to captain cabin captain smiled a entered be well that mr bromhead vouched for captain o'connor for certainly must have have difficulty in bringing to believe that be british officer will of course be very glad to give passage to hear story of adventure ought to be very interesting have have very few adventure terence replied muleteer knew country perfectly have difficulty in obtaining from peasant news of movement of french when started have idea of making such long journey have intended to join lord beresford in front of badajos if must not manage to cross frontier higher up marmont march south rendered that impossible thought that safer plan must be to keep well away from frontier a of course thing be much more settled in interior two three muleteer with animal must excite little attention even if passed through town with large french garrison except that mule might have be impressed a have mean of recompensing guide in case be anxious to avoid risk when do sail sir at eight o'clock tomorrow can not very well go in attire captain said smiling will be glad to advance sum that may require to procure clothes can doubt pay on arrival at lisbon terence gladly accepted loan of ten pound with returned to shore on reaching little inn at once handed thirty pound to garcia man however absolutely refused to accept senor since have got money will take fifty dollar to pay for food forage on way back although really have cost nothing for have to make journey on business even did owe money must not take now may not be so lucky on way back a have be in coming might be seized by brigand therefore must in case rather that left matter until come to salamanca may not be for long time be quite a likely that may be obliged to quit portugal embark for england a that will ever get to salamanca who know senor luck may turn however must rather that be so have have pleasure of having made journey with will have pleased nita if come well good if not can not be helped will not grieve over if have money with might lose might cost life terence have again gone out purchased suit of clothes befitting spanish gentleman took muleteer with have longer reason for concealing identity must find necessary to announce to be british officer might be useful to have corroboration of story also laid in fresh stock of linen of be greatly in need next morning

have urgent despatch from junta of cadiz to of seville despatch of own to person at cordova others in madrid who be in communication with british government offered sum for safe delivery must

campaign opened other officer might be appointed to command need not trouble on score in future colonel o'connor lord wellington said if have bad luck to be captured again will know that absence will be temporary if became necessary to appoint anyone else to command must only be until return on leaving commander in chief quarter adjutant general asked terence when thought of rejoining regiment be going to start at once sir ordered horse to be saddled in readiness at ten o'clock must not think of doing so adjutant said road be very bad not at fit to be traversed on dark night like besides must really gain nothing by if leave at daybreak will overtake regiment before have marched many mile chapter effecting diversion at twelve o'clock next day terence rode up to regiment just a have halted for two hour rest a soon a be recognized men leapt to foot cheering vociferously gathered round while minute two later herrara ryan two major ran up to greet illustration men leapt to foot cheering vociferously have be expecting for last month ryan exclaimed though how be to get through french line be more than must imagine still made sure must do somehow gave credit for more sharpness than posse dick felt sure must not be done so have to go right down to cadiz back to lisbon by ship be very much easier affair than ours be met with adventure difficulty on way well herrara heard at headquarters that regiment be going on well fought stoutly at banos loss be not heavy hope have fifty three killed hundred more le seriously wounded more than half of have rejoined vacancy have be filled up two battalion be at full strength two of captain fernandez panza be killed have appointed two of sergeant temporarily pending confirmation on return be well that be worse be good men will be loss to whom have appointed in place gomes mendoza two sergeant major be men of good family thoroughly know duty of course filled place for time with two of colour sergeant suppose have ridden from headquarters terence ryan put in must be a hungry a hunter be just going to sit down to couple of chicken ham so come along while be taking meal terence gave account of manner in have escaped from salamanca so be in old quarter terence well certainly have marvellous knack of getting out of scrape when saw horse carrying into middle of french cavalry thought for moment that minho regiment have lost colonel be not for long soon be sure that somehow other must give slip again of course have be thinking of a prisoner at ciudad be afraid that must keep sharper watch over there than did at bayonne still felt sure that must manage somehow even without help have what be order have none save that be to march to miranda where will find guerilla force under moras be to operate with do can to attract attention of french be know for have not have time to look at written instruction received from adjutant general when said goodbye to last night think there be precise order be yours herrara be be to consult with moras to operate carefully not to be drawn into combat with superior nearly equal french force took to mean equal to strength of regiment for guerilla be not to be depended upon to smallest extent in anything like pitched combat there be doubt about terence agreed for cutting off small party harassing convoy anything of sort be excellent for down right hard fighting guerilla be not worth salt great advantage of be that render necessary for french to send very strong guard with baggage convoy occasionally when be particularly bold numerous to despatch column in pursuit of if be not for band must be able to concentrate troop must soon capture andalusia valencia then turn attention to other work a be have to keep road clear to leave strong garrison everywhere to keep sufficient force in province to make head against guerilla for if did not do so friend must be speedily killed peasantry be constantly incited to rise do know anything of moras be said to be good leader herrara replied to have gathered under number of other band have reputation of being le savage cruel than greater part of partisan leader though doubt kill prisoner for in must hardly restrain men doe not permit barbarous cruelty be disgrace to spanish people in fact believe order be that prisoner be to be taken will look at instruction terence said drawing out paper have received night before yes said when have read instruction be good deal like yours leave hand somewhat more free be to consult with moras to operate with when think advisable in respect to act entirely upon own judgment discretion main object being to compel french to detach a many men a possible from neighbourhood in order to oppose be to take advantage nature of country may afford to inflict heavy blow upon be right ryan said cheerfully have quite made up mind that must always be dependent upon moras be kept inactive owing to refusal to carry out anything herrara might propose a can act independently of be sure to have plenty of fun will make a hot for a can dick if can not do more can certainly oblige french to keep something like division idle to hold in check with two battalion be irregular ought to be able to harass amazingly to hold of mountain pass against considerable force after two hour halt march be renewed two day later regiment arrived at frontier ran close to town douro separating two country learned that moras be lying four mile farther to north across frontier line doubtless preferring to remain in spain in order to prevent quarrel between follower portuguese next morning terence accompanied by ryan four mounted orderly rode into glen where follower be lying have erected great number of small arbour of bough bush a terence rode up to one of be larger better finished than rest moras came to entrance to meet did not at correspond with terence idea of guerilla chief be young man of three four twenty of slim figure with handsome thoughtful face have be student of divinity at salamanca have killed french officer in duel brought on by insolence of latter have be compelled to fly few men have gathered round have at once raised standard a guerilla chief at first operation have be on very small scale success have attended enterprise report of reckless bravery have speedily swelled number of follower although a rule kept only hundred with must at time by sending round summons collect five time number in few hour when terence introduced a colonel of two battalion have arrived at miranda to operate in conjunction with moras held out hand frankly be very glad indeed to meet colonel o'connor said received despatch four day ago from general saying that minho regiment must shortly arrive at miranda to act in concert with be glad indeed when heard of for name of regiment be well known on side of frontier a well a on other having be engaged in many gallant action name be equally well known in connection with hardly expected to meet for despatch said minho regiment under lieutenant colonel herrara yes only rejoined two day ago having be taken prisoner at fuentes d'onoro having made escape from salamanca aid will be invaluable senor own men be brave enough be irregular in full sense of word smiled although can be relied upon for sudden attack for defence of pas must not stand against french force of quarter of strength in plain want backbone better one must be found than regiment be more glad that be in command because know unhappily portuguese get on well together while men must hesitate to obey portuguese commander must have confidence in must gladly accept leadership hope that there will be difficulty on ground of race terence said be fighting in common cause against common enemy dissension between ourselves be a absurd a be dangerous let introduce captain ryan adjutant of regiment moras shook hand with ryan who have be looking on with surprise at colloquy between terence moras then asked into arbour have little to offer said with smile save black bread wine latter however be good obtained large supply of from convoy captured few day since wine be indeed excellent accustomed a be to coarse bread of country terence ryan be able to eat with satisfaction now colonel moras said beyond fact that be to act in concert know nothing of plan please to remember that while be said that be to discus plan of operation together place unreservedly under order of irregular warfare have learned something of military science anything like extensive operation be a ignorant a child while have shown capacity for command may be of advantage to from knowledge of country indeed there be not village track that someone other of follower be not well acquainted with of course will be of great advantage to terence replied courteously thank much for what have said be sure from what have heard underrate ability beyond regimental drill knew very little of warfare until quite by accident came to assume command of regiment be only because drilled disciplined thoroughly that have good fortune to obtain success with acquaintance with country will be fully set off to superior knowledge may have of military matter have doubt that will get on well together instruction have received be to effect that be to make incursion attack in various direction concealing a far a possible strength so to oblige french to detach considerable number of troop to hold in check must relieve pressure upon lord wellington army must deter enemy from making offensive movement into portugal until general have received reinforcement expected shortly be in position to take offensive will be just work to suit guerilla chief said a received subsidy from political agent at lisbon few day since be in position to keep whole force have together be more than can do generally for even if successful in attack on convoy greater portion of men scatter return to home a long a share of booty last care to come out again terence now produced map with have be supplied considerable time be spent in obtaining full particular of country through troop might have to march ascertaining best spot for resistance when retreating for attacking column who might be despatched in pursuit of in discussing manner direction in operation must most alarm annoy enemy be finally agreed that terence must break up battalion into three party two of consisted of battalion strong must be under command of bull macwitty of must be accompanied by guerilla who must act a scout in case opportunity must offer join in fighting might take place other two half battalion formed third body under command of terence must with main force of guerilla occupy road between zamora salamanca valladolid in way french must be harassed at several point must find so difficult to obtain information a to real strength of foe be threatening that must be obliged to send up considerable force to oppose must hesitate to undertake serious advance into portugal until question be cleared up line of communication assured again be agreed in first place that force must unite in mountain west of braganza between river esla on east tera on north affording strong position from in case of very large force mustering against must retire across frontier into portugal terence have be supplied with money authority to give order on paymaster department for such purchase a be absolutely necessary moras be also well supplied having not only money have be sent proceeds of successful attack upon convoy proceeding to salamanca in have captured commissariat chest with considerable sum of money besides large number of cattle several waggon load of flour provision with terence have authority to draw from store at miranda be to be taken to spot have chosen a headquarters in hill beat altogether terence ryan said a after matter have be arranged rode out from guerilla camp be only about three month since saw then must only just get along in spanish now be chattering away in a if have never spoken anything else life well see dick knew just enough when be taken prisoner to be able to a say get along in that made difference to if have known nothing at of must not have be able to benefit by trip with muleteer in spain a be be able to talk with a rode side by side day sat together by fire for hour after have halted when day journey be over did tremendous lot of talking a see came out at end of month able to get along really fluently doubt make good many mistake mix good many portuguese word with spanish doe not matter in least so long a one be with friend although must matter good deal if be trying to pas a spaniard among people who might betray if found out that be english see that have improved in portuguese almost a much a have in spanish be really only first drudgery be difficult in learning language when once one make start one get on very fast especially if one be not afraid of making mistake never care rap whether make blunder not so that can make understood three day later two body be assembled in valley about equally distant from miranda braganza have advantage of being entered from east only through narrow gorge must be defended against very superior force while there be two mountain track leading from by force there must be withdrawn must entrance be forced day be spent by leader in making final arrangement while men worked at erection of great wall of rock twelve foot high a many thick across mouth of gorge collecting quantity of stone rock on height on side to roll down upon enemy who might endeavour to scale while very strong party built wall six foot high in great semicircle round upper mouth of gorge so that column forcing way through thus far must be met by so heavy fire that must only debouch into valley with immense loss two hundred men of minho regiment drawn from terence party be to occupy valley with three hundred of guerilla who must be able to do good service by occupying height while regular infantry held newly erected wall one of moras most trusted lieutenant be to command while after discussion be arranged that herrara must be in general command of garrison brave fellow be reluctant to remain inactive have be for time seriously unwell having be laid up for time with severe attack of dysentery be really unfit for continued exertion although have made light of illness refused to go on sick list terence pointed out to that command be very important one here plunder that might obtain from enemy must be carried if by mean of spy traitor french obtained news of situation of post might be attacked in great force before other detachment must arrive to assistance a there be four thousand french troop at zamora be agreed that direct attack must be made upon town bull with force be to watch garrison attack detachment might be sent out leaving severely alone when sallied out in force to content with outmarching infantry beating off cavalry attack be if necessary to retreat in direction of stronghold macwitty be to occupy road between zamora valladolid while main body held road between latter town zamora to salamanca frequent communication be to be kept up between so that column might speedily be reinforced if necessary in course of week whole country be in state of alarm bridge be broken down road blocked by deep cutting across convoy attacked small french post at tordesillas fuentelapena valparaiso captured french soldier being disarmed then taken under escort to within ten mile of salamanca toro be entered suddenly garrison of three hundred men taken by surprise forced to lay down arm powder bullock waggon with store be sent by circuitous route to bridge across douro at miranda then up to stronghold so vigilant watch be kept on road that single courier be able to make way from valladolid to salamanca zamora beyond fact that whole country seemed swarming with enemy french commander be in absolute ignorance of strength of force have so suddenly invaded leon one day messenger rode in from macwitty to fuentelapena where terence have headquarters saying that body of french infantry with cavalry be on march from valladolid towards zamora strong position have already be selected for defence bridge broken down at point where road crossed tributary of douro terence at once sent ryan with men to reinforce macwitty despatched several mounted messenger to find bull to tell to join on road four mile to east of point where macwitty be defending passage of river marched directly on point crossing river at tordesillas arrived there early in morning found that french column have passed late evening before at point road ran between two hill several time crossing stream wound along valley large number of men be at once set to work breaking down bridge throwing up breastwork along bank where river made sharp bend crossing valley from foot of hill on one side to of on other while work be being done cannon shot be heard then distant rattle of musketry terence knew that by time ryan must have joined macwitty moras at once started with men of portuguese to threaten french rear make dash upon baggage terence order to officer in command of two company be that be to keep men well together to cover retreat of guerilla from cavalry attack firing continued for next hour half then suddenly swelled in volume amid rattle must be heard sound of heavy volley of musketry terence have hour before ridden forward at full speed with four mounted orderly when arrived at spot where must survey scene of combat saw that be more serious than have anticipated guerilla be falling back rapidly a soon a gained high ground halted opened fire upon cavalry who scattered over plain be pursuing own men be retreating steadily in good order facing round pouring heavy volley into french cavalry a charged french attack on macwitty have ceased terence saw body of infantry moving towards right where on rising ground body of troop about thousand strong be showing menacingly have doubt for moment that be bull command who hearing firing supposing terence be engaged there have led command straight to scene of action at once sent orderly back at full gallop to order men in valley to come on at top of speed then rode along hillside joined bull who be now closely engaged with advancing column of french so hot be fire from bull own men guerilla that two french battalion wavered came to halt then breaking into skirmishing order advanced up hill wait too long bull terence said there be steeper slope behind however think will come up very far not at least until be reinforced there be body just starting think can hold on here until join skirmishing line a soon a do so sound order for men to fall back where be men sir be four mile away at spot where told to join however mistake be of importance have sent off for a soon a arrive show fancy french will retreat tore out leaf from pocketbook wrote out order to macwitty leave captain ryan with command to hold river march at once with rest of men to ford heard of mile down river cross there ascend hill on french right scattering men so a to make a much show a possible menacing french with attack tell captain ryan to redouble fire so a to prevent french noticing withdrawal of force gave to one of orderly told to swim river deliver to major macwitty when terence have done be able to give attention to what be passing across valley men have now ascended hill joined guerilla french cavalry unable to charge up height have fallen back column of french fifteen hundred strong be marching in direction a have expected skirmisher in front of be making little way evidently halting for arrival of reinforcement be still more than mile distant french gunner have be withdrawn from bank of river be taking up position to cover advance of infantry shot presently came singing overhead doing harm however to portuguese who be lying down on crest of swell keeping up steady fire on french skirmisher ten minute later column be within short distance of line of defender gave word men retired up steeper slope behind while guerilla be ordered to remain to keep up brisk fire until french be within thirty yard of crest be then to run back at full speed join above portuguese have scarcely taken up position when tremendous fire broke out below minute later guerilla be seen rushing up hill close behind came french line cheering loudly a appeared portuguese opened fire with such steadiness precision that leading file of french be almost annihilated wave swept upwards encouraged by shout of officer advanced against second position for hour obstinate fight be maintained strength of position neutralizing effect of superior number of french spaniard fought well imitating steadiness of portuguese being for most part good marksman fire be very deadly several determined attack of french be beaten off with heavy loss then from valley below be heard sound of bugle call be repeated by bugle of assailant slowly reluctantly french began to fall back terence looked round have from time to time glanced across to hill opposite have seen men there retiring steadily in good order before assault of french now saw that force from valley be marching rapidly along hilltop to assistance while away on french right macwitty command spread out to appear of much greater strength than really possessed be moving down slope a if to assault below in valley battalion of french infantry with cavalry artillery be drawn up be evidently only waiting for return of two assaulting column to join in retreat french commander doubtless supposed that be caught in trap unable to effect passage of river seeing stubborn resistance troop be meeting with on hill arrival of two fresh body of enemy on scene induced to believe that foe be in great force that ere long might be completely surrounded moved forward slowly by road have come be presently joined by two detached party a soon a moved on terence sent orderly at gallop across valley to order macwitty moras to follow french along on hill on side of valley to harass a much a possible while with bull command kept parallel with on side french cavalry kept ahead of column leading battalion be thrown out a skirmisher on lower slope of hill while artillery in rear kept up heavy fire upon portuguese spanish a soon a be made out on hill above terence kept men on crest signalled to macwitty to do same guerilla swarmed down hillside maintained galling fire on french column terence took men along at double heading column descended into valley at point have fortified here there be sharp fight french cavalry fell back after suffering heavily infantry advanced gallantly after fierce fight drove portuguese from wall up hillside here maintained heavy fire until column opened out french artillery came to front when terence at once ordered men to scatter climb hill at full speed without attempting to repair broken bridge french infantry crossed stream breast high cavalry artillery followed terence seeing that retreat must not be seriously molested that if attempted to do so must suffer very heavily from artillery sounded halt french continued retreat to valladolid leaving behind baggage have be unable to get across stream terence force came down from hill assembled in valley congratulation be exchanged on success have attended effort then roll be at once called be found that hundred three men of minho regiment be missing there be roll among guerilla moras estimate after counting number assembled be that upwards of two hundred be absent from rank fully of having be overtaken killed by french cavalry terence at once sent off two party of own men to point where fight have be fiercest be to collect wounded including of french to carry down into valley while party of guerilla searched hillside down to scene of action for comrade who have fallen from fire of french artillery musketry when wounded be collected be found there be upwards of two hundred french infantry fifty nine guerilla twenty four portuguese smaller proportion of wounded of latter being accounted for by fact that so many have be shot through head while lying down to fire at french a climbed hill two hundred thirty french soldier have be killed terence at once set men to dig wide trench in soldier of three nationality be laid side by side considerable amount of reserve ammunition being captured in waggon men cartridge box be filled up again rest be packed in waggon of driver have cut trace others have neglected to do there be sufficient waggon to carry wounded friend enemy together with considerable amount of flour french wounded be taken to ford by macwitty have crossed then of who have be wounded in leg although unable to walk be fit to drive be given rein told to take waggon to zamora distance of twelve mile fifty men be told off to march with until within sight of town a otherwise must have assuredly be attacked whole of wounded massacred by spanish peasant force then broke up again column taking a much flour meat a men must carry remaining waggon store be heaped together set on fire long before be done have be rejoined by ryan command have remained guarding river until french have disappeared up valley have then crossed at ford though using haste did not rejoin force until whole of fighting be over have be good day work terence said when evening force have entered tordesillas quartered there for night may be sure that general at valladolid will send messenger to salamanca giving greatly exaggerated account of force begging to send down to marmont at once for large reinforcement if courier make detour in first place will not be able to cut off dick must if must have doubt that will report force with column be engaged a being nearly double what really be besides sharp a have be expect messenger will by time have got through from zamora commandant there will report that large force be in neighbourhood of town that without leaving place entirely undefended have not strength enough to sally out against can not know that force ours have joined hand in attack on valladolid column that represented anything like whole of force have be harrying country cutting off detached post fact too that gathering be not mere collection of guerilla of revolted peasantry that there be regular troop among in considerable number will have great effect marmont will feel obliged when get news to send fifteen twenty thousand troop up here to clear country now first thing to do be to draw up report of engagement to send off to wellington think that will be good thing dick for to carry think that there be fear of being interrupted on way to miranda a officer will be able to get fresh horse take news quicker than orderly must do be of great importance that chief must know a soon a possible what have taken place here will speak very strongly of service during past week be always good thing for officer selected to carry news of success lastly can give much better account of operation since crossed frontier than orderly must do wellington may want to send order back for future work be game ryan said thank for offer how long will be well be eight o'clock now if start at midnight will be soon enough so if have finished supper have better lie down on bed in next room get sleep for be marching last night will want rest before starting on journey chapter dick ryan capture terence wrote two despatch one giving full account of engagement other detail of work have be performed since crossed frontier wrote in duplicate so that might send off messenger three hour later in case by chance ryan failed to reach miranda carefully abstained from giving real account of strength of various column in case putting number at five time actual strength so that if despatch must miscarry not only must information be conveyed to french must be led to believe that invading force be vastly stronger than have hitherto supposed ryan be of course to explain when delivered despatch that figure must in case be divided by five reason why false number have be inserted terence let sleep until one o'clock then roused several french horse have be found straying riderless along valley best of be picked out for few minute later dick be on way to miranda road by be to travel must take six mile south of zamora distance to be ridden be between fifty sixty mile knew that must not do at gallop went along at steady pace sometimes trotting sometimes cantering be now late in september at half past five be still dark when ryan approached spot where road be following crossed main road between zamora salamanca be riding at canter when suddenly to surprise consternation rode into midst of body of cavalry halted on main road sound of horse foot have be heard before must even draw sword be seized taken prisoner french officer rode down line what be matter asked have taken prisoner sir sergeant answered heard coming by crossroad seized a rode in among be soldier officer must think from what can see of who be sir french officer said to ryan latter saw that concealment be useless must soon be light enough for scarlet uniform to be seen therefore replied in broken french name be ryan hold rank of captain be riding to miranda when unfortunately fell in with trooper a be halted did not hear of course must not see until be among illustration beearch at once riding with despatch doubt officer said search at once men might destroy here be sir ryan said taking despatch from inside jacket need not have searched give word of honour a british officer have others on put in middle of troop sergeant officer said put trooper in special charge of on side unbuckle rein buckle on to of trooper do ride behind keep sharp lookout upon be important capture five minute later squadron again started on way south ryan after silently cursing bad luck at having arrived at spot just a body of cavalry be crossing wondered what evil fortune have sent there at precise moment be not long in arriving at conclusion convoy of french wounded have arrived at zamora late in evening commandant thinking likely that enemy who have hitherto blocked road might have concentrated for attack on column have decided upon sending off squadron of cavalry to carry important news have learned from wounded of defeat of column five thousand strong coming to relief from valladolid party proceeded at brisk trot meeting with resistance arrived at salamanca by ten o'clock in morning officer in command at once rode with ryan latter guarded by four trooper to residence of general leaving dick with escort outside entered house sent in name duty with be charged to general be at once shown into room congratulate on having got through captain d'estrelles general said a entered be ten day since heard from zamora have sent off six messenger know whether of have arrived sir none of commandant sent off one two day suppose like sent be stopped whole country seems on fire general said have have five six party come in here disarmed who have be captured by enemy must seem that post on road to zamora on to valladolid have be captured men must only report that be suddenly attacked by such overwhelming force that resistance be impossible say that whole country seems to swarm with guerilla there be certainly considerable number of regular troop among have happened at zamora despatch will inform sir may tell that be virtually beleaguered country round swarm with enemy two three reconnaissance in force met with most determined opposition be in communication with valladolid sir communication be stopped at same time a to town be sorry to say that will see by general despatch that severe disaster have happened to column coming from valladolid to relief general took despatch rapidly perused content column five thousand strong with cavalry gun repulsed enemy must be in force indeed from estimate have received from prisoner released thought must be fully ten thousand strong see that wounded who be sent by moras estimate engaged with at twelve thousand be hardly probable that must at such short notice have assembled in anything like full strength have also to report general that morning before daybreak captured british officer on way to miranda with despatch be fortunately halted for moment so that be unaware of presence until rode into midst of be despatch have not opened be important capture indeed general said that be if report contains detail of fighting content may enable to form clearer idea than can at present of number broke seal read account of battle be signed t o'connor colonel said name be well known to a of very active partisan leader three of column appear to have be commanded by british officer here have major bull major macwitty captain ryan be captain ryan whom have made prisoner sir disposition appear to have be good ably worked out bridge across river have be destroyed crossing be opposed by one column while be attempting to force passage three more column attacked one on flank rear while fourth composed of portion of force defending passage who a soon a be fairly engaged with other column crossed ford lower down leaving thousand men to face on river bank advanced against left finding thus greatly outnumbered column fell back leaving behind five hundred dead wounded passage be closed by enemy who have broken down bridge thrown breastwork across valley after sharp fighting made way through then turned to other despatch be still more useful said be general report of proceeding since crossed frontier give number of column total up to twenty five thousand men of ten thousand seem to be regular troop rest guerilla do wish to see prisoner sir be waiting with guard outside yes might a well see though a point of fact can give more information than contained in report be very full detailed so sir said when ryan be brought in be british officer be sir dick replied quietly at present on detached duty serving on staff of colonel o'connor who be with guerilla chief moras general said yes sir troop under colonel o'connor have be acting in concert with moras other force much to advantage of such of soldier a fell into hand not one of whom have suffered insult injury have be permitted to go free after being deprived of arm colonel o'connor also sent away french wounded who fell into hand after battle in waggon escorted by strong body of troop to within mile of zamora in order to protect from massacre by peasant behaved sir a british officer must be expected to behave general said be war always conducted on same principle must be better for army for people of country will place on parole if choose thank general must rather have hand free must see opportunity of escaping that be not likely to do general said for if refuse to be bound by parole must take measure against having of opportunity that speak of until country be cleared can be sent with convoy to france be sorry that refuse a must do so under similar circumstance can not blame accordingly ryan be taken to strong prison in heart of city where however be assigned comfortable quarter sentry being placed at door a window looked into courtyard be strongly barred chance of escape seemed slight indeed be almost inclined to regret that have not accepted general offer given parole not to attempt to escape two day later one of moras men who belonged to salamanca went into town to see friend brought back news that british officer have be captured by party of french dragoon coming from zamora have be seen by many of townspeople a sat on horse with four trooper round at door of governor house have be lodged in city prison comparison of date showed that there must be doubt that prisoner be dick ryan terence be greatly vexed at loss so far a despatch go said to herrara who have on day before arrived from stronghold be now safe from attack there can be doubt that be fortunate rather than otherwise that have fallen into hand of french for will give altogether exaggerated impression of strength have doubt that orderly who left two hour later have got through in safety still be greatly annoyed that ryan have be made prisoner miss service companionship very much if can possibly get out will do so will see moras ask to send man who brought news back again to gather further particular must take matter in hand being in command here must consider duty with be intrusted before question of private friendship moras presently came in to see terence when latter told what wanted undertook at once to obtain detail possible a to place of ryan confinement number of men come from town said will cause inquiry to be made among at once choose dozen with connection who may be able to assist send into salamanca with instruction to act in concert to ascertain whether be possible to do anything by bribery to endeavour to communicate with prisoner to devise plan for escape from gaol be strong place before french came be city prison took over have used not only for prisoner of war for person suspected of being in communication with people even for officer of own army who have be convicted of insubordination disobedience of order other offence one of men will send to whom will intrust general arrangement of matter be one of lieutenant leon gonzales have be friend of mine since boyhood entered a law student when went into college for divinity be daring fearless have excellent head large acquaintance among young men at university indeed in class of society belongs to one of best family yes of course know terence said have several time come with when have ridden over be in command of detachment be with when captured french garrison at tordesillas be much pleased with although too occupied to see much of conceived great liking for must say that be just man to manage business successfully if be possible to do so at event will despatch with six other men whom may choose afternoon moras said have intended to remain in command of party leave here when march tonight will hand over to night force with exception of guerilla a many of minho regiment marched away from station occupied to take up new position between valladolid valencia herrara be to remain behind in command of portuguese in conjunction with guerilla be to occupy old position stopping line of communication showing in village town hitherto unvisited divided into party of two three hundred march rapidly about country so that fact that main body have moved elsewhere must be unknown to french authority who must therefore believe that force be to cut road north of valladolid be newly arrived one thirty six hour later terence with battalion half of regiment of moras guerilla took up position in mountain lying to east of valencia between river esqueva arlanza from position must with equal facility come down on road between valladolid valencia between latter town burgos here for week maintained in first place falling upon convoy from valladolid south when only moved forward under escort too strong to be attacked carrying on operation on road to burgos in raid obtained abundance of provision considerable number of arm much ammunition in two three instance large

discover one of loss must not cripple greatest enemy be cold be now end of october several time snow have fallen be necessary to keep up large fire be double inconvenience in first place smoke by day flame by night might betray position of camp in second place track in snow must speedily cover hill must enable enemy to follow wherever moved be therefore determined that must no longer maintain

have fallen back across douro have established in stronghold from made frequent excursion towards zamora benavente to dick ryan in prison first fortnight have passed slowly terence must a soon a

probably be filled in with dust black lead night after work be done difficulty must have be great for have learned that sentry patrolled street outside prison work must only have be carried on for two three minute at time how be to get down to courtyard knew not probably sentry have be found more amenable to bribe than old sergeant have be to bitter disappointment night passed without anything unusual taking place scheme have evidently failed broke up loaf eagerly next morning found a expected message authority suspicion sentry changed must wait till vigilance subsides keep in readiness fortnight passed then in middle of night leapt suddenly from bed on have thrown without undressing a heard key grating in door for minute two sound continued heart sank again have got key wo fit muttered suddenly heard bolt shoot back door quietly opened be ready voice asked in whisper quite ready then follow ryan have caught up boot a leapt from bed man outside have evidently taken

before then removed piece cut out handed to man who laid quietly down on pavement of passage in ten minute other bar be removed have cord man said unwound ten foot of stout rope from waist ryan put head out through hole looked down in darkness must see nothing heard heavy tread of two sentry a sound of footstep faded away in distance heard sudden exclamation slight movement few second later voice below asked in whisper be there yes ryan replied joyfully putting noose be at one end of rope over stump of one of bar at once slid down moment later other man descended after way senor voice said taking hand led across street then after quarter of mile walk stopped at door of large house opened with key led way up stair to second floor opened door said enter senor be at home ryan have

glass be filled cigar lighted in first place one of men with have cousin who work for baker who contract for supply of bread to prison fortunately be one of duty to go with bread to hand over see weighed that simplified affair amazingly in next place be necessary to get hold of soldier who usually handed bread to non commissioned officer who took ration for prisoner under special charge have be well provided with money when soldier came out one evening got into conversation with assented willingly enough to offer to have bottle of good wine together then opened subject believe distribute bread ration to prisoner said nodded ' want one special loaf be rather better bread than rest though look same to reach prisoner who be friend of mine may be that will want two three such loaf to

there be nothing to be done three other men who have be standing hidden in doorway ran out poniarded frenchman before have time to give alarm be unfortunate be unavoidable however two day later loaf got safely to at least be assured that have done so by soldier in kitchen in meantime learned from man who have be warder in prison before french took possession of that passage close to bottom of staircase terminated at barred window in street behind two of men undertook to cut bar be easy matter for there be sentry outside one came along back two three minute men have light ladder directly have passed ran across street placed in position fell to work constant interference by passing of sentinel annoyed greatly hindered work see sentry have to patrol lane down one side of prison then along behind back so have only time taken by from corner to end of lane back to work be so annoyed at one night when sentry came to be relieved be found stabbed to heart a misfortune happened just after went on duty men managed to file one of bar night curiously enough same accident happened two night later just a have arranged with spaniard who have enlisted in french army that must aid to escape be sharp fellow have managed to get key of room from peg where hung to take impression of in wax from have key made everything be now ready other bar be sawn on night accident happened to second sentry next night spaniard be to be on guard on staircase sent loaf with message to be in readiness unfortunately second accident aroused suspicion of authority that affair have something to do with escape of prisoner accordingly sentry outside be doubled two men patrolling together that evening guard be suddenly changed be evident that for time nothing must be done for nearly fortnight dodging about of guard continued then a be quiet thing went back to old course four sentry be taken off others going about two together pair taking two side of prison morning spaniard who a be on duty at night be able to come out into town early told man who have arranged affair with that must be on night duty must manage to take place among guard so that when arrived at door must be one to be left

sombrero flattened inside so that before opening door have only to stand musket in corner laying greatcoat shako by be in position to go through street anywhere a civilian have be well paid a be already heartily tired of french service jumped at offer made after chatting for time longer obtaining more detail of proceeding of rescue party ryan gonzales lay down for few hour sleep on couch in room while host turned into bed have vainly attempted to persuade one other to accept chapter back with army ryan remained four day in flat occupied by don alonzo santobel leon gonzales have left before daybreak to regain house where be staying with one of friend before discovery of escape of prisoner be made affair be certain to cause great excitement there be doubt that everyone leaving town must be strictly examined at gate not improbably house must be searched order issued that one must be allowed to be out at night after ten o'clock without military pas three soldier have be in turn assassinated one have deserted prisoner have be released there be evidently several person concerned in matter must not improbably be guessed by authority that actor in plot be agent of british officer in command of troop have given such trouble over whole province between burgos salamanca don alonzo gave manservant on whose fidelity must rely permission to go into country for ten day to visit relation ryan be installed in place dressed in suit of clothes be not to open door to visitor spaniard doing so mentioning to who called that servant have gone on holiday french indeed

through gate going out with several peasant who be returning home one of leon follower have taken out uniform in basket with cloth thrown over on be placed article of crockery have apparently bought for use at home ryan have be carefully instructed a to road must follow four mile out from city turned down by path kept on for mile half then came to farmhouse standing alone a approached leon came out to meet shook warmly by hand have be feeling very anxious about said got through yesterday unquestioned officer at gate today might have be more particular sort of fellow might have taken into

fell back behind esla fortnight since for four thousand of french reinforcement from south have reached zamora strong party of cavalry be scouting over whole of country round ryan have already heard how road between valladolid burgos have be interrupted several convoy cut off captured be glad to find however that serious fighting have taken place while have be prisoner after nightfall started on journey travelled sixty mile night farmer son young fellow of twenty who knew country thoroughly accompanied on horseback for first twenty mile to set on way road followed ran almost parallel to tormes bridge over river being a learned held by strong party of french troop posted there to prevent body of spaniard crossing placing between salamanca ciudad rodrigo when morning broke be within five mile of douro entered wood where intended to pas day a be unaware whether french troop be stationed along river be still dressed a countryman leon went in afternoon to little hamlet mile from wood there learned that french be encamped at village mile from bridge at miranda one of peasant on leon telling that be lieutenant of moras offered to guide to ford of whose existence did not think french be aware be seldom used a must only be forded in very dry season a water now be must only be necessary to swim horse distance of few yard two friend slept great part of day a sun set finished provision have brought with be ready to start when two hour later guide arrived from village information proved correct led straight to ford found unguarded rewarding handsomely for trouble swam across hour later entered miranda put up at small inn mounted early next morning in afternoon after three hour ride across mountain came down into valley where arrival excited much enthusiasm among troop garrison having be joined by macwitty column can not say be not expecting to see captain ryan macwitty said a shook hand heartily for heard from colonel that don leon have started with party to try get out of prison that be sure must accomplish if be at possible be expecting here in day two with rest of regiment for have message two day ago from saying that be too cold to remain on hill longer that must start on day after messenger left of course messenger be mounted men can march a far in day a man can ride be sure to lose time must take leon road for distance then strike off cross upper esla at maylorga follow road down avoiding benavente cross tera at vega take track across mountain come down into valley from above said that must only bring such store a must be able to carry on march that hoped to get here before french be aware that have left mountain late in afternoon leon follower arrived have travelled at night so a to avoid being questioned by french cavalry who be scattered over country ryan be glad to see men who have risked so much for very pleased to be able to exchange peasant clothes for uniform next morning leon mounted rode by track by terence must arrive met halfway between vega camp greeting be hearty one indeed a ryan shook hand with moras said can not tell senor how much be indebted to don leon for splendid way in managed rescue nothing must have be more admirably contrived better carried out certainly seemed to after have be there day two that rescue be simply impossible though knew that colonel o'connor must do best to get out a soon a learned that be captured gave credit for better sense dick than to ride right into hand of french terence said a ryan rode on together at head of column think must have done terence night be dark must not see ten yard ahead of if have be on march of course must have heard by bad luck have halted just across road be following be very fortunate that put number wrong in despatch can tell be mighty comfort to to know that have done so for must have be half mad at thought that have got at real strength must have entirely defeated object of expedition a be have satisfaction of knowing that capture of despatch must do more good than harm did man who followed get through yes kept eye open dicky terence said returned ten day later with letter from adjutant general saying that commander in chief be highly satisfied with report that forward movement of french have ceased at several point advanced troop have be called in spy have brought news ten thousand men under general drouet have marched for salamanca that report be current in french camp that very large force have crossed frontier at northeastern corner of portugal with evident design of recovering north of leon of cutting main line of communication with france added that trusted must be able to still further harass enemy cause to send more reinforcement said that doubtless must be very shortly driven back into portugal again that left matter entirely to judgment pointed out that if must maintain for fortnight winter must be at hand when pass must be blocked with snow marmont must no longer think of invading portugal in force a be now more than month since letter be written certainly further reinforcement have arrived think chief will be well satisfied with what have done have sent off two letter since then fully reporting on work have be at between burgos valladolid whether have reached can not tell macwitty have one despatch for tell came nearly fortnight ago that have at time be compelled to fall back behind esla that a country beyond swarmed with party of french cavalry thought that messenger must get through that great harm might result be despatch to fall into hand of enemy well daresay will keep dick that harm will have be done by not receiving sooner now tell about escape be lodged in old convent have such luck terence be in city prison in centre of town window instead of looking out into street be on side of courtyard window be strongly barred civilian be allowed to enter prison think that even who have sort of genius for escape must have found a did simply impossible to get away lookout be certainly bad have none of advantage have at bayonne of being guarded by friendly soldier if have at salamanca not be able to make friend with spanish girl well tell about ryan gave full detail of manner in don gonzales have contrived escape be well managed indeed terence said splendidly done leon be trump ought to have be born irishman to have be in regiment know can give higher praise than on arrival in valley found that courier have returned hour before despatch expressed commander in chief extreme satisfaction with manner in terence have carried out instruction employment of force in cutting main road between valladolid valencia between latter place burgos while at same time maintained hold on country south of douro thus blocking road from salamanca to zamora valladolid be in highest degree deserving of commendation garrison of town named be kept in state of constant watchfulness so great be alarm produced that division followed that of drouet have paralyzed marmont a snow have already begun to fall among mountain be probable that will soon go into winter quarter work therefore may be considered a done a position in mountain must soon become untenable must be well if at once withdraw force into portugal moras also received despatch signed by lord wellington thanking warmly for service have rendered may say sir that yours be first case since have have honour to command british force in peninsula have received really valuable assistance from body of irregular troop be highly sensible of zeal ability have shown in cooperating with colonel o'connor service have be of extreme value to army must also express high gratification not only with conduct of men under command when in action at clemency shown to french prisoner clemency unfortunately very rare during present war will not fail to express to central spanish authority high appreciation of service have given order to officer commanding detachment of british troop at miranda must keep force together near frontier will a far a possible comply with request may make for supply for use moras be highly gratified with despatch will said stay in valley for winter will not keep more than hundred hundred fifty men with peasant will disperse to home remaining with will be inhabitant of town who must not safely return a might be denounced by spanish spy in french pay a having be out with have plenty of supply stored up here to last through winter terence at once sent off report of return acknowledgment of receipt of despatch from headquarters next day in obedience to order marched with regiment across frontier established in miranda answer came in five day be brief on receipt of colonel o'connor will march with regiment under command to pinhel there report to general crawford terence have ridden over afternoon before to valley where found that two hundred of guerilla remained fifty of be on point of leaving rest must remain with moras through winter on arrival at pinhel after three day marching reported to general crawford general be absent from head of staff received order on quartermaster department tent for men be at once given spot pointed out for encampment six regiment be heard in immediate neighbourhood among found to great joy be mayo fusilier a soon a tent be erected ration drawn party despatched to obtain straw for bedding from quartermaster department terence left herrara two major to see that troop be made comfortable then rode over with ryan to camp of fusilier be received with heartiest welcome by colonel officer in whose rank however there be several gap for regiment have suffered heavily at fuentes d'onoro so have be taken prisoner again terence captain o'grady exclaimed sure must be on purpose did anyone may get taken prisoner once when happens twice begin to look a if be fonder of french ration than of french gun did think of in light o'grady now put so will try not get caught for third time heard of return of course that have gone straight with regiment to miranda have line from dicky day before started mighty unkind have thought that of have sent word since then with nothing to do at at while have be marching countermarching now here now there now backwards now forward ever since fuentes d'onoro till one leg be ready to drop off one give someone else chance to put in word o'grady colonel said here be dying to know how o'connor slipped through hand of french again sorra word can anyone get in when tongue be once loosened if be not quiet will take away with to own quarter just ask two three men who know how to hold tongue to come up listen to story will be a silent a mouse colonel dear o'grady said humbly though must point out that o'connor being colonel like in way under order might take into head to prefer to stop with here instead of going with now terence be waiting for story why go on because a see be hard at work eating just at present have marched twenty mile morning with nothing crust of bread at starting story will keep much better than luncheon terence did not hurry over meal when have finished gave particular of escape from salamanca journey down to cadiz then round by lisbon thought there must be woman in terence o'grady exclaimed with soft tongue presentable sort of face impudence enough for whole regiment be aisy for to put comhether on poor spanish girl who have never have good luck to meet officer of mayo fusilier before sure have always said to meself that if be ever taken prisoner must not be long before good looking girl must take fancy to get out of french clutch sure if young fellow like without special recommendation except bigger share of impudence than usual must manage must be aisy indeed for man like with advantage of having lost arm in battle to get round there be shout of laughter round table for o'grady have a usual spoken with air of earnest simplicity a if proposition be laying down be beyond question must have have weary time at miranda since came back o'connor colonel said with one there wing of th suppose be to be pitied colonel doctor o'flaherty laughed may be sure that kept miranda lively in way other trust for getting into mischief of sort there be saying what might have done if have a suppose be staying for last two month at miranda in point of fact have not be case have be across frontier have be having pretty lively time of at least have for dick have spent month of inside french prison what major exclaimed be with force have be puzzling have be keeping french in such hot water a hear marmont be obliged to give up idea of invading portugal have to hurry off twenty thousand men to save salamanca valladolid from being captured nobody have be able to understand where army sprung from how be composed general idea be that division from england must have landed at oporto vigo that must have be brought round from sicily for none of letter paper said word about large force having sailed from england not soul seemed to know anything about know man on crawford staff assured that none of be in secret french officer who be brought in prisoner few day since put number down at twenty five thousand at least including said large guerilla force said that zamora have be cut off for long time that country have be ravaged post captured almost at gate of salamanca that communication have be interrupted large convoy captured between burgos valladolid that one column five thousand strong have be very severely mauled forced to fall back confirmed statement that have before heard from peasantry french deserter now there be chance of penetrating mystery have be profound puzzle to here indeed to whole army officer taken seemed to consider that regular soldier be portuguese of course be beresford troop be with down south a to other portuguese army unless wellington have got one together a secretly a got up line of torres vedras thing be absurd besides who have ever heard of portuguese carrying on such operation a without having lot of men to stiffen to set good example terence did not at once answer looking round table saw that in place of expression of amusement with previous conversation have be listened to there be now on face deep serious interest glanced at ryan who be apparently absorbed in occupation of watching smoke curling up from cigar at last said fear major can not answer question may say have have specific order to keep silence a seems that whole matter have be kept profound secret think that unless come out in other way must be justified in saying anything about think that will agree with ryan dick nodded yes agree with that must be best to say nothing about till hear that fact be known have be done once may be done again quite so dick be glad that agree with however there can be objection to giving account of gallant charge into middle of french cavalry story of imprisonment escape be sure colonel that will be source of gratification to to know one of officer dashed single handed right into midst of french squadron ryan laughed be afraid interest in matter will be diminished colonel when mention that charge be executed at night be ignorant of vicinity of french until rode into middle of there be again general laugh be on way with despatch for lord wellington went on when unfortunate business happened be unfortunate indeed ryan colonel said did not capture despatch hope indeed did colonel have fast hold of before must a much a draw sword however gained very little by for knowing that be possible might be captured despatch have be so worded that must deceive rather than inform anyone into whose hand might fall though of course have instruction to explain matter when delivered safely then proceeded to give full account of rescue from prison of salamanca be listened to with great interest be splendidly managed colonel said when have brought story to end be splendidly managed terence must not have done better well be certainly wonderfully handy at getting into scrape why have be captured twice time got away safely when gave commission terence thought that ryan must keep thing alive certainly did not anticipate that must be so successful way a have be have have very little to do with colonel ryan said know that at athlone terence be ringleader of mischief went on still be good second ryan be if position doe not really belong to o'grady be colonel o'grady said in extreme surprise looking round table with air of earnest protest when be always lecturing boy think o'grady manner of lecturing be akin to well known cry ' throw into pond boy at moment there be sound of horse drawing up in front of house be general staff one of ensign said a glanced through window table have be cleared there be sudden instant rush to carry away bottle glass to hiding place newspaper be scattered along table when door opened minute later general entered followed by staff officer of mayo fusilier presented orderly even studious appearance rose saluted a general entered hope be not disturbing gentleman general crawford said gravely with sly look of amusement stealing across rugged face be glad to see so well employed there be doubt that irish regiment be greatly maligned on two three occasion when have happened to call upon officer have uniformly found studying content of newspaper cigar too must be of unusually good quality for odour seems mingled with faint scent of what will say certainly reminds of whisky though a see that must be fancy on part however gentleman have not come in to inspect mess room to speak to colonel o'connor looked inquiringly round terence at once stepped forward again saluted general whom terence have not before met looked up down then held out hand have heard of many time colonel o'connor general hill have talked to frequently of not long since when be at headquarters lord wellington spoke to for time about from staff learned other particular that be young knew be not prepared to find one who might well pas a junior lieutenant even a ensign be regiment that formerly belonged to a on sending across to corp learned that be here thought a well to come to tell before comrade friend have received from headquarters morning request from adjutant general to tell personally when arrived extreme satisfaction that commander in chief feel at service that have rendered when be at headquarters other day be shown report that have during last six week sent in be therefore in position to appreciate work have done be not too much to say that have saved portugal from invasion have paralyzed movement of french have given to commander in chief month in to make preparation for taking field in earnest in spring have colonel o'connor told what have be doing said suddenly turning to colonel corcoran general in answer to question said that a seemed matter have be kept secret did not feel justified in saying anything on subject until received distinct intimation that there be further occasion for remaining silent did well sir general said again turning to terence acted with prudence discretion have with much dash bravery distinguished conduct a however army have now gone into winter quarter a general order will appear today speaking of service have be commissioned purposely to convey to lord be approval there be occasion for further mystery on subject force whose doings have paralyzed french broken up communication compelled marmont to detach twenty thousand men to assist at least equal force in salamanca zamora valladolid valencia have consisted solely of men of colonel o'connor regiment about equal number of guerilla commanded by partisan moras need not tell that supreme amount of activity energy prudence united must have be employed thus to disarrange plan of french general commanding army of one hundred thousand men by band of two battalion of portuguese couple of thousand undisciplined guerilla be feat other general in british army might well be proud to have performed too much praise can not be bestowed upon colonel o'connor three british officer acting under command of whose service together with of portuguese officer have most warmly spoken in report now colonel see that there be on mess table dark ring may possibly have be caused by glass doubtless be not very far away have doubt that when have left will very heartily drink health of former comrade must say comrade for hear that captain ryan be among be ryan stepped forward congratulate also sir said colonel o'connor have reported that have rendered great service since be attached to a adjutant have introduced many change have added to efficiency discipline of regiment staff a well a will be very pleased to make personal acquaintance of colonel o'connor will be glad if will dine with today if colonel corcoran will accompany tomorrow will inspect minho regiment at eleven o'clock will then introduce to lieutenant colonel two major who have so well carried out instruction so saying shook hand with colonel terence ryan with acknowledgment of salute of other officer left room with staff if bullet doe not cut short career in of adventure said to colonel corcoran who have accompanied have extraordinary future before face be singular mixture of good temper energy resolute determination there be many gallant young officer in army be seldom that reckless bravery enterprise be joined a in case with prudence head to plan can not be more than one twenty so there be saying what may be when reach forty trant be excellent leader have never accomplished tithe of what have be done by lad general having left room officer crowded round terence few word be said for be still so surprised at what have heard a to be incapable of doing more than shake warmly by hand pat on shoulder ryan came in for share in demonstration colonel returned at once after having seen general ride off faith terence said if justice be done must make general for putting into army have mind to write to lord wellington put in claim for promotion on ground what be doing o'grady broke off a officer walked round round terence scrutinizing attentively a if have be unknown animal be trying to make sure colonel that be really terence o'connor whom have cuffed many time when be bit of spalpeen with respect for rank a discovered colonel in matter of bird fastened in plume of shako look like yet have doubt be terence o'connor will swear to on testiments think can do o'grady terence laughed see have done credit to instruction have always told must make man of be instruction have done how wish lad went on with sudden change of voice that dear father have be here day faith must have be proud man ah be cruel bullet hit at vimiera ay may well say that o'grady colonel agreed have heard from lately terence colonel be more than four month since have have letter from of course always writes to to headquarters a only stopped there few hour on way from lisbon to join regiment stupidly forgot to ask if there be letter for of course there have be opportunity for to be forwarded to since however will know in day two have arrived here will be sure to send on at once now let hear about o'connor for at present have heard nothing vague rumour about doings of northern army of yours beyond what general have just said first colonel if will permit to say so o'grady put in must propose that general crawford suggestion a to first thing to be done must be carried out that whisky keg must be produced again have good stock terence enough to carry nearly through winter then must be good stock indeed o'grady terence laughed see general be too sharp for that be a scotchman have naturally good nose for whisky be capital fellow hot tempered obstinate a undoubtedly be be a popular with division a general out here know that if there be fighting to be done be sure to have share more except when roused be cheery pleasant take great interest in men welfare doe that can to make a comfortable a possible though a generally form advanced guard of army necessarily suffer more than rest of by time tumbler be brought out from cupboard into have be so hastily placed on general arrival dozen black bottle be produced jug of water terence health be drunk with honour three cheer be added for dicky ryan then sat down to listen to terence story chapter ciudad rodrigo before o'connor begin colonel said have better lay on table in front of pocket map got from lisbon for last year after o'connor have lectured on advantage of knowing country can tell terence have be of small use to since left torres vedras think that even o'grady must pas examination a to road position along frontier with credit to think gentleman that who have not got map with must do well to fetch will then be able to follow colonel be story get to know good deal more about country where hope will be fighting next spring than must in other way several of officer left room soon returned with map feel almost like schoolmaster terence laughed indeed a work consisted almost entirely of rapid marching must scarcely be able to follow without map may really be useful if campaign across there to know something of road position of town village then proceeded to relate have taken place first describing incident of battle work among mountain understand said that order be not so much to do injury to enemy a to deceive a to amount of force to lead to believe to be very much stronger than really be must only be done by rapid march a will see main object be to cut line of communication at same time to show in force at point considerable distance apart to effect on several occasion marched upwards of sixty mile in day upwards of forty several day in succession feat must hardly be accomplished except by men at once robust well accustomed to mountain work trained to long march a of regiment have be since be first raised then taking out copy of report gave in much fuller detail than in report account of movement of various column flying party during first ten day then more briefly operation between burgos valladolid ending up by saying see colonel there be really nothing out of way in have advantage of having great number of men who knew country intimately cutting of communication exaggerated report brought to by peasant maintenance of post round salamanca zamora while be operating near burgos valladolid impressed commander of town with such idea of strength such uneasiness a to communication that after reverse to column none of ever ventured to attack in earnest be doubt true colonel said to have done when with reinforcement sent up very strong garrison at four of town to say nothing of division of burgos have forty thousand men disposable be task wanted head well screwed on can see how did must be very different thing to doing however have taught great deal of geography of country between frontier burgos ought to be useful if have received order afternoon to march with regiment to tordesillas for example must have known more where place stood by what road be to go to than if have ordered to march to jericho now must be able to go straight for by shortest line must cross road at point at be not likely to be attacked throw out strong party to protect flank till have passed must feel be not stumbling along in dark just trusting to luck now colonel must be off to own quarter

time to close that may go with own letter boy be waiting to carry on horseback to post office four mile away so goodbye very affectionate cousin mary next two month passed quietly at pinhel operation continued to be carried on at various point although several encounter of minor importance took place combatant be engaged rather in endeavouring to feel other position to divine other intention than to bring about serious battle marmont believed wellington to be stronger than be while latter rather underestimated french strength thus there be on side movement of advance retirement during time have elapsed since battle of fuentes d'onoro albuera badajos have be again besieged by british ineffectually in august wellington taking advantage of marmont absence in south advanced established blockade of ciudad rodrigo have led to fighting activity of general hill serious menace to communication effected by terence portuguese guerilla have prevented french from gathering in sufficient strength to drive blockading force across frontier again from carrying out napoleon plan for invasion of portugal wellington on part be still unable to move owing to absence of transport manner in portuguese government thwarted at point leaving demand that road must be kept in good order unattended to starving own troop to extent that be altogether unfit for action placing obstacle to calling out of new levy in way hindering plan obtained little assistance encouragement at home military chest be empty muleteer who kept up supply of food for army be six month in arrears of pay british troop be also unpaid badly supplied with clothes shoe while money store be still being sent in unlimited quantity to spanish junta where did good whatever might a well have be thrown into sea in spite of difficulty army be daily improving in efficiency men be now inured to hardship of kind have in three pitched battle proved superior to french have absolute confidence in commander much be due to effort of lord fitzroy somerset wellington military secretary who by entering into communication with commander of brigade regiment most of whom be quite young men for greater part of army be of recent creation be enabled not only to learn something of state of discipline in regiment greatly to encourage stimulate effort of officer who felt that doings of regiment be observed at headquarters merit must be recognized without favouritism that failure in discipline morale of under order must be noted against twice during two month terence have be sent for to headquarters in order that might give lord fitzroy minute information concerning various road locality point out natural obstacle where obstinate defence might be made by enemy must be turned to advantage by advancing army route map that have sent be frequently turned to fully explained second visit took place in last week in november on arrival military secretary began conversation by handing gazette to arrived yesterday colonel o'connor congratulate that upon very strong recommendation of lord wellington be gazetted to majority now that position be so well assured there will be no longer occasion for to remain nominally attached to headquarter staff of course be before came out that be done learned that intention be that must not act upon staff be to be merely honorary position without pay in order to add to authority independence when happen to come in contact with portuguese officer of higher rank be so sir be very grateful for kindness that lord wellington showed in thus enabling to wear uniform of staff be of great assistance to at time indeed be deeply conscious of kindness with have on occasion treated for recommending for promotion must have be personally glad lord fitzroy went on to have have permanently attached to staff a knowledge of country might at time be of great value of zeal energy have given more than ample proof spoke of matter to general morning agreed with that must be great addition to staff upon other hand step must very seriously diminish efficiency of regiment that raised have since commanded regiment have lately rendered quite exceptional service under command reckon to be a valuable in fighting line a if be one of own be more than can be said for other portuguese battalion although of have of late fought remarkably well say that colonel herrara aided by three english officer who by way be promoted in gazette two ensign to rank of lieutenant mr ryan to of captain must not keep regiment in state of efficiency so far a fighting be concerned without leading must not be relied upon to act for detached service such a have performed under thank sir of course must be great honour to to be on general staff must be very sorry to leave regiment frankly think that must get on well without colonel herrara be ready to bestow infinite pain on work think that must do thing on own responsibility bull macwitty have proved zealous active can always rely upon to carry out order to letter doubt if must get on a well with herrara a do with be very glad to hear that mr ryan have got step latter make admirable adjutant if have to choose one of four for command must select have not be very long with regiment be not known personally must not think have same influence with portuguese officer men moreover be afraid that having be in command so long must miss independence if have only to carry out order of others can quite understand that military secretary said with smile can quite realize fascination of life of partisan leader especially when have trant others have not body of men whom have trained upon whom can absolutely rely can still of course wear uniform of field officer on general staff so will have very little alteration to make save by adding proper insignia of rank will write line authorizing to do so now let have turn at map may tell in confidence that if opportunity offer will at once convert blockade of ciudad into siege hope to carry before enemy can march with sufficient force to relief to do so must naturally collect available force from salamanca zamora valladolid must probably obtain reinforcement from madrid estremadura want to ascertain a far a possible best mean of checking advance of of troop by blowing up of bridge throwing forward of force a regiment to seize defile other point must be held for day two enemy column thus delayed even twenty four hour might be of importance understand sir of course pass between madrid avila might be retained for little time especially if defender have few gun must be liable to be taken in rear by force at avila where there be when went down south over five thousand men a to troop coming from north must doubtless march on salamanca from town must cross huebra yeltes so near source that difficulty must be caused by blowing up of bridge if exist pas over sierra de gatta on south of ciudad might be defended by small force without difficulty map be now got out matter gone into minutely after hour conversation lord fitzroy said thank colonel o'connor of information that have given will assuredly be very useful if besiege ciudad from what hear there be good many change being made in french command napoleon seems about to engage in campaign with russia be likely to draw off certain portion of force here while change be being made must seem to offer good opportunity for to strike blow on last day of december terence received following order colonel o'connor will draw six day ration from commissariat at daybreak tomorrow march to river aqueda on following day will ford river will post along line of yeltes from junction with huebra to mountain will prevent person party crossing from side be of highest importance that intelligence of movement of army must be sent either by garrison of ciudad by peasantry to salamanca when provision be exhausted be authorized to hire cart send in to army round ciudad if possible must obtain supply from country near be authorized to purchase provision to send in account voucher for such purchase to paymaster department hurrah ryan exclaimed on reading order thing be going to move at last mean of course that army be going to besiege ciudad at once that be to prevent french from getting news of until be too late for to relieve for last month gun ammunition have be arriving at almeida thought that weary time of waiting be drawing to end be glad indeed terence must say that be afraid that must not be moving until spring will go in say goodbye to fellow yes may a well mind say where be going to only that be ordered away suppose that regiment will know anything about till within hour of time march there can be doubt that be serious business ciudad held out for week against massena with marmont within few day march with army at least a strong a ours will be tough business indeed to take before can come up to relief can well understand that be important that will know nothing about siege till be too late for to arrive in time have come in to say goodbye colonel terence said a ryan entered mess room of mayo fusilier that evening where be off to o'connor well sir mind mentioning in here must go further chief knowing what be capable of proposes will make rapid march to madrid seize city bring king joseph back prisoner there be roar of laughter terence boy captain o'grady said be hardly mission worthy of fighting man like expect that be hiding something from that real idea be that must traverse spain france enter germany seize boney carry off with to england dare not tell whether be right not o'grady thing of sort must not even be whispered about be wonderfully good guess that have made when be over will be able to take credit for having divined what be up for mercy sake talk about keep a silent a grave if anyone must ask have become of pretend that know nothing about be going o'connor colonel said when laughter have subsided yes colonel march tomorrow morning daresay will hear of before many day be over may perhaps be able to make even closer guess than o'grady a to what be doing be heartily glad that be off be now at full strength again most of wounded have rejoined must have filled up vacancy dozen time over portuguese know always manage to get food for men somehow be more than can be said for other portuguese regiment though of trant pack be better off than beresford regular then too think like fighting now that feel that be match for french man for man get fair share of at rate three month that have be idle have be useful a new recruit know work a well a others then know how much longer be going to stop in bastely hole o'grady asked well will tell much o'grady fancy before day week will have work to do that be likely to be hot be comfort terence dear boy have little pity on finish off business by yourselves remember that have come long way that will be mighty hard for if be to clear french out of spain leave nothing for to do to bury dead escort army a prisoner to port will bear in mind o'grady forget past know how desperately grumbled at rolica because regiment be not in how got wish at vimiera lost arm in consequence so even if do a say push french out of spain will have consolation of knowing that will be able to go back to ireland without leaving more piece of behind there be something in terence o'grady said gravely think that when be over will go on half pay there may a well be a much of left a possible to enjoy be ungrateful country be serving in spite of have done for loss of arm into bargain here be still captain though maybe be near top of list still be captain be here be two gossoons like dick ryan one of marching about field officer other captain be heart breaking entirely one of most zealous officer in service be never luck have have from day be born will come day never fear o'grady perhaps may not be so far off a fear well colonel will just take glass with for luck then say good night for have good many thing to see after must be up very early so a to get tent packed handed over to draw ration eat breakfast be off by seven be close upon hour when regiment marched be known that there be french troop west of huebra after fording aqueda force halted until then moved forward reached huebra at midnight lay down to sleep until daybreak then extended along bank of yeltes a far a source among mountain thus cutting road from ciudad to salamanca north distance to be watched be twenty mile a river be in many place unfordable be necessary only to place patrol here while strong party be posted not only on main road at point where by road peasant track led down to bank on day bridge be thrown across aqueda six mile below ciudad for passage of artillery owing to difficulty of carriage be five day later before artillery ammunition must be brought over be only done by aid of cart wellington have caused to be quietly constructed during preceding three month on th light division pack portuguese contingent forded aqueda three mile above ciudad making long detour took up position behind hill called great teson remained quiet during day garrison believing that have only arrived to enable force have long blockaded town to render investment more complete measure of defence be taken at night light division fell suddenly on redoubt of san francisco on great teson assault

be to penetrate by breach colonel o'toole with portuguese be to cross river to aid right attack while pack portuguese be to make false attack on san jago gate on other side of town to convert into real assault if defence must prove feeble french scarcely appeared conscious that critical moment be at hand have raised breastwork along top of breach be perfectly prepared for assault when signal be given attack be begun on right th th th regiment rushed from convent of santa cruz leapt down into fausse braye made way to foot of great breach reached at same moment a rest of third division who have run down from small teson terrible fire be opened upon undismayed by shell grape musketry from rampart house drove french behind new work here however enemy stood so stoutly that progress must be made unable to cross obstacle troop nevertheless maintained position although suffering terrible loss from french fire equally furious be attack on small breach by light division after few minute fighting succeeded in bursting through rank of defender then turning to right fought way along rampart until reached top of great breach french there wavered on finding that flank be turned third division seizing opportunity hurled upon breach be also won be attack be successful on other side of town pack portuguese meeting with resistance have blown open gate of san jago have also entered town here terrible scene took place british troop sullied victory by wildest most horrible excess have forgotten forgiven treatment have experienced at hand of spanish before after battle of talavera when be almost starved while spaniard have abundant supply yet left british wounded unattended to die of starvation in hospital when evacuated city from time animosity against spaniard have be vastly greater than feeling against french who have always behaved a gallant enemy have treated wounded prisoner with greatest kindness now long pent up feeling burst out murder rapine violence of sort raged for hour wholly without check officer who endeavoured to protect hapless inhabitant be shot down command be unheeded abominable atrocity be perpetrated share of blame rest with wellington staff who have taken no measure whatever for maintaining order in town when possession must be gained of provision must never be omitted in case of assault portuguese whose animosity against spaniard be equally bitter imitated example of british comrade fire broke out in several place added to horror of scene castle be still held by french troop having retreated there a soon a breach have be carried there be not therefore even excuse of excitement of street fighting to be made for conduct of victor in vain terence officer endeavoured to keep men together by three four scattered down side street to join

pistol have be discharged yet bull cut down one fellow who tried to climb over barricade otherwise blood have be shed on side help be coming now one of portuguese officer be admitted with twenty four men that have picked up others came in rapidly within quarter of hour three hundred men be assembled be sober looked thoroughly ashamed of a be formed up in courtyard terence went down to said word of blame now men said have to retrieve character half of will post yourselves at window from ground floor to top of house be not to show yourselves till receive order to do so be not to load gun a appear at window point down into street officer will post five at window rest of be at once to clear away furniture in hall when receive order throw open door pour out forming across street a do so captain ryan will be in command of be not to load to clear street with bayonet if of soldier be too drunk to get out of way knock down with butt end of musket if rush at use bayonet went round house saw that five men be in readiness at window looking into street ordered to leave door open pistol will be fired from first landing said that will be signal then show yourselves at once waited until ryan party have cleared away furniture then went out on to balcony addressed crowd of soldier who be standing uncertain what step to take next many of having already gone off in search of plunder elsewhere listen to men shouted hitherto have refrained from employing force against men who after behaving a hero be now acting like madman will do so no longer will give two minute to clear off anyone who remains at end of time will have to take chance derisive shout threat arose in reply turned round nodded to count who be standing at door of room with pistol in hand raised fired in moment soldier appeared at window menacing crowd below with rifle at same moment door opened portuguese poured out with ryan at head trampling over pile raised in front of there be moment of stupefied dismay amongst soldier hitherto none have believed that there be in house with exception of few officer sudden appearance of hundred men at window number pouring out through door took so completely by surprise that there be not even thought of resistance men who have faced terror of deadly breach turned fled save few leaning stupidly against opposite wall none remained by time ryan have formed up two line across street of advanced short distance be at once joined by defender of other house by at window do take command of one line bull of other macwitty think that will be meddled with must of return attack will first try persuade to go away quietly if still attack will at once fire upon herrara will send out officer bring men in at back door a before will soon have greater part of regiment here with can hold street if necessary against force be likely to attack in hour indeed more than fifteen hundred men have be rallied while two line hundred strong be formed across street eighty yard apart rest be drawn up in solid body in centre terence order being that if attacked in force half of be to at once enter house on side of street to man window felt sure however that sight of so strong force must be sufficient to prevent rioter interfering with soldier being for most part too drunk to act together with common object indeed proved to be case party at time came down street on seeing dark line of troop drawn up retired immediately on being hailed by english officer slunk off under belief that large body of fresh troop have entered town hour later mounted officer followed by five six others orderly rode up what troop be officer asked minho portuguese regiment general bull answered commanded by colonel o'connor general rode on line opened staff passed through terence who have posted in balcony so a to have view of whole street at once ran down two of men with torch followed on approaching at once recognized officer a general barnard who commanded one of brigade of light division so regiment have remained firm colonel o'connor general said be sorry to say sir that did not at first scattered like rest of troop officer for time defended two large house from attack of soldiery matter became very serious then sent out of officer who soon collected three hundred men sufficed to disperse rioter without being obliged to fire shot officer then again went out now between fifteen sixteen hundred men be here be glad that have come sir for felt in great difficulty be hard to stay here inactive when be aware that town be being sacked atrocity of kind perpetrated upon other hand dared not undertake responsibility of attempting to clear street such attempt must probably end in desperate fighting might have resulted in heavy loss on side have caused such ill feeling between british portuguese troop a to seriously interfere with general disposition for campaign doubt have taken best course must be pursued colonel o'connor must take on responsibility of doing something appearance at head of regiment will have effect upon men of light division who be sober will doubt rally round though hitherto effort have be altogether powerless officer will of course join at once fear that many have be killed in trying to protect inhabitant now that have at least got nucleus of good troop have doubt that will be successful have torch there be supply of in house sir get lighted divide among men a soon a have done form regiment into column be to load sir general said shortly instruct officer that one be to fire without order that sound of firing at head of column be not to be considered a signal for rest to open fire though may be necessary to shoot of insubordinate scoundrel by way think will be best that only leading company must load rest have bayonet can use if attacked forty torch be handed over by count be lighted distributed along line ten being carried by leading company have bugle colonel yes sir there be one to company let come to front play assembly a march on now will ride at head by side sir dismount one of orderly take horse by time preparation be completed have be joined by nearly two hundred more men just before started terence said must not

only want to command men can rely upon loud chorus of lament entreaty rose from men be a painful to a be to terence went on raising hand for silence how proud must have be if morning must have met general said that regiment have be good enough to praise so highly several time have proved trustworthy instead of having to report man deserted officer that many continued evil work of pillage worse to end many of men wept loudly others dropped upon knee implored terence to forgive have already instructed two major what be to be done twelve captain now stepped forward colonel bull said in loud voice must be heard over square officer of minho regiment thoroughly agree with in that have said feel deeply disgrace conduct of men have brought upon trust that will have mercy on be ready to

marshal to be shot operation took upwards of two hour at herrara suggestion table be brought out crucifix placed upon man a came up after emptying out pocket swore solemnly laying hand upon table that have given up spoil have collected terence must not help smiling at scene regiment presented before men began to file past small proportion of men stripped off coat unwound from body roll of silk costly veil other stuff of have taken possession be laid down by side of blanket on pile of gold silver coin great number of ring brooch bracelet have accumulated by time whole have passed by money

away regiment be by time formed up again terence addressing told of order that have given saying that a regiment have made compensation in power have rid of spoil of people whom have professedly come to aid must now look spaniard in face again just a have concluded staff officer rode up lord wellington wish to speak to colonel said have be looking about for everywhere regiment seemed to have vanished then must leave work of inspecting kit to herrara will see that article be unfolded closely examined place man in whose kit anything be discovered under arrest at once trust that will not find anything if do place strong guard over prisoner with loaded musket order to shoot one of who try to escape walking by side of staff officer for have returned horse lent by general barnard accompanied to house in great square where lord wellington have taken up quarter chapter gratitude regiment have be distinguishing again colonel o'connor have heard from three source first general barnard reported to that other officer be wholly unable to restrain troop from villainous work last night until found regiment drawn up in perfect order be able with to put end to disorder everywhere reigning in second place count de montego marquis de valoroso two of wealthiest noble in province have called upon to return thanks for inestimable service a expressed rendered by colonel o'connor officer in defending house protecting life honour of family from assault of soldier said that defender consisted entirely of officer how be that be sorry to say that men be at first infected by general spirit of disorder left alone by ourselves thought that must not do anything better than save from spoliation two fine mansion happened to be at spot where have be left have to stand sharp siege for two three hour abstained a far a possible from using arm think that only two three of soldier be wounded however must have have to use pistol in earnest in short time have not sent out several of officer by back entrance of house be not long in finding persuading to return to duty couple of hundred men a soon a sallied out affair be at end soldier fled officer be sent out again when hour later general barnard came up have seventeen hundred in readiness for action arrival relieved of heavy responsibility of deciding what course have better be adopted yes told so think that acted very wisely in holding men back till arrived for nothing must have be more unfortunate than conflict in street between british portuguese troop there be doubt have not be for regiment disgraceful scene of last night must have be very much worse than be must be glad if will convey thanks to thank sir will be obliged if will allow to say that regret to hear that regiment in placed confidence must have at first behaved so badly that have retrieved conduct by subsequent behaviour have acted a must have expected of have be speaking very severely to morning be afraid that effect of word must be altogether lost be to report commendation of conduct without expression of blame lord wellington smiled do a like colonel o'connor however regiment will be placed in order today a exception to severe censure passed upon troop who entered town last night do really think that will behave better time be sure will sir threatened to have three hundred who have not joined when general barnard arrived transferred to regiment be only upon solemn promise by whole of officer guaranteeing conduct in future forgave moreover article taken in money jewel dress have be given up have sent to syndic money for distribution among sufferer jewellery other thing to be reclaimed by from whom be taken kit be being examined thoroughly when came away think that can say with certainty that single stolen article will be found in have done very well sir very well influence with men be surprising regiment will be quartered in convent of san jose other division will move in afternoon take place of st rd brigade regiment therefore may consider high honour that will be retained here daresay that will not be long before find work for to do again lord somerset will give order at once to take possession of convent terence returned to regiment in high spirit work of inspection be still going on at conclusion colonel herrara reported that single article of plunder have be found be gratified that be so herrara said now let regiment form up in hollow square again men went on have message for from lord wellington repeated that have suggested thus see men that conduct of who at once obeyed order returned to rank have caused misconduct of others to be forgiven lord wellington have still confidence that regiment will behave well in future fact that plunder have be given up to be restored to owner have of course effect in inducing to believe hope that man will take lesson to heart that misdeed of few may bring disgrace on whole regiment that will in future hing to forfeit name that minho regiment have gained for good conduct a well a for bravery loud cheer broke from regiment who then marched to convent of san jose took up quarter there two hour later two spanish noble called upon terence count de montego introduced companion have only just heard where be quartered went on have be trying in vain morning to find not soldier of regiment be to be seen in street although questioned many officer none must say where be went off so suddenly last night have opportunity of expressing gratitude to officer said enough more than enough last night count terence replied be glad indeed that be able to protect house lord wellington informed that have called upon spoken highly of service have be able to render pray say more about can quite understand what feel can assure that thanks be due to for having done duty a british officer gentleman on so lamentable admit disgraceful occasion wife daughter of marquis of valoroso be most anxious to see thank officer be too frightened agitated last night to say aught indeed a say scarcely noticed feature can bring officer round now be sorry to say can not do senor have to see after arrangement comfort of men getting of ration cooking so on tomorrow will be sure be glad to pay visit can come can not colonel yes be at liberty now count will be happy to pay respect to senora more hear marquis said a walked along together of event of last night more deeply feel service that have rendered be unable to understand how be that soldier must behave with such outrageous violence to ally be very disgraceful greatly to be regretted senor be bound to say that a have now gone through four campaign remember conduct of spanish authority to troop during march to talavera stay there on retreat be by mean surprised that among soldier who be unable to draw distinction between people authority there must be deep lasting hatred there be such hatred for french men fought battle of talavera when weak with hunger while spaniard who engaged to supply with provision be feasting men be neglected starved in hospital must have died to man have not happily for french arrived treated with greatest humanity kindness soldier forget sort of thing know that for last three year promise of spanish authority have never once be kept that have have to suffer greatly from want of transport store promised can of course discriminate between people at large authority soldier can make such distinction deeply a deplore what have happened here must own that soldier have at least excuse for conduct two spaniard be silent can not gainsay statement count de montego said indeed word can be too strong for conduct of central provincial junta then senor how be that people rise sweep away choose honest resolute men in place be difficult question to answer colonel may be said why people when ill governed destroy tyrant possibly because a rule tyrant have army at back here such army a there be although nominally under order of junta be practically led by own general must obey rather than junta however be matter for spanish people alone although have suffered cruelly by effect of system please remember be not in smallest degree defending conduct of troop only trying to show that have at least excuse for regarding spaniard a foe rather than a ally that have a considered long list of wrong to avenge there be truth in say colonel unfortunately men like ourselves who be natural leader of people hold aloof from petty provincial struggle leave public office to be filled with greedy adventurer have be accustomed to consider work of kind beneath country be paying dearly for now trust when war be over seeing how country have suffered by abstention from politics from affair of province will put forward to aid in regeneration of spain by time have arrived at door of count house street have be to extent cleared shattered door broken window portion of costly furniture household article of sort still showed how terrible have be destruction of previous night large number of poorer class be at work clearing road a city authority have be ordered by lord wellington to restore order in thoroughfare count led way up to drawing room countess three daughter rose introduced brave defender to last night count said in half darkened room in confusion alarm prevailed must have have so slight view of that doubt

must have suffered have not be for interposition be delighted to have be of service to senora be duty be very pleasurable one can assure pray to say more about how be that speak spanish so well senor countess asked after daughter have shyly expressed gratitude to terence owe chiefly to muleteer of salamanca be prisoner there last year accompanied for month after have made escape from prison also owe much to guerilla chief moras with whom acted for six week last autumn have learned little of language before speaking portuguese fluently naturally picked up without great difficulty name be not unknown to colonel count said living so close to frontier a do naturally know much of what pass in portugal heard spoken of a famous leader of strong portuguese regiment seems to have be in thick of fighting heard that have be taken prisoner by french at battle of fuentes d'onoro yes have misfortune to be captured by be sent to salamanca escaped by aid of girl who sold fruit in prison muleteer took with on journey to cadiz thence came round to lisbon by ship seem very young to have seen so much service if will excuse saying so colonel terence smiled have have great luck senor extraordinary luck ah colonel know how well have deserved luck a call must never have be in command of such regiment if have not done something very much out of way to attract attention of commander be not appointed to regiment raised be to say came upon number of portuguese who have be called out for service who have leader arm being anxious to fight for country asked to be leader accepted offer found docile obedient with aid of two british trooper with spanish officer twelve of trooper established something like order discipline a be fortunate in first affair with enemy have faith in be able to raise to point of discipline be think now quite equal to of own regiment seeing that have made useful with corp be confirmed in command obtained rank of colonel in portuguese service be now major in own hope senor later on will tell story of of adventure be assured that house in be yours that be not for mere curiosity that must hear story that a will ever retain grateful memory of what have done

frequently spent evening there host introduced to many of leading people in town spanish general carlos d'espagna be appointed governor of ciudad paper having be discovered showing that many of inhabitant have acted a french emissary executed without mercy so rigorous however be measure that be felt that more than sufficient blood have be shed accordingly several british deserter found in town be pardoned many others of men have fallen fighting desperately in breach believing that there be hope of mercy being extended to if taken prisoner in siege ally lost men officer among whom be general crawford mackinnon killed general vandeleur badly wounded lord wellington be created duke of ciudad rodrigo by spaniard earl of wellington by english french loss be killed wounded prisoner immense store of ammunition gun thanks to vigilance with minho regiment have guarded line of ford of yeltes news of siege be received by marmont in time for to interfere with bridge over aqueda have be thrown across on st of january siege began on th even on th nothing be known at salamanca of advance of british army be not until th three day after town have fallen that news that siege have begun reached marmont at valladolid have ordered army to concentrate on salamanca be not until th that men be collected there on following day news arrived of fall of ciudad in meantime large number of labourer be being employed in repairing strengthening fortification of town while wellington laboured in making preparation for siege of badajoz however progressed slowly owing to refusal of portuguese government to supply transport for gun to furnish facility for supply of food for army wellington maintained headquarters on coa until first week in march then moved south with greater part of army ciudad being left entirely in hand of spaniard general supplying governor with provision store explaining to object intention of new work very strong force be left to guard frontier of portugal from invasion by marmont men of whom be portuguese being scattered along line guarding pass minho regiment being ordered to take post again at pinhel terence left ciudad with reluctance have along be treated a dear friend in house of two spanish nobleman spent most of evening at one other of have be obliged to tell in full detail adventure since joined army rescue of cousin from convent

be feeble testimony indeed of what feel be joint present of marquise daughter of girl gave small case containing superb diamond ring of great value then large case containing magnificent parure of diamond emerald senor be for future wife will value be sure not so much for what may be worth a testimony of gratitude of six spanish lady for inestimable service that rendered perhaps will have special value in eye inasmuch a stone formed small part of jewel of two family that saved from plunder have of course have reset there be difficulty in getting done for at present ours be believe only jewel in ciudad dear countess terence said much moved like taking so valuable present what be in comparison to what have done for senor please suppose that have seriously diminished store nowhere believe have lady such jewel a have in spain few family can boast of finer one than of marquise can assure that will value jewel more when think that of companion will be worn by wife of gentleman who have preserved more than life be royal gift indeed herrara said when terence showed jewel must be afraid to say what be worth many of old spanish family posse marvellous jewel relic of day when spaniard owned wealth of indie spoil of europe must imagine that must have be among finest stone in possession of family if be colonel must take very first opportunity occurs of sending to england may be sure that will do so herrara be not sort of thing to be carried about in cavalry wallet have other place to stow a soon a arrive at pinhel will get strong box made to hold two case hand over to paymaster there to be sent down to lisbon by next convoy sent home money did not want to keep by when be at pinhel last two other portuguese regiment brigade of british infantry be stationed at pinhel in readiness at moment to march to almeida guarda must marmont make forward movement be probable enough for be evident by concentration of troop at salamanca valladolid that have intention of marching south intended to leave to soult with army of estremadura castile andalusia to relieve badajoz from time to time news came from that town siege have begun on th of march attack being made on fortified hill called picurina at first progress be slow incessant rain fell ground became swamp operation have several time to be suspended while phillipon brave officer who commanded garrison made numerous sortie from town with more le success on night of th assault be made on strong fort on picurina be captured after desperate fighting loss of officer men killed wounded on following day trench be opened for attack upon town assailant laboured night day on th breach have be effected in work called trinidad be to be attacked by th light division castle be at same time to be assailed by picton division while general power portuguese be to make feint on other side of guadiana san roque be to be stormed by force employed in trench enterprise be well nigh desperate breach have not be sufficiently cleared be known that enemy have thrown up strong intrenchment behind most of gun be still in position to sweep breach week at least must have be occupied in preparing way for assault wellington be forced here a at ciudad to fight against time soult be close at hand british have not sufficient force to give battle at same time to continue siege of town be therefore necessary to carry place at once at cost of life to abandon fruit of effort have be made have wellington instruction be carried out there must have be occasion for assault to have be delivered until breach be greatly extended intrenchment destroyed gun silenced portuguese ministry however have thwarted at turn siege must not be commenced until fortnight after date fixed by wellington fortnight delay cost life of british soldier four of assault on breach failed on crest of phillipon have erected massive stockade thickly bristling with sabre blade on upper part of breach plank similarly studded have be laid while on side vast number of shell barrel of powder faggot soaked in oil other missile combustible be piled in readiness for hurling down on assailant while soldier behind defence have be supplied with four musket never did british soldier fight with such dogged bravery a be here evinced again again dashed up breach centre of volcano of fire shell burst among cannon poured volley of grape through rank french plied with musketry fireball lit up scene a if by day mine exploded under foot yet again again reached terrible breastwork effort to climb be fruitless number of in front be

sternly silently murderous fire be maintained by enemy picton however have gained possession of castle walker with command have captured bastion of san vincenti part of command fought way along battlement towards breach while marched through town finding that town have be entered at several point defender of breach gave way soldier poured into town here even more hideous scene of murder rapine be perpetrated than at ciudad rodrigo went on for two day night absolutely unchecked have never be satisfactorily explained why after event in former town precaution be taken by general commanding to prevent recurrence of scene brought disgrace on british army for can not be held blameless five thousand men officer be killed wounded in siege of three thousand five hundred fell in assault next three month passed without action of importance discipline of army have a might have be expected deteriorated greatly a consequence of unbridled license permitted to soldier after capture of two fortress absence of punishment for excess there committed lord wellington complained bitterly in letter home of insubordination of troop of outrage committed upon peasantry especially by detached party of general disobedience of order who have permitted license excess to be carried on unchecked unpunished can not be considered largely responsible for natural consequence of such laxity in may heavy rain prevented movement on side except that town of almaraz most important position at bridge across tagus permitting soult marmont to join hand be captured by surprise by general hill work have be considered almost impregnable being carried by assault in course of hour be one of most brilliant exploit of war wellington have moved north be again on aqueda on th of june rain having

by moore army nearly four year before what fun be terence ryan said when frightened place out of very sens by report that french be entering town be very well dick think that be just a much frightened a spaniard be when saw how thing have succeeded that troop be called out there be saying what must have done to have found out who started report very least thing must have happened must have be to be

funniest thing ever saw thing have changed since then terence be afraid have quite done with joke of sort must hope so dick think can answer for be by mean sure a to like ryan said indignantly be always leader in mischief believe must be now if have chance know terence replied little more seriously than have before spoken have be through wonderful number of adventure since then pretend have not enjoyed in something of same spirit in enjoyed fun used to have together see have have immense deal of responsibility have two thousand men under though bull macwitty be good men so far a carrying out of order go be still too much trooper seldom make suggestion never really discus plan suggest so that responsibility of life of men really rest entirely upon shoulder have be only when have be separated from a when be prisoner have be able to enjoy adventure in same sort of way that used to do together little thought then terence that in three year half for be about what be must be captain major for count portuguese rank one way other of course have have two more year regimental work than have have must have be much better for if have have longer spell of too of course have be extraordinarily fortunate have be very jolly be sure must have be better for to have have more experience a subaltern before began well can not say see terence at rate have have lot more regimental work than most officer for have to form regiment teach discipline everything else think that must have done so well if have be ground down into regular regimental pattern have come to think that powder pipe clay be actual indispensables in turning out soldier quiet time at salamanca lasted little over fortnight for in beginning of july lord wellington heard that in obedience to king joseph reiterated order marmont having received reinforcement be preparing to recross douro that soult be on point of advancing into portugal that king with large army be on way to join latter indeed be not to have moved till king joined believing that own army be ample for purpose eager to gain victory unhampered by king presence suddenly crossed at tordesillas be only by masterly movement sharp fight at castile that wellington succeeded in concentrating army on aqueda british general drew up army in order of battle on height of vallesa position be strong one marmont knew country perfectly instead of advancing to attack started at daybreak on th marched rapidly up river crossed before opposition must be offered then marched for tormes by movement have turned wellington right flank be a near salamanca a be british have in power unless checked to place on road between salamanca ciudad so to cut line of retreat seeing position thus turned wellington made corresponding movement two army marched along line of hill parallel with other gun on side occasionally firing day long be short distance apart at moment battle might have be brought on wellington have opportunity for fighting except at disadvantage marmont having gained object for have manoeuvred be well content to maintain advantage at british be on height of cabeca aldea rubia so secured former position at san christoval marmont however have reached point gave command of ford at huerta have in power to cross tormes when pleased to recross at salamanca to cut road to ciudad have proved too that army must outmarch british for although have already made march of distance when race began have gained ground throughout day in spite of effort of british to keep abreast of moreover marmont now have junction with king army approaching from madrid securely established must either wait for arrival give battle if saw favourable opportunity wellington position be grave have not only to consider adversary force whole course of war disaster must imperil have safety of whole peninsula to consider defeat must not only entail loss of advantage have gained in spain must probably decide fate of portugal also determined however to cover salamanca till last moment in hope that marmont might make error must afford opportunity of dealing heavy blow next morning ally occupied old position at san christoval while french took possession of alba whence spaniard have be withdrawn without notice to wellington evening before british general have sent despatch to spanish commander saying that feared that must be unable to hold position messenger be captured by french cavalry marmont believing that wellington be about to retreat fearing that might escape determined to fight rather than wait for arrival of king french crossed tormes by ford of huerta alba british by other ford above salamanca movement be performed while terrible storm raged many men horse of th dragoon guard be killed by lightning while hundred of

salamanca extending from ford of santa marta to height near village of arapiles line covered salamanca be open to marmont to march round wellington right so cut communication with ciudad during night wellington heard that french must be joined in course of two day by twenty gun cavalry resolved to retire before came up unless marmont afforded opportunity of fighting to advantage latter however be

two detached hill called arapiles hermanitos be steep rugged a french be seen approaching portuguese regiment be sent to seize gained one nearest to while french took possession of second th division assailed height first gained captured half of have wellington now wished to retire must have be at once difficult dangerous to attempt movement line be long one must have be impossible to withdraw without running risk of being attacked while in movement driven back upon tormes ignorant of marmont precise intention for main body of french army be almost hidden in wood wellington must only wait until plan be developed therefore contented with placing th division on slope behind village of arapiles be held by light company of guard th th division be massed behind hill where deep depression hid from sight of enemy for time thing remained quiet except that french british battery on top of two hermanitos kept up duel with other during pause french cavalry have again crossed tormes by one of ford used in night by british have taken post at aldea tejarda thus placing between british army road to ciudad movement however have be covered by wood about twelve o'clock fearing that wellington must assail hermanito held by marmont brought up two division to point stood ready to oppose attack wellington indeed have be preparing have abandoned idea fearing that movement must draw whole army

two division covered by fifty gun supported by cavalry to move along southern ridge of basin menace that road holding in hand six division in readiness to fall upon village of arapiles must british interfere with maucune movement british line have now pivoted round until position extended from hermanito to near aldea tejarda in order to occupy attention of british prevent from moving french force attacked village of arapiles fierce struggle took place have marmont waited until clausel division still behind came up occupied ridge so a to connect french main army with maucune division

from portion of village still held a be hurrying to join maucune shell exploded near hurling to ground with broken arm two deep wound in side misfortune be fatal to french chance confusion ensued movement of troop be paralyzed be about five o'clock when rd division under pakenham fell upon maucune leading division two battery of artillery suddenly opened fire on flank from opposite height having expectation of such stroke believing that british be ere in full retreat along ciudad road french be hurrying forward lengthening out into long straggling line onslaught of pakenham division be irresistible supported a be by gun cavalry nevertheless french bore gallantly forming line a marched forward while gun poured shower of grape into approaching infantry nothing however must stop pressing forward broke half formed line into fragment drove back in confusion upon column behind french cavalry endeavoured to check british advance by charge on flank be repulsed by infantry british
