basque road driving three four of battle ship ashore capturing three others compelling rest to take to flight honour popular applause gained by lord cochrane be in opinion of authority more than

exploit at sea lieutenant embleton be put on half pay after action of imperieuse against french fleet found without prospect of future employment without even chance of obtaining nomination for son to midshipman berth blow be at first very keen one be le bitterly felt after conclusion of peace great reduction of navy a fate be only that of thousand of other officer have now come to feel that effect of wound for received small addition to half pay rendered unfit for further service even must have obtained appointment have since leaving navy lived in little cottage at ramsgate where from garden must obtain view of sea passing ship education of son afforded employment for hour day favourite position be on bench in garden from must watch through telescope mounted on tripod passing ship criticise state of rigging sail form conjecture a to destination be great pang to to part with stephen felt that must no longer keep by side be sure that careful training have given in nautical matter must enable lad to make way in mercantile navy fortnight after conversation with lieutenant received letter from friend in london saying that one of ship have returned fortnight before be now unloaded must at once begin to fit out for fresh voyage must be therefore a well for to bring stephen up so that might have advantage of seeing whole process of preparing ship for sea gave warm invitation to lieutenant embleton to stay with for week two on following day father son went on board ramsgate hoy thirty six hour later arrived in port of london be warmly received by mr hewson think boy be fortunate that tiger must be first ship will sail in said that evening regard captain a best officer be good seaman capital navigator be of most kindly disposition therefore can put boy under with certainty that will be well treated cared for in next place tiger doe not like other ship make regular voyage to from foreign port carry on business of trader among east indian island be not one to whom business must be safely intrusted have great confidence in captain pinder be good man of business thoroughly conscientious accustomed to way of treacherous native of island tiger be more heavily armed than usual have more than once beaten off attack of piratical craft there be fear of pinder being caught napping will in first place take cargo to calcutta reserving portion of hold for good for trading among island when have landed freight at calcutta will cruise in archipelago for month a long in fact a pinder find that can carry on really good business with native then will return to calcutta fill up with freight for return voyage thus see boy will gain good deal of varied experience will see perhaps a much adventure excitement a must meet with in score of ordinary voyage will have advantage of being under kind commander who will instruct in rudiment of navigation nothing must be better mr embleton said warmly be voyage of others must be to boy taste will be satisfied indeed at being in such good hand a to navigation be practice only that want have taught know can take lunar work reckoning out from star observation a accurately a must do be that so mr embleton be glad indeed to hear then there be doubt about future of boy if be steady industrious be pleased to hear for own sake if for nothing else for although pinder mate be capital sailor in other respect able officer be not men of pinder type can take of course rough observation at noon work out by rule of thumb aid of table beyond that can hing have not received education to enable to grapple with mathematical problem even of simplest kind although in case of pinder falling sick might manage under favourable circumstance to bring ship home must fare very badly if have long spell of bad weather must not get observation at noon for day even week together will be satisfaction to to know in case of anything happening to captain there be someone on board who must in case take lunar shoot star well to morrow morning will go down to dock will hand boy over to pinder must of course be very glad to have here think be of great advantage to boy to see everything done from first step be going to have entirely new fit out of standing running rigging so have be stripped entirely have nothing three lower mast above deck accordingly after breakfast next day mr hewson sent for hackney coach drove down to dock be tiger mr hewson said a stopped at side of fine craft be six hundred ton three year old fast sailer be not much to look at at present when be in full dress be handsome vessel look fast mr embleton said for must rather command craft of size than one of greater tonnage tiger at present certainly did not show to advantage deck be begrimed with dirt body of rigger be at work in parcelling serving with spun yarn eye of shroud officer in rough canvas suit be superintending work be mr staines first mate mr hewson said must not be happy if be not on board from very first hour that rigger be beginning work good morning mr staines went on raising voice be captain pinder on board yes sir mate said touching cap then went aft to poop cabin from captain came out a visitor stepped on board also be in working suit good morning mr hewson said be in rough see one hardly expects visitor on first day of fitting out know captain be lieutenant embleton of royal navy be son of whom be speaking to two day ago be glad to meet sir captain said shaking hand with mr embleton sailor know by reputation a being one of lord cochrane officer will be pleasure to to do can for son will find very different to most of apprentice pinder have have advantage of father teaching theoretically at rate be already well up in work when tell that can take lunar observation from star may imagine that will not require much teaching in navigation be glad indeed to hear hewson heartily glad there ought to be two men on board ship who can do for there be never saying what might happen if there be only one have made anxious many time when have bad spell of weather a to how tiger must get on if happened to be washed overboard by sea killed by falling spar well master embleton can see that will have difficulty in making first rate sailor of have come to stay yes sir father thought must be good for to be on board from time fitting out began quite right lad will then learn a much in fortnight a must in year at sea always make point of being here first officer must allow anything to prevent seeing that everything be right from first to last think that will be able to sleep on board for next fortnight of course not mr embleton said intend to take lodging for a close to dock gate a can perhaps may know of tidy place ca do better than lodge with captain said mr staines always put up at same place give notice when be going to begin to fit out keep room for slept there last night house be kept by nice clean woman widow of skipper who be lost with craft about ten year ago have doubt can put lad up too can mess with will go round with till get shroud up one be quite enough to look after rigger thank very much captain will be in respect more pleasant for boy than lodging by matter be speedily arranged mr embleton then took stephen to clothing shop bought two suit of rough canvas will find dirty work steve there be keeping free of tar by way captain pinder have not ordered steve outfit yet for know on line apprentice dress like midshipman on others so put off until saw always like apprentice on board ship to be dressed a midshipman captain replied there will only be three on board a far a know make point of messing with officer if there be only two three apprentice on board take meal with doe good at approve of mixing with men forward must say mr embleton get one good suit for going ashore rougher suit for duty on board dozen duck suit for tropic two three suit of dungaree for slipping on over others when there be dirty work to be done cap be sufficient to indicate officer a for rest of outfit own experience will tell what be needed railton in leadenhall street be man can recommend keep house badge for cap turn out work well generally get togs there find a cheap a anyone thank will take steve with a far a in hackney coach get measured then can be back here again by time knock off for dinner will then put on slop get to work steve returned to lodging just a captain first mate came in to dinner then carried one of canvas suit down to ship put on be soon at work having first lesson in seizing rope for fortnight work continued stephen greatly pleased captain first mate by attention willingness working time a rigger boy paying greatest attention to minutia of work saturday afternoon sunday spent at mr hewson where father be still staying host refusing to listen to talk of leaving until tiger sailed four day be spent in planing deck painting inside out work be scarcely finished when cargo began to come on board a soon a be case second third mate other two apprentice joined like mr staines towel pasley second third mate have made way up from forecastle be active young men good sailor who have laboriously mastered very small amount of bookwork be needed in addition to practical seamanship to pas examination who like majority of class of time knew nothing of navigation beyond taking rough observation at mid day working out by rule of thumb on table mr staines presented stephen to be new apprentice said father be lieutenant in royal navy one of lord cochrane men great friend of owner stephen embleton be lad name day will make fine officer have be at work here since morning rigger came on board be not afraid to put hand into tar pot a can see from appearance have learned lot from father so wo have trouble with generally do have with johnny raw be right youngster second mate said heartily if will learn anywhere will learn here for better captain never commanded ship passenger hope staines believe that skipper have have two three application although owner have objection to taking considers trouble be more than be worth of course must make something out of passage there must almost certainly be cantankerous beggar among of course table cost good deal more when there be passenger especially a will have apprentice to mess with be sure be glad indeed that sha' be bothered with other two apprentice be about stephen age have made one trip in tiger be at first little inclined to patronize new comer day before tiger hauled out into river owner mr embleton came down to look over great be change three week have made in appearance deck be beautifully white lofty spar well scraped freshly varnished network of new rigging set off to greatest advantage new suit of sail be bent lay loose in gasket ready for dropping four gun be ranged along side be handsome craft indeed mr embleton said a stood on wharf alongside taking in detail of outfit with eye of seaman be gun twelve pounder yes there be long eighteen down in hold will be mounted a pivot a soon a get among island others be well enough when come to close quarter long gun generally keep pirate from getting there like being peppered before come within fighting distance believe captain must rather part with other gun than sail without long tom must captain pinder who have just joined remarked five time have pivot gun made sheer off without venturing to come to close quarter indeed have never have to loose broadside gun three time in of came suddenly round corner into bay where be lying at anchor a have have notice of owner intention to come down officer be in new uniform after captain pinder have shown guest round ship sat down together to dinner in cabin have plenty of freeboard see mr embleton said a after returning on deck looked over side yes never will load down ship mr hewson said will never take cargo within twenty per cent of full carrying power have a little a possible stowed quite forward quite aft so that have not only plenty of freeboard be buoyant in heavy sea be sure pay insure ship have not lost one in last sixteen year insurance money saved make up for loss of freight have satisfaction of knowing have done in power to ensure safety of officer men very good policy hewson mr embleton said warmly see score of ship passing inside goodwins so loaded down must not be on board in heavy gale for money in bank state of sail often show that be badly cared for in other respect system of insurance be doubt good one have be so scandalously abused that may safely be said that have largely increased annual number of wreck loss of life be not for insurance owner must in own interest be driven to see that ship be made in respect seaworthy well provided with gear of kind well manned above not overloaded insurance be responsible for large proportion of marine disaster a if wind continued favourable tiger must drop down river a soon a got out of dock must be at very early hour next morning be necessary that stephen must be on board that evening however went back with father to mr hewson spent afternoon at exeter 'change seeing wild beast returned by eight o'clock to ship tiger made quick voyage to calcutta rounded cape without encountering bad weather be only twice obliged to shorten sail during whole passage stephen enjoyed life exceedingly be in first officer watch became great favourite with mr staines astonished fellow apprentice a soon a be fairly on way by producing quadrant taking observation at same time a did captain mate still more so when took lunar star observation working out by figure instead of from table in nautical almanac found at first little difficulty in obtaining accuracy when vessel be rolling be not long in overcoming captain found that be able to place ship position on chart quite a correctly a did must give lot steve first mate said when have be out fortnight if must work thing out a do have gone over over again to fellow who advertise that teach navigation be of use ca make head tail of letter zigzigs thing have tried have tried till head ached more study more fogged get about there doe not seem to to be sense in thing when see sit down figure away with letter thing beat altogether be not difficult when have begun from beginning stephen said of course a father wanted to teach navigation taught just thing led up to problem that be talking about so that really be not hard if have to do other sort of mathematical question must be just a much puzzled a be then see father explained step a came a one led to learnt without meeting with one special difficulty can quite see that must be very hard for anyone to learn to work out without having be coached from start will never try again think must find port by reckoning sun a for moon star give up altogether there be hundred of skipper nay thousand of who know more than do be indeed case skilful navigator have le advantage over experienced men who worked by rule of thumb than be now case a instrument be comparatively rough chronometer far le accurate than at present even most skilful in use be well satisfied if at end of long voyage found that be within twenty mile of reckoning be different work now lad to what used to be two year ago now one walk up down deck though there may be twenty sail in sight one pay more attention to than one must to a many sea bird then sail be watched one be up in top with one glass twenty time day for there be saying whether be friend enemy one watch at night be watch then for there be never saying whether french privateer might not come looming out of darkness at moment if vessel of about size be made out mile off be hand on deck cast lashing off gun stand by till be out of sight again now one jog along that have got to look out for be to see that run foul of craft let one run foul of yes have rough time of in day ai sorry that be over look out sharp for pirate when be among island mr staines ay lad when one see malay pirate there be mistaking for anything else at night be generally stark calm whether one be lying idle with sail hanging flat against mast whether one be at anchor one know that ca come upon under sail on still night one can hear beat of oar mile away there be never fear of being surprised a long a there be hand wide awake watchful on deck calm be greatest curse out there ship lie sometimes for day ay for week with water a a grease everything have be thrown overboard floating alongside sun coming down until brain be on boil have storm sometimes sometimes not very often when doe blow blow fit to take head off have nothing to do to cruise under bare pole hope that nothing will get in way there be one thing be not gale like have here cyclone instead of getting blown along for hundred of mile go round round so that if there be land within fifty mile of when storm strike chance be that be safe if can lie to can manage at last to edge out of on side be furthest from land cyclone be joke can tell if get warning enough to get canvas stowed to send down light spar have got ship like tiger under in good trim not too light not too heavy ought to be able to live through there be better sailor one more familiar with island than skipper be not fond of carrying on perhaps at time think little too prudent generally turn out right anyhow be fault on right side have sailed under fifteen year now be third mate when first joined ship not know old gertrude have never have cross word with have other two mate expects man to do duty a be right enough if be done well everything go on smooth think that there be ten of crew who have not be with skipper for year when get back to port crew be paid off be always 'when will want again captain ' matter whether be in fortnight in couple of month pretty nearly man will turn up speaks for a to owner skipper mate too mr staines well have not much to do with unless man doe duty doe pleasantly without cursing swearing wo make two voyage under skipper indeed wo make one three year ago towel be laid up with hurt got on voyage before have to get new second mate at last moment for pasley have not got certificate then must take towel place man be highly recommended be good sailor be bully foul mouthed one skipper put on shore at cape paid passage home out of own pocket though know owner returned to afterwards said that have done quite right tell lad be lucky in making first voyage on board tiger for putting aside everything else know single ship except hewson where apprentice mess with master mate be treated a be here daresay wonder why of have not be apprentice be only last two three year that hewson ship have carried before that there be always fourth mate to of ship so that there be two officer in watch ship have good name owner have so many application from friend with son who wanted to go to sea that three year ago made change be mighty particular who take indenture contain clause unless report by captain sail under be favourable owner have right of returning premium received of cancelling indenture can tell lad that if owner took a much pain for comfort of officer crew a mr hewson doe jack must have deal better life than be now case chapter ii in malay archipelago stay at calcutta be short one a soon a cargo for port be unladen tiger again sailed apprentice have run ashore have gone with one of mate a in so large city boy if alone might well have got into trouble stephen went with first mate be glad at arrangement a mr staines have frequently be there before knew town well stephen therefore saw great deal more of than must have done have be alone be delighted with native bazaar must have laid out much of spare cash there have not mr staines prevented time enough when get back stephen if have got money to spend have better go with to stall where last two voyage have be here laid in stock of article useful for trading with malay looking glass bead brass button bright handkerchief thing of sort say one might get cheaper in london in first place one always find plenty of thing there to spend one money on in second place people here know exactly sort of good needed in island one can get at one stall instead of having to hunt about in dozen shop for be allowed to trade on own account up to certain amount a rule find when get back here can sell curiosity buy down in island for about four time a much a good cost so if do same will have more money to buy thing with here than if bought now for most of thing pick up will find can get much better price in london than can here what sort of thing do buy there mr staines skin of bird carved wood work malay arm model of canoe thing of kind bird skin be best especially if know anything about have got a much a two three pound for rare skin exchanged for twopenny looking glass dozen brass button of course be exceptional case for a rule will average two three shilling apiece have better buy big pot of arsenical soap act a preservative to keep away insect also two three air tight tin box will hold thing buy here can fill with trade good steve took advice expended four out of five pound father have given on sailing mate laid out twenty pound in similar purchase then returned to ship be anchored mile down river followed by three cooly carrying purchase other apprentice similarly laid out spare cash have done well lad captain said a be at dinner on evening before sailing must not expect to make very great deal by trading although doubt will get handsome return for money to do really well must have knowledge of what bird be rare what be common must advise when get home to spend time that have to spare in visiting museum examining bird there doubt will be able to find out from one of attendant be rare one might be able to consult book on subject may have luck to come across skin be altogether new at rate little knowledge must enable to exchange good to very much greater advantage than must otherwise do knowledge of kind be always useful to sailor who in wandering may well get from native rare valuable specimen in natural history there be always plenty of collector ready to pay good price for have often regretted that did not pay attention to such matter when be young for besides paying well give great interest to visit to little known place have heard of two three captain who have made good deal of money by for two month after getting among island serious adventure be met with trading went on steadily several time large native craft be seen sheered off when saw that tiger be well armed prepared for defence a most of place touched at have be visited by captain on previous voyage native hailed return with expression of apparent pleasure however friendly bearing there be never abatement of vigilance by captain officer only certain number be allowed to come on board to trade seaman always carried cutlass by side brace of pistol in belt even when went ashore for wood water two boat be always sent men with loaded musket keeping guard while others worked gun of ship be loaded trained in readiness to open fire in case of hostile demonstration on part of native occasionally when chief have paid visit to ship invited captain to feast on shore strong guard armed to teeth accompanied boat lay by ship side in readiness to land party if necessary be most treacherous race on earth captain said one day when third officer remarked that seemed very friendly can never trust for moment will shake hand with with one hand stab with other number of ship company have be massacred owing to captain putting faith in appearance allowing too many of copper coloured scoundrel to get on board at once a long a make rule that not more than twenty thirty can come on deck that boat must keep at distance be safe must never let be caught napping have have one two very narrow escape for be twenty five year now since first came among island have just passed a third mate when made first voyage here captain be easy going man be quite taken in by appearance of friendliness on part of native first mate too be good sailor new to island too fond of grog luckily second mate have be here before ship have once be attacked nearly men killed before must beat malay overboard be always in fidget be only about twenty at time like young fool thought that be pure cowardice on part however at earnest request carried brace of double barrelled pistol in pocket unknown to captain first mate persuaded dozen of crew to do same got captain to let keep cannon loaded with grape though latter made secret that regarded precaution a altogether uncalled for native came on board a usual at first only two three canoe load gradually number of malay on deck became larger larger quite crowd of boat be clustered round must see that pearson second mate be in fidget glanced at significantly two three time began to think that might be right be of engaged in bartering with native noticed that pearson put good under charge close to one side of deck so that standing behind leant against bulwark must not be taken in rear ordered couple of men to move lot also of spoke to be knew among pearson have persuaded to carry pistol in pocket like look of thing mr pinder ' one of old hand whispered to 'no more do jack ' said slip below bring up four of boarding ax put one of down among mr pearson good make sign to that be for use put other three down in front of then do bob hawkins take place between mr pearson a if be going to lend hand with trade then if there be shindy four of will be able to make hard fight of anyhow ' did a told second officer nodded to approvingly thing went on quietly for five minute then heard heavy blow given followed by fall a if be signal quiet crowd of native became in moment mob of yelling fiend scream filled air pistol shot rang out may guess fell to work in earnest fancy did not throw away shot between cleared space in front of then snatching up ax made at nail first fought way aft first mate be fighting like demon have caught up handspike being very powerful man kept off assailant fairly till cut way through joined moment be free from group be attacking rushed forward sweeping native over with handspike like ninepin two of kept on side of there be just breadth enough on deck to give free play to ax though malay came at furiously must not stand blow of heavy weapon cook steward came rushing up behind 'turn cannon on canoe pearson shouted 'depress a much a can give hot ' have time to look round minute later heard one of cannon go off followed by yell scream from water two of along deck shouted 'but fire until have order malay be swarming up from canoe joining crowd in front of saw rush of of fellow up on to top of forecastle must make way now be a much a must do to hold own fought on until thought gun be ready then looking round saw two men standing behind with lighted match cannon be trained to sweep deck conklin ' be not until touched shouted in ear again that mate heard 'now ' pearson yelled 'throw yourselves on to cut down one two of rascal when shout 'run get back behind gun thought of what be coming gave fresh strength went at with will drove back couple of yard then pearson shouted 'run back went aft a hard a must tear pearson almost dragging conklin with a passed between gun with malay close at heel men fired gun be crammed almost to mouth with bullet execution be awful in moment dashed at again while men forward who have armed with capstan bar ran down ladder fell upon in minute be over malay who remained alive sprang over bulwark discharged remaining five cannon into canoe smashing up number of rest paddled for shore for life have time now to look around be awful sight over fifty malay lay dead together with eleven of men besides captain if have not be for pearson not soul must have lived to tell tale after be over found that a crowd on deck have increased most of old hand who be men have taken pistol have gradually gathered near forecastle of others have joined when outbreak came have for time be able to make stout resistance until one of number who be on forecastle when fight began shouted to that be training cannon forward then made rush up joined illustration went at treacherous malay with will drove back man who have be among native have be cut down at first alarm out of twenty eight hand on board when fight began only sixteen remained many of have desperate wound from malay crease two of died day two afterwards conklin have be very badly cut about none of wound ought to have be dangerous have heated blood by drink that in hot climate be fatal so buried ten day after fight thus see lost two officer thirteen men for want of taking precaution of course sailed at once for calcutta luckily have fine weather on way must have fared badly with crew have fallen in with hurricane pearson be good navigator after taking six more hand on board at calcutta brought home safely owner made handsome present next voyage sailed a first mate a second so turned out lucky stroke for of three year later went a captain year afterwards sailed a first mate when be have other adventure captain be in year before did not sail with pearson year for be promoted suddenly to ship ready to sail be piece of luck for one of owner went down to dock late one afternoon found captain blind drunk so be sent straight on shore pearson got billet be very sorry must not go with a after business became great friend in report of affair gave more credit than deserved for idea of getting hatchet up said alone enabled to make successful defence have more cause to regret transfer since captain be obstinate man a found out during voyage just a much inclined to treat native with contempt a former skipper have be however man appointed to take pearson place a first mate be sharp fellow lucky be so be lying one night in harbour where native have appeared particularly friendly day before purvis mate suggested to captain that must be a well to have watch kept a if at sea old man pooh poohed idea ' like ' mate said to 'those fellow be too friendly did not bargain over good took at own term be not way believe did just to lull into sense of security a soon a skipper turn in for night will get gun quietly loaded will keep watch while will order crew to turn in standing so a to be ready to tumble out at once be mighty hard to keep awake on soft night when anchor be down with on deck betting be two to one that hand on anchor watch will drop off to sleep skipper will be snoring by ten o'clock have better turn in now will see to getting gun loaded to having plenty of ammunition handy will call at four bell if be going to be attacked be likely to be just a day be breaking ' have better call at two bell said 'and then can get three hour sleep be up at eight bell wo begin to get light until after may be sure that if hear sound will wake at once ' so arranged at one o'clock came down quietly have only taken off shoe carried in hand so a to avoid making noise might wake skipper a went out on deck 'everything be quiet ' mate said 'and have be ever since turned in even be not natural for a know native when have be doing trade generally keep on feasting making row night keep ear well open for there be trusting watch time have gone forward have found sound asleep naturally think that a there be only anchor watch there can be fear of disturbance so must trust to own ear not to theirs ' right ' said will keep awake never fear think if have not be confident that first mate be not man to take alarm easily must have have difficulty in keeping eye open for night be sultry not breath of air be moving went forward to two men on watch told that must keep sharp look out for that be likely enough might be attacked before morning then lit pipe paced up down deck stopping occasionally to listen intently be nearly eight bell when thought heard grating sound on shore walked forward found a expected that two men on watch be half asleep 'wake up fool said 'there be something moving ' again heard low grating sound 'did hear that ' asked men be wide awake now 'yes sir heard noise know what be ' 'they be launching canoe said will call first officer went aft purvis woke directly touched ' fancy be launching canoe said have twice heard grating sound ' be up in moment stood listening intently for minute there be certainly movement on shore be difficult to say of what kind be just low confused murmur 'you be right ' mate said presently 'look at water ' for moment scarcely understood then saw what meant have be a smooth a oil before be no longer so be broken with tiny ripple a if disturbed by faintest possible breeze 'these ripple must be made by launching canoe went on ' strong body of men might carry almost noiselessly down sandy beach put in water without making splash stir made in wading in lowering down however quietly must break up glassy surface ripple once started must run out here anyhow will get men out tell to come noiselessly will serve out arm ammunition to wo load gun till have something more to go upon may be time before attack think be likely enough that will wait until hear boat have doubt have sent for coming up before make move behall wake skipper 'certainly not a likely a not must blow up send men back to bunk again have made up mind that there be danger obstinate beggar must risk having throat cut rather than own there be ground for alarm ' went into forecastle roused men warning to muster a quietly a possible hour passed without slightest sound being heard then men fidgeted whispered together be evidently of opinion that have be turned out on false alarm men purvis said sharply can hear something ' must have heard pin drop in moment believe man held breath there be sort of quiver in air rather than sound watkins boatswain who have be year year in vessel trading among island said 'you be right mr purvis be sweep what be more be not one boat must say dozen 'that be what think ' mate said 'how far off must say be ' 'it be difficult to tell must say three four mile be best of proas canoe if men take pain with paddling will come within hundred yard of before hear a proas row oar can make out long way off on still night like 'well will wait few minute longer before wake skipper purvis said to 'he will swear that doe not hear noise at that be fancy in ten minute there will be mistaking watkins have better get up that boarding netting ' for among island ship carry very useful be in repelling attack have got handy ' boatswain said soon brought on deck behall lash up sir ' have better wait till captain come out wo take above couple of minute especially if run along by bulwark in few minute sound of oar be unmistakable purvis went in to call captain 'what be ' skipper said a mate knocked 'there be five six proas coming towards sir have reason to believe that canoe on shore be launched ready to attack ' ' believe be nonsense ' skipper said angrily a came from door be always fidgeting about pirate mr purvis ' came out on deck listened moment then said betuff nonsense what have got men out send to bunk at once 'with greatest respect to sir will hing of sort if did men must not obey can hear proas be not going to submit to have throat cut tamely mr pinder thoroughly agrees with so doe boatswain that proas can be coming for good purpose at time of night be madness not to be ready for what do say mr pinder ' entirely agree with sir ' replied 'this be rank mutiny ' skipper said furiously must rather be tried for mutiny than have throat cut here now sir will give order will ' will give order captain said morning will have put in iron purvis giving short laugh turned on heel lad said 'you have heard sound of oar know a well a do that will shortly be attacked will have to fight hard for life captain be of opinion that be mistaken want to turn in again what do say will have throat cut not ' there be angry growl from sailor well then set to work load gun ball at first keep grape handy will want before have done do quietly be a well fellow on shore must not know what be up to a soon a have loaded rig up boarding netting ' in moment be bustle there be need to run gun in for be already done captain insisting upon always having port closed in order a said that native might see that intention be perfectly friendly consequently men be enabled to load gun without noise moving about deck on naked foot like shadow then boarding netting be triced up arm distributed amongst men having boarding pike cutlas brace of pistol by time that be done judged by sound of sweep that pirate be not more than mile away lantern be got up on deck placed in readiness to be lighted run up to yard arm so a to throw light down on water will call old man again obstinate a be ca help hearing oar now know that be plucky enough will fight ship well a soon a be once convinced that there be danger ' went together to skipper 'captain ' purvis said in loud voice have come to tell that proas be within mile of to ask to take command fight ship heard skipper tumble out of bunk again with angry exclamation opened door without word went straight up on to poop listened moment then ran down again ' beg pardon mr purvis ' said hastily 'but have be wrong there be doubt be going to be attacked be heartily sorry for what have said thank for watchfulness ' beay more about captain be ready to begin a soon a give order will throw on thing be out again in minute in le than time turned out again 'you have gun loaded asked 'ay ay sir boarding netting up ' 'can make out yet 'no sir by sound be keeping close in to shore have got kedge anchor in boat will lower row couple of ship length drop there then can warp round so a to bring gun to bear deferred doing to last so that fellow on shore must not know be on alert 'yes do so at once mr purvis ' boatswain two hand be at once called to boat be then lowered rowed off in direction mate pointed out anchor be let drop boat returned to ship paying out hawser over stern captain have taken place on forecastle be looking anxiously ahead ' see ' exclaimed at last 'they be coming out from behind low point mile away haul on hawser bring broadside to bear on get gun across to starboard side mr pinder ' ship be pierced for eight gun side by time ship be swung round be in position proas now no more than quarter of mile away be heading straight for 'take steady aim lad captain said 'and fire a soon a be sure of shot ' in quick succession gun spoke out at report wild yell broke from proas from shore now astern of a quick a can with grape ' captain shouted there have be five proas when first gun be fired before have reloaded one have disappeared there be shouting confusion in one of others be evident that also be in difficulty fire until give word ' three proas be within fifty yard of when gave order eight gun poured content into crowded deck effect be terrible two of proas ceased rowing altogether of oar of other dropped into water hampered effort of who still continued to row 'the port watch will repel boarder starboard watch will load again ' captain ordered there be way enough on proas to bring alongside men at steering oar be killed have lost head for instead of bringing up alongside simply came up bow on a struck side malay tried to climb up attacking a did only at three point men have little difficulty in keeping off thrusting through netting with boarding pike giving malay time to attempt to chop down netting with crease 'be loaded ' captain shouted 'ay ay sir came from gun 'train so a to take proas between wind water ' captain said 'then run port gun back to place will be attacked on side directly ' sea indeed be sparkling with phosphoric fire a crowd of canoe from shore paddled out towards steward now lit ran up dozen lantern got gun over in time before must load malay be swarming up side three men pinder load gun cried captain will keep fellow off ' same order be given to boatswain with regard to gun on starboard side be exciting work for spear be flying in shower stink pot be hurled over netting yelling shouting be deafening men be sticking to pike for have be ordered to keep pistol in reserve in case pirate obtained footing on deck there be two little gun on poop when have loaded gun on port side captain sent up to load crammed with bullet up to muzzle then ran to poop railing placed one of hand there with lighted match have tough ten minute of if canoe have come up at same time a proas must have gone hard with last broadside have be poured in have sunk two of big craft other have drifted away so that in fact have only shore canoe to cope with have hard work to keep back none of native managed to cross netting along waist of ship though few shoved through hole that hacked with crease managed to swarm up by cable on to bow three men who be stationed there disposed of before enough must gain footing to be dangerous captain have be keeping gun in reserve in case proa have dropped behind at first must come on now saw that be low in water that many of malay be jumping overboard therefore shouted out 'give broadside aim into thick of ' that broadside settled seven eight of big canoe be smashed up several of others turned paddled to shore moment later men who be attacking leapt into boat alongside followed example a quickly a can ' captain cried 'and give parting salute ' ran two little quarter deck gun over peppered with bullet other gun joined in a soon a be reloaded that finished matter loss be not heavy considering what hard fight have be have two killed seven eight wounded by spear while must have suffered frightfully in morning captain called crew aft made speech thanking for conduct saying that owed safety that of ship to first mate that night work must be lesson that must never forget privately said same thing to there be doubt that be first mate who saved ship other affair be lesson to a well a to captain matter how friendly native might appear from day have never anchored among island without having half gun double shotted other half loaded with grape there be always officer watch on deck so happens to will not be because have be caught napping on occasion captain well nigh lost ship crew by carelessness for several week cruised among island bartering good with native of sea coast village at most of captain have touched on previous voyage a soon a ship be recognized canoe came off freely stephen gradually got rid of good have purchased at calcutta knowing nothing of respective value of bird skin be guided simply by rarity of skin of number be brought on board bought none however brilliant plumage whenever saw one be new to at once made offer for a be seldom box filled slowly until one day went ashore with captain first mate twelve sailor armed to teeth to pay visit to chief on few occasion on have landed always carried with hand bag filled full of trade good on present occasion after feasting have gone on for time stole out from chief men be sitting down in front drinking palm wine keeping vigilant eye upon movement of native presently one of malay came up to touched bag a if to ask what be content brought out two three small looking glass large brass necklace few of cheap bangle ring set with coloured glass used by hindoo peasant woman native pointed to hut near beckoned to steve to follow jim may a well come with stephen said to one of sailor think fellow want to trade with be treacherous beggar care about going with by sailor got up followed across to hut malay be evidently chief of importance stephen thought that might be possessed of article of better class than usually offered in one corner of hut stood seaman chest with several small case round needed glance to show that latter be two chronometer three quadrant scoundrel have be plundering ship jim ay ay honour there be not much doubt about must like to knock black villain on head chief caught tone of anger made variety of sign to effect that there have be great storm that ship have be driven ashore wrecked ay ay be very well sailor growled wo do for chronometer must never have floated polished case have never be in water never mind jim wo do to look suspicious pointed to chronometer asked by sign how much be wanted for took out four looking glass two brass chain three four bead necklace chief looked doubtful when stephen added crimson silk handkerchief closed with bargain at once must indeed have given for looking glass alone if stephen have held out for for regarded chronometer with certain sense of dread be to mystery having made when first brought ashore ticking noise be generally considered to be in way alive be therefore left out in air for day be then found that be a supposed dead none of other native must have given house room chief who be le superstitious than majority of tribe have brought into hut although have not have sufficient courage to break up for sake of brass having disposed of chief opened lid of chest took out clothes held up stephen shook head decidedly then brought out gold watch heavy bag untied latter handed to stephen for inspection lad have difficulty in repressing exclamation for be full of guinea put down placed watch beside assumed air of indifference then made up pile of about equal value to first threw in couple of dozen brass button chief nodded stephen slipped bag watch into coat pocket while transaction have be going on jim have carried box containing chronometer quadrant to comrade anything more sir asked a appeared at door of hut nothing more to carry jim a far a be concerned there be good pea jacket togs in chest have doubt that belonged to captain of ship have cut off button will buy for coat trouser dozen shirt be to jim great delight purchased for stephen then examined whole content of chest thinking that paper might be found must give clue to name of ship that have belonged to nothing of sort be discovered however bought whole of clothes calling in sailor one by one divided among then went back joined captain have be doing trading captain whispered to be white plunder have doubt that ship have be surprised crew massacred somewhere near here have bought chronometer quadrant have certainly not be in water also content of sea chest divided among men there be paper of kind from appearance of chronometer must say that can not have be here long captain nodded will talk over when get on board steve will be off at once for fellow be beginning to get drunk with beastly liquor of theirs be best that must get out of place before there be excuse for quarrel few minute later took seat in boat rowed off to ship chapter iii cyclone a soon a arrived on board captain pinder examined chronometer pronounced to be excellent one must not wind up until be greenwich time a now stand must then compare with own of course sir stephen said have bought not for myself for ship not at steve have traded a have right to do ship have nothing to do with at same time know whether will be able to keep sell must give notice on return home that such thing have be found here under circumstance leave doubt that crew of ship to belonged have be massacred ship burned doubt owner of vessel have be missing will call at office to inspect chronometer say that anyone must have legal right to have be absolutely lost gone out of possession have bought in way of fair trade if wish to have back again sir of course will give up well at rate if did so lad must get reward proportionate to value however may never be claimed owner whose ship be missing who have received insurance money be not likely to trouble further in matter be not have sir stephen went on also got gold watch bag of money suppose chest belonged to captain that carried gold with for purchase of store be lucky fellow steve come down into cabin will count money two hundred guinea went on when have finished well be about best bit of trade have seen done have better hand over to to keep oh mean to be kept sir stephen said must not be fair at must not think of be like prize money ought to be divided in same way mind keeping gold watch just now if find out name of ship when get back to england must wish to send to widow of captain money too if belonged to there be chance whatever of lad captain must be fool enough to bring out lot of gold like on own account be certainly ship money that must hold for making advance to crew a for purchase of store must pay for by bill on owner still be doubt right about watch poor fellow widow must doubtless be glad to have a to gold will take charge of for present will talk matter over again later on there be occasion to come to decision about at present be entirely yours think that have right to give up sum of money like without at rate very careful consideration be sum divided up into share must give very small amount to on board while might be of most material service to day other please oblige by saying nothing about at present decision be arrived at in matter of sort somebody be sure to feel aggrieved be astonishing what little thing upset crew especially on voyage of kind where there be such controlling influence over men mind a exercised by touching at port where there be authority to whom in case of necessity captain can appeal very well sir will of course do a wish will say anything about watch yes there be objection to doing especially a must be mentioned in inquiry may make a to ship being missing there be need for secrecy about will also mention money to officer will appreciate offer that have made agree with be sure that will be better that nothing must be said to crew evening first mate said to stephen captain have be telling about bag of money got hold of steve think that offer to treat a if be prize money be very kind one agree with that must be mistake in first place money must go far in matter of sort ship be to say owner take large share to begin with officer take share men share must not come to pound head pound head must only suffice for to have drunken spree on shore be just a well without a captain say be astonishing what little thing upset sailor mind might take into head that a got two hundred pound in hut there might be lot more must be wanting to land to turn village upside down there must be bloodshed sort of trouble old saying 'least said soonest mended ' come in here strongly have so far got on very well with native voyage hope that will continue to do so to end quite allow that must of be glad to give sharp lesson to village ashore have be plundering have doubt murdering crew of ship still have evidence of ca attack village on mere supposition have be friendly enough with partly because have be here before captain get on well with more because be perfectly well aware that be always on guard that there be chance whatever of catching asleep in nine case out of ten be carelessness over confidence of sailor tempt native to take advantage of must never have shown thing if have have idea of attacking next morning operation of filling up water tank be completed at noon order be given to weigh anchor steve saw how rightly captain have foreseen what be likely to happen for sooner be order given than two of men came aft a deputation from crew what be lad asked well captain boat crew went ashore yesterday came off with lot of togs must in course have be taken from seaman chest now seems to a chest must not have be there by fair mean that like enough have be murdering looting vessel here for aught know place may be full of plunder of sort may be there be twenty thirty other seaman chest there other good seems to sir that chap ought to be punished that must try to get a much of plunder have got hidden a can therefore crew beg that will sanction going ashore tackling lad ca sanction that captain said be true that mr embleton be offered by one of chief chronometer content of sea chest bought chronometer also bought content of chest divided among men who went ashore chief made sign to that thing have be saved from ship have be wrecked be possible that may be so may not have be wrecked on island thing may have be share of one of canoe from here assisted in looting at rate have proof that vessel be boarded captured if have be done here think must have seen more sign of among native who have come out to ship on shore there must have be more trade good about handkerchief bead so on must not have be anxious to trade with at rate there be ground for attacking village have during last three four day traded peacefully with a have done on several different occasion when have put in here even if there be other reason must refuse to allow to be attacked because news of affair must spread from island to island next time be in sea must do trade must certainly be attacked if gave chance of course will report circumstance connected with discovery of chest at calcutta endeavour to find out what ship have be lately missing beyond that can hing in matter be trader if be attacked do best to beat off assailant must be altogether beyond business to attack sea side village because find that be in possession of ship good for be to do so must soon put end to trade in island go back tell comrade then muster at once heave cable short order be obeyed be evident that there be lack of usual briskness willingness however before ship have be many hour on way matter settled down work went on a usual see lad first officer said to stephen a sail be sheeted home tiger glided away from anchorage captain be quite right if have be known on ship that have got that money there must have be good deal more trouble than there be must have be good to tell that doubt be ship money sailor be like child must have argued that if must obtain two hundred pound from one hut must be likely to get a much in general loot of village see giving togs bought be enough to stir up thing must not have passed off so pleasantly have known about money say that there must have be mutiny anything of sort because great majority of have sailed for year under skipper still there must have be great discontent grumbling if there happened to be among new hand one two sea lawyer might have worked upon men caused great deal of trouble see that sir steve said well there be harm done lad will see that in day two matter will have be forgotten be lesson that may profit by be always best to avoid anything even remotely be likely to set sailor talking together crew be not a trustworthy a tiger must be astonished what mischief two three cunning plausible rascal can do among crew if have got ever so small grievance to work upon week later ship be passing along coast of small island when joyce eldest apprentice who be examining shore through glass said to second officer there be wreck of sort sir in among black rock so there be mate said shading eye with hand see plainly enough now that call attention to went aft reported to captain who came out examined carefully with glass be wreck certainly not work of native time said have be blown on shore left almost high dry spar be gone bulwark be swept away though can not see line of broadside fancy that have broken in two anyhow a have hardly steerage way will lose time by sending to find out what ship be mr towel might a well lower gig take six men let take musket pistol with a mr joyce be first to make out may a well go with if see sign of native can land ascertain whether have be plundered may be that have not be discovered yet by native if see of about content with getting ship name port from stern boat be lowered may go too steve added a stephen be looking down into boat be mr archer turn a have got touch of fever morning be better sitting under shade of sail than in open boat thank very much sir stephen said running below shoved pistol into pocket have got water in boat captain asked mate just a steve returned on deck keg be about half full sir said a one of sailor lifted shook hand down from long boat captain said turning to one of men be better always to make sure mr towel went on leaning over side one be never sure of weather for hour altogether like colour of sky now if there be sign of change aloft see native have not be near place give look round beyond rock for anything might show whether of crew got ashore fire made anything of sort must see sign will fire gun two when return lay off for few hour to give chance of coming down to beach ay ay sir mate said will take look round for from way have be thrown up must doubt whether there be slightest chance of anyone having got ashore captain nodded then mate gave word boat pushed off from ship four men rowed two sat in bow mr towel two apprentice sat aft be three mile from shore there be ripple on water wind be very light there be however ground swell have caused tiger to roll be scarcely perceptible in boat steve remarked on mate said long swell affect boat in least have often gone ashore on west coast of africa when one be scarcely conscious in boat of there being swell on at yet vessel at anchor outside be rolling almost gunwale under still must rather that have not got be sign that there be wind somewhere agree with skipper that be unnatural looking sky still may be hour yet before there be change hour rowing took to shore must not have picked out worse place lad mate said when approached wreck see there be black head sticking out of water round must have be tremendous sea to have carried that ship right through chucked up there where there be not two foot of water lady vernon london joyce exclaimed at moment can make out name plainly then eye be better than mine joyce for ca say can read yet row easy men in bow keep sharp look out on water if be to come bow on to hidden rock must have to wait ashore until boat came out to fetch rowing very gently boat kept on course until within length of ship then ran quietly up on flat rock seven eight inch under water must see now that captain conjecture be correct ship have broken back having a be carried in on crest of great wave dropped on sharp ledge of rock about amidships sea have rushed in through hole in side have torn away planking most of timber forward while after part of ship have held together hold however be gutted of content native have not be here since steve said a pointed ahead where apparently far out of reach of water lay quantity of wreckage splinter of plank bit of timber bale of good great litter of loose cargo be of use climbing up above mate said in answer to offer on joyce part to endeavour to reach deck wave see have rushed in through stern window have made clean sweep of everything deck have burst up gone will have look at thing on shore step out lad pull boat bit higher up be done waded through water knee deep to shore wreckage lay hundred yard further up on ground quite twenty foot higher than on be standing bale be marked with ship name there be sign of cask box have doubtless be smashed into splinter among wreckage five skeleton be found searched further inland must discover sign whatever of life between shore dense forest began four five hundred yard away be certain that one have escaped mate said in first place living creature must have ever gained foot if cast up by sea a must have be first wave struck after be thrown up there must have swept deck clean finished at one blow in next place if by miracle of did get safely ashore may be sure that must have buried comrade next morning see be sand up there where wreckage lie must not have taken long to scrape hole deep enough large enough to bury ah captain be getting impatient exclaimed a sound of gun came across water wonder went on a looked at sky have be about hour on shore have be so fully occupied in examining wreckage in looking for sign might tell if of crew have gained shore that have paid attention to weather great change have taken place since have left ship wind have entirely died away darkness have crept over sky be not cloud sort of dull vapour quick lad to boat mate said there be not moment to be lost there be storm brewing sooner be on board better ran through water got into boat pushed off be careful men paddle quietly until be well beyond rock keep sharp look out forward gun be fired from ship a spoke steady men steady said can row a hard a like when get outside be of use knocking hole in to start with a soon a be beyond rock bent to oar at mate order two apprentice sailor in bow took seat by rower double banked oar skipper be getting rag of sail off mate said a looked ahead there be gun be getting darker darker suppose can make out give way lad gloom deepened rapidly ship continued to fire gun minute two be well did so for mate have now lost sight of way do think will come sir stephen who be at stroke oar asked mate shook head there be knowing said if be inshore tiger will lay bone by wreck behind ca be above mile away from by sound of last gun will be close thing can hear wind coming even rowing be conscious of low moaning sound come from behind think mate said in answer to look from stephen suddenly puff of wind from behind rippled water round then died away again row lad mate exclaimed can see ship now be not mile away five minute will do men strained at oar boat sprang forward at stroke must hear moaning sound growing louder louder captain have got head off shore mate said have be towing round have just hoisted boat up have got little storm jib on now lad four five hundred yard will be alongside be race with storm odds be too great be hundred yard from ship when roar rose into wild scream line of white water sprang towards with fearful velocity in oar men mate shouted throw yourselves flat in bottom of boat quick order be executed almost a soon a given mate too slipped off seat on to floor board while still retaining hold of tiller next moment storm struck be well that boat be still flying through water with way full on have be lying motionless must probably have sunk like stone under force of blow a be leapt forward like horse under spur passed length so from ship latter have not yet gathered way lay pressed down until bow be well nigh level with water a mate looked up saw captain holding on by shroud waved hand then boat flew on in minute ship be out of sight mate shouted in ear of sailor who rowed stroke oar who be lying next to crawl forward try fix floor board there so a to show few inch above bow to act a head sail if broach to be up with a go along tell man to shift bit more aft stern must be well down can never keep straight if ca fix floor board get up mast tie up foresail in roll then hoist will give hold enough to wind man nodded made way forward endeavoured to carry out first part of order moment raised floor board above level of gunwale be wrenched from hand blown ahead with aid of two other men managed to step mast mate waved hand to to say that must do for present man however prepared sail ready for hoisting rolling up tightly winding cord round round then hooked head on to traveller on mast lay down at foot holding halliard in readiness to hoist water be still perfectly smooth boat flew straight before wind without tendency to broach to stephen after stroke oar have gone forward crept aft until be beside mate there lay for time feeling half stupefied by tremendous roar of cyclone captain pinder be a good officer must be most particular about boat always have built specially from own design be broader than usual have flat floor deep keel thus be extremely buoyant line resembling of surf boat on west coast of india africa while deep keel enabled to sail close to wind men chafed sometimes when on way to shore found passed by narrow boat of other ship captain be perfectly indifferent to used to say to other skipper who laughed at for what called walnut shell boat be not made for racing be made to carry crew in heavy sea boat will live where yours must be swamped in five minute with great beam will carry sail while must not dare show shred of canvas make difference to whether get to shore five minute earlier later properly handled smallest of boat ought to weather ordinary gale while long boat must be a safe to cross atlantic in a tiger though say that must be a comfortable crew one of whom have many time grumbled at contrast between beamy craft smart gig of most other ship now felt advantage boat sped lightly along raising head higher higher out of water whenever fresh blast of wind added to speed save for sound of rushing water against side might have be at rest for motion must be perceived in hour sea began to get up a soon a did so mate made signal to man at halliard sail be drawn up tightly a be rolled difference be at once perceptible boat flew along faster than before men be now sitting up in bottom of boat knew that battle with storm have a yet scarcely begun that when sea once got up must have terrible time of in ordinary ship boat prospect must have be absolutely hopeless norwegian pilot boat whose model captain have pretty closely followed be able successfully to ride out heaviest gale in north sea mate two apprentice latter of whom have often heard from captain pinder with whom matter be pet hobby of wonderful power of craft in gale entertained strong hope that must live through might come a sea rose small portion of foresail be loosed then more be freed until whole of little sail be drawing speed with dragged boat along saved from being swamped by following wave in hour water no longer ran in wave be broken up in confused tumultuous sea greater part of sail be again bound up for there be longer same risk of being swamped be necessary to moderate boat speed in such tumult of water what make like stephen shouted circular motion of wind mate replied in similar tone of voice dare say have made two three circle already there be compass in locker behind sir mate nodded may be useful when storm be over must not help now might get broken that stephen must quite understand for motion of boat be so sudden unexpected that crew often grasped at thwart gunwale fearing must be thrown right out of at one moment wave seemed to rise underneath almost chuck into air then must sink between two mass of water looked a if must tumble over fill then must dash head forward at wave rose suddenly in front of for time seemed to on board a if destruction be imminent a buoyant little craft struggled bravely on shipping more water than one man with bailer must free of a fast a came aboard in shape of spray began to breathe again more freely be now nine hour since gale have burst upon there be sign of abatement when a be on top of wave mate shouted there be breaker ahead head be lifted when boat rose again on wave must see line of white foam ahead of a far on side a eye must see through mist keep look out for break in line wilcox mate shouted man forward waved hand holding to mast stood up minute later turned shouted something to man next to message be passed from mouth to mouth to mate be not reef sir be low sandy coast take place on thwart mate shouted get oar out men did so then in momentary lull in blast officer said get ready to pull for life when give word only chance be to go in on top of wave instant touch ground loses way jump out stick heel in sand approached edge of surf rapidly stick oar in deep check way mate shouted stood up in boat when be within fifty yard of point where wave curled over fell with roar like thunder on beach two three wave passed under then saw one of greater height approaching row lad row for life wind helping flew forward wave rose higher higher behind looked almost a steep a wall involuntary cry broke from several of men a boat stern rose up row row mate shouted six stroke be pulled then wave fell over with crash in moment be shooting along with speed of arrow in midst of mass of seething foam get ready to jump mate shouted voice be lost action accompanied be understood be flying up steep slope when suddenly motion became slower then there be bump hold to lad if can man spring overboard for moment seemed drawn backwards by rush of water then boat became fixed moment later water left now together before next wave reach with united effort lifted ran boat own length further up next wave barely reached boat stern before came be well up on sand then mate pointed upwards roar of surf howl of wind must have drowned word gesture be sufficient most of men have like officer lost hat who have not done so took off several of including stephen joyce threw on knee others stood with bent head uttered fervent thanksgiving for preservation from what have seemed almost certain death mate be first to move went to side of boat began to take double handful of sand to throw into others looked at in surprise made sign that wind might lift boat up whirl round dash to piece then set to at work continued until boat be half full of sand then two barrel of water be carried up together with bag of biscuit bottle of rum from locker where supply be always kept in case of emergency like present went on beyond brow of sand hill ensconced in hollow at foot where be completely sheltered from wind mate got out jack knife managed to get cork out of bottle pouring water from one of breaker into tin pannikin formed part of boat equipment gave ration of grog to served out biscuit round a soon a be eaten grog drank threw on sand be soon fast asleep utterly worn out with prolonged strain have gone through when woke day be just breaking mate be first to leap to foot tumble up lad said must have have twelve hour sleep storm be over be soon at top of sand hill heavy sea be still breaking on sand there be scarce breath of wind sea though rough agitated be no longer covered with white head looked bright in rosy light boat lay where have left securely anchored by weight of sand contained next glance be inland for quarter of mile away sand covered everything then few bush rose from beyond be stunted tree hundred yard further thick forest bordered sandy belt a far a must see on hand be evidently large island for two three mile away country rose hill beyond hill culminating in jagged mountain dome twenty mile distant do know where be sir stephen asked a mate stood silently looking at peak wish did have never seen that hill before if have have be from other side gave quite different outline see be nine hour in gale during time fancy must have run nearly hundred mile suppose be distance from point where started for be sure to have gone round round several time in first hour two island be at be fifty sixty mile from coast of sumatra possibly be there that have be cast ashore on other hand may have gone quite in direction anyhow there be denying that be in awkward fix matter little enough of island have hit upon native be pirate scoundrel possession prize most be human head first thing to do lad be to draw charge from musket pistol to reload then will have consultation be done then went down to boat half expected mate went on after examining shock have started butt of three plank on one side two on other will get sand out first turn over bottom upwards be done think might make shift to cobble up mate said of wood here be a hard a iron might cut peg fasten plank into place again suppose will be able to make watertight might caulk up with pitch gum from of tree be not first thing to think of be use having boat if have not food water to put into biscuit must last two three day water if be careful a long again be not enough to start with on long cruise place have to make for be timor do think that must find way there steve how far be be looking at chart last day be on board sir noticed that timor lay to south of where be then must say be something like six seven hundred mile away well be of use starting on expedition a with stock of provision a ours so propose that in first place see what be to be found in forest will be hard if find supply of fruit if can collect store enough might venture upon making start see must keep well off land for if be made out from of coast village must have one of craft after in time in case must say have better stay here for week if tiger got safely through gale may be sure captain will be cruising about looking for have sufficient faith in boat to feel pretty positive that if have not be cast ashore be still afloat chapter iv rescue be soon in forest required care caution to make way through tangled growth of climbing cane vine of be armed with terrible thorn a have hatchet to chop way through be often obliged to make detour to escape obstacle orchid of brilliant colour fantastic shape grew thickly on tree ant in countless number swarmed up down trunk many angry exclamation be wrung from seaman a bite a sharp a sting of wasp told that of insect have crawled up leg of trouser made way down neck unless be going to live on ant mate said ruefully a gave savage slap at leg seems to be likely to starve for have seen nothing to eat since entered wood even if of tree did bear fruit see how be going to get at for one must be eaten alive by little brute before reached top vote turn back mr towel one of men said must rather put to sea take chance than keep on being stung by ant when there doe seem least hope of finding anything there doe seem much chance here nixon think have best get out of wood follow edge along may come to place where be more open may even strike on stream if must do might patch up boat pull up stream bit anyhow think be use pushing on here jacket be torn in dozen place already by thorn one of have nearly taken eye out grumbled indeed be bleeding from gash have received from thorn made way back carefully there be general exclamation of satisfaction when light must be seen ahead through tree a soon a be out on sand shirt be hastily pulled off hunt for ant carried out be lucky bite swell up joyce said must be mass of bump be a bad a if one have be attacked by swarm of bee yet there be only little red spot to show for bite a soon a have freed from ant started along edge of forest after walking for two mile gave shout of joy for river fifty yard wide issued from forest sand hill have hidden from sight until be close upon thank god sha' die of thirst mate said will be hard job to get boat here have got to be done even if must launch through surf there must be getting in through roller on bar at least must not like to try so have got to drag here somehow will be tough job a there seems chance of getting food in other way must undertake hurrah exclaimed suddenly there be cocoa nut tree on other side of river settle let be off back again at once returned in much better spirit than have before felt on way went short distance into forest cut off number of thorn two inch long seemingly a hard a iron breakfasted on biscuit with full allowance of water then set to work at boat thorn answered purpose a nail admirably plank soon be securely fastened into place against stem without nail to clench plank together be evident to that boat must not float five minute stood looking at discontentedly what be to be done with said mr towel can anyone make suggestion must think sir stephen said that if must get strong fibre of thin climber barred way be not thicker than string there be breaking must think that must do that with must sew plank together caulk afterwards with thread from bit of leg of one of drill trouser capital idea stephen at rate must be worth trying will go fetch of climber sir long thorn to make hole with may a well go stephen have nothing to do here at rate be cooler in forest than be on sand will want good stock of thorn for be sure to break lot of in making hole have thing in knife will do for sir joyce said produced from pocket knife with many blade one of being long pricker be given to day before sailed have always wondered what use that thing must ever be here be use for at last capital joyce be just thing there be flint steel tinder box in locker best plan will be to make fire heat that pricker of yours red hot must make work great deal easier there will be le risk of breaking of splitting wood so now will collect dry wood creeper leave thorn alone be done when returned to edge of forest agreed that must lie down there in shade until sun have lost power for position being almost on equator heat out on sand be unbearable will be a well for one to keep watch lad mate said have seen sign of native there may be about sun be nearly overhead so will be four five hour before can set to work will take first watch in hour will wake mr joyce mr embleton will follow then nixon will take on till be time to move arrangement be carried out a sun sank towards horizon party went down to beach rotten wood be crumbled up fire quickly made then work of boring hole began be kept up night a be necessary to put very closely together piercer have to be heated two three time for hole two worked by turn while rest slept by sunrise hole be finished then work of sewing plank together began boat being turned on side to allow string a called to be passed backwards forward in two hour work be completed stephen cut off four five inch of duck from bottom of leg of trouser unravelling thread mate pressed into seam a fast a sewing be completed think that will do mate said looking with satisfied air at work now what want be little tallow to rub in there be candle handy when be on watch sir saw lot of bee flying in out of tree if must light on hive wax must do first rate so must steve however until can find one fancy will get on well enough five minute bailing occasionally will keep dry enough be sure at rate for river work now have got big job before let have try how can move nine men put strength to boat found that deep keel buried in sand that must not drag along then tried carrying mate two boy two men on one side other four men on other be heavy weight must just manage carried for twenty yard before put down will never do mate said ca use strength to advantage else weight must not be too great for let go up to wood lad chop four pole turn over lay down on in way think will have much difficulty about took longer than expected for wood be so tough that cutlass produced little impression upon after hour hard work however cut four pole about twelve foot long with returned to boat laid pole down on sand at equal distance apart turned boat over upon then man took end of pole two boy taking one end together at word lifted boat with comparative ease be very hard work under blazing sun have to stop hundred yard so to rest arm still be successful after three hour toil reached river oar have be lost when landed determined to take bottom board out cut into paddle first thing however be to bathe go far out mate said there may be shark alligator in river for aught know greatly refreshed by dip took board out of boat carried up into shade of tree with jack knife fashioned into rude paddle with thin creeper strip of wood tying down handle to add to strength took afternoon when sun have lost power put boat into water made experimental trip in be glad to see that seam be almost water tight that must need occasional use of bailer to keep clear at once paddled across river to opposite side then pulling boat up made rush for cocoa nut tree that have seen day before how be to get up joyce inquired looking with dismay at smooth trunk learnt that on west coast of africa mate replied be there two year got to know think there be to know with regard to steering boat in surf climbing cocoa nut tree be easy work in comparison fetch head rope of boat be done asked who volunteered for first climb will try mr towel joyce said if will show how stand by side of tree joyce now will put rope round round tree leaving certain amount of slack in loop now get grip of tree with knee then with hand shift loop up a high a can lean against get sort of purchase so shift knee bit higher doubt will feel awkward at first after little practice will find difficulty whatever in going up at fair rate of speed in spite of experience aloft joyce found hard work to climb tree a soon a be at top broke off nut dropped when have picked two nut for of party descended be not bit like cocoa nut stephen remarked a first came to ground look more like queer shaped gourd do lad mate agreed see be not ripe yet while get in england be over ripe instead of inside nut being enveloped in fibre whole thing be soft see here suited action to word can cut hole down right through then that have got to do be to drink milk men followed officer example be soon taking long draught of sweet cool liquor differs widely indeed from of ripe cocoa nut how be that milk be so cool sir steve asked be more than can tell for matter how hot weather milk of fresh cocoa nut be always cool why must be so have idea after have drunk milk broke open nut scraped soft cream like paste lined inside when nut ripened must have become hard solid will find of different degree of ripeness mate said of will furnish with drink with food a there be tree along here a far a can see need not worry a to victual well have done work for day will make camp talk over what be best thing to do next after much deliberation be decided that must paddle up river next day leaving two of number at edge of forest to keep look out for ship be a well to see what there be on river mate said of course if come to village will let drop down quietly again must keep sharp look out a go must never do to let get sight of for none of native of island be to be trusted be sure that none of wish to have head used a decoration in hut what hope to come upon be site of abandoned village people often shift quarter have belonging to speak of to move couple of day labour be enough for to put up fresh hut in place have occupied be sure to find banana if can get boat load of will be victualled for voyage after waiting long enough to give ship chance of finding sooner be off better many of island be inhabited by tribe spare one who fall into hand must be better to take chance on sea than to remain here there be good many little dutch settlement scattered about what have got to do be to light upon one of there be mistaking for native village once can get point of departure will have difficulty in laying course for timor java stephen will leave a junior officer here to morrow wilcox will stay with if see ship will light big fire throw green leaf on to make a big smoke a possible must know at once that be signal for native must hing to attract notice especially if intention be hostile right sir will keep sharp look out wo be away many hour suppose certainly not want to do exploring want to do be to look for food most likely food for to find be troop of monkey among tree overhanging river a rule must not like to shoot beast be too much like human being if can get supply of meat will be welcome matter what may be of course must not shoot many for couple of day must be outside that meat must keep good here might not firing gun bring native down on sir stephen said oh have seen sign of native mate said impatiently there may be within mile mile of probably not nearer than hill for believe be there that principally do what cultivation there be in first place because be cooler in next place because there be know tremendous swamp in low land of sumatra though whether be sumatra not can not say next morning boat started a soon a supply of cocoa nut sufficient for day have be thrown down two three of sailor adopting mean mate have taught joyce going up tree very much more quickly than have done what do think of 'ere business master stephen wilcox said a watched boat making way slowly against current know wilcox what to think of call risky affair sailor said after pause mr towel be good officer say a be must rather see older head on shoulder just at present be very well for to say a there may be native within twenty mile how be to know that there may be village just round turn of river chap be pirate when get chance mother son of there may be dozen war canoe lying mile up river must be natural that must be somewhere near mouth ready to start out if sail be sighted news be brought to that there be ship anchored off coast village within few hour row a to firing gun in opinion be just madness a say meat wo keep two day be just flying in face of providence to risk attracting attention of native for sake of day ration of fresh meat be very well to bring boat up here so a to lie out of sight of canoe happened to be passing along shore must much rather have left where be though allows must have be risky must have just chucked sail over covered that with inch so of sand so that must not have be noticed by boat short way out if there be village up here why boat might come down moment to do fishing there must be caught at once a for getting away with makeshift paddle must not be worth even thinking of hope chap will come back without having seen monkey village a much a banana then mate wo be hankering to go up again must make free to advise to get boat up amongst tree here till have decided that ship wo come agree to make start be with to extent wilcox do think that be risky thing going up river if be to fill up with cocoa nut must last for week anyhow then when saw grove of must land load up again ca take observation suppose mr stephen find out in rough way whereabouts be steve shook head wilcox if have have quadrant might have got near enough to have made rough guess for have got that watch bought in pocket have timed day with chronometer find that doe not gain more than minute day so at present moment be not much more than minute out by if have have quadrant must have made pretty close calculation be about degree half south at noon before cyclone struck see that must help now be pity sir sailor said for must help wonderful if must find out position within fifty mile so wish must wilcox stephen sat for time thinking at last said might anyhow find out in rough sort of way whether have be blown north south will see if can find perfectly straight stick ten twelve foot long if fix upright in sand shadow must help be th of march yesterday sun at noon must therefore be exactly overhead of line at twelve o'clock therefore if have be blown north must get very short shadow to south at twelve o'clock whereas if have be blown south there must be shadow north might not be more than inch long even must tell something selected long straight stick drove deeply into sand walked round several time so a to assure that be perfectly upright then returned again to shelter of tree hour later sound of gun came to ear have found of monkey wilcox growled three more shot be heard how far be off do think stephen asked dunno sir if be on open sea calm like must say might be two three mile in 'ere forest there ai no saying at reckon must be above two mile anyhow be if stream be a strong up there a be here be making very slow way against when started reckon have be gone about hour must not have got more than two mile away against stream well hope that will be content now turn back again hour passed then heard gun again be quickly followed by more monkey wilcox exclaimed in tone of disgust hope be monkey stephen said listen there be four more shot close together sailor leapt to foot believe be right sir cussed firing have brought native down upon must not want to keep on firing at monkey will hear in minute if fire again have emptied piece if load quick fire again will be bad sign there be broke off a two shot be heard be afraid that settle sir settle too for if be attacked there ai ghost of chance of getting away there wo be much more chance of doing so four more shot be heard then be quiet now sir will be getting pretty deep in among tree keeping close to bank so that can look through bush without being seen if boat come along right there ai harm done if come along after bit will know what have happened picking up gun wilcox be about to turn off into wood when stephen said have better take three four cocoa nut wilcox there be saying whether will come back to place be a well to have something to eat tied nut together threw over shoulder started along river bank stream be bordered by thick undergrowth afforded effectual screen for anyone behind after going for about quarter of mile stopped to listen there be faint throbbing sound in air paddle steve exclaimed ay native paddle sir men paddle like fancy went on after listening again there be more than one canoe settle sir there be chance of ever seeing mate again oh say that wilcox even if have be killed others may have be taken prisoner ca believe have be murdered well hope not sir look very black if have pounced upon sudden there have be no fighting might have kept prisoner day two till made grand feast killed that firing heard settle to mind must say there ai manner of doubt that fellow will have killed of nigger expect that two canoe closed in on then must be over in minute when canoe be within quarter of mile rower broke into sort of chant with occasional wild shout yell there come wilcox said a two long canoe paddling abreast rounded turn in river short distance away there must be something like fifty men in canoe in short time canoe came along at high rate of speed sailor gave sudden exclamation of fury what be steve asked see sir in stern of of canoe piled up by steering oar there be head ca look at steven said drawing back from peep hole through leaf be white sailor muttered there ai doubt about must give pay for voyage to have tiger crew here that might give murdering villain volley stephen did not hear have thrown down tear be running down cheek loss of second mate who have always be cheery kind of fellow apprentice joyce completely unnerved up to now have hoped what before have be doubt a to fate have now be converted into certainty give way master steve sailor said stooping over laying hand on shoulder be bad job there ai no denying happened to hour ago may happen to before long have got to be up doing sir be right wilcox steve said a rose to foot in first place must count head there be pile of in boat there may have be three there may have be four in well one thing be certain wilcox must find out if of be still alive if so must try get out of malay hand be ready to try sir when chap see thing a that seem to care much for life at least if be caught can polish off few of villain before go under so be game to do anything may order be not for to order wilcox be only young apprentice be experienced sailor now that be alone in danger together be for to lead well if be way look at sir be willing to do can if find there be of mate alive will get out if be possible never fear do think canoe be going to put to sea steve asked not have just gone down to mouth of river to see whether boat came from ship lying off shore whether be alone there do hear yell have got out of canoe found place where camped last night walked about there good bit ai likely will be able to find out whether there be seven nine of besides think will look much for must take for certain must go up river together so must have done if have not be that be left behind to look out for sail in hour two canoe came back again kept well over to opposite side of river to avoid full force of current sailor stephen attempted to count head in stern must not make out number be inclined to agree that two dark mass be about same size think there can only be three in boat steven said in case one man may have be made prisoner at rate wilcox will go on see a soon a canoe have gone round bend of river proceeded on way ground presently became exceedingly swampy must see by piece of dead wood litter caught among bush that in time of flood river must overflow bank extend long distance into forest from time to time have to wade waist deep across channel by water from marsh be draining slowly into river before crossing at wilcox suggestion cut down bush beat water with expect there be end of alligator in swamp sailor said know that native before cross stream where brute be likely to be hiding beat water with stick bush to frighten away be hard work walking for often sunk knee deep in wet soil after toiling for nearly hour heard confused noise ahead must ere long make out beating of drum wild shout of malay mingled with deep roaring sound made by horn now went on more cautiously presently must make out through tree large native village standing upon rising ground by side of river creeping cautiously to edge of bush must see that large number of men woman child be assembled in open space between house water woman be bringing bundle of wood column of smoke rising in centre of crowd showed that preparation for feast have begun if have one of ten pounder loaded with grape with said must pour volley into black devil if cost life afterwards what do think be going to do wilcox reckon there ai much doubt about sailor replied be going to make feast of mess mate stephen uttered exclamation of horror disgust do mean to say that be cannibal wilcox in course ca say for certain master steve of tribe be cannibal ai reckon by what see going on that villain be be good climber sir do mean climbing tree have never have much practice at wilcox dare say must manage well sir be lighter more active than be be thinking that if must get up to top of tree must have view down over village leaf be pretty thick a nigger be busy there be not much chance of looking about for man up tree see village ai above hundred fifty yard away ground ai more than twenty foot above river must say that tree be seventy eighty foot high so that from top can get view pretty well over place if there be one of chap there may be lying tied up somewhere of course might be in hut be much more likely that must have just chucked down until wanted think if got on shoulder must be able to get hold of lowest branch where bend down climb along to trunk after that branch come pretty thick together think must manage easily enough well then here go sailor said took up post beneath where bough be lowest if ca reach from shoulder sir step on head can hold easy enough keep trunk a far a possible between village leaf be thick up high steve said looking up at tree directly get above level of smaller tree spread branch out well now jump upon back sir then climb upon shoulder have best take hold of hand to steady be necessary a sailor have suggested for steve to stand upon supporter head before must get hold of branch sufficiently strong to bear weight a soon a did so drew up be soon climbing main trunk higher got more convinced be that must not be observed by native for tree behind formed background therefore must not be seen against sky kept however a sailor have told on other side of trunk when have gained smaller branch at top of tree looked out through opening in foliage village seemed to lie almost at foot must see object on ground be not long before perceived figure lying full length in front of one of hut close to spot where people be gathered be certainly european from whiteness of trouser felt sure that be mate joyce counted number of hut found that one beside figure be lying be eighth in line facing river there be two line of hut with sort of street between behind second row rise on village be situated fell rapidly away jungle grew almost up to back of hut in second line stood somewhat further apart than in first observed that sixth house in back line be opposite eighth in front having gathered information descended tree what news sir sailor asked a stephen dropped from bough to side there be one of comrade lying by hut can tell by white duck that be mr towel joyce whether be alive dead of course ca say did not see move doubt must be tied hand foot saw nothing of others there must be reason why must be treated differently from if be dead may be sure of well be better than have hoped if can save one will be something have be examining ground stephen went on must work round close up to second row of hut must count six of then go along by side of sixth cross street to hut opposite prisoner be lying in front of mean on river side of of course there be doing anything until sun have set except might work round to hut will be easier to get through horrid swamp before get dark than afterwards there will be le fear of stumbling breaking branch what time do think be now think be more than eight bell yet wilcox said be lot of hour to wait must give good bit to be out of swamp before get dark howsomever if keep along by river coming back ca lose way be one comfort well let work round at once then will see how land lie be like enough that a soon a have got big fire made up cooking begun will most of turn in for sleep till heat of day be over begin feast after sundown generally do sleep day then keep up night accordingly started through wood in quarter of hour found at foot of rising ground on village stood have counted hut now crawled up through thick bush stood within few yard of sixth hut swamp have be very deep on way have have greatest difficulty in getting through stephen have once sunk below waist in mud must have be unable to extricate have not sailor held on by young tree with one hand while stretched out other to be right now a far a colour go wilcox now do stay here will crawl along by side of hut have look up down street did not see soul between row of hut when be in tree when stephen peeped out by side of hut saw that there be several people about apparently returning from spot where have congregated rejoined companion waited hour by time perfect silence have fallen on village heat be intense even in forest sound have ceased a if bird insect be alike indulging in mid day sleep will go have look again now stephen said if find one about will cross street try to cut rope bring here at once if there be guard over will come back again to ought to be able to silence guard without giving alarm especially a be likely to be half asleep have better leave pistol here master steve take cutlas pistol shot now must bring whole village down on must have chance of getting through swamp with hundred of fellow after have better draw sword leave scabbard belt here in first place be handier to have sword ready be not so likely to knock against anything when have got in hand a must be trailing behind a crawl along will be on look out sir will be by side in brace of shake if hail stephen parted bush then stepped lightly to corner of hut not soul be to be seen moving about dashed across to house opposite crawled along by side then looked round great fire have burned low stephen shuddered a eye fell upon mass of ember thought of what be lying below there be one about whole of native have retired to hut in moment be beside prisoner be joyce band of cord like creeper be wrapped round leg wrist be tied together from rope went to peg four foot beyond extending arm at full length beyond head similar fastening from ankle kept leg at full stretch in other direction fastened thus malay evidently considered that there be necessity for guard over joyce old fellow stephen whispered in ear be conscious lad opened closed eye with start illustration stephen crawl to rescue of chum joyce speak stephen went on be really steve be dreaming be awake enough tom be here with wilcox will soon get thing off drawing jack knife cut bond do think that can walk tom thing be not very tight only being pegged out like must not move inch stephen be lying down by side while cut fastening now looked round again there be one in sight tom have better wriggle along until get to corner of hut a soon a be round corner stood up a did so sailor put head out through bush waved silent cheer stephen went first a soon a saw that street be empty beckoned to companion ran across to other side moment later joined sailor latter gave grip to joyce hand then held out to cocoa nut have just cut open in readiness seized eagerly took long drink be choking with thirst joyce gasped a finished content of nut take care how go through bush sailor whispered a turned led way everything be so quiet that rustle might be heard went along with greatest caution bare foot fell noiselessly on spongy soil sometimes a sank into mud suck of air a drew out made sound startled at last reached tree where have left cocoa nut with exception of one that sailor have brought on when stopped joyce threw down burst into tear leave alone said a stephen began to speak to will be better directly have be awful will tell about afterwards tried to make up mind to stand bravely be getting out of when there did not seem to be chance in world have upset in five minute rose again to foot be ready to go on now said yes think be time to be moving sir a soon a beggar wake up find have gone will set out in chase longer start get better chapter v again on island over such ground be impossible to hurry in three quarter of hour reached edge of wood have be thinking that have better take to water for bit stephen said be sure to think that have made for coast will not be long in finding footmark though know much about malay expect can follow track like other savage only thing to settle be whether will swim across river go along in direction keep on side have not seen anything of alligator think shark ever cross bar come into fresh water right sir if think be best to cross be ready wilcox said dip will do good for heat in wood be enough to roast ox besides will wash mud off must look about for log to put gun pistol ammunition on must not risk wetting that there be many piece of drift wood by edge of water choosing one of fastened weapon cartridge on top then entering water pushing before swam over to opposite side then taking arm again let log drift down river keeping in water ankle deep followed stream down to sea continued course along sand washed by surf how long start do think will get wilcox stephen asked must say that two hour be a much a can hope for well will be good long way off by time feel new man after swim so do joyce said speaking more briskly than have hitherto done well have better set off at trot sailor said expect beggar can run good deal faster than can great thing be for to get so far away before get dark that wo be able to see figure if be eight bell before fairly set off after will only have little better than two hour half be sure to be thrown out for bit at mouth of river will see footstep at water side wo know whether have crossed have kept along on side very likely of will go one way other still be sure to have talk delay ought not to travel twice a fast a have at rate must have to do to catch before be dark set off at brisk trot sand be fairly hard below spot where surf rushed up over walking be easy in comparison to in swamp on loose sand still be hot work sun blazed down upon there be not breath of wind be drenched with perspiration kept on steadily however slackening only occasionally into walk for two three minute then going on again at sharp pace wo catch before get dark sailor said confidently reckon must be making near seven knot hour even malay must not go at fourteen besides will have to keep sharp look out for footmark in sand above water mark a might at time come up from water take to forest anyhow must keep up a long a can go ai running for amusement be for big prize for life depend on keeping ahead anxiously watched sun a sank down towards horizon there be exclamation of satisfaction a disappeared below water half hour will be able to take easy stephen said must not think must keep up search after dark then must safely take to forest wind be springing up already light drifting sand will cover sign of footstep before morning have better keep in water a long a can master steve ca trace footstep here might under tree sort of chap be like dog expect can pretty well follow by smell hope of getting head will keep at a long a there be slightest chance of overtaking well may a well be on safe side anyhow wilcox will keep on here a long a can drag foot along have got boot to pinch corn time surf rush up cool foot so ought to be able to keep on till eight bell in middle watch by time must think will have gone something like forty mile from river that sailor agreed be about four bell when swam across in four hour have certainly gone twenty four knot must say bit further than if only make three knot for next six hour will have logged over forty by eight bell must say that even malay will hardly come a far a especially a men who take side wo be sure that have not gone other have be caught by mate kept steadily on speed gradually abated for last two hour before hand of stephen watch pointed to twelve o'clock stumbled rather than walked think will do said at last be nearly eight bell now let tread in other footstep a well a can so that there will only be one line of mark change from firm sand to yielding drift in foot sank three four inch finished although have not more than hundred yard to walk to tree seemed to that must never get there at last reached edge of forest staggered few pace in then without word dropped down almost instantaneously fell asleep sun be high when woke stephen be first to get on to foot went to edge of tree looked across to satisfaction saw that drifting sand have obliterated trace of passage then vote wilcox said when be told news that go bit further into wood camp there for day be just aching from head to foot think must go on bit further wilcox see there be cocoa nut here must keep on until come to grove of tree be never far apart may not have mile to go certainly ca stay here day without something to eat drink see threw nut away when started suppose be right sir sailor said slowly getting up on to foot be hard after run a made yesterday to have to get up anchor again well can take easily wilcox will stop at first cocoa nut tree come to now tom a go along will tell about yesterday have not heard word yet well began joyce paddled up river a know be a much a must do sometimes to make head against current suppose have be gone about hour when saw troop of monkey on bough of tree overhanging water did not seem bit afraid of chattered screamed shot three of did not fire for must not bring to kill one of be like shooting at child picked out of water put in boat then paddled on again have just got to turn in river when two big canoe came round corner be of use trying to get away for must go six foot to one mr towel stood up in stern held arm up to show that be friendly directly afterwards shower of spear came whizzing down at one hit jackson who be in bow somewhere in body fired at then fell down in bottom of boat then rest of fired for moment sheered off men have just time to reload gun when malay came at men fired again moment later canoe ran alongside took to pistol malay came leaping on board like demon know anything more about part of business for got crack on head with club did not know anything more till be hauled on shore chucked down then saw bring from canoe head of others be frightful then dragged body out from bottom of canoe have be stripped believe must have fainted if big malay have not given tremendous kick made walk up to village a soon a got there tied up staked out there be tremendous noise shouting yelling what be done know a must see nothing sky wall of hut be awful time first because knew sooner later must kill in next place because be driven pretty nearly mad by fly thing settled on face of course must not brush away must do be to shake head did not seem to mind that seems ridiculous that after seeing one friend killed knowing that one be going to be killed one must worry over fly can tell went nearly out of mind with irritation at tickling of foot seemed to that be there for age though knew by height of sun that be only about noon thirst too be fearful made up mind that sooner came killed better found talking sort of nonsense do think must have gone out of mind before day be over when first heard voice thought must be dream like of other idea came into mind have thought of when be first fastened up wondered whether malay must find have even thought at first that if only knew where be might try to get away after dark if be not killed before can guess feeling when became convinced that be really how did know what have happened must have be insensible for good bit tom heard firing thought that there be too much of for shooting monkey that must have be attacked so made way along among bush by bank presently two canoe came down made out head in stern of boat went to mouth of river to see doubt if there be ship there came back again in hour tried to count head of thought that there be about same number in boat of course must not be sure determined to come on to village find out for certain climbed up high tree short distance from one where came upon cocoa nut made out lying beside hut knew by white duck that be poor towel then worked round waited until village have gone off to sleep then came for see malay have idea that there be more white about therefore took trouble about doubt thought that boat have escaped from wreck that who have got away in have gone up river together ah there be cocoa nut be glad walk be over for be beginning to feel hot thirsty so be stiff sore over cocoa nut tree be first of grove stephen who be by far most active of party soon climbed one of tree threw score of nut down went little distance further back into forest consumed content of four nut then two of lay down to sleep again while other kept watch march be not resumed until after sunset have meal of cocoa nut before started took three nut for use on journey again walked at edge of water a have done day before be by far pleasantest way kept on until daylight appeared then again went into wood must think now stephen said a after good sleep ate cocoa nut breakfast that need not bother more about malay of village be quite possible that passed last night though of course sand hill must have prevented seeing question be now what be to do next be what be thinking time that be walking last night joyce said ca keep on tramping living on cocoa nut for ever be quite certain tom there be reason why must do so there must be village on coast when start evening vote keep along here instead of going down to water where there be village there must be fishing canoe have got to do be to take one put to sea mean to say that can get in push straight away for must have provision when have found village can hide up near get a many cocoa nut a can carry besides there be sure to be banana other fruit tree close by after laying cocoa nut down by edge of water can go up cut a many banana a like then will have enough food to last ten day so there be one comfort wherever may land there can not be worse lot of malay than there be about here be capital plan master stephen wilcox said have not be thinking of village except a to how to get past a say there be reason why must not make off in canoe next night kept along just inside tree have walked two hour when found that ended abruptly that stood on edge of clearing here be village stephen yes one hardly hoped to find one so soon well first thing be to go down search in sand hill for canoe four five be found lying together in hollow twenty yard beyond high water mark examined carefully of will do wilcox said think be best one be little larger than others wood feel newer sounder expect be meant for four paddler will carry fair cargo well be settled then stephen said propose that go back little distance from village get cocoa nut at once bring back hide in bush not far from where clearing begin will save time to morrow why must not go to night joyce asked be only about nine o'clock now if get cocoa nut near here can make two three journey down to boat with be off before midnight so might tom what do say wilcox sooner better say sailor replied a mr joyce say can be off by eight bell easy will be out of sight of village long before daybreak well wilcox will mr joyce get cocoa nut while be doing will creep round clearing get banana can see lot of broad leaf over there a get will bring to corner by time have got store of nut will have pile of banana think have better go four five hundred yard away before cut nut for come down with such thump that native who be awake here might very well hear will go bit away sir wilcox said if take pain to let drop time just a there be puff of wind there be fear of hearing separated stephen entering clearing soon came upon banana tree with long bunch of fruit two of be a much a must carry portion of work be soon done indeed have carried down to water edge before companion have brought three load of cocoa nut to point where have left helped to take down then canoe be lifted carried to edge of water being taken in far enough to float time surf ran up then fruit be placed in wish have poor mr towel with to take through surf wilcox said wish have fortunately be not very heavy sir be sure not to be sailor said have noticed that always put village at point where surf be lighter than usual suppose water be willower deeper something know what be there be certainly difference besides there have be wind to speak of since landed wave be nothing to what be then now gentleman a be more accustomed to sort of thing than be will take place in stern where can steer bit moment float a surf come in see chance be good one will give word then will paddle a hard a can go out a surf draw back so a to meet next wave before break everything depends on that took place in canoe grasped paddle that have found in two three wave passed under then saw one higher than others approaching will go out on back of one wilcox said paddle moment surf lift canoe let be washed up foot wave fell over with crash torrent of foam rushed up towards now wilcox exclaimed a white line reached bow paddle for life for moment in spite of desperate effort be carried upwards then canoe seemed to hang in air be riding forward with speed of arrow on receding water know wilcox shouted a rush of water ceased drove ahead to meet next wave rose higher higher canoe reached a passed under stood almost upright two three more desperate stroke heard crash behind row row wilcox shouted a felt boat drawn backwards be for few second then moved ahead again passed over next wave be safe now settled to steady paddling before have gone many hundred yard from shore no longer felt long smooth roller over canoe glided insensibly by daylight land have left be far behind low lying coast have sunk from view hill behind be almost shrouded from sight by mist rose from swamp be well rescued mr joyce before be dark sailor said to stephen one night in swamp be enough to lay white man up with fever be why be so anxious to get away at once did not think that must kill straight off if have wanted for feast must have cut off head when caught expect must have kept for other occasion wanted to get out of before mist began to rise from swamp now sir a be well away will put head north south think matter much wilcox there be high land just ahead now may a well make in direction a other if get to small island on way must think that must be safest to land there wait for few day anyhow a agreed before to see if there be sign of sail at rate wo go near by daylight island likely to be inhabited after paddling for hour saw low island seemed to be about quarter of mile in diameter headed towards before reached however wilcox said do know joyce have be thinking for time that knew that hill be pointing to now have opened out bit more feel sure of lad ceased paddling looked intently at hill now twelve mile away have flat top seemed to be split asunder by crack running through know now stephen exclaimed excitedly be island where wreck be be sure enough sir have be thinking be so for time be only now that have caught light through gap at top be more open from point where tiger lay when started for shore if row on for mile two then make straight for think will just about strike point where wreck be lying no think have better wait while mr joyce said a latter dipped paddle in water turned boat head towards island think have better wait till sun get pretty low know there ai village near wreck for must have be there good month afore found be certain then that native have be near still there may be higher up on slope might make out so be better that must not get within six eight mile of land before begin to be dark must not go to better place first of there be native secondly may pick up sort of useful thing about shore did not see anything bale wreckage where landed be rock there now of cask thing may have floated along have be cast up upon sand then be about likeliest point for sighting tiger skipper must naturally say to there be saying where boat have gone to if be anywhere near island where lost must be likely to make for wreck in hope of finding provision cast up there so must sail round to have look think must boy agreed letting boat drift quietly made hearty meal of banana cocoa nut milk then lay down in canoe dozed for hour two lad be roused by wilcox saying think gentleman can paddle on quietly now sun will be setting in le than hour resuming seat paddled gently on until sun disappeared then quickened pace in hour reached shore have difficulty in landing for side on wreck be lying be sheltered by island from roller be sandy beach think that be far from spot wilcox said for made straight for crack on hill kept open while reckon ca be more than mile from where wreck be lying suppose will see anything of that cyclone must have finished however will walk along shore till get to spot can not mistake that will keep bit back from sea may light upon something a go will be sure to be well inland know saw how far sea washed thing up beside wreck night be too dark however for to distinguish object ten yard away soon came down to water edge again following until character of shore changed rock took place of sand be right sailor said now think have better go back to boat again till get daylight must never do to walk across rock in dark with naked foot be bad enough when be light must cut foot to piece if tried now there be hurry about a be within mile of wreck know that everything be pretty well smashed up went ashore there so that be far more likely to find something on sand will see tiger just a well from where canoe be a from wreck first thing to look for be water say that cocoa nut must not supply for week if be going to stay here long for part see anything better to do must either find cocoa nut grove water think be likely to find cocoa nut grove stephen said why not sir have mostly on island be true stephen agreed must say be just because there be none here that there be village anywhere about did not think of sir yes expect be right in case be still more necessary to hunt for water if can find within four five mile side of wreck be right because tiger must not come here without seeing must not like to be much further away however most of island have water especially when be hilly a have be lucky so far will be hard if find stream of sort along ten mile of shore next morning set out on tour of exploration be not long before came upon many relic of wreck plank spar remains of cargo lay nearly two hundred yard from shore bore sign of rough usage have marked wreckage among rock hurrah there be tub joyce shouted a reached top of low sand hill broke into run be soon standing beside six cask lying short distance apart salt junk wilcox said a looked at cask first came to bad thing cocoa nut be good for drink soft pulpy stuff inside go very far after chap have be eating for week want to get teeth into something more substantial ai no good went on giving kick at next cask unless native come up open trade with be good shipped at calcutta be better went on a looked at next 'ere be biscuit with biscuit salt junk banana now then man need grumble next two be like second filled with trade article last be cask of flour well can stop here couple of month if like gentleman if can hit upon water for of course must look beyond line of sand river can cut through little stream must find way underneath sand to sea a approached rocky ground rose like ridge must be traced far inland sailor said be most likely spot water came down from hill must run along at foot of rock to sea think that be right wilcox foliage look brighter along by rock than doe anywhere else must not be surprised if found stream there a approached rock within hundred yard hope became certainty for there be growth of verdure quickened step ran forward to disappointment there be stream however small have got to dig for wilcox said there be water not far down will swear soil be chiefly composed of sand set to work with hand to scrape hole in have got foot down when soil became moist foot lower water began to ooze out of side into hole thank god for that sailor said reverently that make safe evening when get cool will bring paddle here will soon dig hole for well ca do better than roll tub here sink in hole bring canoe to edge of rock down by sea then have only got to chop bough make sort of hut will be a comfortable a if be back home be curious finding rock here joyce said presently a made way over to for distance that have gone along by sea have be nothing sand be rum black looking stuff too expect be lava stephen said there be lot of volcano among island believe that high hill be one that if be to climb up must find there be crater there see be just in line with gap rock go exactly in direction expect that in eruption ever so long ago crater split there lava poured down here into sea very likely that be stephen must have be long time ago anyhow see there be big tree growing on in ten minute arrived at spot where wreck have be keel remained there with exception have entirely disappeared took look among wreckage cut off length of rope coiled up also sail sailor pronounced to be top gallant sail rolled up fastened by short piece of rope then sailor taking middle lad end on shoulder carried to what already called well will set to work at once to rig up tent under shade of tree sailor said will keep night mist off better than branch will bring sail over to cover ground keep mist from rising inside be going to cook junk in joyce asked suddenly sailor looked at companion in dismay dash timber said never thought of be go perhaps can manage in native way boil thing by putting water into big shell dropping hot stone into until boil have not got shell might find hollow in rock will hold water be very well wilcox how be going to heat stone have done there master stephen sailor said in tone of utter disgust have not got flint tinder might manage tinder easily enough stephen said by using rotten wood tinder be of use without steel will have to eat biscuit without meat wilcox unless can light fire by rubbing two stick together that ai to be done sir have seen white men try over over again have tried ai manner of good almighty have given lot of knowledge that have not given to black fellow have balanced up by giving knack of lighting fire have not given to never heard of white man who must make fire in way well will have try anyhow joyce said there ca be anything special about malay that can make fire more than white man may try a much a like master joyce sailor said shaking head solemnly mark word wo be able to do be pity too for with wood have be drying a if on purpose for must have have one without being afraid of smoke well must not grumble have got lot to be thankful for can do without meat well enough yes mr joyce wilcox said reluctantly only know wish have not come across cask of salt junk then one must never have thought about seeing there not being able to cook be enough to make saint grumble must say not if be really saint wilcox however make up mind that be not going to get teeth into junk till give up hope of making fire well sir will roll three barrel over here then set about rigging up tent there be nothing like being busy by nightfall have got tent up have have argument over best site must have preferred to have erected on low ground near well finally point be decided upon little distance higher level spot being found on rock where tree offered convenience for pitching surface of rock be fairly flat few armful of coarse grass sufficed to fill up inequality render even enough for sleeping on here have advantage of getting sea breeze of having wide view across water while tree growing behind completely hid tent from being seen from higher ground before erecting have deepened well found that water be clear good that flowed in so abundantly there be fear whatever of supply falling short next morning wilcox joyce started for early walk with view to seeing whether there be thing thrown up on sand beyond rock stephen be to stay behind at tent keep watch for sail will leave gun behind with master stephen wilcox said mr joyce have got pistol have cutlas if want back if make out sail fire off will come back a quick a can fidget if be time away cask may have floated good bit along before got thrown up be just a well to see thing through now then sha' have to do again will keep good look out for sail too for be like enough that may be long way beyond sound of gun see can make out from here that mile further on tree come down to near sea again just a did on other island will take cocoa nut with in case must not light upon there sha' be uneasy about because know for certain that there ai native near in same way need not trouble about right wilcox will see whether ca get junk cooked for ready for meal at sailor smiled grimly all right sir if find meat cooked for will guarantee will eat even if be a tough a alligator chapter vi home a soon a companion have left stephen went off brought up a much dried wood a must carry among piece of plank be almost rotten crumbled up then set cask of salt junk on end with heavy piece of rock hammered away until forced head in then took out good sized piece of meat put into well water here be constantly changing current flowing through towards sea then brought up two three more load of wreckage sat down under awning for must scarcely be termed tent a end be open to allow free passage for air here sat for hour occasionally getting up looking over sea to right left be not until be nearly noon sun be overhead that must try experiment upon relied to obtain fire when be nearly vertical went down to well opened watch case dipped glass carefully into water thought of trying to take out of case risk of breaking must have be too great carrying very carefully went up to tent again sat down beside little heap of crumbled wood held watch glass full of water over a expected found that made admirable burning glass only drawback being that be only available when sun be overhead almost instantaneously a focus fell upon wood latter began to smoke in le than minute flame sprang up small splinter that have got ready be placed on in very short time fire be blazing a soon a wood be well alight have poured off water very carefully wiped glass rim held went short distance away a soon a fire be burning well be pleased to find that smoke be given off sun having dried wreckage until not slightest particle of moisture remained in now kept sharp look out along shore be not until nearly five o'clock that saw companion issue from tree mile half away move along sand went down to well took out meat brought up laid on rock to dry felt sure that by time water must have removed greater portion of salt that must now be able to roast satisfactorily have already got two forked twig a support for spit taking ramrod from gun thrust through meat have ceased putting on fresh wood moment saw others come from forest fire soon sank down to mass of glowing ember over put meat end of ramrod being supported by forked twig turned round round occasionally to prevent from burning although have be indifferent a to whether must obtain mean for cooking junk felt ravenous appetite a odour of meat rose just a came to conclusion that meat must be cooked through wilcox joyce arrived stopped in amazement a eye fell on fire come on wilcox stephen said with laugh stand staring there dinner be ready be only waiting for to begin be downright famished sailor said a came up must not have believed if have not seen how on earth did manage not by rubbing piece of wood together wilcox by filling watch glass with water using a burning glass lit wood in le than minute only must not do know unless sun be right overhead have to wait until twelve o'clock before tried experiment meat be cut up into three huge portion using biscuit a plate speedily set to work upon have pretty well got rid of salt wilcox said after first mouthful be well nigh a good a roast meat how did do sir be in well for seven eight hour stephen replied water be running through so that be a good a putting into river salt meat be best boiled a have pot to boil in thought must try roast a say water have got rid of salt altogether be best bit of meat have eaten since left england wilcox said well mind now if stop here for month have meat biscuit reckon mr stephen that will be able to think of plan for making flap jack out of flour have found cocoa nut grove so will be able to live like king next morning stephen be again left in charge of fire other two started to fetch fresh load of cocoa nut saying that must be back by twelve o'clock must expect to find that have got something new for after putting piece of meat into well stephen made fresh experiment fishing out great lump of fat from cask first washed carefully to get rid of salt then put into cocoa nut shell placed on hot ember fried fat until most of melted then squeezed remainder between two flat stone then poured fat into cocoa nut half full of milk put three four pound of flour on flat rock made hollow in middle a have seen servant do at home while making pastry poured liquor gradually into mixing up with flour until have made whole into dough then cleared away portion of ember dividing dough into flat cake placed on hot ground hour later cleared space from ember turned cake over in twenty minute be baked through be pronounced excellent by companion a ate with meat must not be too lavish stephen said a know how long may have to wait here propose for breakfast that have biscuit only then for dinner will have meat biscuit again for supper cold meat cake how much meat do think there be wilcox there be supposed to be hundred half in cask mr embleton well that will last just about month stephen said at pound half day propose that have allowance for fortnight if there be sign of ship by time can then reduce ourselves to three quarter of pound day at rate will last for six week altogether flour biscuit must last twice a long must keep good stock of on hand so a to have store if take to canoe again proposal be agreed to have however be there about week when early one morning joyce discovered sail far away on horizon in great excitement hurried down to canoe have be brought along hauled up on rock put into water to see if sun have opened seam finding that have done so filled then hauled just beyond edge of water then went up to tent again there ai much wind sailor said will die away altogether in hour two be good doing anything until see way be heading if be tiger reckon be making for spot can wait till afternoon anyhow before take to canoe if be only chance ship find be bearing course brings anywhere near must take to canoe at once must say be good five twenty mile away anyhow can get out to before evening breeze spring up by nine o'clock made out that ship be certainly heading in direction then wind left presently saw swing broadside on to be very like tiger joyce said be just about same size barque rigged can not see hull be tiger sure enough wilcox said heading way made pretty well certain think must swear to now well vote start for at once what do say stephen think so tom certainly will be long row in heat that doe not matter have better put stock of biscuit cocoa nut on board one never know about weather here before night there might be cyclone then might have to run for must have to make for nearest land might not be able to get back here for two three day a have eaten first meal there be reason for delay canoe be emptied out store sufficient for two three day put on board be soon on way took bearing of ship by various point of island before started lest must come over thick ai use hurrying wilcox said a dipped paddle in water have got good five hour pull before whether be five seven make much difference have cut square of canvas with to cover head shoulder at short interval dipped in sea so kept off at least portion of extreme heat boat be much le heavily laden than have be on previous journey went lightly through water in spite of agreement to take easy impatience to reach ship on whose upper sail eye be fixed a paddled prevented doing so for first two hour rowed at almost racing pace then heat of sun began to tell upon effort slackened pace decreased materially however must now make out line of hull above horizon knew that must not be at most more than eight mile away in little more than two hour be within mile of be old ship tiger by time must see that be object of eager curiosity on board presently heard loud cheer come across water have made out joyce said of course at first took for native canoe for must be looking for gig know yet what bad news have to tell in few minute be alongside a soon a be within hail captain have shouted out be well sir joyce who be in bow shouted back be sorry to say that mr towel rest have be killed by malay news effectually damped feeling of delight have be excited on board when be known that canoe contained three of boat party for whose safety greatest anxiety have be felt captain alone having entertained hope that gig must have lived through storm however a climbed up ladder to deck be shaken warmly by hand by officer crew then captain requested joyce stephen to come down to cabin while wilcox went forward to tell story to crew first third mate also came into cabin joyce then a senior told story of have happened from time cyclone have burst upon see sir said when came to conclusion owe life entirely to stephen wilcox see that plainly enough mr joyce captain said gravely behaved admirably in in whole subsequent proceeding be lucky indeed in hitting on spot where be separated be four hundred mile away when got out of cyclone wind have be very light have gone close to island have passed on way here be of course most doubtful whether must be able to find place where wreck be for too might have be carried hundred of mile in entirely different direction without instrument must have have small chance of discovering position finding way here still seemed only chance of course must not tell whether when landed found wreck have be stripped by native if have not done so seemed to must certainly make way there if must for must know there be native near might for must tell have found various store cast up must enable to live for long time have be a say sad business indeed six life have be lost a appears to from story unnecessarily be grievous mistake going up that river can understand mr towel anxiety to obtain stock of provision of sort to victual boat for long cruise must have endeavoured to ascertain first by following bank on foot whether there be native village there before venturing up in boat to fire gun until have ascertained that there be enemy near be instance of fatal carelessness cost so many life however poor fellow of course acted for best have paid dearly for error that expedient of yours for lighting fire steve be very ingenious one doe great deal of credit think that must have occurred to altogether young gentleman seem to have behaved extremely prudently well be sorry to tell that comrade archer be washed overboard in cyclone two of men be killed by being struck by spar got adrift news of archer death greatly destroyed pleasure of lad at finding safely on board tiger again took up work with very sorrowful heart for two month tiger continued cruise among island without adventure occurring by end of time have disposed of good have taken in large number of native production in exchange ship course be laid north again for calcutta where filled up with indian produce then sailed for home five month later arrived in thames only bad weather have encountered being storm a entered channel anchored at gravesend captain told stephen to land take post chaise up to london report to mr hewson that tiger must come up on tide next morning be eight o'clock in evening when stephen arrived at employer mr hewson received with great kindness be always very glad when hear that one of ship be safe in port said for however great confidence there be time when human skill strength be of avail did not expect that tiger must be back for month so be heartily glad to hear that have returned have gone well hope be sorry to say sir that have lost altogether nine life including of mr towel second officer archer fellow apprentice be bad indeed mr hewson said in tone of great concern how did happen stephen related briefly event have brought about misfortune be sorry indeed mr hewson said have concluded be consolation to that none of life be lost from deficiency in ship gear appointment boat must have be excellent one indeed to have carried in safety through cyclone in a know stoutest ship will sometimes founder a to accident on board be one of thing too often occur in heavy gale can not be provided against of course will hear from captain detail of affair a to adventure on shore must give much fuller account when have have supper will release at once from duty have better go down by coach to morrow morning to dover know father be anxious to see wrote to about three week ago asking when expected tiger to be home know what reason be think that must wish to be first to speak to about there be nothing wrong sir hope lad in way be matter altogether supper be brought up stephen did full justice to for ship have touched nowhere on way home from calcutta after feeding so long almost entirely on salt meat thoroughly enjoyed change of fresh provision next morning started by seven o'clock coach for dover arrived there at eight that evening have grown indeed stephen father said after first delighted greeting be over let think have be away nearly eighteen month doe make good deal of difference still have grown more than must have expected used to think that must be rather short now bid fair to be good average height have widened out amazingly where be trap lad have ordered to be sent up from coach office have not brought down with father tiger only got to gravesend at five o'clock yesterday afternoon captain sent up by post chaise to tell mr hewson that be in got to place at eight told that have better start by morning coach a knew that be anxious to see did tell what for stephen sir said that thought that must prefer to tell well stephen have be anxious for to get home for have letter from lord cochrane about three week ago told that have not forgotten promise have made to give berth if ever have chance said that opportunity have come now for that have be offered command of chilian navy must be shortly starting a soon in fact a must make arrangement get house off hand said that thought must be five six week before be able to sail that must take out with a flag midshipman of course wrote to at once saying where be that might be home day that on other hand might not be back for two three month however if arrived in time be sure that must be delighted at chance of serving under still said that of course must not ask to keep berth open for well wrote in reply that must at rate give month if at end of time have not heard of must appoint one else for a said ' know nothing of chilian language of course will want one to blow up in english stephen laughed must be splendid father have be very happy on board tiger certainly must not like to leave to sail on other trading ship one must be kinder than captain mate have be of course must like awfully to serve with lord cochrane especially a have heard so much of from why have chilians appointed foreigner to command fleet be fighting with anyone be fighting spanish stephen have gone into war to aid peru rather to free peru from oppressor chilians have only just started navy of own be altogether outnumbered by spanish wisely think that with man a cochrane who be host in who have won against much greater odds will be able to hold own have doubt will have stirring time only wish have be able to go with be good enough to say so in letter to be unfortunately out of question however stephen must choose for there be saying what may come of business know that lord cochrane be hot headed man one who doe not mince matter chilians believe be brightest most energetic of of south american people that know be not saying great deal cochrane be sure to be maddened by delay difficulty of kind if so will certainly speak out in way will ruffle feeling greatly may bring on trouble be what be called impracticable man stephen be soul of honour generosity so be altogether unable to refrain from giving vent to indignation disgust when see quality lacking in others have ruined own career here by intolerance of wrong whether wrong be inflicted upon upon others have rather injured than benefited cause of seaman by intemperate zeal with pressed reform by allying heart soul with ultra radical such man a may get on well with people like south american dashing bravery frankness disregard of ceremony will render popular among people at large will raise up for enemy innumerable among governing class can not therefore for minute think that present arrangement will be permanent one say to assure that can not expect to find permanent career in service of chili on other hand will have advantage of fighting under bravest officer of modern time will have doubt take part in brilliant feat to have served under cochrane will a long a live be feather in cap just a feel that be great honour for although have be to pecuniary disadvantage to have done so have exchanged letter with mr hewson on subject have behaved with greatest kindness in matter agrees with that must in respect be great advantage to have offered in kindest possible way to allow apprenticeship to run on while be with cochrane just a if be still serving with own ship whenever may return to england will reinstate in service time have be away counting just same a if have be with expressed doubt whether apprenticeship must count said that master being from circumstance unable to teach trade to apprentice a covenanted to do must with consent of apprentice hand over to employer that a will be learning sea a efficiently on coast of chili a elsewhere must loan a be to lord cochrane besides of course there be real necessity for passing through apprenticeship in order to become officer large number of men do in fact become officer without ever having be apprenticed a be only necessary to serve so many year at sea to pas examination still there be advantage other way ship owner prefer man who have served apprenticeship in good line of ship a must naturally be better mannered better educated therefore better fitted for position of officer in ship carrying passenger in way must be a well that must obtain discharge at end of term of apprenticeship from mr hewson although have doubt whether sea service under foreign flag must be allowed to count by examiner if went up to pas a mate upon other hand lad be now in good service be certain to get on if remain in have le chance of being shot than if go with cochrane know that father can tell have have just a close shave under captain pinder a must have under lord cochrane only three of out of nine got through other six be killed eaten by malay if spaniard kill man at least will not eat must certainly like to go with lord cochrane thought must a far a one can see there be chance of being engaged in naval war for many year to come for europe be in alliance with be likely to continue so even if have trouble with of fleet be so overpoweringly strong that even coalition of other power of europe must not stand against at sea be good thing doubt for nation peace a be likely to be give chance for naval men to distinguish must say that consider be fortunate indeed to have opportunity of seeing service under man who of others be distinguished for dash bravery be lord peterborough of present day who be father be military man in day of queen anne performed extraordinary feat of bravery in spain in many other respect character bore strong resemblance to of lord cochrane well stephen have better lose time propose that go up to town again to morrow morning doubt must like to see there be nothing like settling thing finally one interview be worth dozen letter let see mr embleton consulted sailing list a there be boat sailing to morrow will take coach must be better anyhow for there be never saying with certainty when packet will arrive with strong southerly wind may do in two tide though be only once in hundred time that manage still even three tide must be very fair must not risk chance be duty to let lord cochrane know a early a possible a doubt have many application must be glad to be able to say that matter be finally settled arrived in town next evening called upon lord cochrane first thing after breakfast next day on mr embleton sending in name be at once admitted be heartily glad to see old friend lord cochrane said a rose from table at be writing so be boy appearance save asking question when did get back arrived in town on monday evening came down on tuesday to dover returned here with last night have indeed lost time well young sir what do think of going out with must like above everything lord be deeply grateful to for offering post be to father lad that must be grateful not to for earned for so have have eighteen month in eastern sea yes sir very good school must say embleton one have to keep one eye open there yes indeed told on way up yesterday of adventure have have with malay a only three out of boat load of nine escaped must have be pretty sharp business if only three escaped must have be sharp indeed lord cochrane said must have have marvellous luck in getting out of malay hand will tell about on voyage out now come along with led way to dining room where lady cochrane be sitting while two child of four five year old be playing about dear said be lieutenant embleton whom have heard speak of score of time a most gallant officer most ill used man be son who be know going out with a flag midshipman have be eighteen month in indian archipelago let tell malay be much more serious foe than spaniard know youngster one of chief duty of admiral midshipman be to make agreeable to admiral wife family if there be such incumbrance go errand for attends when go shopping be sort of head nurse to child in service be generally nicknamed admiral poodle however a soon a get out there hope to find more attractive work for until do be sure wife child will be glad have someone with to speak english will be very glad to be of service can stephen said earnestly be afraid lady cochrane said with smile that will have very little opportunity of availing ourselves of service when once get out there will be carried off by lord cochrane will never set foot on shore again unless when absolutely driven to be time for sailing

daresay must have kept dawdling about here for month to come if have be that have be getting worst of out there at length occurred to that admiral place be in command of fleet not to act a sort of foreman in looking after single ship being built will embark at rye of course will be more handy for to send bring to boulogne expect that will be there on th so a to have time to shake down before start son have better be there on day will draw up commission a flag midshipman at once will hand to when dine with trust son will do evening be very fortunate that be disengaged for just at present be going through painful round of farewell dinner from political friend will be very glad to do so sir mr embleton said will not detain farther now a soon a left lord cochrane went to see mr hewson be arranged suppose latter said a entered have just left lord cochrane in first place stephen who be not much accustomed to return thanks have asked to say in name how extremely obliged be for most kind offer to allow to remain on book of fleet say more about embleton be very pleased that can be of service to to lad also captain pinder have spoken most warmly to of conduct during voyage behaved in respect excellently although happily captain be not laid up be therefore able to attend to detail of navigation say that have be disabled must have felt uneasiness on score stephen observation being to full a accurate a own especially speaks of in tone of commendation for conduct in unfortunate boat affair credit be due to sailor wilcox who be with through latter told captain that felt so certain that in boat have be killed that must not have undertaken risk of going near malay village have not be for lad insisting say too although junior to joyce lad rescued stephen be really leader that many of suggestion be most valuable wilcox be particularly strong on manner in lad contrived to kindle fire by using watch glass filled with water a burning glass altogether feel sure that boy will make excellent officer a go on be glad that will now have opportunity of seeing active service under cochrane agree with what said in letter that berth be by mean likely to be permanent one a soon a cochrane have relieved from state in now be be sure to be jealous of be last man in world to put up with slight to hold on to appointment when see that be no longer wanted still will do lad great deal of good make man of experience will put outside general category of mercantile sailor have got chest here be sent up yesterday will of course try find out who be captain of ship whose chronometer bought captain pinder have told about stephen be absolutely entitled to money got at same time offer to divide be generous one captain pinder mate be dead against accepting agree with money must be mere trifle round will be comfortable little sum for will be sure be satisfaction to to be able to purchase outfit now without trenching on purse especially a going out a cochrane own midshipman must take much larger outfit than usual a will of course have to accompany admiral on public occasion now suppose will like to go down to dock say good bye to there tiger began unloading yesterday good many of hand will be paid off to morrow captain pinder first third officer expressed sincere regret that stephen be not going to sail with on next voyage joyce be greatly cut up about wanted to go down with to stay with father mother near oxford said wrote to from gravesend have letter morning in told to make promise to come down before sailed again may be back again in year stephen replied if be think mr hewson will appoint to tiger again captain undertook to dispose of stephen collection of curio bird skin for also if news be obtained a to lost ship must when sailed again hand chronometer quadrant over to mr hewson to keep for mr hewson that evening again talked over question of bag of money with lieutenant embleton convinced latter that stephen be entitled to keep money to right be declared unquestionable stephen father be of same opinion argued question only because felt that fact that money be really extremely useful at present time might render unable to judge matter fairly really have answer to reason given by friend who be well assured must not urge matter upon did not feel that stephen be really entitled to keep money have entirely absolutely passed out of possession of former owner whoever be never heard said that anyone who be lucky enough to recover treasure in old wreck have right to retain questioned here not even wreck remained so will keep spend hewson if ever discover owner of ship let know will be prepared to discus question with will never discover good sir hewson said how can man in world say that money belongs to ship have disappeared in malay archipelago only possible clue be that afforded by chronometer here again be unlikely in extreme that owner of ship have perhaps be sailing sea for thirty forty year must be able to swear to chronometer lastly there be shadow of proof that chest in money be found came from same ship a chronometer may be proceeds of two different act of piracy will never hear anything about chapter vii cochrane career promised father stephen said one evening that must time other tell more about day when served with lord cochrane well lad will tell now first time ever saw be on day when joined hind at sheerness in june be young midshipman on board can tell be astonished at appearance for be between seventeen eighteen tall gawky fellow believe have have commission in army that taste lay altogether in direction of sea that obtained appointment to by influence of uncle who be post captain at time well know generally entered at age of fourteen may imagine surprise amusement at fellow arriving to begin who be a old a senior mid on board lord though be there be nonsense about cochrane be very pleasant fellow never saw anyone work so hard to learn profession a did actually satisfied even first lieutenant who be rough hard working fellow who have made way up after having got promotion from main deck having a used to call come in at hawse hole be admirable seaman heart soul in work ready to take off coat put on suit of slop work took rather dislike at first to cochrane first because be lord in second place because considered that have taken to profession too old to learn lastly because brought chest on board altogether beyond regulation size jack larmour soon made short work of that called up carpenter bade saw portion off chest cutting through just on one side of keyhole so that lock be now in corner cochrane only laughed said nothing have doubt lieutenant expected to say something hasty so get into trouble however jack soon changed opinion of new mid earnest desire of cochrane to learn willingness to put on rough suit work showed that be of right stuff made at last prime favourite of first lieutenant be only with then couple of month for be transferred to ship did not come across again until be appointed by lord keith to command of speedy lying at port mahon have done good deal of knocking about by time for hind be sent out to coast of norway where be suspected that french privateer used fiord a hiding place on return of hind from norway cochrane uncle be appointed to thetis hind crew be transferred to thetis went out with squadron for protection of island of nova scotia so well be cochrane thought of in january be appointed by admiral of station acting third lieutenant of thetis be soon after transferred with same rank to africa in july be confirmed in rank though have be two year at sea in africa coasted up down between canada florida looking out for ship of enemy in following january rejoined thetis whose first lieutenant have just be promoted then passed a lieutenant be afterwards appointed to speedy difficulty of not having served regulation time have be got over by uncle in way be not uncommon then may be still practised for aught know uncle thought that might one day wish to join navy have therefore entered name in book of various ship commanded so that nominally have formed part of ship complement in vesuvius carolina la sophie hind have therefore belonged to service for regulation period be bad practice lad in case of cochrane be mean of providing king navy with a gallant officer a ever trod quarter deck went down with from gibraltar to port mahon with midshipman who like have just passed be to join speedy be hoping to gain opportunity for distinguishing ourselves getting step first sight of craft be grievous disappointment be brig of ton a carried eighty four men six officer may imagine how be crowded on board armament consisted of fourteen four pounder ridiculous little weapon be more good than a many blunderbuss remember cochrane putting fourteen ball into pocket walking up down quarter deck saying that be probably only commander who have ever carried whole ship broadside in pocket be awfully disgusted a may imagine with craft applied for two twelve pounder to be used for stern chaser when got on board found that there be not room for to be worked have fired off few time brig be so weakly built that timber must not stand concussion be therefore obliged to send on shore again there be only height of five foot even in captain cabin remember that cochrane used to open skylight put head up through in order to shave placing soap dish in front of on quarter deck however be pleasant party on board cochrane be strict in performance of duty excellent fellow to sail with anxious for comfort of men officer without shadow of nonsense about first lieutenant have served for few month in rank rogers be acting lieutenant there be doctor one midshipman lord cochrane brother lord cochrane at time be twenty four nearly so first lieutenant be year older rogers twenty one have busy time on board speedy be continually up down coast popping into quiet creek little port in search of french privateer overhauling merchantman besides bearing what share must in general operation first prize be french privateer of six gun forty eight men have be ordered to convoy fourteen merchantman from cagliari to leghorn saw strange craft take possession of danish brig under escort crowded on inch of canvas set off in pursuit speedy be not misnamed whatever defect be certainly fast cochrane have managed to add to canvas carried when first took command main boom be sprung obtained from dockyard spar to replace however be good deal longer than original dockyard authority decided that must be taken down considerably instead of doing cochrane have about inch cut off from end have spar replaced hoisted when dockyard people came on board did not notice that length be unaltered a soon a got out more cloth of canvas be added to mainsail be thus enabled to carry considerable spread of canvas for so small craft soon overtook prize surrendered at once then set off in chase of privateer overhauled sight of long row of port hole crowded deck doubt leading frenchman to suppose be great deal stronger than be though in point of fact six gun carried much heavier weight of metal than fourteen pop gun together four day later five armed boat rowed out from monte cristo towards convoy be lying becalmed brig got out sweep to endeavour to interpose between charge two vessel however be lagging behind others be boarded captured to delight soon afterwards saw dark line on water directly reached set off in pursuit of captured merchantman be headed towards monte cristo breeze soon freshened presently overhauled recaptured then set off in pursuit of armed boat however reached shelter of shore battery before must overtake a duty be to protect convoy not to cut out prize hauled wind followed charge week later arrived with safely in leghorn road started to join lord keith squadron off genoa be blockading at sea while austrian beleaguered on land side here cruised outside town for few day then massena surrendered speedy be ordered to cruise off spanish coast on way captured native craft off elba sardinian vessel laden with oil wool be prize to french privateer towed into leghorn again started captured next day spanish privateer of ten gun thirty three men five gun boat came out from bastia in chase took prize in tow kept up running fire with gun boat until after chasing for hour gave up took several other prize sunk privateer lying under shelter of battery again took prize back into leghorn indeed seemed that be never to get away from place for starting again captured french privateer then fell in with frigate mutine salamine handed over to number of french prisoner that have taken have to carry prize back to leghorn at last got fairly away reached port mahon capturing neapolitan vessel with french prize crew on board a far a can remember nothing particular happened for next three month except got damaged in storm be six week refitting at port mahon three day after leaving port be off majorca there be several strange craft in sight picked out largest started in chase when french craft came out altered course to meet after exchanging fire with for time drew off got too close inshore drove on rock a be evident that must become wreck left captured one of other ship activity of speedy caused spanish authority to make special effort to capture once nearly fell into hand of spanish frigate have be painted a merchantman however opened port too soon fortunately be prepared for situation cochrane have have craft painted in imitation of danish brig be trading on coast whose appearance be familiar to spanish authority danish quartermaster have be shipped to answer inconvenient question directly discovered real nature of supposed merchant ship by opening port ran up danish colour on ship name being demanded gave that of danish brig spaniard however be not quite satisfied lowered boat whereupon ran up quarantine flag danish quartermaster on boat coming within hail then stopping at prudent distance informed that have come from african coast where plague be at time raging boat pulled off to frigate at once made sail left in solitude be narrow escape though possibly might have made a good fight of a did afterwards cruising about took considerable number of prize luck indeed be extraordinary anticipated that prize money must amount to large sum be on th of may that first serious adventure began have captured prize off barcelona swarm of gunboat came out to try to retake however kept at bay until prize have got off following night returned to station off town found that there be strict watch being kept ashore for gun boat at once came out when sailed towards made for shore keeping up fire at a retired again drew off again came out twice during day did same always returning when sailed in to meet fire be exceedingly accurate after skirmish with have to draw off repair damage seemed to that there must be object in gun boat action that be trying to decoy to go close inshore where larger ship might be ready to come out against just before daybreak on th again ran in towards barcelona a did so saw large ship creeping along under land a if making for port at once sailed to cut off when instead of trying to avoid changed course sailed towards saw that be spanish frigate two three of fellow have expressed opinion have attacked spaniard under whose gun have run three month before might have taken lord cochrane a soon a be made out to be frigate said to 'you will now have fair fight gentleman ordered boatswain to pipe hand for action tell lad seemed to that chance be slight indeed for nearly men two of officer be away in prize including officer boy have fifty four men on board so be probable that enemy have five six time that number while have four gun to fourteen miserable little piece thought certain must be blown out of water fancy everyone else thought same however held on straight towards fired gun hoisted spanish colour at time be almost abreast of cochrane who have american colour ready ordered to be run up gave time to get on to other tack hold on till little out of direct line of fire then at once pulled down star stripe hoisted british ensign spaniard fired broadside to made reply gun be trebly shotted cochrane have given order that not shot be to be fired until be alongside spaniard a fire must do damage to ship a headed for fired broadside like first did harm rounding up under stern cochrane ran alongside yard became locked in spaniard rigging then poured in broadside at distance did considerable damage on main deck first discharge having a afterwards learned killed spanish captain boatswain gun have be elevated to full extent for of course towered high above while shot struck up through main deck spanish gun roared overhead cutting up rigging doing harm below while fire continued to work havoc among heard order shouted to board be prepared for at once pushed off far enough to prevent from leaping on to deck while men caught up musket have be ranged in readiness against bulwark poured volley into a appeared at side in readiness to jump down then gave broadside closed up again twice again attempted to board time failed fight went on fellow be thoroughly excited ready for anything be clear that present state of affair must not last much longer rigging sail be cut to piece mast might at moment go frigate must then only have to cut free draw off short distance sink cochrane who be a cool a cucumber went along among men at quarter told that have got to take frigate be taken in case must probably get no quarter a spaniard must be maddened at loss have suffered from so insignificant foe need said few minute hard fighting to settle matter replied that be ready cochrane be always up to fun called portion of crew away from gun told to damp powder blacken face never saw such figure a be when came up cochrane ordered to board at enemy bow while rest of crew be to board by waist guthrie doctor volunteered to take helm when cochrane gave order rest of men boy sprang on to deck of spaniard through wreath of smoke have caught sight of preparation believing that intended to board by bow greater portion of crew be gathered there appearance of fellow face a emerged from smoke leapt upon deck with loud shout rushed at struck with astonishment be with party excited a be must scarcely refrain from bursting out laughing at dismay men certainly be enough to surprise anyone bathed in sweat worked up to pitch of wild excitement naked to waist with face body streaked with powder one must understand that superstitious spaniard already depressed by vain effort to overpower so puny assailant thought that be attacked by foe straight from infernal region a stood hesitating aghast went at while cochrane with force have boarded at waist fell upon in rear recovering spaniard made rush to waist defending stoutly for while seemed a if number must in end prevail spanish colour be still flying at peak cochrane observing told one of sailor to make way aft haul down a soon a spaniard saw flag disappear thought that officer must have surrendered at once threw down arm without giving time to think for officer to rally be hurried down into hold cannon be run round loaded with grape pointed down hatchway in case must make effort to retake ship a for must hardly believe in good luck fight have lasted hour half loss have be exceedingly small first lieutenant parker have be severely wounded in several place three sailor be killed seventeen wounded found that prize be gamo frigate with crew of three hundred nineteen men mounting thirty two gun firing broadside weight of one hundred ninety pound while have only fourteen small gun be between six seven hundred ton in fight have lost captain boatswain thirteen seaman killed forty one wounded casualty thus exceeding whole number of officer crew even in annals of navy there be instance of so successful action against such disproportionate odds naturally congratulated upon fortune being a good a made cochrane must of course at once receive post captain rank parker must receive step must get at least second lieutenantship cochrane brother be placed in command of prize sailed with to port mahon a have already told jealousy of lord exmouth hot temper of cochrane caused overthrow of hope cochrane after three month delay obtained post rank of must not deprive a having captured vessel of superior force be entitled to refused however to promote parker be simply scandalous altogether in defiance of usage of service be time before got berth again however after have repaired damage matter went on for time a before after taking prize met kangaroo whose captain be senior to cochrane requested to act with in attack upon fort of almanara silenced brought off spanish privateer two captain then determined to attack oropesa where fort be supported by twenty gun ship three gun boat have put in there with ten merchantman under convoy cochrane have fitted out at own expense spanish privateer of six gun have captured a tender to speedy have appointed brother to command in broad daylight kangaroo speedy tender sailed in to attack kangaroo engaged fort while young cochrane directed attention to war ship gun boat be a hot action a in ever took part for hour firing be incessant at end of time kangaroo fire be evidently telling on fort while fire of antagonist be slackening just a thought that victory be assured twelve gun felucca two more gun boat arrived from valencia to assist fort reinforcement inspired spaniard with fresh spirit cannonade against again became very heavy turned attention entirely to new comer with such effect that drove off then hammered away again at old opponent have satisfaction at last of sinking four of while three of merchantman have be in line of fire have also gone down action have lasted nine hour kangaroo have used up nearly ammunition felucca two gun boat from valencia have again come up have few shot left be forced to put bold face on accordingly kangaroo weighed anchor stood in close to fort again anchored a if to pound at close quarter while headed straight for felucca gun boat fortunately did not await coming turned tail returned to valencia kangaroo boat ours be now lowered made for remaining merchantman four of cut cable ran ashore where be under protection of large body of troop on beach must soon have driven off have have ammunition left a be be obliged to content with capture of other three ship on return to port mahon after really successful action found to disgust that instead of gamo being purchased a usual by government have be sold for mere song to algerines thereby depriving of prize money have expected to get for cochrane be especially enraged for have gamo be purchased must have be transferred to from speedy must have be in position to do very much more than in wretched little craft be however piece of treatment that have be receiving extraordinary number of prize have taken excited jealousy of senior officer on station for indeed have captured more than other cruiser together result be that prize be sold for anything must fetch owing to ridiculous sum for be given away rascality of prize agent did not receive tithe of prize money must have come to ill will resulted in bringing career to end on return to port mahon be ordered to escort extremely slow old mail packet to gibraltar what rendered more ridiculous be that be to carry mail bag only to hand over to old tub on arrival at gibraltar be then to return without communication with shore be supposed that while engaged on duty must at least be able to take further prize be so much faster than convoy that while crawled along be able to run in explore bay creek in one several merchantman be lying a bore in towards weighed anchor ran ashore a soon a be dark sent boat in set fire to a one be laden with oil made blaze must be seen fifty mile away unfortunately three french line of battle ship be within circle indomptable dessaix formidable ran in to ascertain cause of fire at daybreak made out three large ship in distance imagining be spanish galleon on way home from south america at once prepared to chase a light broadened out saw mistake made out to be line of battle ship at once crowded sail bore down towards ' fear time embleton cochrane said to be up with will do best to get away chance be small there be one good thing be flying french flag may expect vastly better treatment at hand than must get from spaniard who must a likely a not refuse to acknowledge surrender sink without mercy ' got stitch of sail on a wind be very light put out sweep frenchman however have more wind than have gained on fast threw fourteen pop gun overboard to lighten for even cochrane felt that be useless to think of fighting now three vessel separated so a to ensure that must not slip past dessaix be nearest to began firing broadside after broadside time tacked keeping bow chaser going time cutting up rigging for three hour continued threw over ammunition store slowly gradually dessaix crept up to just a be abeam cochrane put helm hard down spun round to make desperate attempt to run between enemy be received with broadside from formidable dessaix immediately tacked in pursuit in le than hour came up within musket shot yawing to bring gun to bear poured in broadside thought must have annihilated fortunately have answered helm so quickly that a came round gun bore ahead of round shot struck water under bow grape however cut up rigging riddled sail damaged mast a next broadside must assuredly have sunk cochrane ordered flag to be hauled down nothing must have be kinder than treatment captain declined to accept cochrane sword begging to continue to wear though prisoner in thirteen month cruise have taken retaken upwards of fifty vessel one hundred twenty two gun five hundred thirty four prisoner after capture french line of battle ship took lubberly convoy into algeciras be trying to be lying there almost within range of gun of gibraltar two three day later sir james saumarez sailed in with powerful squadron french at once put out boat carried anchor ashore warped in until grounded so a to prevent being attacked on side tide brought british ship so fast up bay in hurry of work french ship still lay head to shore be therefore helpless to offer defence to expected attack greater part of french sailor be at once sent ashore to powerful spanish battery there very effective fire be opened upon british ship nothing however must have prevented capture of french vessel have there be wind there be however scarce breath on water british being unwilling to anchor under heavy fire of battery be swept past by strong current fire however severely damaged ship of war sunk several gun boat hannibal alone managed to tack made inshore thinking to place inside frenchman not knowing that be aground in so doing ran ashore be there exposed to broadside of french ship fire of battery gun boat captain ferris who commanded continued to reply to fire until most of gun be dismounted third of crew killed wounded then seeing that effort of rest of squadron to come back to assistance be vain be forced to haul down flag next day boat with flag of truce came across from gibraltar with proposition for release of crew of hannibal speedy there be regular system of exchange at time a french did not know what to do with prisoner be released on giving parole not to serve again until french prisoner of own rank be given in exchange for be done few day afterwards three day later spanish admiral at cadiz arrived with six ship of line several frigate gun boat french men of war having be warped off ground damage repaired whole sailed away six day after action followed by british squadron came up to at dusk a soon a became quite dark captain keith in superb dashed in between two sternmost ship two spanish men of war mounting hundred twelve gun poured broadside into of then shot ahead presently engaged third spanish man of war san antonio in darkness aided by smoke of superb gun be not seen at by of two spanish ship between have passed concluded that other be enemy furious cannonade commenced between one of lost foretop mast sail of falling over own gun caught fire other still supposing to be enemy poured broadside after broadside into then approached to board in confusion yard of two vessel became entangled together second ship also caught fire ship burned until blew up nearly on board perishing few survivor being picked up by boat of superb be at time engaged in taking possession of third spanish ship of war have struck to officer men of ship be released in exchange for of hannibal speedy be therefore free to serve again be sent back to england put on half pay peace having soon after be patched up remained without chance of employment fortunately parent at time be alive got on better than of comrade poor parker be especially badly treated by authority cochrane in vain attacked admiralty hostility to extended to officer have serious grievance for long delay before have obtained promotion caused several junior officer to pas over head annoying a be affected le than cruel treatment of parker year passed before officer obtained promotion despairing of getting took little farm married settled there with family cochrane persevered so strenuously on behalf at last be made commander be ordered to join rainbow sloop in west indie sold off everything even house furniture in order to enable to obtain outfit proceeded to take up command on arriving at barbadoes reported to admiral who knew nothing about rainbow supposed that might be newly purchased craft fitting out at bermuda parker went there must hear nothing of then returned to barbadoes when became evident that such vessel be in existence returned to england ruined man have expended whole capital amounting to upwards of thousand pound in settling family during absence in providing for outfit voyage first lord of admiralty expressed polite surprise mistake must have occurred promised compensation for loss command on first opportunity neither promise be kept parker spirit health gave way under misfortune sank into grave cochrane finding that too have small chance of employment went up to edinburgh worked hard at university there until war broke out again in when applied for ship obtained after threat to retire altogether from service command of old brig be one of many old craft purchased from men of influence in exchange for vote have be used a collier be unable to sail against wind cochrane be ordered to watch boulogne in short time found that if wind on shore sprung up nothing must save ship reported to admiral order be then sent to to cruise north of orkneys to protect fishery there be fishery to protect order be simply sentence of exile remained here for nearly fifteen month during whole of time not so much a single ship be ever seen from masthead returned to england on st of december found that lord st vincent have just be compelled to retire from admiralty cochrane claim be urged by friend on lord melville successor with such force that be transferred to pallas new thirty two gun frigate chapter viii basque road few day afterwards lieutenant said now stephen a have nothing to do evening will go on with yarn lord cochrane have not forgotten on day that be appointed to pallas wrote to saying that have applied for a second lieutenant that lord melville have promised to appoint two day later got official appointment with order to join at once found cochrane in very bad temper said 'what do think embleton confounded cruise of mine in arab have ruined in opinion of sailor why if have be appointed to hundred gun ship on day when returned together after loss of speedy must have got volunteer enough for in twenty four hour now dismal tale told by crew of arab of exile in north sea fear doubt that be going to be sent off to similar station have so frightened have not have half dozen men apply actually will have to impress crew expect sir ' said 'that when get hold of few prime seaman tell that be a sure of prize money with a if be already divided will soon spread news will not be long before fill up ' so turned out luckily among first haul cochrane made there be two three of speedy old crew took in hand told that so far from being in disgrace longer lord cochrane have commission to take month cruise off azores before joining fleet that job alone be likely to fill man pocket in very short time have pick of best men in plymouth sailed in middle of january for azores instead of making straight for island cochrane ran down coast of spain then worked up towards azores thereby putting on track of spanish vessel bound from west indie to cadiz day two later captured large ship bound from havana laden with valuable cargo having learned from prisoner that ship be part of large convoy proceeded on course week later captured even more valuable prize a contained in addition to usual cargo diamond ingot of gold silver two day later took richest of three having on board large quantity of dollar next day caught fine privateer with more dollar on board four prize be sent in to plymouth a only have month brought work to close returned to plymouth have serious adventure on way back for in heavy weather fell in with three french line of battle ship at once made after with gale heavy sea gained on fast a have taken out dollar from prize have on board pallas thought of losing be even more vexatious than idea of seeing inside of french prison pallas be very crank vessel lee main deck gun be under water even quarter deck carronades be at time immersed however frenchman came up so fast that be necessary at cost to crowd on more sail cochrane have hawser brought up with got up preventer stay then sail be spread drove bow under through sea still came up to be also plunging so heavily that too be unable to fire gun presently have one on side of with le than mile interval between third be quarter of mile further away situation be very unpleasant one for now that be up to must be able to shorten sail little occasionally fire at with broadside gun cochrane gave order for whole crew to be ready to shorten sail when gave word sail must come down simultaneously be critical movement be well executed cochrane shouted order in moment down came sail helm at same moment be put weather have not be for hawser with have stayed mast everything must have gone out of a wore round rolling in trough of sea a soon a be round up went sail again went off on opposite tack to on have before be running french be altogether unprepared for such manoeuvre in such heavy gale a be now blowing be long time before must shorten sail get on opposite tack indeed ran on mile before must do while be rushing along at rate of thirteen knot hour in opposite direction so be very long distance away before be fairly after by time darkness be coming on when morning broke be altogether out of sight continued course to plymouth election be on while be lying two month in plymouth cochrane stood a candidate for honiton be defeated refused to bribe opponent therefore won hand down a paid usual sum of five pound for vote after election be over cochrane sent ten guinea to of men who have voted for saying that have sent a reward for having refused to accept bribe of opponent expenditure be considerable a cochrane calculated ensured return at next election whenever might take place a voter naturally calculated that if have paid ten guinea vote after be beaten there be saying what must pay if be returned at end of may sailed in charge of convoy for quebec brought one back again be dull work be heartily glad when on return be ordered to cruise off boulogne then to join squadron of

gun sooner have taken possession than two other corvette came up gun of prize be turned upon be beaten off prize be brought safely down river in meantime position have not be pleasant one soon after daylight three strange craft be seen making for mouth of river be clearly enemy a have only forty hand on board thing looked very blue must make think that be strong handed cochrane said to ordered men aloft to fasten up furled sail with rope yarn to cast off gasket other rope then waited until enemy approached while men remained on yard knife in hand when gave word cut rope yarn sail fell together naturally produced impression upon frenchman that have very strong crew directly cloud of canvas fell hauled wind made off along shore hand on board officer men hauled at sheet be soon in chase gained rapidly upon divided crew among bow gun opened fire scarcely have fired dozen shot when captain of foremost vessel ran ship ashore shock brought down mast crew landed in boat ran a close a dared fired several broadside into to prevent floating with rising tide other two corvette came back to assist comrade when sailed boldly towards firing bow gun again one nearest to also deliberately ran ashore be like first dismasted third boat made for river by superior sailing cut off whereupon also ran ashore be abandoned by crew know that ever saw forty men laugh so much a did fellow at seeing three strong corvette thus deliberately run ashore destroy when if one of three have attacked single handed must have made real resistance prize captured by boat now came down pallas rejoined squadron admiral thornborough wrote very warm despatch a to gallantry of affair notice be taken of at admiralty first lieutenant did not receive promotion that deserved after two three other affair be ordered to sail into basque road to reconnoitre french squadron lying there after brush with french frigate three brig succeeded in doing discovered that there be five men of war two heavy

france have brisk time of gained immense amount of credit must have gained very large amount of prize money have not be for rascality of prize court at malta have believe be instigated by one in london to adopt a hostile attitude a possible towards lord cochrane most important exciting affair that have be defence of fort trinidad close to town of rosa lord cochrane order have be to assist spaniard against french have done great deal way by landing strong party who blew up road blocked communication rendered passage of body of french troop difficult if not impossible when arrived off rosa french have already invested town marine of excellent have be holding fort trinidad have suffered severely from battery erected by french upon hill commanding be withdrawn on arrival of imperieuse place taken by marine be rum place fort side towards sea sloped gradually steeply two fort be placed one above like big step above stood tall tower very strongly built fort have gun have have must not have used against enemy battery on high cliff for tower stood in way so protected from french fire defended place for long time even after town of rosa have fallen several attempt at assault be made be repulsed last be most serious enemy have made breach at foot of tower to reach must have to scale cliff on stood by mean of ladder cochrane prepared for assault in very curious way just below breach be sort of vault forty foot deep under tower cochrane knocked away portion of arched roof of vault so that on reaching top of breach french must see great gulf in front of with timber plank erected sort of slide from breach down into vault covered with grease so that trying to descend must shoot down to bottom remain there prisoner until released when have completed laid train to blow up magazine in case be necessary to evacuate fort being thus prepared waited for assault commanded a tower be by battery on cliff nothing must be done to prevent making breach for same reason there be mean of preventing scaling party placing ladder climbing up interior barricade be however formed when made attack before daybreak repulsed with ease forty of enemy who got on to top of breach be destroyed by musketry fire a soon a reached shell be dropped down upon waiting below hand grenade thrown after suffering severe loss drew off french erected fresh battery at last place became absolutely untenable so took to boat blew up castle got safely on board imperieuse after capturing more prize doing other service imperieuse returned to plymouth cochrane be appointed to go out take command of fire ship to attack french fleet in basque road admiral gambier who be in command of fleet on coast be in strong opposition to plan have denounced effort a desperate ministry be extremely unpopular desired to strike blow must excite enthusiasm did not believe in success offered cochrane command in order must fail blame must be thrown wholly on shoulder at first declined altogether to have anything to do with drew up memorandum showing number of battery must have to be encountered extreme improbability of ever arriving near enough to french squadron to do harm objection be overruled be ordered to sail for basque road where six transport prepared a fire ship be to join appointment caused a be natural very great dissatisfaction among captain commanding ship in gambier squadron be senior to cochrane regarded appointment on service a being slur indeed insult on personally anger however being excited rather against lord gambier than against cochrane fleet indeed be in state of general disorganization approaching mutiny at inactivity in have be kept at various measure have be carried out by admiral a might have have to wait for long time before fire ship arrived from england cochrane obtained from gambier several craft fitted up a fire ship others however arrived from england cochrane wanted to make attack on night joined before french must gain knowledge of nature of attempt be going to be made against lord gambier refused to consent result be that french did get notice of intention be prepared in order to avoid danger enemy ten men of war struck topmast got sail on deck four frigate alone remaining in sailing order be placed mile in front of men of war lay in shelter of immense boom specially designed to arrest approach of enemy at night in addition to fire ship cochrane have prepared two three vessel a what called explosion ship be intended not so much to damage enemy a to terrify to prevent sending boat to divert course of fire ship solid foundation of log have be first laid on keel so a to form extremely solid floor to give explosion upward tendency on be placed large number of empty spirit water cask set on end into fifteen hundred barrel of powder be emptied space around be filled in with timber sand so a to form solid mass over powder cask be laid several hundred shell three thousand hand grenade french deemed position impregnable men of war be ranged close together in two line frigate guard boat considered must be sufficient to divert fire ship might make way round boom gale be blowing on shore cochrane went in explosion ship led advance night be dark when cochrane reached what thought be vicinity of advanced ship of french lit fuse with officer four men with took to boat rowed away made little way against wind sea fuse instead of burning for fifteen minute a intended only burned time however be really mean of saving life of on board boat be nearly swamped by effect of explosion a force a intended took place upwards shell grenade exploded far overhead scattering content over wide area boat lay inside circle of destruction on board imperieuse be anchored three mile away felt shock a if ship have struck heavily on rock for moment sky seemed sheet of fire then came crash of exploding shell rattle of grenade then roar a fragment piece of wreck fell into sea fire ship be very badly handled many of be lighted over four mile from enemy be put on wrong tack before be left by crew although there be upwards of twenty in number only four reached enemy position not one did damage nevertheless desired effect be produced explosion vessel be alongside boom when blew up completely shattered enemy be so appalled by explosion that believing fire ship be equally formidable not only made attempt to divert course with one exception french ship cut cable when morning dawned whole of fleet except two ship be helplessly ashore tide have ebbed lay over on side with bottom exposed to fire have lord gambier sent two three ship in to complete work of destruction not one of powerful french squadron must have escaped fort have begun to open upon therefore sailed away towards fleet be lying ten mile off on getting within signalling distance cochrane signalled that enemy ship except two be on shore that frigate alone must destroy beyond acknowledging signal notice be taken be not until eleven o'clock that fleet got up anchor then sailing in to within three mile half of road anchored again by time tide have risen most of enemy ship be already afloat furious at seeing result of attack absolutely thrown away cochrane ordered anchor to be weighed allowed vessel to drift towards enemy must not get up sail a knew that must be at once recalled if did so therefore drifted until short distance from enemy then at half past one suddenly made sail ran towards hoisting at same time signal 'in want of assistance engaged three line of battle ship on seeing several ship be sent to assistance before came up one of men of war hauled down colour be taken possession of by ship came up engaged captured two other french men of war while be deserted by crew set on fire illustration cochrane scatter french fleet in basque road by terrible explosion ship signal for recall be now hoisted by admiral be obeyed by most of other ship frigate four brig however taking upon to remain with imperieuse however be prevented from destroying vessel still lay at mercy by peremptory order of recall brought service of imperieuse service to end service of cochrane also be ordered back to england lord gambier despatch a to affair be so scandalously untrue that cochrane denounced in parliament gambier demanded court martial a have support of utterly unscrupulous government scandalously partial judge false witness backed by forged chart result be certainty public indignation be excited to highest pitch by shameless manner in trial be conducted although cochrane career in service be ruined became perhaps most popular character in country be a know afterwards imprisoned expelled house have suffered persecution of kind westminster however have remained faithful to have returned at election have never relaxed strenuous effort to obtain naval reform to vindicate own character on point need hardly say that be heart soul with so terrible be persecution to have be in variety of way exposed can not blame if zeal have at time outrun discretion most other men must like poor parker have sunk under such treatment a have received a told did not get anything like tithe of prize money must have received for capture share of be more than spent in litigation with dishonest official fortunately laid out portion of share of prize money in buying house invested remainder in fund have enabled to live in comfort certainly must not have done have be wholly dependent upon half pay although have be most annoying remaining for so many year unemployed regret having served with cochrane in speedy pallas imperieuse for indeed three ship of size ever inflicted such damage upon enemy commerce captured so many ship performed more gallant exploit when be dead will leave instruction that word served with cochrane in speedy pallas imperieuse will be placed on tombstone will be by far most striking testimony must be written a to career a sailor chapter ix in chili seeing that boat be

cochrane must marry only daughter of official of admiralty court even have not be attached to miss barnes proposal be one be signally distasteful to cochrane have be engaged in exposing serious malpractice by official of admiralty court amassed great fortune at expense of seaman for to have benefited by very malpractice must have seemed contradiction of principle uncle in vain pointed out to that fortune must leave must obtain by marriage must suffice to reinstate earl of dundonald in former position a large landowner cochrane determination be unshaken married miss barnes so uncle cut out from will entirely broke off acquaintance with be sure however have never for moment regretted choice believe that make a perfectly happy a be possible for man of restless disposition to be on th of august rose sailed from boulogne lieutenant embleton who have remained on board with son until got under way returned to england do know anything about chilian business lord cochrane asked stephen a walked up down deck together on following morning father told little about sir said that have not paid much attention to matter until received kind offer to take well lad be well must know something about right wrong of struggle in be going to take part know that spaniard obtained possession in south america partly by right of discovery partly by papal bull settled matter portuguese be given east coast while to spain be handed besides island vast territory of mexico central america whole of western portion of south america in extent considerably surpassed that of europe natural wealth have be properly administered must have be fabulous spaniard however thought of two thing one be to force native to embrace religion other to wring possessed from first caused death of great number of indian second brought about virtual enslavement of whole of native race tyranny practised by spaniard upon poor people be inconceivable ten of thousand may say hundred of thousand perished from labour exacted from in mine whole people be kept in state of poverty that spanish official might be enriched that annual amount of gold silver sent to spain might be obtained doubt be successful revolt of north american colony against that first inspired down trodden people with hope of shaking off intolerable yoke under suffered first leader found be francesco miranda creole of venezuela be to say belonged to spanish family long settled there came over to europe in two year later took part in french revolution hearing that revolutionary movement have taken place in mexico new granada against spain obtained promise of assistance from pitt who naturally embraced opportunity of crippling spain be hostile to in went out threw into struggle continued with doubtful success for year in miranda obtained valuable aid from uncle sir alexander cochrane who be then in command of west indian station thing looked much brighter for cause of independence unfortunately few month later pitt died whig came into power a usual feeble policy succeeded strong one aid be withdrawn from miranda result be that for time spaniard be able to crush insurgent in miranda again organized revolt in venezuela be unable to cope with power of spain two year later be taken prisoner sent to madrid where died in prison however work have not be without result for same year that commenced unfortunate venture in venezuela revolt broke out in mexico headed by priest named miguel hidalgo be conducted in barbarous fashion be speedily crushed two leader of better type morelos rayon still continued to carry on war force be defeated in though believe there have be occasional fighting since then matter have be comparatively quiet in south america thing went better in revolt broke out at quito be headed by man named narenno force however be never strong enough to seriously menace power of spain however for five year maintained guerrilla warfare fighting with desperate bravery until be captured sent to spain where believe also died in prison so far great deal of blood have be shed great destruction of property effected spain have be put to vast expense situation be practically unaltered change be however at hand bolivar native of caracas have be brought up in europe stirred by news of struggle that countryman be maintaining went out in to join miranda in venezuela when latter be defeated taken prisoner bolivar crossed into new granada where insurrection have broken out knowledge of european method of warfare discipline soon placed at head of movement there two year after arrival be appointed captain general of new granada venezuela title be empty one in very short time be defeated forced to fly from country by formidable spanish army be sent out in to crush rebellion bolivar fled to jamaica where remained few month organized considerable force in trinidad in landed again on mainland cruelty perpetrated by conquering spaniard upon population have stirred up so intense feeling of hatred against that bolivar be speedily joined by great number of men gained success after success swept northern province clear of spaniard founded republic of colombia of be elected president drove tyrant out of new granada marching south freed province of la plata from spanish yoke while event have be taking place in northern western province national movement have extended to chili here in people rose deposed spanish captain general carrasco set up native government of count de la conquista be at head movement here be not so much against spain whose sovereignty be still recognized a against spanish governor to obtain series of reform must mitigate tyranny have be exercised naturally however reform be obnoxious in extreme to spanish authority in spanish troop attempted to overthrow new government be however unsuccessful revolution triumphed rule of spain be formally thrown off chili declared independent state be good beginning trouble set in almost directly three brother of family of carrera set to work to turn popular movement to own benefit by intrigue overthrew national congress established new government with elder of a head so much dissatisfaction be caused by corruption misgovernment of carreras that spaniard endeavoured to reconquer chili when danger be imminent new actor came to front general o'higgins man of irish descent whose father have be spanish viceroy of peru be put at head of affair in november spaniard who have won way to capital be forced by good generalship to retire again intrigue of carreras however still divided force of chili spaniard again advanced from peru o'higgins seeing danger effected junction with force of carreras offered to give support to resign position in favour if must co operate with carreras however held aloof with band from battle left o'higgins little body of men to oppose spanish troop natural result be defeat of chilians on st of october o'higgins with little party be attacked at rancagua by spaniard for thirty six hour resisted continuous attack carreras force be short distance away side expected to attack spaniard in rear preferred however that rival a regarded must be destroyed held aloof at last o'higgins with men now survived of force be driven into great square of town surrounded on side still resisted however until force have fallen then although seriously wounded placed at head of survivor cut way through enemy effected retreat extraordinary valour displayed by chilians in battle stirred english blood felt that here be people who have not like rest of south american race become absolutely demoralized by century of misgovernment by spaniard at time however cause seemed lost carreras submitted without trying to strike blow o'higgins with handful of survivor from rancagua hundred of fugitive crossed andes into la plata where remained for two half year in exile general san martin who fought under bolivar have taken leading part in aiding la plata to obtain freedom felt strong enough at beginning of to aid o'higgins to recover chili from spaniard who have be carrying out wholesale confiscation persecution among who have taken part in revolution in february crossed andes with men fell upon main spanish army of about same strength be encamped on height of chacabuco position from overawed large town having advantage of surprise completely defeated spaniard in very short time drove altogether out of chili republic be again established presidency offered to san martin declined honour however be then conferred upon o'higgins council saw that be impossible to hope for permanent peace so long a spaniard be able to gather army in peru pour down into chili whenever chose so lost time in sending don jose alvarez over here to endeavour to raise money in name of republic to build war ship enlist public sympathy on behalf among other thing be commissioned to offer command of chilian fleet a soon a one must be created a sympathy be very strongly with brave people who be struggling against tyranny at once accepted have be detained in england upwards of year trying to get war steamer that have be building completed at last chilians have concluded that a can not get steamer may a well get so see be on way out thank sir stephen said will feel great interest now in cause of chilians father told be fighting against spaniard did not interest much in matter thought much more of honour of serving under than of chilian cause now that know that be really brave people struggling to maintain freedom will feel proud of fighting in so good cause how old be mr embleton be sixteen month ago admiral nodded very useful age for work be old enough to hold own in fight not old enough to begin to think that know about everything now tell about affair of yours when lost ship tell everything can think of just a happened exaggerate own share in on other hand let know what did what said see know very little about a yet if will tell detail of business will be able to form idea a to how far will be able to entrust carrying out of order to to confide in ability to discharge special mission on may employ see mr embleton conduct of chilians in matter of carreras show that however bravely may fight a yet have not much idea of subordination know nothing of sea service chance be that interest family will go further in obtaining appointment of officer to ship than question of ability will be very useful for to have one can trust even if only junior officer to see that order be carried out when can not be present therefore want to gather from story exactly how must be likely to behave under difficult circumstance will sit down in two deck chair will tell story exactly a must tell to father remember be in hurry voyage be going to last good many week more tell story in detail better will be pleased so closely did admiral question stephen a to detail that took many hour to tell story even when mentioned about idea that by putting water in watch glass must when sun be overhead use a burning glass admiral stopped to inquire about watch be one be carrying now yes then let look at handsome watch youngster did father give to then stephen have to break off from story to tell exactly how came into possession whole history of trading result story be not brought to conclusion until following afternoon very good mr embleton lord cochrane said now know great deal more about than did before feel that can employ without hesitation in matter in brain a well a courage be required if have heard story before must have taken out sailor a coxswain between showed great deal of resource a far a can see credit of matter may be divided between getting fellow midshipman out of hand of malay be well managed took precaution possible to throw off scent acted very wisely in deciding to make for wreck when discovered position showed good power of resource in arrangement there especially in matter of getting fire hear from father that be well up in navigation altogether congratulate on having young officer with whom can trust be of course mere matter of chance appointed simply in order to oblige father who be gallant officer who have suffered in profession owing to having served under among many application made to be for young officer who possessed very high testimonial of conduct good service may say frankly be more than little tempted to regret have selected one of whose conduct knew nothing although felt sure that father son must assuredly have lack of courage ability however be now well content that made choice did indeed feel sure must not have made better one be long voyage for rose met with such bad weather off cape that be at first unable to weather be ten week from date of sailing before entered harbour of valparaiso voyage have be of advantage to stephen in rough weather off coast have volunteered for duty have shown activity courage going aloft to reef furl sail in worst weather have too by readiness at time to take child off lady cochrane hand to play with to tell story gained warm approbation of parent before arrived at valparaiso admiral treated with kindness cordiality such a might have shown to young nephew acting a flag midshipman lord cochrane be received at valparaiso at capital with enthusiasm dinner fete ball be given in honour although cared little for such thing must not be gratifying to after cruel treatment have met with from for whom have performed such brilliant service to find that elsewhere reputation stood at highest point stephen who of course accompanied admiral on occasion enjoyed festivity very much more than did lord cochrane to be quite new very pleasant shone in reflected light of admiral be made great deal of by young chilian lady only drawback being ignorance of language have however on way out picked up little from chilian passenger on board rose be not long before be able to talk to certain extent to partner in dance nevertheless much a enjoyed be by mean sorry when on nd of december lord cochrane who have received commission a vice admiral of chili commander in chief of naval force hoisted flag on board principal ship of chilian navy have arrived none too soon large spanish force be advancing from peru against formidable fleet be master of sea be fitting out naval expedition for attack on valparaiso chilian admiral blanco encalada have succeeded in capturing spanish fifty gun frigate have be renamed o'higgins be only temporary success with undisciplined badly equipped fleet be quite unable to withstand threatened attack of spaniard lord cochrane have to encounter trouble from outset among chilian fleet be hecate eighteen gun sloop have be sold out of british navy purchased by two men captain guise spry a speculation at first attempted to sell at buenos ayres failing to do so have brought on to chili where government have bought ship have appointed to command american captain named worcester have obtained considerable influence over admiral encalada seeing that influence must be shaken by lord cochrane ascendency formed intrigue to persuade chilian admiral to insist upon retaining chief command upon dividing with lord cochrane admiral encalada however refused to allow to be made tool saying that must wish for greater honour than of serving under so distinguished officer a lord cochrane for time therefore intrigue be defeated sooner have hoisted flag on board o'higgins than lord cochrane set to work with usual energy to complete outfit of little fleet consisted in addition to o'higgins of san martin lautaro of have be east indiaman former carried gun latter hecate now called galvarino of gun chacabuco of aracano of puyrredon of spanish fleet consisted of three frigate esmeralda of gun bengenza of sebastian of four brig one of gun three of there be also schooner carrying one heavy gun small one rest be armed merchantman resolution of gun cleopatra of fernando of la focha of guarmey san antonio of on th of january leaving admiral blanco to complete equipment of galvarino aracano puyrredon lord cochrane sailed with o'higgins san martin lautaro chacabuco from day admiral flag be hoisted to upon sailed stephen life have undergone sudden complete change from morning until night be engaged in rowing from flagship to other vessel in carrying order ascertaining how certain portion of work be getting on reporting to admiral going on shore to dockyard with urgent requisition for store required lord cochrane be equally busy went from ship to ship stood by captain while crew be put through exercise in making shortening sail practising drill cutlas exercise on deck working gun hard a be work imposed upon by constant drill enthusiasm energy of admiral so communicated to most of officer seaman that astonishing progress be made in four week elapsed before sailing though must hardly be said that smartness of crew equalled that must be shown by british men of war men work be very fairly done admiral felt convinced that ship must be worked manoeuvred far more rapidly than of spaniard stephen have from first messed with ship officer lord cochrane have said to on day when hoisted flag a flag midshipman mr embleton must very well have a well a flag lieutenant at table think that must be better for to mess with officer find that in chilian service midshipman mess by a be case with have common mess with lieutenant there be certainly considerable advantage in arrangement though might not work well in navy where boy be much more mischievous given to prank than be of southern people enter so young into service six midshipman on board be none of younger than be member of good old family here there be therefore need for so strict line of distinction between midshipman lieutenant a there be with system be more like prevails in army where youngest ensign associate when off duty on term of equality with elder mingling with will acquire language far more rapidly than must do be to take meal at table moreover think that will be more pleasant natural life for while will avoid appearance of favouritism be altogether better stephen bowed fond a be of admiral felt that must be more pleasant to associate with lad of own age than to be always on best behaviour already knew officer having met at various entertainment at valparaiso have found pleasant young fellow though air of manliness gravity have amused good deal wished that have in addition old friend joyce with whom must occasionally skylark quarrel make up again after manner of boy wardroom be large airy there be ample space for party at meal consisted of three lieutenant surgeon purser seven midshipman a have never be accustomed to rough life in cock pit of british man of war contrast to former condition be not so strong a must have be to midshipman in royal service somewhat stiff courtesy prevailed among chilian officer in relation to other differed widely from frank heartiness at captain pinder table when meal be over however air of restraint softened little stephen soon became on intimate term with other midshipman three four of whom have never be to sea before be like life on board ship one of asked few day after have joined not bit don enriques to begin with midshipman never dine with lieutenant live half a well a do in next place be great deal more serious great deal more dignified that english midshipman be with be always playing trick with other may be officer on board ship when be among ourselves be just like other boy of same age consider boy don estevan do indeed stephen laughed one think man until be quite senior midshipman if play trick on other must quarrel sometimes oh yes quarrel then have fight then be good friend again ah do fight with sword pistol stephen laughed fight with fist what like common people young chilian said greatly shocked just same except that fight little better be way always settle quarrel among boy in england very good way be one get black eye something of sort there be end of a for fighting with sword pistol know what must happen if two midshipman be to fight duel in first place must get into frightful row in second place must be laughing stock of whole fleet of course in country like where blow be considered a deadliest of insult thing be different in england be not viewed in same light everyone know something of boxing be of proper way of using fist have come to be national way of fighting among common people among boy of class must for example don estevan consent to fight with boy with man of peasant class if injured certainly must stephen said know must fight big man because evidently must have very little chance with if quarrelled with fellow own age must of course pitch into other without question of rank exclamation of surprise broke from other midshipman a stephen made statement in very broken spanish be questioned over over again by to make sure that have not misunderstood seem to think terrible stephen said stand on rank yourselves when fight when board enemy ship fight with sailor who attack stop to discus with whether be one of gentle blood like mere peasant for time being put on equality with be pure matter of strength skill be just same with in most matter stand on rank same a do when blood be up put aside fight without caring whether opponent be nobleman peasant when be over shake hand feel that there be bad blood between chapter x wrecked on fifth morning when ship got up anchor there be sign of movement on board chacabuco be attention paid to admiral signal mr embleton take one of gig row on board report what be matter there stephen did so approach of boat be apparently unobserved companion ladder be not lowered therefore ordered men to cease rowing presently officer appeared at side admiral wish to know what be matter why obey signal stephen said sharply standing up in stern sheet crew be in state of mutiny officer said refuse to get up anchor stephen returned with message admiral at once gave order for frigate to bear down on chacabuco crew be mustered at quarter when came within cable length of chacabuco frigate be thrown up into wind admiral shouted unless anchor be peak in five minute will blow out of water there be mistaking earnestness of tone many of men sprang at once to capstan bar anchor be soon out of water make sail lord cochrane again ordered keep along close beside few minute later fleet be under sail afternoon entered port of coquimbo a soon a anchor be let go admiral gig be lowered went on board chacabuco what be about asked captain who received at gangway men say that be overworked excellency that be kept hard at day making taking off sail that want to leave ship muster crew sir lord cochrane said crew silently assembled port hole of o'higgins be opened men must be seen standing at gun now men lord cochrane said give five minute to pick out twelve men who have be ringleader in mutiny will iron bring on board flag ship where will be tried punished for offence what be there ship crew of chilians so regardless of duty so careless of honour of country that be ready to disgrace by turning into pack of mutineer merely because be required to do extra work to fit for fighting enemy of country be willing to believe that have suffered yourselves to be misled that did not understand magnitude of crime that be committing there six bell be striking have five minute to put ringleader into boat see that exceed that time for a soon a watch tell that five minute have gone give order to fire one broadside will be sufficient to send chacabuco to bottom gentleman said turning to officer at end of five minute if order have not be carried out will take to boat leave ship a soon a have done so will open fire then turned on heel went down ladder rowed back to ship a left saw there be great uproar on board chacabuco a sailor disputed among who have be leader in matter two boat be lowered at once just before expiration of given time twelve men be put on board ironed be then rowed to flag ship signal be made for first lieutenant of of other ship of squadron to come on board court martial be at once held upon mutineer man who be shown to have be at bottom of whole affair be sentenced to be hung rest to term of imprisonment admiral remitted death sentence changed to ten year in jail culprit other prisoner be taken on shore handed over to civil authority having thus given wholesome lesson lord cochrane proceeded northward to callao bay where intended to attack considerable naval force gathered there be protected by battery of callao of san lorenzo little island in bay mounting in one hundred sixty gun in addition to on board spanish war ship consisted of few frigate two brig eight gun boat to attack force lying under gun of battery be too perilous enterprise for even cochrane to undertake determined however to make attempt to do at least damage knew that two american men of war be expected to arrive in callao made slight change in flag ship lautaro hoisted american flag sailed toward harbour carnival be at time being carried on there be le chance that vigilant watch must be kept up by fort ship unfortunately dense fog came on for eight day chilians be forced to remain inactive at end of time hearing heavy firing believing that one of ship must have gone into bay have be attacked by enemy cochrane stood in direction of sound other ship did same when fog clearing up in moment discovered other found small gunboat lying close to captured at once learned that firing be salute in honour of viceroy who have be paying visit to battery be now returning to town in brig of war be crowding sail fog again closed in hoping capture of gun boat have not be noticed lord cochrane determined to risk partial engagement rather than withdraw without firing shot a retreat now must raise spirit of spaniard depress of chilians accordingly o'higgins lautaro stood on having boat ahead sounding wind fell very light instead of going in engaging spanish ship a intended lord cochrane be forced to anchor at distance from moment that two chilian vessel be made out through fog ship battery opened fire upon showing that capture of gun boat have be observed sailor garrison called to gun for two hour ship be exposed to heavy fire from battery ship replied steadily aim being chiefly directed against northern angle of one of principal fort whose fire especially annoyed a soon a little breeze sprang up anchor be weighed two ship sailed to fro in front of battery returning fire until captain guise who commanded lautaro be severely wounded ship at once retired from action neither of other chilian vessel ventured within range from first to last flag ship being thus left alone exposed to whole fire of enemy lord cochrane be ultimately obliged to relinquish attack retired to island three mile distant from port for five week blockaded callao be dull work mr embleton admiral said one day a paced up down quarter deck what can one do with four badly equipped ship one of have lost commander who though not friendly to be at least officer of courage other two commanded by men who be afraid to bring ship within range of enemy gun badly manned badly provisioned by mean in fighting trim if spaniard must sail out to engage might do something have dismantled frigate nothing will tempt gun boat to move out from fort only consolation be that spectacle of blockading place successfully can not rouse spirit of chilians induce hope to make effort to put force on sea capable of completely crippling spaniard at end of five week little fleet proceeded to huacho short distance north of callao bulk of inhabitant be secretly in sympathy with chilians spanish garrison evacuated place fled almost immediately ship opened fire order be given for boat to be lowered lord cochrane landed to see that there be scramble for property of government of large quantity be found in store together with considerable amount of money be of even more importance to chilians whose treasury be empty who be crippled in operation by want of specie during april may lord cochrane cruised up down peruvian coast several landing be effected valuable capture made of money store property of peruvian be always respected admiral spared pain to convince inhabitant that chilians be friend be hostile only to spaniard oppressor several ship laden with store for spanish troop also fell into hand towards end of cruise sail be observed at distance in offing a at moment boat be about to effect landing to capture fort from spaniard have be driven by fire of ship admiral turned to stephen said mr embleton please to take command of second cutter be fast sailer have doubt that can overhaul brig in couple of hour boat crew be already on board armed suppose will meet with resistance when have boarded will take command of navigate to valparaiso will be returning there in course of two three day stephen touched hat ran below be delighted at prospect of first command though be not very important one have brought best of chronometer with snatching up quadrant pocket compass at once descended ladder to boat have be hailed by admiral ordered to lie there petty officer who commanded being transferred to boat crew consisted of twelve men a breeze be off shore stephen ordered mast to be stepped at once two lug sail hoisted crew be glad to escape labour of carrying down store from fort transporting to ship sat down contentedly in bottom of boat while stephen took tiller brig be hull down when seen from boat stephen calculated that be six seven mile out be steering south have evidently le wind than be taking cutter fast through water made course to point four mile south of brig so a to cut off be not long before be evident to that must succeed in doing so be within two mile of ship when saw sailor talking earnestly together looking towards shore glancing round saw that top of hill be enveloped in cloud sign a experience have already taught of approach of gale brig have evidently not noticed boat have also observed threatening aspect of cloud a stephen again looked ahead began to shorten sail have not better return one of chilians asked certainly not stephen said wind be against storm will burst before must get back so that must be much better off in brig than must be in open boat get out oar men help along wind be freshening already if rise much more brig will run away from wind indeed got up rapidly oar have to be laid in while cutter be still mile off from brig have evidently be observed attempt be being made to hoist of upper sail have be lowered boat be now flying through water in quarter of hour ran up on leeward side of brig sail be dropped bow man caught hold of chain with boat hook stephen rest of crew at once scrambled on board cutlas in hand there be however resistance crew of brig be a numerous a boarder success of chilians have created effect that captain cried out a leaped on board that surrendered stephen first order be to get cutter up tackle be soon hooked on to be raised from water laid bottom upwards on deck while be being done peruvian crew be ordered to shorten sail be none too soon for brig be heeling far over wind momentarily increasing in strength chilians gave cheer a soon a boat be safely on board in very short time sail be reduced to double reefed top sail under storm jib be laid head to wind sky be now entirely obscured land be no longer visible sea be beginning to rise be going to be heavy gale do think stephen asked peruvian captain very heavy think have seen coming on since daybreak hoped to get to callao before burst be heavily laden in state for facing great gale what have on board military store ammunition money believe so senor there be twenty box sealed up in lazarette now tell what must have done if have not captured know ship better than do must lie to let run must put before wind senor at once will be dangerous to do so when sea get up well put two of best men at helm captain give necessary order know what ought to be done know enough of language to make sure that will not make mistake man brace hand shouted now obey captain order a if be mine manoeuvre be safely executed brig brought before wind felt relief at once sped rapidly before storm on even keel how far will gale extend beyond coast there be saying senor ordinary gale will seldom be felt above hundred hundred fifty mile big one a will think be may take thousand mile before can get on course again be there danger to be feared if go far enough may get among island on course that be steering will run hundred of mile before reach have got chart suppose have chart of coast senor nothing beyond only do coasting trade then look out be bad one if wind hold like stephen said however there be nothing to do now gale continued to increase in violence in couple of hour stephen ordered main topsail to be lowered on to cap there secured be dangerous service be undertaken by chilians who be far more handy sailor than peruvian stephen felt grateful when last of stepped on to deck again small a be amount of sail be now spread brig flew before wind with alarming rapidity sea seeming to stand up on side of foremast bent so much under pressure stephen have to order preventer stay to be rove be with great difficulty risk fastened above hound taken well aft where be tightened by tackle strain on mast considerably relieved wish must get down upper spar shouted to captain pressure help to keep head down after watching for minute ordered stay runner to be cut at same time calling hand aft scarcely have men gathered there than vessel plunged head into sea there be loud report top gallant mast fell over bow with crash two of chilians with ax crawled out along bowsprit cut away gear held spar alongside wreckage at once floated away jib boom be then got in vessel felt relief lifted head more buoyantly over sea for four day gale continued bulwark be carried away wave swept deck continually one tremendous roller carried away boat caboose deck fitting together with four of chilians six of peruvian sailor straining have opened seam although pump have be kept going a long a crew have be able to work at water have be gaining steadily even chilians who have kept on doggedly long after peruvian have thrown down exhausted hopeless now ceased what be evidently useless labour mainmast have be cut away be towed by long hawser from stern thereby aiding to keep vessel dead before wind stephen felt that there be nothing to be done to wait for end there be material for making raft indeed constant wash of sea must have rendered task almost impossible one even have there be spar at hand raft must one have be manufactured must have prolonged life for few hour be now calculated fully thousand mile from land there be chance whatever of vessel coming across in unfrequented sea from time gale burst upon have twice thrown down for short sleep have eaten no food save dry biscuit two peruvian captain agreed with that vessel must float few hour longer rose sluggishly upon sea several time have plunged head so deeply into that stephen thought that be going to dive bodily down night fell captain lay down on two of sofa aft while crew be in forecastle none expected to see morning light stephen left door open saying to captain will make difference must rather make struggle for life before die than be drowned like rat in hole peruvian who have shown much cool courage during storm shrugged shoulder make difference said a rolled cigarette lighted have done that must a for must a lief be drowned here a outside think that there will be much choice will have warning when go will plunge down head foremost stephen be too worn out to reply felt that what captain said be true even thought when woke must be for short struggle for life be insufficient to keep awake in minute two dropped off to sleep how long slept must not tell be awakened suddenly by tremendous crash threw on to floor struggled to foot rushed out almost instinctively in obedience to train of thought before sleeping a issued out of poop wave poured down from above for moment shrunk back be conscious that ship be fast there be longer movement sea struck against stern with force made vessel quiver a to going forward be out of question for wave swept right over peruvian have joined at door voyage have ended senor yes a far a ship be concerned if hold together until morning there will be chance of getting ashore a spoke great wave struck vessel rose on moved few yard further forward then fell again with crash threw off foot illustration ship fell with crash threw steve captain off foot there be not much chance of that peruvian said a rose again taking up conversation at point at have be broken hour two will see end of perhaps even le felt to a if struck over stephen said must think be on flat ledge of rock think that wind be blowing a hard a be when lay down there be star shining at rate may a well go in again wait must only be swept overboard if tried to go forward turned to re enter cabin be nearly carried off foot by torrent of water swept along passage that last wave have smashed stern in said to peruvian must stand outside seated on deck with back to poop cataract of water from time to time swept over from above fell beyond rushed forward head be lower than stern peruvian remarked begin to think may hold together until morning have not lifted again seemed indeed a if storm have made last effort in great surge have shifted vessel forward for although wave still struck with tremendous force must hear occasional rending splintering of timber astern no longer moved although quivered from end to end under blow worked a if at moment must break into fragment foremast have gone stephen said presently suppose went over bow when struck be afraid none of men have escaped ca make out head of vessel at may have be washed ashore be probable that fall of mast imprisoned captain said a stern be raised good many foot must have be drowned at once poor fellow there be good men among wish have have aft steve exclaimed in tone of deep regret of course never thought of indeed there be small room for in little cabin seemed that death must come to together that chance in fo cbe'le be a hopeless a ours in stern cabin be will of god peruvian said philosophically be probable turn have come only few hour before ours sat silently for long time at last stephen said sea be certainly going down can make out outline of land think day will soon be breaking must have slept good many hour before struck took out watch be too dark to see face opened case felt position of hand be half past three said in half hour will have light enough to see where be gradually dawn spread over sky must make out that shore be three hundred yard away that tree came down almost to water edge lay at mouth of small bay a captain have supposed ship bow be under water only few inch of top gallant fo ' cbe'le be to be seen half hour sun be up long before stephen have explored wreck astern several foot have be torn off water flowed freely in out of cabin be evident that ship have be carried on crest of great wave beyond highest point of reef across mouth of bay to fact in degree owed preservation a wave broke twenty yard astern of so spent considerable portion of force before struck looking astern sea be still extremely heavy no longer presented angry appearance have done on previous day wind have almost dropped wave be no longer crested with white foam in hour two will be able to get ashore stephen said have be saved well nigh by miracle captain saved so far captain said can not say yet what be in store for island be for most part inhabited by savage native who will make short work of if fall into hand well must hope for best stephen said have be preserved so far may trust will be preserved through other danger a soon a sea go down must haul foremast alongside cut away rope drift ashore on must be no great distance to swim now there be hurry have best find out whether can not get hold of provision see there be box cask on shore suppose have be washed out of stern one of first thing will be to get arm there be several case of musket down in hold captain said large quantity of ammunition will be difficult business to get at will have plenty of time stephen said be if native interfere with however first thing be to find something to eat for be half famished have doubt will find something in steward cabin captain said fortunately be first inside door have not shared fate of stern cabin if jacopo have slept there last night instead of going forward with crew must have be saved also opened door of cabin uttered exclamation of surprise a saw steward quietly asleep in bunk why jacopo lazy rascal captain shouted have just be mourning for here be sleeping a quietly a if be safe in port man sat up with air of bewilderment why what have happened captain asked sun be shining there be motion did not think to see morning oh rascal captain said pointing to empty bottle lying in bunk thought that be over so emptied one of bottle of aguardiente have slept like hog night pardon captain man said with shamefaced expression everyone said that ship must not live until morning so thought must take good drink so a to know nothing about did not feel even crash when be wrecked wrecked man repeated a ran to door be wrecked after uttered cry of horror a looked round might have be worse captain said at least three have be saved though in case be far from deserving now look about do duty want breakfast see get quickly will say nothing more about bottle of spirit stole now what have got here two fine ham captain bunch of onion barrel of flour salt beef skin of wine not so bad captain said well make fire do slice of ham be there biscuit left yes captain there be barrel then will make shift with biscuit ham see that be quick about for english officer be famished where be to make fire captain caboose be gone never mind about iron plate be still fixed to deck make up fire on look about in other cabin break up anything will supply with wood now senor will get off after hatch while rascal be cooking breakfast have look at state of thing below be afraid will find most of cargo cleared out stephen said think so there be strong bulkhead just below where be standing thing see on shore be in small hold under cabin be used for ship store while main contains cargo got at lazarette from hatch under table of cabin be not convenient be advantage having separate place when be loaded up with hide there be fear of sailor getting at thing did not carry great store five six barrel of flour few sack of potato onion barrel two of biscuit couple of cask of salted meat barrel of coffee one of sugar well then in case sea have saved trouble of getting on shore captain for there be at least dozen cask of one kind on beach now really principal thing be arm if get up case of dozen musket barrel of ammunition will do of course will be at bottom yes above be bale of soldier clothes will be too heavy for to lift out be heavy enough when be dry three of must not lift out sodden a must be with water then must get up sort of derrick there be plenty of block rope on foremast difficulty will be about light spar will have to go ashore cut down two three young tree to make tripod with think captain have better make up mind to live on board until have got job done there be le fear of being attacked by native must hing in way of searching for game until get something to shoot with must make raft of sort for coming backwards forward with there be plenty of bit of timber on beach will do for breakfast be greatly enjoyed be not until hour afterwards that sea be sufficiently smooth for to begin preparation for landing foremast be dragged alongside shroud cut away running rigging unrove coiled on deck ready for future use couple of coil be fastened to mast late in afternoon captain stephen swam ashore taking with end of one of coil while jacopo remained on board to pay out other so until main raft be made mast must be towed backwards forward a soon a be on shore hauled at rope brought mast to beach then set to work examining cask a captain have predicted most of content of lazarette have be cast up found that have ample supply of food to last for month mast have towed so easily that agreed that must be best way to use a main portion of raft dragged piece of timber close to mast lashed side by side there so a to form platform three foot wide on side of length varying from four to twelve foot according to of piece of timber having accomplished after two three hour hard work took place on shouted to jacopo who hauled back to side of wreck have fastened one end of other rope to tree at daylight next morning again landed proceeded with knife to cut down three young tree of four inch in diameter took best part of day head be then cut off leaving three stout pole of fourteen foot in length with returned to ship taking with bag of coffee berry supply of sugar have found on breaking open cask that sugar be somewhat damaged by sea water have not penetrated far by drying repounding that touched by water great harm must have be done next morning shear be erected set to work took two day labour before must clear enough of cargo out to get at case be not troubled much by water for at stern post there be depth of four foot on reef while at bow there be nearly twenty working a did at after hatchway there be five foot of water below uppermost tier of case be consequently above water level barrel of cartridge be still further on be fourth day before be reached three of barrel be got up when two case of musket have be opened weapon cleaned made ready for service felt sense of security to have be stranger since arrived at island there be now urgent matter to be attended to hitherto have drunk wine at meal content of skin be getting very low have become absolutely necessary that must without delay search for water a there be hill of size in interior felt confident that there must be plenty to be found great point be whether must be in neighbourhood at distance from ship be vital question for useful a raft be for coming going between wreck shore be far too heavy clumsy for transporting valuable distance without hatchet carpenter tool must not construct raft by breaking up deck cutting down of tree with pocket knife be not to be thought of accordingly three set out on foot one morning carrying musket store of ammunition portion of cooked ham biscuit together with bottle containing last of stock of wine when rounded point of little bay gave shout of satisfaction for fifty yard away small stream flowed from forest across sand into sea what pity did not search for before stephen said a throwing down scooped hole in sand took long drink of fresh water must have saved wine for special occasion agreed at once to follow stream up a by mean must leave trace of footmark might be able to find suitable spot for encampment chapter xi dangerous companion have gone few hundred yard up stream when heard sound of waterfall presently came upon perpendicular cliff eighty foot high over edge of water fell unbrokenly must be splendid place to camp at edge of pool captain said must have bath always ready at hand even on hottest day must be cool in shade of tree must not be nice place to be caught by native stephen said even if fortified must only have to get up above throw rock down at peruvian regarded risk a trifling in comparison with advantage of situation stephen however determined to climb to top of cliff examine position there so leaving others lying in indolent enjoyment by pool set to work to find way up have to go fully quarter of mile along foot of cliff before must find place where must be ascended once on crest followed edge back until came to top of waterfall to surprise found that flowed almost directly from little lake of three hundred yard in diameter for about fifteen yard from fall on side rock be bare although level of little lake be three foot below stephen have doubt that in case of heavy tropical rain water must rush down from hill faster than gap through fell below must carry off at time must sweep over rock on side fall in torrent thirty yard wide down in to pool view a stood on patch of bare rock be striking one tree top of forest between cliff shore be almost level with foot of taller tree indeed rising considerably higher than ground on stood beyond wide semicircle of sea extended broken by several island small others of considerable size behind ground rose in apparently unbroken ascent to hill judged to be three four mile away must be grand place for hut said to of course must not put on rock for might be swept away by sudden flood besides there must be no shade just inside edge of tree must do splendidly found in fact that at distance of twenty yard from edge of bare rock be same distance from edge of pool to brow of cliff must only be attacked on one side here said though must not cut down tree might make defence with creeper twined in out among trunk must be quite sufficient against sudden attack with such store of musket a have got might keep whole tribe at question be how to get cask thing up here going to edge found that one of tree have large arm overhanging cliff by fixing block there said might bring up from below without difficulty looking over shouted to two men below have found place here said where can make very comfortable with little labour defend from number of savage how can get thing up captain shouted back easily enough have to fix block to arm of tree over head can then run up without difficulty come up captain will see at once advantage of position in quarter of hour peruvian captain joined when stephen explained plan agreed that be good one a say said can only be attacked along narrow place must strengthen so that must hardly venture to try broke off suddenly there be two case of sword in hold never thought of before might not be much good for cutting tree must do for chopping down bush especially long creeper being a tough a cable must blunt knife in time if remember rightly case be stowed just under barrel of ammunition got out so there wo be much trouble in getting at must be first rate stephen said a there be nothing to do now have better go back to ship get one of case out at once when have done that can begin work of rolling barrel along sand to stream will be terrible work getting to foot of cliff captain said yes too heavy altogether must knock head in on shore fill content into sacking hold clothes carry on back to foot of fall then sling up there be number of bale so that can remain up here until get empty barrel up fill in stuff again will be time enough to set to work at fence when have got everything up week later be established in new camp sugar coffee other article be repacked in cask be headed up again to protect from weather assault of insect portion sufficient for week consumption only being left out labour have be great peruvian captain seconded stephen effort well steward however grumbled frequently have many time to be spoken to sharply by captain week be spent in fortifying position young tree be cut down stuck in earth two foot apart in interval between tree wattle work of tough thorny creeper be interwoven across little promontory eight foot high be painful work for however careful be frequently tore hand with spike when be done similar defence be made along at edge of water to within short distance of fall be carried to height of five foot only tent have be erected with canvas brought from wreck thrown over pole fixed between two tree in smaller one by side barrel be stowed now captain stephen said a spent day in absolute rest after labour there be one more thing to be done what be senor be that gold said there be five hundred thousand dollar come to hundred thousand pound in money that a know be lying safely in stern for looked day after wreck so long a be there be safe enough next storm come will certainly smash up wreck altogether box may be swept into deep water between shore now at present moment may consider gold to be common property if spanish ship ever come here will of course capture if on other hand english chilian vessel arrives will hand over to a lawful prize if of come be most likely by far be worth nothing to anyone think ought to get ashore bury in sand above high water mark think that must be very good plan captain agreed may manage in time to get away somehow even if can not take might take of there will be no great trouble in getting ashore box weigh hundred pound there be twenty of raft must take in three four journey if make early start ought to get job done easily enough in day gold be of use to now may be here for year if be long before get away spaniard may be driven out of peru a have be out of chili admiral will have gone home there will be one to claim treasure spanish government have lost chilian have never gained will be sort of windfall that can with clear conscience divide between ourselves if mind captain think that must be very good plan to say nothing to jacopo about business of gold own like fellow in first place be abominably lazy never doe anything like share of work in second place to mind be evil looking scoundrel want to deprive of share of money if time ever come when may talk of dividing in meantime there be reason why must know have be moved day when examined found be safe noticed evil look come into eye unless be greatly mistaken idea struck that if be to rid of must be master of treasure there will be difficulty in carrying out matter without knowing when be moving store often remained behind under pretence of cooking have only to say that be going to overhaul cargo see if can find anything else may be useful to day will be glad enough to be left in charge here think that be right captain agreed have reason to doubt jacopo honesty still thought of so much wealth although be of more value here than so much sand may excite avarice many man throat have be cut in peru for score of dollar le be just a well not to put temptation in fellow way at present moment must exchange gold for stout twenty foot boat well provisioned to must be simply wealth beyond dream be just a well not to put idea into mind by ever mentioning stuff before gold be brought on shore buried in sand at foot of tall tree standing just beyond highest watermark work took two day a time be spent in making further search in cargo from be fished up bale of linen trouser coat formed undress uniform during heat of summer shoe be also found stephen captain returned to fort laden with large bundle stephen be especially glad at discovery of light clothes in have started on chase of brig be so shrunk with sea water a to be almost unwearable have be going about in spanish uniform found most uncomfortably hot be almost barefooted shoe be even more highly prized than light clothing captain have also lost effect jacopo have saved scanty wardrobe be now prepared for everything stephen said think shipwrecked mariner be ever better set up have clothes sufficient for lifetime great stock of weapon ammunition provision enough for couple of month at least last be weakest point admit there be whole island a hunting ground must begin set to work to explore captain ham have gone long ago have be longing for time for change from salt meat besides want fruit vegetable badly have stuck to work well deserve holiday first thing to do will be to climb to top of hill get idea of size of island begin to think that can not be inhabited for if have be must surely have discovered wreck before now be not certain captain replied may be large island village may lie on other side however have certainly ground for hope that have got to ourselves one thing be anxious to find be sheltered spot cave where can pas rainy season place where now be be charming in such weather a be for ten month in year be not perch must choose in such gale a cast ashore must certainly be unpleasant must not think there be much chance of finding cave except on seashore cave be by mean common article however will doubt be able to light on sheltered place where can take up abode during rain first of must find out whether island be really uninhabited there will be sort of thing to do a soon a can assure ourselves of must be rather glad of one good gale captain gale strong enough to break up vessel altogether of course have be perfect treasure house to never go on board without shudder at thought of fo cbe'le just below level of water be more than standing at edge of graveyard captain said philosophically yes be true know that even if must have got at first day taken ashore buried must have be unpleasant business very peruvian agreed thing have turned out for best be buried at sea instead of being buried on land for regret that ship did not lie on even keel be not because must have got at body buried because in there must have found many thing must have be useful must probably have got axe two tool canvas needle twine of must have be very valuable to well same captain will be glad when gale knock ship to piece besides a long a be there must be seen at once by canoe coming along on side of island on going on board native must see that of crew must have survived that thing have be brought up taken ashore then there must be sure to be search after yes be right there senor have not thought of doubt be desirable that must disappear do think that must blow up captain there be plenty of powder on board peruvian shook head must shatter portion must still remain sticking up above water explosion must be heard fifty mile round cloud of smoke be seen from island within distance there must soon be canoe coming to see what have caused will be best to let remain a be until break up with first gale next morning started taking jacopo with captain proposed leaving behind stephen pointed out that if left alone for long day man might not improbably swim off to ship to assure that gold be still in position might do that captain agreed like most of class be superstitious doubt whether must go on board wreck alone still will be better to take with be certain that there be fear of hut being disturbed during absence if must come upon native three of be better than two took four hour to reach summit of hill undergrowth of creeper being so dense that be often compelled to cut way through at last reached summit a did so stopped in surprise before be cup shaped depression two hundred yard across centre being hundred foot below edge be crater of old volcano peruvian said be age since be active so that need have fear uneasiness on score interior be clothed with verdure here there black crag showed through foliage elsewhere be smooth smiling slope be regular be evident that a captain said long age have gone by since there have be disturbance vegetation have grown up died until soil thick enough to conceal rock have at one time doubt thickly strewn bottom have be buried what be down in centre stephen said there seems to be patch clear of tree there be figure of kind there see on other side what look like regular path have be cut through tree bush perhaps be burying place at rate will go see walked round to other side of crater from there must obtain view of side of island opposite to on have landed be far le extensive than have expected hill sloping steeply down sea be quarter of mile away great number of island studded ocean of at distance appeared considerably larger than upon have be cast thank goodness stephen exclaimed island be evidently uninhabited now can wander about freely yes might have saved trouble of fortifying position captain said gave something to do captain did good in way besides party of native from other island may land here sometimes now let go down explore crater descended path soon stood in bottom of crater saw be veritable graveyard in centre be rough structure built of large stone sloping inwards forming rough representation of hut have evidently be placed there century before for be green with age lichen moss grew upon here there small shrub sprang up in crevice what have once be entrance be closed with great flat slab of rock round central cairn be eight ten smaller one be evidently of comparatively recent origin one of be surrounded by hedge of spear on of hung piece of tattered cloth of native manufacture round central hut be arranged four figurehead of ship while in circle stood number of hideous idol carried by many of south sea islander in war canoe must say that account for island being uninhabited stephen said suppose there be still tradition of having be volcano that mountain perhaps whole island be sacred only used a burial place for very great chief went across to grave surrounded by spear here said be dozen skeleton piled together sacrifice suppose on tomb of chief if have not be for spear skeleton must have said from appearance of cairn that must be at least hundred year old perhaps great deal more better peruvian said hope will be hundred year before come to bury anyone else here must come here good deal oftener than stephen said god of theirs be new at rate freshly painted besides place be evidently kept with care must think very likely people of other island make pilgrimage here once year so to offer sacrifice to god supposed to reside in central cairn to keep house in order think that can not do better than follow path back see where go to may not extend beyond crater if continues through forest down to shore will be evident that have recently be visited for thing grow so fast in climate like in year path must be completely blocked up by vegetation where be jacopo there be at top of crater did not come down with doubt considered that place be likely to be haunted by spirit ascended path to top of crater ground here be bare for short distance stephen saw that two line of stone marked course of path to tree did not lead down towards sea be carried obliquely round top of hill until reached edge of forest on side of island on have landed two rude image marked spot where entered forest now led down in direct path six foot wide be completely clear of shrub not smallest shoot of brushwood showed above soil wherever ground descended steeply rude step have be cut tree on side of path have be barked on side facing here there stick ten foot high with piece of coloured cloth hanging from stood along side of path path be almost like trough centre being fully two foot lower than general level must be used very frequently peruvian said have probably be used for age doubt in rainy season water help to hollow out work must have be begun by human foot jacopo kept closely behind others crossing frequently muttering invocation to saint followed path until came out at head of deep inlet be useful road to top of hill stephen said have not taken more than three quarter of hour coming down while be six time a long in going up hard at work time look there there be mistake a to number who come here pointed to patch of ash charred wood scattered thickly on sand above water line along edge of inlet there can be doubt about that peruvian said place must be constantly visited at rate by great number at time however know whether need disturb evidently go straight up to worship sacrifice come straight down again that have got to do be not to fire gun when be on island however may a well look along shore to see if there be further path into forest examined carefully must see sign that native have gone inland at other point may a well go along shore now stephen said then will see how far inlet be from bay be turning to start when there be rustle among undergrowth followed by short deep sound jacopo dropped musket fell on knee captain crossed hastily stephen dashed forward towards spot where sound have come shouting come along captain be pig there be rush a entered bush dozen pig dashed off levelled musket fired at hindmost gave shout of delight a rolled over fresh meat captain exclaimed a peruvian joined there be at least dozen others who have made off hurrah there be fear of starving may be sure that be not only herd on island pig be dragged out on to sea shore be young animal although nearly full grown jacopo be now in element cut pig open eviscerated carried down to edge of water washed tied leg together with sword cut down sapling thrust through will carry pig senor a shot be fair division of labour captain said raising one end of pole on shoulder while jacopo took other have gone hundred yard further when tree near beach grew le densely ground beneath be covered by plant with large leaf yellow flower stephen who be walking ahead went up to examine hurrah captain shouted be wild melon others laid down pig ran up to patch extended a far a must see plant covered ground climbed tree by mean of rattan festooning with bright leaf flower fruit of degree of ripeness on ground found ripe fruit there be evident sign that be favourite resort of pig that devoured fruit a fast a ripened will fence in large patch of stephen said there will be plenty for pig too never felt thankful that pig must not climb before laughed a cut melon hanging overhead although somewhat wanting in flavour fruit seemed to three men after privation for upwards of month from green vegetable fruit to be delicious how do suppose that got here captain seed may have be carried by bird from place where melon be cultivated captain said possibly even from mainland have heard that seed be carried immense distance in way may be that seed be washed overboard from passing ship be cast ashore here care how came here be well contented to find will carry away seed of eat plant near camp said stephen will soon get supply without having to come here to fetch besides will attract pig enable to get fresh meat without having trouble of scrambling through forest tearing clothes to piece with thorn cut a many melon a must carry in addition to pig then proceeded on way followed shore quarter of mile further when to satisfaction found at bay at mouth of wreck be lying in half hour be at home be certain to see boat coming stephen said a stood at edge of cliff looked out over sea unless come from of island on other side coast round to landing place on other hand there be disadvantage a come in to inlet can hardly help seeing wreck must make rule when go down to walk in stream until get to edge of sea then to keep along on wet sand where footprint will disappear directly in way must have clue to direction in to look for yes must be a well to observe precaution peruvian said when once get melon patch here will not have reason to go down there very often have got everything want from wreck have coast along to left to explore where may make useful discovery two day later again went to sea shore followed to left leaving jacopo time behind have gone mile when came upon thorny bush covered with fruit peruvian pronounced to be guava ate of then proceeded on way before long came upon group of tree bearing fruit considerably larger than orange stephen have seen when cruising on first voyage among island pronounced to be bread fruit let go further peruvian said have found enough good thing for one day let leave rest for to morrow stephen laughed at rate be good excuse for getting back again indeed be quite ready to do so for have strong desire to see what jacopo have be up to in absence must be willing to make wager with that find at hut gathered quantity of bread fruit passed guava bush reluctantly must set to work to make basket captain stephen said want such thing badly can make good sized bag out of sacking will do very well for melon bread fruit want something that can carry thing like guava in without crushing on return to camp found a stephen expected that jacopo be absent at once set out along edge of cliff until reached point at obtained view into bay wreck lay apparently deserted let sit down watch stephen said may not have reached yet there be a spoke figure came out from door of poop just a thought captain have gone down to see if gold be there look at jacopo be evidently furious must see waving arm stamping angrily on deck then went to side shook fist in direction of tent that fellow be dangerous captain stephen said gravely captain nodded safest plan will be to shoot at once can not do that have better tell frankly tonight that have moved gold buried lest vessel must go to piece in storm that intend to give up to spanish chilian ship may come here that if be long time before be rescued will then divide gold between that will get fair share of must be better to shoot captain said be right be evident that have be thinking over money that a likely a not have determined to posse whole of however will see how behaves may a well tell a soon a arrives when see that mean fair by may possibly be content at rate for time especially a must know a well a do how small be chance of ship coming along be altogether out of line of traffic ship going round horn keep far south of on way to china while for peru chili keep up coast there be traffic at from peru chili to china india now that have everything want here captain know that can hold on for long time ought to begin to think over plan for future if have tool must certainly build craft must carry to chili must be terrible business to build one with nothing sword to cut down tree hew out timber shape plank still if there be nothing else to be done must do that be only matter of time patience will find that hour hang very heavy on hand when necessary work be done here must think that ought to be able to build craft of twenty ton in couple of year at outside at rate can think of other plan for getting away have be thinking that might steal canoe when native come here peruvian said daresay might captain if a be probable come in large canoe three of must make very little speed with one of must be pursued overtaken in time may be sure that spend night up on hill probably when go up will leave of number on beach to look after canoe cook even if did get away must hing with canoe know captain said might land with on small island fit deep keel on to get up couple of mast lug sail of course must make beforehand yes might do stephen agreed difficulty of carrying off boat must be immense besides must have to be victualled must have to take food water for long journey to get barrel filled with fresh water on board must be long task utterly impossible to carry out in short time that must have to spare even if beach be entirely deserted yes see be very difficult captain agreed must not mind running risk rather than undertake two year hard labour must not mind running risk either captain if saw probability of success own that seems impossibility however may be that sometimes small party come alone that must get possession of canoe of manageable size at rate may a well prepare for such chance before setting to work to build have plenty of canvas from fore topgallant sail head sail of brig can make couple of lug sail fit for large canoe couple for smaller one get spar ready must not take great deal of time if bit of luck doe fall in way must be ready to avail ourselves of fellow have swam ashore now so have better be going back to hut quarter of hour after reached jacopo appeared stopped in surprise when saw so have be off to wreck jacopo captain said found a much fruit a must carry have brought straight back again finding that have gone went along cliff saw on deck suppose went off to see if gold be safe have seen to that did not like to leave there for ship will break up in first gale box might be swept into deep water be lost so carried ashore gold know be not ours be property either of spanish chilian government will hand over to first ship of of nation may come along if however a be likely enough ship come near island for year spanish a may well be have by time lost possession on west coast altogether may then consider to be ours if get away propose to divide into three equal share a officer have right to larger share than have agreed that if do work here with willingly cheerfully will not stand on right will give equal portion of with at present gold be of more value to of than so much sand beyond fact that if build craft a senor have be talking of doing box will be found excellent ballast otherwise be not worth thought way be very good senor jacopo said humbly can promise that will have reason to complain of without word turned cut off portion of pig be hanging from bough near proceeded to prepare meal hope that have made matter right peruvian said in low voice to stephen must watch closely for short time see how go on if look at matter sensibly must see that a said gold be of value to of at present spoke too humbly altogether in opinion said stephen a be evident that so long a be here interest be alike that three of will have better chance of escape than one must alone may give up thought of gold until time approach for to make start next day went down unlaced fore topgallant sail from yard where lay on beach upon have be washed up after have stripped mast proceeded to cut from two lug sail so a to save trouble of carrying entire canvas up to tent chapter xii death of captain work of making up sail occupied next three day of canvas be unravelled for use a twine hole be made with long sharp thorn jacopo when not engaged in cooking worked diligently seldom joining in conversation between captain stephen conversation turned principally upon best method of building launching proposed boat stephen proposal be that must if possible first get up deck plank must be done by driving wedge between beam after one be taken up work of wedge must be aided by pole used a lever when plank have be taken up a far forward a water must permit to work proposed to blow up after part of ship by mean must obtain large amount of beam timber must be utilized for boat at much le cost of labour than must be entailed by cutting down of tree proposed that explosion must take place at night a roar flash must be supposed by native of island near to be something supernatural connected with spot evidently held in such veneration even be to row across to see if anything have taken place said be about last thing that must be likely to do must doubt make for usual landing place a greater portion of ship above water must have disappeared anything remained must not be likely to catch eye calculated that if plan succeeded ought to be able to build boat of required size in six month at outside preparation of planking have be most arduous portion of plan have first laid out must be done away with altogether a nail must doubtless draw out of plank must obtain plenty of bolt fastening from fragment of wreck building of boat be now comparatively simple stephen even fancied that might complete in four month word be spoken a to gold stephen felt that difficulty might finally arise out of considered a lawful prize for chilian government peruvian be two to one against although might have desire to return to spaniard who be detested by great majority of peruvian might set up claim to on own account however dismissed idea from mind a one must be left to be determined by circumstance for month laboured assiduously plank be successfully taken up then after much consideration preparation be made for blowing up vessel powder barrel be brought up fuse be made six foot long passing from barrel to barrel chain of barrel be laid from stern to point where deck be level with water plan be adopted in order that whole fabric must be shaken broken up while have whole force of explosion taken place at one point must have entirely destroyed timber there while perhaps leaving considerable portion still standing above water success of explosion be complete in morning there be sign of ship above water while bay be covered with floating wreckage took time to collect bring to shore then to tow to spot have decided upon a being best suited for launch be near point of bay beach here sloped more steeply than elsewhere first work be to erect platform sloping still more steeply covered with piece of timber too short for other work craft must thus be built at angle must ensure sliding down into water during progress of building must be retained in place by rope fastened to tree behind by block of wood under stern post among timber one be found long enough to serve a keel when be laid down stern post stem be fitted to securely bolted felt that most difficult part of work be done great labour be required to get out copper bolt from timber in case wood have to be split up before must be extracted work of getting out rib fastening in place be much le arduous than have expected for greater portion of timber of brig have come on shore among be able to find many with curve fairly suited to requirement required hacking off with cutlass while on to others piece of plank be nailed to get required curve by end of five month hull be planked decked felt very proud of work be caulked with oakum obtained from of least serviceable of rope of brig dipped in resin that found oozing from tree fore topmast of brig furnished suitable mast be stepped stayed bowsprit boom gaff be constructed from light spar mainsail foresail jib have be manufactured during long evening when boat be completely rigged timber down be to glide be smeared with lard carried down a far a possible under water being kept in place by heavy stone placed on end be great day when shore be knocked away rope held stern being previously cast off at once moved rapidly down into water amid shout of triumph from constructor drew about three foot of water calculated that when have got ballast store water on board must sink foot must then have three foot of free board have already laid in large stock of pork have salted obtaining salt by filling pool in rock with salt water be replenished a fast a evaporated great stock of melon have also be cut barrel have be carefully examined placed in lake to swell become water tight now that boat be once in water be anxious to be off without smallest possible delay for be native to appear just at moment labour must be thrown away a soon therefore a have gone on board found that craft be perfectly water tight hauled towards spot where have buried gold dug up box carried down to water edge boat be then hauled in until be in four foot of water stephen jacopo waded out carrying box on head then captain lifted on board taking below packed along keel by time be late in afternoon calculated that by beginning at daybreak must get greater portion of store water on board next day be moonlight night after indulging in supper long talk over next day work lay down to sleep be time before stephen fell into light sleep being too excited at thought of approaching deliverance to compose to sound slumber be awakened by slight movement turning round saw in moonlight jacopo kneeling by captain with knife uplifted with shout stephen sprung up grasped sword have ever since gold be hidden placed by side when lay down rushed at peruvian knife have however descended twice assassin gained foot just a stephen fell upon so quick have be latter movement that edge of sword fell on side of murderer face before have time to place on guard with howl of pain rage sprang out from end of tent rushed to narrow opening left in barricade stephen pursued hotly peruvian be quicker footed dodging among tree presently left behind stephen returned to tent stirred up fire to blaze then bent over captain saw at once that latter be dead knife having twice struck in region of heart stephen took up one of loaded musket sat down at entrance of barricade felt completely crushed at blow early suspicion of jacopo have gradually died out for man have worked willingly steadily have seemed perfectly contented with prospect entered a keenly into building of cutter a stephen captain have done be evident now that have along meditated murder have only delayed until craft be built fitted gold in place everything ready for sailing save putting store on board must manage by illustration with shout stephen snatched up sword rushed at assassin hour before everything seemed clear now stephen blamed that have prevented captain from shooting villain on day when latter discovered that gold have gone yet act must have be murder for there be proof that jacopo intended to play false what stephen asked be to do now be certain that murderer must not permit without effort to sail away that must be able to hide among tree to spring out at moment upon a came past laden with barrel sack be not even clear how must get wink of sleep for at moment assassin might crawl up stab so stephen passed night watched attentively for slightest sound did not think that fellow be likely to return night for be certain that have wounded very severely besides scoundrel must feel sure that must keep vigilant watch a soon a day broke got up went to tent to verify thought have struck during watch counted musket there be twenty two cold perspiration broke out on forehead worst fear be realized jacopo have managed during last day two to take two of musket carry away with so that must intention to murder two companion miscarry must be able to wage war against must certainly have provided with good store of ammunition difficult a position have seemed before difficulty danger be increased tenfold now knew that peruvian be provided with firearm there must be occasion for open attack fellow must only have to hide up in undergrowth shoot down a passed be danger against there be providing at moment from time left tent must be liable to be shot down by invisible foe moving about almost mechanically stephen boiled water in very thin skinned gourd have found best substitute for kettle be necessary to use fresh one frequently be plentiful in wood supply be always kept on hand a soon a boiled threw in handful of coffee have be roasted pounded day two before laid chop cut from pig on ember put biscuit on to toast beside have thought of being in danger for felt sure that jacopo must not run risk of approaching tent after meal be cooked eaten sat for long time pondering over what have best be done first impulse have be to take to wood carrying couple of musket store of provision sufficient for day two to hunt peruvian down in case must be ignorant of other position movement must have advantage over other on other hand while be hunting jacopo latter might be putting sufficient store of melon perhaps carcase of pig on board boat making off with gold be there assassin must be ready to run risk to get away with must doubtless prefer to silence only voice must give evidence against must know that chance of stephen ever making escape by must be so small that might be disregarded stephen thought that at rate risk of peruvian attempting to set sail that day be small must be suffering intense pain from wound must probably be incapable of making great exertion most of trusted to jacopo thirst for vengeance to keep for while on island eager a might be to sail away with gold might well postpone departure for few day until have avenged for wound have be inflicted on jacopo have one advantage over must select spot where must at once command path down to shore keep eye upon cutter while from camp stephen be unable to obtain view into bay a be thinking matter over stephen eye fell upon block rope by barrel have be hoisted up have for long time be disused for have found much shorter to clear path from spot where descended from cliff direct to little bay thereby saving at least two third of distance matter of importance while be engaged upon boat building idea at once presented that might leave spot by mean without knowledge of peruvian must thereby turn table on be about to put loop at end of rope around body swing over when hesitated might be driven to adopt same plan that credited jacopo with intention of following after thought took seventy pound of salt pork from barrel put in sack round fastened rope in such manner that a soon a strain on be relieved must be shaken off then climbed out on to bough poured little melted lard on sheave of block to prevent from creaking then lowered barrel down shook off fastening drew up rope again then sent down large sack full of melon done there be nothing to do to wait until dusk kept up good fire day thinking probable that jacopo must have placed where must see smoke rising calculated that man must suppose that must be likely to attempt to leave post after dark must then place somewhere on path to shoot a went past a soon a be dark lowered four of musket with bag of ammunition then followed first carried musket ammunition down to shore then made two trip with pork melon then rolled one of water cask have already be filled down sand into sea entering water breast deep pushed before until came to rope from stern of craft to shore returning fetched pork melon musket ammunition then waded swam out to cutter holding sword in teeth pulled noiselessly up then sword in hand descended into cabin where thought be just possible that peruvian might be sleeping light of moon be sufficient to show that be empty ascending to deck again slackened out headrope attached to heavy stone served a anchor then hauled on rope ashore until felt stern sand making fast rope lowered down waded to shore then brought off musket ammunition pork melon on head lastly got barrel of water alongside put sling round fastened main halliard to hoisted on board be now in position to make off still altogether inadequately provisioned for such voyage a meditated after thought determined to return on shore have at first thought of remaining on board hoisting sail must attract attention of jacopo a soon a be light enough for to see probably in fury at being outwitted man must rush frantically down try to get on board in case stephen must have to shoot in cold blood felt must not bring to do decided finally upon going on shore where must meet man on equal term accordingly hoisted sail then landed with couple of loaded musket taking place behind tree short distance up path waiting until morning various journey have taken time be now judged about three o'clock a soon a be light watch began in earnest contrary to expectation be fully hour before heard sign of jacopo coming accounted for delay on supposition that peruvian must think perhaps that although have outwitted got on board must be altogether unprovided with store unable therefore to put to sea must suppose then that have returned to shore especially a there be sign of on board craft at last saw coming down path with stealthy crouching step with one musket slung behind other in hand ready for instant action be dreadful sight face be bound up with sleeve cut from shirt forehead be encrusted hair matted with dried blood with also linen jacket trouser be thickly stained stephen have chosen tree round whose foot be thick growth of bush now proceeded to put into execution plan that have decided upon stooping behind trunk of tree thrust up from among bush cap on top of ramrod taking care that upper part only just showed above leaf almost instantly jacopo levelled rifle fired stephen gave loud cry dropped cap peruvian with yell of exultation threw away gun drew knife bounded forward a came up stephen sprang out brought butt end of gun down with strength on peruvian head striking senseless to ground stephen picked up murderer knife placed in belt took musket from shoulder then with cord have brought with bound foot turning over fastened wrist tightly together then raised placed in sitting position against tree passed cord several time round trunk knotting firmly behind tree then went away to stream cut couple of gourd filled with water returned jacopo have now opened eye be looking round in dazed condition when saw stephen approaching made struggle to rise be of use jacopo stephen said quietly power of mischief be at end have murdered captain must have murdered so now life be justly forfeited did give fate deserve must bring down body of victim tie to leave to die of thirst fortunately for be british officer can not be judge executioner peruvian reply be volley of curse execration will drink water stephen asked without paying attention to word peruvian only reply be to spit furiously at stephen placed one of gourd on ground close to saying will think better of presently poured content of other over jacopo head then returning to boat brought off coil of rope with still more securely fastened jacopo to tree then went up to tent spent day in carrying down store of provision arm ammunition asking jacopo time passed whether must have water for time prisoner refused agony of thirst caused by fever of wound at last overcame resolution cried loudly a stephen approached for water stephen held gourd to lip until drank off whole of content then went refilled gourd poured one over man head set other down beside continued work by nightfall have carried everything on board there remained to take other water cask alongside jacopo have drunk several gourd full of water during day by evening became delirious from fury fever of wound stephen therefore undid fastening save round ankle took up post near night man raved incessantly from time to time stephen got up poured water between lip in morning cut very ripe melon squeezed juice from pulp gave to to drink then went down towed other water barrel to cutter got on board afterwards returned to prisoner for three day delirium continued stephen kept bandage round head constantly moistened with water gave melon juice to drink third night raving sank to whisper presently became silent stephen thought that must soon be over however man breathing became quiet regular in morning opened eye with consciousness in here still murmured a stephen bent over yes jacopo villain a be must not leave to die how long have be here man murmured after long pause be four day since attacked now that be sensible will set sail will first carry to side of stream now that have got through fever will recover have left at tent one of musket store of ammunition so that will be able to shoot pig there be a know abundance of melon bread fruit guava daresay will discover other thing ere long trust that in time be before will repent of sin try make peace with god have buried body of man murdered with difficulty stephen got jacopo on to back carried to stream laid down at edge in shade of tree then placed within reach of number of melon bread fruit biscuit have long since taken rope off ankle understand why have done for must have killed if must have treated a if be brother know that be of use asking to take with will do one last favour certainly if be in power jacopo will bring musket ammunition down here must not go near there again stephen nodded will get for said at once started for tent first pulled storetent down rolled together lowered to side of pool climbed out cut fastening of block let rope fall beside then threw over case of sword have not thought worth taking away then getting gun ammunition returned to jacopo there be said here be three hundred round of ammunition by side of pool under cliff will find two tent rope ten spare sword may prove useful to here be three gourd full of water close to hand by reaching over can fill a often a like in week have doubt that will be strong enough to walk be there anything else can do there be nothing senor may god bless for kindness may god pardon stephen said adding a turned away may be that day passing ship may carry off then turning walked slowly back to shore wretch a man be felt pang at leaving behind be sure that even if must overcome repugnance to a murderer of captain must not take with for must never be safe for moment with returning health strength must come afresh lust for gold might soon overcome feeling of gratitude for treatment that have received when reached shore near boat cast off stern rope then swam on board hoisted jib foresail pulled up anchor took place at tiller breeze be very light one for time cutter moved along slowly a got beyond shelter of land felt wind began to spin fast through water stephen spirit have be greatly depressed for last few day rose a little craft heeled to breeze nearly six month have be spent on island at last be free a to course have sun by day star by night to guide knew that vessel have be blown almost due west that by heading east must make coast either of chili peru found to satisfaction that boat must keep course very near wind that came about easily rapidly be certainly swift under canvas carried topmast a have agreed that with only three hand must be better to avoid complication of gear in middle of day wind fell good deal at time be abreast of large island presently saw war canoe shoot out from shore lashing tiller ran down below brought up twenty three musket loaded laid against bulwark astern then took place at helm again looked anxiously across water in hope of seeing dark line must tell of breeze freshening again knew enough however of wind prevalent among island to be sure that must not strengthen much for next two three hour from number of paddle going on side of canoe calculated that must carry from forty to fifty men hope be that must be unacquainted with firearm must draw off when began to fire when came within about four hundred yard took up musket fired taking aim at little distance from side of boat at report paddle ceased instantly for time be evident that great confusion reigned among rower while be going on stephen reloaded piece after five minute delay men recommenced paddling at pace contrasted strongly with rapid eager stroke have before rowed stephen waited time until be within two hundred fifty yard then lying down on deck resting barrel on bulwark took steady aim fired one of men standing up in bow fell overboard paddling ceased again hubbub of voice be heard a lay motionless stephen fired shot after shot one two of hit canoe two three others went wide rest did execution among crowded mass by noise be evident that wished to go on others to retire after discharging twelve shot stephen began to hastily reload piece have fired cessation of fire apparently reassured war party for when have reloaded six of paddle again began to work stephen at once recommenced firing eighth shot brought down chief who be standing prominently in stern be evidently in command fall have instantaneous effect with yell of terror native ceased paddling then began to back others to row canoe turned slowly round then sped away at rate a fast a have come up although number of paddler be markedly decreased satisfied that must not return stephen reloaded musket then went below for first meal on board cabin must have seemed poor place to yachtsman with rough beam timber discoloured planking yachtsman ever felt prouder of craft than stephen did of boat in whose building have taken share there be bulk head hull being open from end to end water cask provision have be stowed aft mast illustration stephen beat off great war canoe single handed one of barrel served a table iron plate have be taken from floor of ship galley have be placed forward of mast on layer of sand three inch thick forecastle hatch have be placed above to serve a exit for smoke store of wood result of ship building operation be piled in bow stephen did not trouble to cook boiled water over chip of wood made cup of coffee rather half of small gourd of coffee ate melon biscuit presently went up on deck again at three o'clock light breeze sprung up hour later strengthened to heavy blow stephen sailed on until midnight then reefed mainsail fastened boom amidships lowered foresail hauled jib to weather having thus laid cutter head to wind lay down on deck slept soundly until daybreak next day passed two three island at considerable distance beyond land be visible hoped that be fairly beyond archipelago with hostile native day after day passed without incident stephen always lay to at night for few hour calculated that rate at sailed during remaining eighteen be allowing for calm four knot hour on sixth day appearance of sky changed stephen prepared for bad weather by fully reefing mainsail cloud banked up rapidly wind rose be southerly boat tore rapidly through water two hour later stephen let foresail run down under reduced sail boat went more lightly easily over rising sea by evening have stowed mainsail altogether slackening jib sheet held on course by midnight be blowing gale raised gaff four five foot put lashing round sail to prevent blowing out then hauling on weather sheet let lay to taking now place at tiller so a to be able to bring head up did pay off wind be anxious night little craft be lightly ballasted buoyant rose to sea without taking great quantity of water over bow for two day storm continued stephen never left tiller during time save to run below at interval snatch mouthful of food after first two three hour have felt no fear whatever a to ability of craft to weather gale be long strain be deeply thankful when wind abated sufficiently for to be able to hoist reefed mainsail again to lie to comfortably a soon a be done went below slept for twelve hour sun be shining brightly when awoke light breeze be blowing save for long swell sea have gone down indulged in hearty breakfast before proceeding on way then shook out reef in mainsail hoisted got up foresail slacked off weather sheet of jib again headed east one morning ten day later saw sun rise behind broken outline instead of line of horizon knew that must be nothing hill of mainland lofty a be might be still hundred fifty mile from weather be fair wind fresh boat travelling at six knot hour by mid day to morrow must be close to land whether be chili peru that lay ahead of have mean of knowing believed be former for have headed rather to south of east felt sure that must strike coast somewhere on long seaboard of chili be more convinced of a two day before have seen island far to north of guessed to be either san felix san ambrose have shaped course rather more to south in consequence night be too excited to turn in a usual held on course by morning land lay little more than twenty mile away recognized at once outline of hill that have passed when sailing north knew where valparaiso lay fifty mile further south changed course accordingly at four o'clock in afternoon dropped stone anchor hundred yard off quay of chilian port chapter xiii prize money stephen busied in stowing away sail by time have done so small crowd have collected on quay looking with surprise wonder at little craft with unpainted side rough appearance in short time boat with port official rowed alongside stepping on deck officer looked round in surprise at seeing only one person on board stephen have before arriving at port donned clean suit of linen trouser jacket cap be out of shape badge on front have faded into blur be barefooted hair have grown almost to shoulder aspect of boat be almost a surprising a of solitary occupant there be sign of paint visible work be rough stanchion of various size new in appearance blackened with age sea water who be senor official asked what craft be craft have name senor though who built thought of naming deliverer be stephen embleton flag midshipman to admiral lord cochrane may ask if admiral be now in port be official replied may beg to send off shore boat by may despatch message to admiral story be strange one official said gravely have seen young officer state to be in company with admiral be bound to say that recognize be not surprised at stephen said with smile in first place must imagine that face be colour of mahogany from wind sun in second hair have not be cut for six month lastly suit of clothes though excellent in way be scarcely in accordance with rank will myself row off to admiral ship official said convey message to what will tell thank sir will please say that stephen embleton be on board craft be alone for certain reason can not leave pray to come to send trusted officer with party of sailor to take charge of official saluted gravely be by mean sure of sanity of young fellow curiosity have be aroused by appearance that of craft therefore condescended to undertake mission at ordinary time must have scorned stephen watched boat row alongside frigate anchored mile away shortly afterwards saw stir boat be pulled up to accommodation ladder party of sailor then took place in two figure came down gangway boat pushed off few minute later reached side of cutter stephen saluted a lord cochrane sprang nimbly on board dear lad admiral exclaimed grasping hand gave up for lost many month ago have mourned for deeply where have be what have be doing what on earth have done to where did get extraordinary craft have be cast away on island twelve hundred mile to west only three of be saved built craft between one of comrade be dead other remains on island have sailed back single handed think sir will account for somewhat strange appearance fully fully lad well must tell about afterwards why did not come direct in boat to ship instead of sending for because be afraid of anyone else coming on board until have sent someone must trust to take possession of why bless lord cochrane said with laugh must not have taken to be a valuable a that be most creditable a specimen of work of three shipwrecked men must say from appearance a rowed up to that be fairly fast might be worth good deal a exhibition if have in thames must not fetch many hundred dollar here though have doubt that when properly painted up in trim must make excellent little coaster be cargo not ship sir be valuable what doe consist of consists of gold sir there be five hundred thousand dollar stowed in box admiral looked at in astonishment five hundred thousand dollar mr embleton be in earnest quite so sir ship sent off to with twelve hand be laden with military store money for payment of spanish troop be fortunate enough to get on board capture just before storm burst when be wrecked on island of whose name be ignorant stern where gold be stowed be fortunately in only four foot of water have therefore difficulty in getting at box carrying on shore where buried until have built craft admiral ran down companion into cabin saw box lying side by side along length of keel congratulate heartily said to stephen be by far richest prize have fallen into hand did perfectly right in sending for for in faith must not trust treasure out of sight on consideration until handed over to chilian government after taking care to deduct fleet share of prize money will be welcome can tell for pay of fleet be terribly in arrear treasury be empty there be mean of refilling properly speaking whole of fleet share of money must go to rule of service be arbitrary conversation have be in english admiral going on deck ordered officer who have remained sitting in gig to tow cutter alongside flag ship officer at once gave necessary order two of men jumped on board hauled up anchor nothing presence of admiral prevented burst of laughter among boat crew a stone came to surface a be there be broad grin on face two men resumed place in boat cutter be towed to side of flag ship lord cochrane ordered whip to be sent down with sling superintended bringing up of box whose weight in comparison to size excited lively surprise among sailor who brought up to deck sling be placed round one by one be hoisted to deck of frigate carried into admiral cabin after last box have be swung up admiral stephen went up accommodation ladder to deck officer be gathered round box wondering at weight what must say have in gentleman lord cochrane asked must say that contained specie captain said have not be out of question so great amount must be collected in chili be happy to inform gentleman that box contain spanish gold that be lawful prize captured from enemy by boat crew from ship under command of flag midshipman mr embleton man on board therefore in proportion to rank will come in for share of prize money for will have to thank fellow officer here hitherto none of have recognized stephen have be wondering who strange figure be that have come on board with admiral still looked almost incredulous until stephen stepped forward held out hand to special friend addressed by name why be really don estevan have given up for lost be glad indeed to see again other officer came round heartily greeted stephen asking question together about long absence wonderful prize of admiral have spoken will answer a many question a can presently stephen protested in first place must have bath change clothes have hair cut be thing still on board be anyone else in cabin learned to great satisfaction that cabin be a have left for week admiral hoped that must return there be indeed much anxiety about boat when saw storm coming on whether have gained brig before burst of course none of knew must only hope that have done so storm be terrible one here while thought that brig might have foundered at once when struck be certain that if weathered first blow must have to run for be one of worst storm people here say have be experienced on coast for many year alike in fury in duration agreed that must have be blown at least thousand mile off land before gale spent force a wind continued in same quarter for long time must have taken brig week to beat back against when two month passed without return concluded that have sunk before gaining ship that have gone down in gale be wrecked among of island into whose neighbourhood must have be blown however admiral continued to hope long after rest of have given up at end of two month appointed flag midshipman to fill place a especially said until return being case have not shifted berth cabin have remained unoccupied one of officer gave order that tub must be at once taken to stephen cabin filled with water that ship barber must hold in readiness when called upon when stephen came out hour later dressed in uniform with hair reasonable length be told that admiral have requested presence in cabin a soon a be dressed have ordered message not to be given to until came on deck now lad let hear whole story said first fill glass from bottle must imagine that have almost forgotten taste of wine have not touched since two day after be wrecked sir on whole have not done at badly with regard to food in first place what have become of boat crew be dead sir be killed washed overboard during storm rest be drowned at time of wreck be bad business however begin at beginning tell story own way have plenty of time to listen to fuller make better stephen related story from time of leaving ship until have anchored in bay a saw that admiral wished to have full detail told story at length sun be setting by time brought to conclusion have done wonderfully well lad lord cochrane said warmly when have ceased speaking wonderfully well indeed one must have done better arrangement throughout be excellent showed noble spirit in delaying departure for four day in order to assist poor wretch who have murdered companion must have murdered in greed for gold praise for bringing treasure back here be conduct must expect from british officer at same time be clear that have in power to leave buried on island so that must have gone back in craft brought away with will represent conduct in strongest light to government by rule of service of course be entitled only to junior officer share of ship portion of prize money will certainly suggest that case will be specially considered now will take ashore with be going to dinner given by president will create sensation when state have after deducting fifth for fleet share of prize money four hundred thousand dollar to hand over to will take first to wife will be delighted to see again so will child can give outline of story if have be three day later must not have found here for last four month have be endeavouring to get ship fitted out in vain be putting to sea no stronger than when came back there can be doubt that profiting by last lesson spaniard will have made callao stronger than before however will do something will be worthy of though fear that will not be capture of callao few minute later admiral gig be alongside admiral captain stephen went ashore lady cochrane greeted stephen a warmly kindly a husband have done child be exuberant in delight at return of friend have wonderful story to tell dear lord cochrane said have taken more than three hour to give detail will have greater treat listening to evening than will have at state dinner be too bad don estevan one of friend said to stephen next morning that admiral must have taken on shore with yesterday after have be with afternoon have be looking forward to having to ourselves hearing story may imagine that be burning with curiosity to hear how be that came back alone in curious craft astern above how have brought with prize money have heard at present be that whole of boat crew went with be dead promised others must not ask question until morning work be over so that must hear story together be just a well not to tell by driblet stephen said be really long story a consists of number of small thing not of one special incident can hardly be cut a short a must like to cut for be poor hand at yarn after usual work of exercising men at making sail preparing for action gun cutlas exercise have be performed anchor again cast rope coiled up everything in apple pie order chilian officer rallied round stephen taking seat on breech of gun told story with good deal le detail than have given to lord cochrane relation elicited greatest admiration on part of hearer fact that two others alone without tool save sword must have built stout little craft astern that must single handed have sailed thirteen fourteen hundred mile be to nothing short of marvellous have afternoon before gone on board of have seen that only wanted paint to be handsome little boat unaccustomed to manual labour seemed wonderful that three men two of whom be officer must have even attempted such work with only material from wreck to build with stephen have passed very lightly over four day nursing of jacopo incident surprised more than anything else save construction of cutter after man have murdered captain attempted to shoot stephen with intention of obtaining possession of whole of gold latter must have nursed back to life instead of finishing at once seemed to incomprehensible piece of folly man be murderer senor deserved death why must have troubled about especially when a say native might have come at moment taken craft have cost so much pain labour carried off treasure see when became powerless be no longer enemy stephen replied be criminal be true temptation have be great man saw chance of possessing of what to be fabulous treasure better men than have yielded to such temptation though say that did not deserve death punishment of seeing failure of plan of being left probably for life prisoner on island be severe one indeed will at rate have time to repent of sin day may be picked up by passing vessel thus be able to retrieve error at rate will do harm there well ill came from one of officer said own that for part a soon a have knocked down must have put

of vessel seems to that claim to be fairly lost can not see that be never out of possession know other laughed be two to one against probably held opinion that have a much right to possession a if have be spaniard might have be so stephen agreed see treasure have never be theirs from moment that ship surrendered have nothing whatever to do with nothing except to take possession of grant that temptation to do so must have be strong felt that stephen replied until vessel be completed victualled mean of escape open gold be absolutely useless therefore question a to possession must not really arise until neared land did think probable that two peruvian might then put in claim to at least one of box of money have made up mind that if must content with must be willing for to land somewhere along coast with rather than run risk of fight especially a must not possibly have kept awake night day must therefore have have in power be sure that captain meant honestly under circumstance claim

to get to sea again stephen be warmly thanked by president o'higgins for great service to republic highly complimented on conduct announced to that council have decided to present with sum of twenty five thousand dollar a recognition of service consider said that deserve much larger sum circumstance of state be such that feel be impossible for to do more than barest justice at present time have however decided upon raising at once to rank of lieutenant lord cochrane told last night that such promotion before have served full time be quite contrary to rule of service considered altogether exceptional case that have amply proved to be fully capable of carrying out duty of rank to may attain stephen in few word thanked president council very heartily then retired with admiral be nice little nest egg for stephen latter said consider that ought to have be fifty thousand necessity be so great that can not afford to be generous consider that be immense sir stephen replied have never thought of reward for doing duty will not want money out here lad admiral went on at rate share of ship prize money will be ample for anything that may require if like therefore will hand over box along with own share of prize money to firm here who act a banker will give order on banker in london can send to father to draw invest in name otherwise a may prefer thank very much sir will hope be

astern spaniard have longer doubt a to nature of two vessel fort ingles at once opened fire upon first shot passing through brig killing two men became necessary therefore to land at once in spite of surf have two launch gig altogether lord cochrane took charge of gig while major miller who commanded marine of o'higgins embarked on board one of launch got safely through swell in spite of heavy fire from spanish troop effected landing at once rushed upon spaniard who came down from fort to oppose drove back at point of bayonet second boat quickly arrived from brig returning to ship in le

a be dark admiral prepared for attack from prisoner have learned all detail a to fort found that while almost impregnable from river face flank of fort be defended chiefly by strong palisading detached small party of marine under ensign vidal to endeavour to enter at point party then silently moved forward to direct attack of fort a soon a have taken up position under wall main body advanced cheering firing enemy at once opened heavy fire of artillery musketry in dark be unable to take aim little damage be caused by fire movement have result intended of occupying whole attention of eight hundred men in fort of drowning noise might be made by tearing down palisade with great exertion ensign vidal succeeded in getting up couple of beam men passed through opening used beam a bridge across wet ditch inside palisade then advanced noiselessly until near spaniard into whom fired volley spaniard be seized with sudden panic at finding thus unexpectedly taken in flank instantly took to flight moment fire of marine told admiral that flank attack have succeeded led main body round to rear of fort spaniard a poured out there communicated panic to body of three hundred troop

number of got away in boat to valdivia while rest plunged into forest behind fort little over hundred prisoner be taken like number of men be killed panic having be too great for anything like resistance to be offered on chilian side loss be seven men killed nine wounded fall of western fort practically entailed that of valdivia for while preparation be being made to attack eastern fort

thousand cannon shot one hundred seventy thousand musket cartridge large number of musket one hundred twenty eight cannon also fell into hand of victor large ship with valuable store together with quantity of plate taken by spaniard from chilian church also be captured value of conquest be not however to be reckoned by amount of spoil taken effect on struggle be enormous raised spirit of chilians to highest pitch whilst brought home to mind of spanish government hopelessness of continuing struggle against enemy so well led capable of carrying out most desperate enterprise although lord cochrane be received with unbounded enthusiasm by population at large on return to valparaiso success have excited jealousy of minister of marine other official by be treated with grossest ingratitude even proposed to bring to court martial for having exceeded order although indignation proposal excited compelled to abandon be to resort to other measure hostile to be month before fleet received share of prize money of capture of valdivia in spite of admiral earnest effort on behalf own share be sixty seven thousand dollar never received at failed altogether in endeavour to obtain

refused nothing be done o'higgins who be honest man be practically powerless a entire government be in hand of senate of five member assumed dictatorial power without whose approval nothing must be done be determined however to raise army for liberation of peru although lord cochrane have vainly asked year before for small land force to capture callao army be now raised without difficulty by dictator general san martin be placed in command man have rendered good service to chili when in conjunction with o'higgins have led movement of independence success have turned head be vain arrogant at same time dilatory vacillating like dictator be jealous of success popularity of lord cochrane be bent upon thwarting to utmost army four thousand two hundred strong be embarked at valparaiso in ship of squadron lord cochrane proposed to to land at chilka nearest point to lima callao san martin however chose pisca troop be landed there on th of september for fifty day remained there doing nothing fleet being compelled to remain inactive off port on th of october be re embarked san martin again refused to listen to lord cochrane proposal for vigorous attack upon callao lima requested to be landed at ancon port a unsuitable for purpose a be pisca lord cochrane however determined that fleet furnished at such expense effort by chili must not be wholly wasted when sent ship in to anchor off port retained o'higgins independencia lautaro with professed intention of blockading callao at distance real intention be however to cut out esmeralda from under gun of fort also to carry off ship on board a have learned million dollar be embarked esmeralda be forty four gun frigate be considered finest spanish war ship in pacific lay under protection of three hundred gun on shore strong boom

boat lay hidden behind flag ship be dressed in white with blue band on left arm in order that might distinguish other in dark at ten o'clock boat pushed off in two direction commanded respectively by captain crosby captain guise while admiral led way in launch be just twelve o'clock when boat arrived at small opening in boom oar have be muffled so perfectly have silence be observed that admiral launch ran against guard boat lying at entrance without approach having be observed by spaniard there be hasty challenge by startled officer in command to admiral replied by threatening occupant of boat with instant death if gave slightest alarm threat appearance of boat dashing in through opening have effect word be spoken by spaniard in few minute flotilla of vessel rowed down in line upon frigate boarded at dozen point simultaneously chilians have be ordered not to use pistol to rely wholly on cutlass sentry on frigate shouted alarm spaniard snatching up arm rushed up from below many be cut down at once by chilians rest retreated to forecastle made gallant stand be not until chilians have made three charge upon that gave way leaping overboard others running below spanish marine gathered on quarter deck too fought with great bravery not one among asked for quarter sought safety in flight continued struggle until last man fell admiral have be very unfortunate have swung up into main chain moment boat touched frigate be about to leap upon deck of esmeralda when be struck on head by spanish sentry with clubbed musket fell back into boat fell upon one of rowlock entered

harbour at time be two neutral frigate one british other american have be arranged between spanish authority in event of night attack be to show light in particular position so that might not be fired upon did by admiral order similar light be at once hoisted on board esmeralda thus causing much confusion among spaniard neutral frigate be hit several time while few shot struck esmeralda lord cochrane be now forced by wound to leave to captain guise next senior officer to carry out order that have previously given namely that brig with bullion on board be first to be captured then that ship be to be attacked cut adrift success of operation be certain a spaniard directly saw esmeralda captured have taken to boat made for shore whole of spanish vessel might have be burnt captured captain guise have along thwarted admiral plan to utmost of power have fomented several mutiny must have be tried shot long before now instead of carrying out order cut esmeralda cable hoisted sail steered through opening in boom although marred by treachery at rate gross misconduct of cochrane subordinate capture of esmeralda exercised almost a great influence on fortune of struggle a did that of valdivia be death blow to spanish naval force in pacific for although have still two frigate smaller craft in water never afterwards ventured to put to sea of chilians now became absolute master action in fact ensured success of chilian effort to free peru san martin now requested lord cochrane to re embark army once more carry to huacha be done there san martin remained without doing more than have done at two other port after having landed fleet returned to callao where used effort to tempt spanish war ship to venture out without success effect however of operation showed in other way on rd of december six hundred fifty peruvian soldier deserted from spanish service two day later forty officer followed from time defection took place almost daily san martin now made secret of intention to assume dictatorship of peru have for so many month kept army inactive in order that might in time be able to enforce authority what must not do however be accomplished by lord cochrane weary of long delay offered in following march to capture lima if two thousand soldier be assigned to offer be refused after time obtained force of six hundred with effected landing at port after port along coast so harassed spaniard on th of july lima capitulated peru be free san martin at once proclaimed protector of peru appointed two of creature a chief minister lord cochrane in vain attempted to obtain from payment for sailor of fleet who have be very many month without receiving penny san martin insolently replied that must pay nothing to chili that must make lord cochrane peruvian admiral if must leave service of chili for of peru lord cochrane knew that chili must decline to pay for work have be done to make peru like free independent since be now a prostrate at foot of san martin a have be at of spaniard army have raised have betrayed taken service under san martin a have two mutinous scoundrel captain guise spry lord cochrane therefore determined to take by force money due to fleet at ancon there be large amount of treasure seized from spaniard have be deposited by san martin there in middle of september admiral landed took possession of without opposition of two hundred eighty five thousand dollar found there paid year arrears to officer man in fleet taking nothing however for reserving small surplus for pressing want equipment of fleet in june lord cochrane returned to valparaiso from have be absent twenty month be received with popular ovation enemy be still at work struck at in matter upon be most sensitive by refusing payment to officer men many of whom almost died of starvation in revolution broke out in chili such indignity be heaped upon admiral that upon th of month formally resigned commission in january quitted valparaiso in vessel chartered by taking with several european officer gentleman who like be tired of chilian ingratitude be ready to follow in service engaged stephen have taken part in later operation of fleet after capture of esmeralda have be knocked down very severely injured by splinter caused by shot from spanish battery passing through bulwark close to where be standing lord cochrane have sent with other wounded in one of small war ship down to valparaiso there be tenderly nursed by lady cochrane be three month before fairly recovered strength a soon a be convalescent took berth in craft be sailing with store provision for fleet have be out four day when be caught in storm on shore in vain tried to beat out vessel be poor sailer drifted to leeward faster than must work to windward what sort of ground tackle have stephen asked captain have two good anchor senor lieutenant cable be rather old must advise to have brought up on deck overhauled if find specially bad place can cut out splice end again cable be brought up needed very short examination only to show stephen that be old worn from end to end will go hard with if have to rely upon said must not hold bluff bowed craft like two minute very first roller struck must snap like pack thread worst of be captain that if escape being drowned have inside of prison to look to for be off peruvian coast now of who get to shore will be seized at once with sea a senor there be little chance of of being saved if once strike be now somewhere off mouth of san carlos river in calm weather there must be water enough on bar for to run in not now must strike go to piece to certainty well must depend might bump over even if did break up on bar must have much better chance than must if went ashore anywhere else instead of being dashed on beach by wave then being swept out again must be likely to be carried on into still water behind bar so of making way to shore there be eight of crew have better get up ten small cask wine barrel must do very well let liquor run off then bung up again fasten life line round with help must have fair chance be worth trying at rate captain agreed surf on bar will be tremendous if must stick to cask might get through do think that be north south of now captain north perhaps two three mile well will go on fighting a long a can captain be of use throwing away chance wind may possibly drop shift so a to enable to make off shore if see land before three o'clock must turn run in towards then when get near enough to see object plainer head for south until see entrance when do will go straight for be better at rate to do while there be daylight to help barrel be got up prepared to serve a life buoy have just finished when stephen made way short distance up rigging can see line of surf captain be not more than three mile away have better take look at may be able to tell where be think can make out place of size short distance along captain joined just a thought said that be san carlos mouth of river be about mile beyond then may a well bear away for at once sooner get over better make cask fast to something men captain ordered a stepped on deck surf will get higher a get inshore will have doubt sweep deck when time come let man go to barrel with knife in hand ready to cut lashing just before strike in hour captain made out entrance to river headed ship for there be heavy sea indeed on bar stephen said a neared line of breaker see have changed togs since gale began for saw unless wind changed must find in difficulty have not much mercy to expect a chilian sailor must have none if be known that be naval officer will tell men that if get ashore too be saved have best hold tongue about rank in first place must do harm in next must damage be known have one of cochrane officer on board for must show at once that be on way to fleet whereas if be supposed that be merely ordinary coaster may be let off unharmed there be not much chance for way captain said if fall into hand of spaniard will probably hang at once while country people may cut throat so a to save trouble of handing over to spaniard be more than hundred mile from frontier if do get to shore best chance will be to try make way down coast travelling at night lying up in daytime anyhow will tell men what say get sail upon can captain faster be travelling more chance have of getting over bar will shake out mainsail captain said then hand have better gather aft mast be sure to fall over bow a soon a strike in few minute ship be nearing breaker at high rate of speed men be gathered aft with barrel stephen held breath a mounted last great wave outside surf borne along by great wind impetus of wave vessel plunged head foremost into surf poured in cataract on to deck there be slight shock caused vessel to tremble be swept along by fury of surf wave lifted high into air a passed from under struck again time shock be tremendous man be thrown off foot mast went over with crash most of hand be swept overboard by torrent poured in over stern stephen have grasped one of back stay though seemed to for moment that arm be being pulled from socket still maintained grasp even greater sea than have preceded thundered down upon there be forward move then crash stephen felt floating in water holding on to keg glancing round saw that ship have gone altogether have broken up completely sea be covered with floating timber danger from be greater than from wave let go hold of barrel dived swimming under water at right angle to run of wave a long a must hold breath when came up looked round be beyond wreckage be also inside line of surf have wave carried ship own length farther must have be out of danger river bank be couple of hundred yard away water be still rough be long heavy swell rather than stormy sea stephen who have kicked off shoe before ship struck at once swam for shore be not long in reaching after resting for minute two walked along bank soon made out four barrel have men still clinging to gradually too made way ashore swimmer be men who have be carried away by first wave have swept over boat of others must see sign thought must make out two three barrel in middle of wreckage of be not sure have little doubt that who be with at time ship went to piece have be killed by floating timber now men said when four survivor have joined will keep together try to make way separately men consulted together then said that thought must have more chance of making way south be to separate stephen be glad of decision have doubt be arrived at from fear that if be taken be recognized to be englishman must make treatment worse than must otherwise be much preferred to go alone have authority over men five men together be more likely to attract attention than one alone looking across river saw number of people on opposite bank be evidently inhabitant of town who having seen ship running for shore have come down to watch fate to give assistance in power stephen saw that be waving hand for to make up bank where there might be ferry boat to take over pointed out to men said be afraid will be pursued ere long of course at present take for own people when see that cross will suspect truth will send over to see whether have taken shelter in village there may be on side when hear that have not done so will guess that be chilians there will be hot pursuit for will walk together for little way along bank a if going in direction that point to be not likely to stay long where be will go back to town now that there be nothing to see others will doubt remain on bank to collect wreckage may be washed ashore few may go on to ferry wait there for if there be boat in river may be sure will soon put out to collect floating cask bale little crowd be indeed just beginning to break up after going short distance stephen companion left river started south after going two three hundred yard shook hand separated sailor striking more inland while stephen took for present course ran parallel with sea coast be already growing dark stephen be worn out with excitement of day so that after going on for hour lay down in clump of tree went to sleep be broad daylight when awoke on walking to edge of tree saw village few hundred yard in front of made long detour to pas be proceeding along well beaten path when heard sound of horse hoof behind looking round saw four spanish trooper riding towards escape be out of question walked quietly on in faint hope that might pas without stopping however be improbable hair be matted with sea water clothes still wet whole appearance too evidently that of shipwrecked man stopped when reached be one of men who be cast ashore last night sergeant said be stephen replied frankly order be to take back to san carlos where be companion know stephen replied separated at once went way went theirs be chilian man said anyone can tell by speech stephen by time spoke language so fluently indeed that must have passed a native there be however sufficient difference between dialect of peru chili for to be seen at once that be not peruvian did not reply directly to question be on trader said captain four of men be lost five of gained shore be not on armed ship can not be considered enemy whole race of be enemy sergeant said be rebel traitor one of gomez do martinez take man back to san carlos hand over to governor will ride on with sancho see if can come up with other fellow a there be dozen party out in search be pretty sure to lay hand on before nightfall on way back stephen a walked between two horseman debated whether must be better to allow to remain under impression that be chilian declare english officer in former case must most likely be shot without ceremony in latter might probably be sent up to callao lima might make difference in fate at least might delay if must manage to communicate position to lord cochrane latter must certainly take instant step to offer one more of many spanish officer who be prisoner in hand in exchange for must threaten that if harm came to must give quarter to spanish officer in future at rate latter seemed to promise better chance accordingly when on arrival at san carlos be taken before governor replied boldly to question who be be lieutenant stephen embleton flag officer to admiral cochrane word created sensation among officer standing behind governor dare to say governor exclaimed furiously be giving simple answer to question senor stephen said quietly when ask spanish officer who fall into hand what name be reply a have done truthfully be treated a expect to be treated honourably especially a have not be captured by when in arm have simply have misfortune to be shipwrecked on coast quiet tone of reply have effect officer spoke few word together in low tone governor said more calmly than have before spoken how be to know that story be true have mean of proving now stephen replied if be taken to callao message sent to lord cochrane under flag of truce must speedily bring back letter verifying story how did come to be on board craft be wrecked be wounded senor at action in port of callao splinter caused by shot from one of battery struck when on deck of esmeralda be sent down to valparaiso surgeon can examine will find that wound have lately healed being anxious to rejoin ship a soon a possible did not wait for ship of war going up took passage in chilian trader illustration stephen be bound brought before governor of san carlos doubtless conveying store to chilian fleet governor remarked may have have store of kind on board stephen said be affair of mine simply took passage in paid for admiral be expecting will be sure be ready to exchange officer of superior rank for by governor order stephen be now taken into room in quarter of hour be brought back again governor have left room spanish colonel said to have be decided to send to callao where doubt inquiry will be made into truth of story excellency viceroy will decide upon fate stephen bowed can have doubt senor that excellency will treat with same courtesy with score of spanish officer be at present treated by lord cochrane especially a will know be can not for moment believe badly treated be in power of admiral to carry out wholesale reprisal colonel made reply ordered guard to remove prisoner hour later young spanish officer entered have be ordered to accompany to callao said courteously take four men with be told that be to be responsible for safety must be painful indeed for to have to take stringent measure to prevent from escaping on road if will give parole not to attempt evasion will be far more pleasant for if will give little time to think over stephen replied will give answer be too serious matter for to decide at once however whether accept refuse thank greatly for courtesy in making offer will start in hour time spaniard said meal of be doubtless much in need will be brought to at once when have concluded will return for reply then left room in two three minute soldier entered with substantial meal a ate stephen thought matter over did not seem to that with four soldier officer watching must have much chance of making escape even did succeed in doing so must almost certainly be retaken a must have short start dress chilian speech must attract instant attention if overtaken might be shot at once therefore decided that chance must be better a prisoner at callao than a fugitive in hostile country accordingly when officer returned at once gave parole not to attempt to escape upon journey be very glad that have so decided spaniard said will send at once suit of clothes to ride in attire must at once attract attention might lead to unpleasantness have long journey before may a well make a agreeable a can under circumstance stephen thanked heartily for offer gladly accepted for felt ashamed of appearance in rough clothes now shrunk water stained servant who brought suit of clothes brought also large basin of water soap towel stephen be therefore able to make toilet in comfort suit be undress uniform white breech jacket of same material with white braid pair of high riding boot broad brimmed hat a soon a dressed guard conducted downstairs officer four trooper be already mounted horse stood ready for stephen without word mounted officer took place beside trooper falling in behind rode out through gate thank heartily for thoughtfulness in providing with mean of making respectable certainly look better young officer said now permit to introduce name be filippo concha uncle be governor here be to owe pleasure of excursion with must not have thought that ride of five six hundred mile be pleasure don filippo oh yes be when one can go one own pace travel only in morning evening moreover one get terribly tired of small provincial town especially in time like when thing be not going quite so pleasantly a one might wish one know that inhabitant be bitterly hostile to one besides senor have attraction at callao in fact be betrothed to fair cousin daughter of uncle who be chief naval authority at port uncle be one here be strict disciplinarian a leave be stopped owing to doings of admiral

humour however did not care about a long a got leave have gone down to river with several of officer to inspect good of large quantity have be cast ashore if have be here must not have ventured to effect transformation in appearance until to morrow be good rider senor indeed stephen replied have have opportunity for practice doe not matter much don filippo said daresay will be good rider at end of journey not being so at present will afford excuse for not making fatiguing journey so be for best see chapter xv friend in need don filippo did in power to make journey pleasant one for stephen travelled on average about twenty four mile day twelve in morning soon after sunrise a much in cool of evening during heat of day halted sometimes in shade of grove sometimes at hacienda where breakfasted young officer chatted freely to stephen about life a lay in shade during long hour of heat stephen related own adventure on first cruise in reply to question of spaniard repeated to what have heard from father of cochrane exploit don filippo treated in way a friend equal one who saw together must have dreamt that be prisoner even at night guard be placed at door of chamber spaniard

port ship cut out from under gun peruvian ready at moment to revolt flag almost swept from pacific with prospect that broad dominion won for spain by pizarro cortez will be wrested from can hardly imagine wrath humiliation of spaniard at misfortune have fallen upon more so that misfortune have be inflicted by naval force that deemed absolutely contemptible be due to admiral cochrane english officer in next place in addition to political hate there be religious one be by heretic that have be defeated a be defeated century ago by people dutch know how great be power that priest wield have still inquisition among though power in spain be comparatively slight institution still flourish on side of atlantic make anxious for doubt admiral must exchange of prisoner for might did learn

be be at once shot be sorry now that undertook journey have be friend comrade since started can not bear thought that evil must befall have absolute right to good treatment for admiral have always treated prisoner with greatest kindness consideration regret to say that in present state of feeling of spaniard be not certain that such treatment will be meted out to must hope for best don filippo stephen replied blind to fact that position be not free from danger confide in honour of countryman unhappily young officer said gloomily idea of honour on side of atlantic differ materially from in old country have be so ever since set foot in country act of treachery have be performed by men who at home must shrink from deed savoured of dishonour although even here one spaniard must not transgress code towards there be too many who feel scruple whatever a to course that may pursue towards one of race religion stephen nodded understand that don filippo own that while have great fear of ill treatment on part of military civil authority feel must fall into hand of inquisition chance must be slight one from have heard know that power be so great that even most powerful of civil authority have to give way to of course being british subject have shadow of right to meddle with if do so becomes known in england will be very serious matter fate might never be known even did come to admiral ear have be brought prisoner here application on part might be met by statement have be shot while attempting to escape died of fever in prison must never be able to obtain proof to contrary be too well aware of young spaniard replied men be constantly missing not military men merchant land owner others who have be known to entertain liberal opinion one know what have become of

tyranny be never carried to greater point than still prevails here have be here for century what have done for country under sway so far from enriching have impoverished great proportion of population be little more than slave be hated a bitterly a cortez be hated by mexican when overthrew empire of montezuma be three year since came out here full of enthusiasm eager to bear part in putting down rebellion of chili now feel that chili be more than justified that ere long will lose possession that sword of ancestor won for be regarded with so much natural pride by spaniard worst of be that be outcome of own work own oppression misgovernment be to speak like in public not even influence of two uncle must save too must disappear be heard of more have be thinking went on after few minute silence for last two three day whether must not be better for to give back parole to suffer to escape of course must be blamed offence must not be tithe of gravity of of speaking a have just spoken to must not think of thing don filippo stephen replied warmly must not take freedom at cost of involving in trouble one who have behaved so kindly to have still great hope that everything will turn out well that will be exchanged for officer in admiral hand be sure to hear of being at callao for last letter said that many deserter be coming in from of be likely to learn be prisoner in case must not be sure lose day in sending in flag of truce with request for exchange notice that if be refused must quickly follow by retributive measure if harm befell spaniard did not reply felt sure that pain must be taken by authority to prevent news of companion capture becoming public uncle on appointing stephen escort have laid strict injunction on to say nothing of matter on arrival at callao until have delivered prisoner over to authority have received permission from to speak of on following day entered town a rode to house of military governor one paid heed to passage be two young officer

hand over to governor there until hear further will maintain absolute silence a to arrival here will simply state that be here on short leave have nothing to do to bow retire if possible will send message to admiral that be here at present however be out of question for while be waiting in anteroom learned that blockading fleet have sailed away that there be news whatever a to direction have taken be very unfortunate may be assured that a soon a return will somehow other communicate with admiral remounting rode to prison said good bye to other before reached door for a filippo said must be better that must part ceremoniously must not show affection for other said must english admiral learn that be here must manage to make escape suspicion must at once light upon believe don estevan will do in power to aid parting inside be therefore brief don filippo handed stephen over to chief official of prison saying that order of governor be that be to be kept apart from other prisoner allowed communication with anyone adieu senor trust that have have cause to complain of treatment during journey hither none stephen said gravely have treated with courtesy that officer have right to expect at hand of captor young spaniard bowed saluted prison officer left without word governor struck bell on assistant entering gave stephen into charge place in end cell of long corridor said if be occupied at present remove whoever be there to cell prisoner be to hold communication with others extra strict watch must be kept on be one of heretic officer of chilian fleet will want looking after closely cell happened to be untenanted stephen be at once conducted there be apparently intended a place of confinement for officer who have fallen into disgrace be twelve foot square contained table chair from window be very closely barred view of bay must be obtained stephen felt that quarter be better than have expected a soon a be alone examined apartment more closely looking down a well a must between bar must see top of wall twenty yard away decided that courtyard surrounded building so even must find mean of descending from window must be necessary afterwards for to climb wall at present however have idea of trying to escape to do so must be caught greatly prejudice case might be used a excuse for instant execution however concluded that if must loosen bar must be a well to do so without loss of time a might be necessary to make attempt at very short notice upon examining bar found that be so strongly built into wall that must be task demanding very long time to execute turning from examined door framework be massive have noticed a have entered that be fastened outside by two heavy iron bolt there be not much to be done way said now must wait to see how meal be brought in only possible way can think of be that of overpowering warder getting out in clothes suppose that there be much order discipline in spanish prison if must once get down into yard after dark might walk quietly out if there be gate open climb that wall if there be that evening supper be brought in by warder into whose charge have be given be accompanied by armed with sword musket two of stephen said to a after retiring without having spoken word guard closed bolted door behind think must manage at pinch seems to that escape be possible question be what must do with when got out if fleet have be still off town might have made along shore stolen boat rowed out a have gone there be nothing to be done way journey on foot from here to frontier down through chili must be tremendous affair must be pursued a must be guessed have gone way order must be sent to town village to look after man in dress of spanish officer on foot must be remarked by soul met three day passed without incident at dinner time on fourth thought that warder a placed hunch of bread on table gave significant glance a soon a door be closed seized bread pulled to piece inside be tiny pellet of paper opened smoothed out in female hand be written in tiny character inquisition have demanded will be handed over to morrow if be possible make escape to night if can do so turn to right from front of prison take second street on left knock three time on fifth door on right hand side friend will be awaiting if can not escape hope still will try other mean destroy when read stephen read through three four time to be sure that have instruction by heart then put paper into mouth chewed up swallowed must be done when bring in supper said to know that be last to be served in corridor for can hear stop at door next to before come here be advantage a must go straight down corridor on leaving first thing be to tear up two rug into strip make rope for binding of course will have to tackle soldier first warder have evidently be bribed will make resistance when have once overpowered soldier may get hint from other a to be best way of getting out of of course be filippo doing what good fellow be to run risk there be one thing if once get fairly out of cell will be killed rather than be taken handed over to inquisition although have not once be visited between meal thought prudent not to begin work of making rope until sun be getting low when did so tore up blanket twisted knotted together strip then sat down to await coming of jailer have already tried to wrench off one of leg of table be too heavy strongly made for to succeed then thought of using chair must not feel certain of stunning soldier with first blow latter might fire off musket shout so loudly a to give alarm therefore determined to trust to hand alone knew that be greatly superior in strength to of little spanish soldier that with advantage of surprise ought to be able to succeed without noise about hour after became dark heard footstep come to next cell then took place close against wall by side of door waited a bolt be drawn back took deep breath warder a usual came in first followed closely by armed guard a latter entered stephen sprang upon hand closed upon man throat with so fierce grip that musket fell instantly from fellow hand without losing grasp in slightest stephen whirled round threw against warder whom shock brought to ground stephen hurling already almost insensible soldier upon seizing musket brought butt end down upon soldier head with force amply sufficient to stun then rolled off warder body helped latter to foot be obliged to be rough with said in order that fellow when come to sens may confirm story that be at once knocked down of course will tie gag yes before go have better give tap with musket need not hit quite so hard a did must be hard enough to make good bump need be afraid of hurting be well paid for anything may happen though indeed did not expect to come like in first place be going to take clothes stephen said can say that be insensible when stripped first want to tell how can get out wo have much difficulty about that man replied when have taken round supper work be done for night half of be free to go out spend evening turn down first staircase come to follow to bottom then take corridor to right go on until come to open door two soldier will be standing there on sentry ask question of warder have better wait when get in sight of door till see that one else be going out might be noticed that be stranger question might be asked now have better lose time others may be out before get there door be shut illustration stephen make dash for liberty grapple with guard a spoke be taking off uniform consisted of dark jacket trouser cap brown belt from hung sword stephen put on then tightly bound insensible man whose lung be now playing stuffed portion of rug into mouth fastened there with strip tied at back of head then similarly bound gagged warder then gave heavy blow on head feeling that be best for man that must be severe one then took sentry musket hid under bed so that if by chance managed to free of bond must not fire to give alarm then putting cap on head stephen went out bolted door proceeded down corridor following instruction have be given made way towards door just a neared saw group of three four warder going out together waiting for moment till have disappeared boldly followed passed between sentry into open air so rapidly easily have escape be managed that must scarcely believe that have escaped from hand of military authority still le from fate must have awaited have fallen into hand of inquisition not knowing be front of building followed lane upon side door opened to end then finding that be now at rear of prison returned gaining street in be main entrance followed out instruction tapped three time at door of house indicated there be little pause then be opened short distance be senor female voice asked be man whom be believe expecting who received message with exclamation of gladness woman opened door a entered closed behind follow senor said there be nothing in passage to run against few step further stephen heard door open flood of light poured into passage guide said quick entered closed door behind thanks to saint that have escaped senor voice said seemed to well nigh impossible that must do so knowing how brave enterprising english be filippo said that have great faith that might manage stephen now saw that speaker be young very pretty girl be speaking to senorita inez concha said respectfully how can thank don filippo sufficiently for action in behalf have saved life for assuredly have not known must be handed over to inquisition thought

down into brazil be not likely to be questioned on line one must imagine that must be likely to take may meet with adventure on way english people be fond of adventure at rate plan will be safer for indeed for why for senorita if be to be captured said must be questioned a to who aided there be mean in prison by can wring truth from strongest bravest there be torture senor that flesh blood must not withstand be right donna inez stephen said gravely for must be ready to run risk of getting through to south what have said decides must die rather than say word must betray cousin one can say what one must do under fiendish torture therefore at once accept plan be right girl said filippo said that be sure that for sake must consent to now for instruction nurse will in first place take home

about five mile be not be distance a road ascends good deal generally count a six be fine city lima hope that will not be very long before will be able to enjoy without presence of spaniard think can not remain here much longer if chilian army must move from sea coast whole country must be up in arm must rather have done without chilians if must for there have never be great friendship between peruvian say between for be almost a much chilian a peruvian seeing be born within mile of frontier high up in hill there be more money to be made here in first place peruvian have more town beyond pass there be more traffic in next place in chili most men be ready to work if there be money to be made whereas most of peruvian be too lazy to pick up gold if lay at foot most men in business come from hill why peruvian chilians like other who can tell chilians have colder climate people for most part came from north of spain be hardier more active then too be not so strict in church matter

least know something of country man know much there be men indian who make business to trade to guide trader of course never go very far have gone far enough to know much of nature of danger difficulty do think that must be able to find such man there be many muleteer said be not everyone can be trusted know of one man who if happened to be at home disengaged must suit well if must undertake such journey must go if anyone must for danger terrify have made before now perilous expedition with officer others who have sought to discover source of river life in village few mile from summit of pas if have not a yet decided on route will at rate if can not go give better advice than can obtain from anyone else know of passed through city of lima unnoticed there be still number of

width dividing town into regular block contained at time inhabitant be surprised at want of height in house comparatively few of have more than one story on remarking on to muleteer latter said be because of earthquake nowhere be there such bad earthquake a here if be not for lima must be perfect country round be very fertile there be abundance of pure water climate be healthy lie foot above sea earthquake be terrible there have not be bad one lately might come at time twenty thirty year there be very bad one worst be of first destroyed house in lima second be almost a bad be much worse at callao there not only have earthquake tumult of wave such a never be before seen sea went right over town almost soul there at other town along coast perished there be twenty three ship in harbour at callao nineteen of be sunk other four carried mile inland since then there have be nothing like indian say that may expect before long know what go by people say that predicted others long before came have ever felt earthquake senor there be very slight shock when be at valparaiso be not much more than rumble heavy wagon make in street did damage have never felt great earthquake muleteer said have felt little one animal always know when be coming when see mule uneasy apprehensive always choose level spot where there be fear of rock coming rolling down on halt there first shock may be so slight that one hardly feel mule know about straddle leg brace up else lie down on ground when see do know that next shock be going to be smart one lie down too be nothing when be out in country in town be terrible people rush out into street screaming with fear if be near church make for if not kneel down in street where be pretty safe house being so low mostly thatched have never seen one severe enough to bring house down have seen crack parapet tumble down great piece peel off wall what with dust scream of woman child ringing of church bell be enough to shake man courage can tell after proceeding ten mile farther by road always ascending often steep halt be made muleteer removed valise pack gave double handful of corn to animal then hobbling allowed to wander about to pick up what must stephen partook of of food have brought with then wrapping in cloak lay down for few hour sleep at daylight journey be renewed so travelled on halting for five six hour in heat of day riding in morning early late on into evening climate however scarcely necessitated mid day halt at night be glad to wrap in blanket in addition to cloak at last summit of pas be reached in front of rose chain of mountain almost a lofty a have climbed between great range lay plain varying in width several town small village be visible be jauja to right muleteer said be pasco to left be large town look so very far apart from here air of mountain be so clear be difficult to judge distance must not take to be much more than twenty mile from be nearly three time a far be fully eighty mile apart where doe guide of whom spoke live be twenty mile down be where road from two town fall into pas be convenient for because be in track of merchant going either north south stay be made on top of pas for wind be strong piercing there be snow covered peak on hand so hurried onwards although have already done long morning march five mile farther halted in wood although have already made descent of thousand foot be glad to light fire on following day halted early at solitary hut standing at junction of two road bravo muleteer said a door opened man came out at sound of mule foot here be pita thought must find for since war began trade have gone off greatly be likely to be out of employment well met pita be in hope must find here for senor have need of service of bold fellow like enter indian said gravely lifting sombrero for be dressed in peruvian fashion be long since have seen gomez yes full year muleteer replied be at cuzco be just starting with party of trader hut contained little furniture there be pile of skin proceeds of indian hunting since return from last expedition took off three four of threw on ground motioned stephen to take seat while busied in preparing meal nothing be said of business until be served when be finished indian rolled three cigar when be lighted three cup of excellent coffee made pita said now senor in what way can serve want to go down amazon to coast be long journey long difficult have never be so far farthest point have reached have be barra where madeira fall into solimoes be amazon gomez explained be called maranon here in peru from frontier be known a solimoes a far a frontier pita went on there be great difficulty there be many town on bank beyond to barra there be one two village mozon begin at two hundred mile north of road be good one for pas through pasco huanuco there can take boat will carry a far a frontier beyond will have to take for peruvian will venture so far from here senor wish to escape town gomez said have paper wish to escape questioning know what spanish authority be how suspiciously view passage of stranger must not take down madeira be terrible journey indian said very few white men have ever descended river there be bad fall bad indian have never gone down more than few hundred mile must need much courage senor even then thing might turn out badly must not undertake such journey single handed though with good comrade might adventure must not get boat unless bought one a rule men travel on light raft a be safer on rapid than boat way have advantage of being good deal shorter than going round by maranon difficulty danger be very much greater do love spaniard stephen asked indian face darkened have be destroyer of race said oppressor of country hate with heart then may tell at once stephen said that be englishman be one of officer of english admiral who command fleet have destroyed war ship be blockading town be wrecked on peruvian coast thrown into prison be about to hand over to inquisition a heretic when escaped so can understand danger must run in passing through of town speak a hear chilian dialect therefore must be detected a stranger at once a must give satisfactory reply to question have paper must at once be seized sent back again to callao indian nodded gravely have heard of misfortune have befallen spaniard knew that fleet have inflicted such damage upon be commanded by englishman senor be provided with money gomez said did not know that be englishman though suspected from manner in be hired that have trouble with spaniard must have told so gomez stephen said thought better that must not know so that if be seized by spaniard must declare that be wholly ignorant of being englishman believed be only trader travelling on business must not have believed gomez laughed have good with speech showed that be not peruvian have often wondered on way to what nation belonged how be that one so young must be ready to undertake so desperate enterprise a proposed now that know be officer under terrible english admiral can well understand must do much pita said for enemy of spaniard more for reason than for sake of money be ready to undertake to do best to take in safety to barra beyond must not go river below be a hear quite open must journey down without difficulty save such a must meet with from portuguese authority distance must be too great for to return even from barra must be journey fully two thousand mile home again what must be term for taking to barra say must take there senor only say must try do so a tell have never journeyed far down madeira know not what difficulty may be for reason will want money paid to when reach cuzco near live wife family must leave with in case never return will think over what pay will require for comrade be not matter upon one can decide at word can quite understand pita must of course keep sufficient in hand to pay expense down to para where can doubtless obtain passage by english ship be ready to pay sum may ask be within mean now gomez have better go out look to mule leave pita to to think matter over indian will not overcharge gomez said when be outside hut pay of men be small value life lightly when like pita once take to life of guide to who be searching for mine to trader never settle down be proud of confidence placed in of own skill a guide so long a can earn enough to keep family during absence very little suffices for be contented suppose there be mine to be discovered yet gomez assuredly there be muleteer said confidently spaniard have worked rich mine ever since came here great a be treasure that have taken away be still insignificant compared with store of gold among inca when came here peruvian on side of andes dream of gold there be thousand of men who a soon a earn enough money to buy tool provision set off to search for gold mine buried treasure be certain that inca buried vast quantity of treasure rather than see fall into hand of spaniard have never be discovered be generally believed that secret of hiding place be known to indian who have handed down secret from father to son may be true may not so many thousand of indian have be killed by spaniard have died in mine that may well be that who knew secret died century ago say that may not be known to of now if so be more likely that may be among tribe beyond boundary of peru there be vast tract there where spaniard portuguese have penetrated whole country be one great forest in place one great desert indian of peru have become for most part idle shiftless race century of slavery have broken spirit altogether have secret be known to many of must have be wrung from long since especially a be now catholic go to confession must never be able to keep secret from leaking out be true that there be little indian village among mountain where people be still almost independent here secret may still be handed down doubt if will ever be known doubtless be guarded by such terrible oath that who know will never dare to reveal have gone in time with score of expedition in search of treasure most of thought that have obtained clue to nothing be ever discovered doubt whether pita be ever earnest in search in respect be like ourselves in others be still indian have full share of indian superstition so that christianity be deeper than skin must do best to guide who employed to neighbourhood where thought that treasure be hidden doubt whether must do anything to assist in search must really try to gather from indian clue a to whereabouts at rate native must not very well have carried away gold mine not carried away senor that spaniard have such rich mine at first show that did learn from native by torture daresay where most of be situated got more silver than gold even now there be gold to be found in sand of most of river in south america so think be from washing more than mine that spaniard got gold still think that there must have be rich gold mine in time before spaniard when native saw how villainously monarch chief men be treated how spaniard thought of nothing gold silver may have blocked up entrance to richest mine in few year sign of site must be covered by thick vegetation see senor thing be talked over whenever few of get together though there be not many other thing that do know will scarcely meet peruvian who must not talk with for hour about lost treasure lost gold mine of inca there be many place know of where sand be rich enough to pay well for washing be far away from habitation man must have to carry store provision tool with then be hard work peruvian doe not care for hard work a to native there must be keeping at must desert run away at once for not only do hate work above thing hate to work for gold look upon gold a accursed thing brought about conquest of country by spaniard century of oppression have befallen race even must native alight upon rich spot must go away never say word about fearing that if did sort of trouble must fall upon pita be fine looking indian gomez yes senor be mixture be be of pure indian blood belongs to two tribe father be native of one of village highest up among hill too be hunter guide in one of journey down in plain country married daughter of one of chief of wild indian pita be son know tribe be that mother belonged to know that lived in forest on one of greater river pita be not one who talk much of who talk much at know that have reputation of being one of most daring hunter guide in country that have gone through many adventure while travelling with trader have always be trustworthy faithful to employer a say can not promise to take safely down madeira if man can do will half hour later returned to hut where indian be sitting in precisely same attitude in have left well pita have arrived at conclusion gomez asked have thought over said calculate that may be year before return risk be great can senor afford to pay three hundred sixty five dollar be for service of comrade have wife family will therefore need le pay than who will have to leave money behind for mine senor will be at other expense until arrives at barra except for such thing a tea sugar liquor may wish to put on board at starting if senor can not afford will guide down along by foot of mountain until can cross over into chili will be arduous journey without peril will pas through few village how long will take pita must be long journey senor a bird fly must be seven eight hundred mile winding round foot of hill must be two must rather try other pita stephen replied for thought of passage by water through unknown forest then down amazon exercised strong fascination over idea of toilsome journey of two thousand mile be reverse of attractive war be be sure nearly over might arrive in chili only to find that admiral have gone away even when reached frontier have journey to make before reached valparaiso whereas when arrived at para must sail direct for england must afford to pay term ask went on will still have enough left to take from barra home then so be indian said to morrow will start for paucartambo lie few mile from mayutata will pas through cuzco on way have arm see senor yes ammunition will want larger supply before start at daybreak next morning set out indian walking ahead once twice stephen pushed mule forward to endeavour to enter into conversation must get few word from have to drop back to gomez who be willing enough to talk be use trying to get anything out of pita senor if can get in mood by camp fire may tell of adventure native be not given to talking overmuch pita when be once on way a guide will go on without saying word for hour have made several journey with be always same of course there be nothing for to look after here be sort of habit have doubt that must tell how many bird have crossed road to day have noticed lizard must tell where mule belonging to last party have made false step how many there be travelling together about take in though here might just a well be left alone watchfulness might save life afterwards day after day journeyed on stephen did not enter cuzco a capital of inca felt interest in cared little for a great spanish town whose glory have almost departed be not worth running risk when nothing be to be gained by visiting therefore remained at pita indian hut few mile away while gomez went into town with guide to get store required pita comrade returned with stephen be greatly surprised at man appearance pita be for indian tall be spare in frame very sinewy muscle stood up beneath brown skin like cord hurka be so short that be almost dwarf save for face might have be taken for boy of fourteen possessed none of pita gravity be soon laughing chatting with indian wife child be evidently special favourite with face be bright intelligent must not think senor gomez said a after telling what have purchased in city stood watching hurka who be running backwards forward between hut mule carrying in package that little chap be one of best guide on side of andes pita be must say two best whenever can work together be wonderful shot better than pita can swim like fish doe not seem to know what fatigue be pita be like brother although be so different in way be wonderful to see how get on together must not mind where went with for can find way through thickest forest be up to device can be useful to traveller have never heard of losing anyone under charge except of course from disease heat perhaps few shot by indian be thing may always happen there be guarding against especially when have got men with who will go own way make light of idea of taking precaution sometimes have have to fall back altogether when have be with gold treasure seeker never when be with trading party in forest country native be generally ready enough to trade there be part where never allow white party to penetrate whether be that there be really treasure extraordinary rich gold mine whether be only that in section tribe be more hostile than in others one know for certain there be doubt that when party approach certain locality trouble begin directly a go through forest arrow come flying thick through tangle of creeper poisoned dart from blow pipe foe be invisible make felt soon break down courage of bravest to be shot at when never get chance of shooting back in return pita hurka have be with party have be attacked forced to fall back have not be fault for always warn who employ that danger be too great to be overcome still men who think that have got clue to hidden wealth always seem to consider guide be interested in preventing getting will listen to advice till find out for that danger have not be exaggerated that be certain death to push on further wonder that of have be killed stephen said be wonder senor have even declared that must be in league with indian be due to understanding native way of fighting while white men stand up fire away into bush quickly throw down behind trunk of tree then crawl into forest fight in same way a indian do say that more than once two alone have made native fall back so enabled white to retreat will see that will take bow arrow with though must use rifle if openly attacked in battle in forest when hunting in dangerous neighbourhood use bow in preference to rifle next day journey be continued in ten day reached stream a indian told stephen ran into beni one of principal feeder of madeira here be village occupied wholly by indian half caste large canoe be purchased load of two mule stowed in store of bread fruit be obtained from native together with ten skin sewn up a bag intended to be inflated used for construction of raft two day be spent in making preparation then stephen took leave of gomez to whom gave handsome present in addition to sum have be agreed upon by time stephen have come to appreciate good quality of hurka whose unfailingly good temper gaiety have lightened journey whose humorous story of adventure of obstinacy folly of employer raised smile even on impassive face of pita stephen be delighted when canoe pushed out into stream began journey down thousand of mile of river have to be traversed before reached eastern sea coast pita sat in stern of canoe hurka in bow while stephen have comfortable seat in middle separated from by two pile of store provision over be roof of green bough supported by four pole connected by others to thin curtain of cotton stuff be attached be made in one piece be rolled up in daytime to allow passage of air at night must be dropped round so a to form protection against insect vapour from water tent be large enough for three men to sleep in comfortably in centre be small stove in fire be kept burning for cooking purpose in daytime to counteract dampness of air at night a soon a be dark insect became troublesome indian threw on fire branch that cut fresh day from shrub growing on bank caused pungent odour effectually prevented insect from making way in through leafy roof during daytime canoe be generally kept close to one shore other so a to be under shade of overhanging forest tree at night sometimes tied up to tree more often one other of indian sat in stern of boat giving occasional stroke with paddle to keep drifting down in centre of current while be light always have gun close at hand sometimes brought down bird from tree overhead baited hook on long line be towed astern seldom caught anything during day at night frequently captured few fish however be more often done by spearing indian having bought spear for purpose at village on occasion stephen took place in bow with two lighted torch of resinous wood light attracted fish be speared by indian who seldom missed striking however far beneath surface though stephen failed even to catch sight of fish formed main staple of food helped out by bird be for most part of pigeon tribe though larger differing much in plumage from english specie have brought from cuzco hundred pound of flour be sewed up in two skin so in case of misfortune to canoe must be uninjured by water from indian made flat cake be excellent substitute for bread for first ten day hurka while paddling generally sung spanish song that have picked up gradually ceased doing so became a taciturn a pita indian on part of river told stephen be generally of peaceful nature be quite willing to trade a have merchandise must look upon with suspicion moreover tribe be often at war with other in case be always better that traveller must avoid consequently be better to travel silently for same reason generally timed so a to pas indian village at night fire on such occasion being kept very low ash being drawn up over ember so a to completely extinguish light until village be well behind shooting be for time entirely given up chapter xvii down river time passed pleasantly to stephen a reclined on heap of skin blanket watching forest bordered stream looking up through overhanging canopy at bird monkey latter of afforded great amusement by way in chattered gesticulated mother with little one climbed to top of tree while male came boldly out on lower branch to bid defiance to in boat often slept for heat almost noiseless fall of paddle tranquil easy motion of canoe made exceptionally drowsy one day eye fell upon something on large branch of tree bent down to within twelve foot of water be only ten yard ahead when noticed be partly hidden by foliage for moment seemed to to be thickening of branch must have passed without thought have not be for slight movement then glance showed that be animal of kind lying almost flattened upon tree caught up rifle just a rose to crouching attitude be upon point of springing upon pita gun be loaded with shot only a threw up muzzle fired almost instantly beast gave terrible roar spring be arrested fell headlong into water within foot of side of boat tawny head with two row of big white teeth arose from water almost abreast of great paw be raised to strike at boat hurka rifle cracked out animal sank again below water have saved life senor pita said gravely be jaguar have not fired must have struck down crushed in skull with blow of paw wonder did not see be thinking at time that have best tie up for hour two so a to pas next village be large one after dark be almost hidden among leaf stephen said have not moved must not have noticed illustration animal be on point of springing when stephen fired think blinded senor hurka said saw rise to spring snatched at rifle just a fired think charge struck between eye for saw sort of blur there just a fell must have be too late for though might have hit a be in air must assuredly have come down on pita be not like pita come of thinking while be paddling instead of keeping eye on everything be wrong indian replied must have known that attack by jaguar be always possible be first that have seen since starting have thought of danger in mind will be more careful in future must have be well hidden for did not see hurka until moved for spring be true little indian replied englishman eye must be quick indeed nerve steady be seeing catch up gun that first called attention to have laid under great obligation senor for pita be best friend be aught to befall must feel that have lost part of perhaps before journey come to end may be able to show how grateful be be nothing worth talking about stephen said in journey like comrade may well save other life more than once be true senor be duty to save life if need be be turning table upon for to be mean of saving however will not find lacking when time come already have agreed that time of others must carry business through successfully be not like spaniard to be indian dog mere dust under foot people whose service buy a buy of mule have treated a if have be comrade of same colour a have insisted upon eating with have talked with a if be friend together will find that be so if danger arises indian be not accustomed to kindness consideration from spanish master must do without must not suffer indian to exist in land need labour so bear with on part never forget that ancestor be lord of country that received white stranger with kindness be repaid by grossest treachery ingratitude that not contented with seizing land possession murdered prince leader reduced whom did not slay to slavery keeping only that might work mine till field for century have passed since then there have be change be still master beast of burden may pay for service have thought consideration for may risk life for value ours more than if be dog save among muleteer like gomez who long ago ceased to be spaniard be now peruvian look upon a conquered race a to friendship kindly thought for indian think more of dog than do of therefore senor may guess that pita feel towards only a master who pay a one who have treated a if be same colour a even service have rendered pita bind le to than kindness that have shown if englishman be like must be blessing indeed to country if after famous admiral have driven out spaniard must reign over land bring of people here to govern white peruvian be better than spaniard be same blood have same idea save that be coward while spaniard to do justice be often brave there be little to choose between be a proud of white blood despise a heartily be a greedy of gold too indolent to work for when spaniard have gone will be despot a hard a tyrannical a present governor hope for change though know well that will do little for while if people of race came a master of land might have share of freedom happiness tale have reached even that across western ocean rule over people dark like ourselves infinitely more numerous than be when spaniard first set foot here that rule be good just one that native be happy contented that there be same law for a for do think senor that there be chance of admiral people coming here be afraid not hurka english here be in service of chili be free ourselves sympathy be with men who be struggling to be free have idea of conquest here be peru to offer to come under rule must not accept have already wide possession in north america elsewhere need further territory especially in climate be unfitted for might rule a do india peruvian must never be contented must never attempt to keep in subjection did wish gone india country speak of be inhabited by many race religion before went there be incessant war be to leave must at once recommence people then feel that rule be real benefit that be far happier under than be under native ruler when went there have thought of conquering only went there to trade be because be attacked that defended there be still portion of country be altogether independent so long a native sovereign leave alone be well contented that thing must remain a be enrich at expense of native have to pay tax to keep up expense of army administration there england draw revenue from india doe not a spain did enrich with plunder of land be free to people of nation to trade there a do individual may gain wealth there by commerce by growth of indigo other thing that can not raise at home a nation obtain revenue from india army there be for most part raised from people who be free to enlist not a please who fight a faithfully for a must have done for own ruler then what do gain by being there hurka asked gain in trade be carried on by merchant selling english good there buying indian produce army civil government furnish employment to large number of englishman be only material advantage so far a know gain although of course be matter of pride satisfaction to englishman that rule over so great country that presence there be of enormous advantage to people be there no gold silver mine there pita asked at rate nothing have be worked since went there ah if must come here hurka exclaimed what blessing must be to be sure that indian when knew that must be fairly treated must no longer preserve secret of inca must gladly open to mine have be hidden ever since spaniard came hand over vast treasure have be left untouched year be useless to be hidden only because hate spaniard know did discover mine must compel people to work at a father did ere long must disappear altogether while have be talking have floated quietly down stream pita said that be now few mile from next village have better tie up until darkness came on have desire for gold senor hurka asked after have secured canoe to overhanging branch two indian have rolled lighted cigarette not particularly hurka suppose everyone must like gold have already enough to live upon having be very fortunate in aiding to capture vessel carrying large sum for payment of spanish troop if be to search for gold must be rather for sake of adventure than for treasure be first white man have ever met senor who must not undertake risk in order to gain fortune richest be a ready to adventure gold in enterprise promise even chance of success a poorest be willing to risk life adventure must be very exciting stephen said say must not like to take part in one just a be glad to have chance of such adventure a going down amazon must certainly be excitement not chance of making money must attract say for moment must refuse share in treasure only must not run great risk for sake of treasure alone suppose that one must do with more than have for even if have nothing to wish for must at least be pleasure to give away have be fortunate although be still very young have be through great many adventure if be to settle quietly down at home now have more to look back upon than most men day after day floated down sometimes on broad tranquil sheet with scarce perceptible current at others in rapid headlong stream pent up between narrow bank volume of water have vastly increased since started owing to number of stream have flowed into beni of being so large that must be considered good sized river in europe at last month after starting hurka said that next day must reach confluence of beni madeira there be mission station there if senor like to pause there for day two before descending river can do so not at hurka in first place will be asked great many question must be difficult to answer in second even two day in mission station must be frightfully dull very well senor then will pas straight into river halt few hour journey further down why must halt at will want to construct raft senor there be many dangerous rapid in madeira besides fall river be beginning to rise be noticing yesterday how thick water have become of stream run into be laden with mud show that rain have begun on western slope madeira be generally in flood two day before beni water will be running down in great stream therefore will be necessary to make raft need not desert canoe can let float alongside of can haul on to raft will be convenient for sleeping in have better land at once make raft pita said before reach madeira know of high bank for very long distance after have entered great river where must manage then by mean let do so at once stephen said perhaps may get sport accordingly boat be headed towards shore when reached side found that beni have risen bank usually seven eight foot out of water be now little more than foot above level may get bird hurka said nothing else instinct of beast tell that river be nearly full doubtless indeed low lying part of forest be already submerged will be off before will travel on till come to ground be always above flood will doubtless be caught perish such a climb will take to tree hunger will destroy how far do flood extend in place hundred mile on amazon a have heard great deal further paddled along close to bank until reached spot where be bordered by vast number of reed many of a thick a stephen arm now be going to make raft hurka said reed be far better than solid branch be very light fasten loosely together so that can give to water when have made will then want four young sapling will lash together firmly in square under corner fasten skin one also in middle of pole know have brought eight with first make raft with rush be made about four foot larger way than frame with skin frame be laid in raft be fastened loosely to thus see raft be complete without pole skin so long a hold together simply rest on if raft get broken up skin will support pole generally lash few cross pole to frame on sit for water splash up between reed making everything wet a be going to take canoe with will not want cross pole will lay on reed get on board will pick out largest reed can get to place under spot where will lie will only get out of boat when be necessary to go to front side of raft to pole off from floating tree other danger took two day to complete raft second day work being carried on afloat for stream rose very rapidly lashing of reed be of leather thong so tied that while be held firmly in place there be great deal of play advantage stephen discovered a soon a be afloat again on stream rapidity with river be running raised in series of sharp wave rigid raft must have have one end other constantly immersed raft however undulated with water almost a carpet of same size must have done lashing of buoyant reed permitting side to rise fall while structure upon lifted fell with motion canoe half floated be half supported by raft below stephen be surprised to find how slight motion be even in broken water presently two indian left canoe seating on pole paddled towards shore to left getting out of current made way along edge of forest be close now hurka said to madeira struggle of two swollen river will raise turmoil so great that even raft might break up in wave stephen must well believe when canoe reached angle where river joined width be nearly two mile scene presented appearance of sea in violent gale except that be chaos without order regularity cross current seemed to crash against other hurling spray many yard in air wave leapt up in conical form a if lifted bodily from below position of centre of stream changed continually a one current other gained mastery here there be whirlpool eddy must have engulfed ordinary boat in moment whole be white with foam be like huge boiling pot stephen said a watched boat ever made must live in hurka said have seen boat on great wave break on coast there be order in wave skilled in work must wait opportunity come in on top of one of here be confusion boat must be thrown into air by one of suddenly rising lump of water if caught between two of wave must be crushed like shell one must think of descending river when beni madeira be in flood except by doing a be doing now keeping in dead water if in canoe making way through submerged forest even must be hazardous work for canoe might be torn by unseen bough below surface of water therefore at time like most men wait until flood have abated unless be in great hurry be seldom for indian peruvian be ever in haste about anything greatest danger to inexperienced traveller be that of being lost in forest many stream come in when water be very high be difficult to know whether one be crossing tract denuded of wood one of many channel of river once lost in forest traveller fate be sealed for current there be insufficient to enable to judge in direction be main river for may be in back eddy in current from cross channel tree be so interlaced with creeper foot of way have to be cut while among foliage be snake of kind from great boa to little tree snake bite from cause death in few minute there too be starving jaguar leopard wild cat who once get over terror caused by inundation be on look out for food amidst enemy inexperienced traveller speedily loses presence of mind even reason once when be going down very river heard noise of wild laughter intermingled with strange piercing cry knew at once that be traveller lost in forest took two hour to cut way to spot where heard sound guessed who be sufferer two spaniard have hired large canoe have taken with six village boatman have refused offer to go with four men of tribe who be accustomed to river danger a demanded much higher sum than villager be ready to go for said when saw put off that must never get down to mission when reached spot one man be lying dead at bottom of canoe one of spaniard one of villager be missing having doubt leapt overboard in madness others be raving madman with scarce strength to raise in boat others making dreadful laughing screaming that have heard when saw took believe for devil be not until have lassoed strongest that be able to overpower bound laid at bottom of canoe took down to mission be fifty mile below be told afterwards that only one of ever recovered sens others died raving be hopelessly mad from one who recovered be learned that a soon a came to point where stream became rapid made for edge of forest at night tied up canoe to tree in morning when awoke found that line have become untied that have drifted into forest there have be three day when found have lost idea of direction have be few hour later last voice must have be silenced when flood subsided canoe occupant must have rotted away one must ever have known fate have befallen how do find way through flooded forest hurka be born in a be born in bird to make way back to nest may be that careful examination must show that trunk on one side be more thickly covered with creeper than other need to take notice of such thing if notice be without knowing a be sure of direction have seen spanish traveller who have thing with said must direct course at sea with card go round round always when be steady point in one direction be doubt very useful out on plain in forest where there be obstacle here where wood be intercepted by numberless stream with wide swamp such machine be useless to one unless be intimately acquainted with country course of stream even indian dweller on shore of river often in time of flood get lost in forest lose life so changed be aspect of everything by water must be terrible stephen said a glanced between trunk of tree at still dark water under thick canopy of course sun must be help often see sun in time of flood senor rain often fall very heavily even when doe not do so there be see mist in air rising from vast expanse of water besides be only when be directly overhead that sun ray penetrate foliage at time be too high for shadow to afford much guidance among three shot of gun at regular interval be call for aid in flood time be useless one for indian like wild beast leave save when hut be on eminence chance of shot being heard by human ear be small indeed to one lost in forest at other time be certain death when flood be out man must do wisely to fire first shot into own head day after day travelled on keeping just far enough out to get benefit of current without allowing to be drawn towards centre of river even at time be very difficult especially when be passing round curve for much of water instead of following channel made way through forest to next bend in river have greatest difficulty in preventing from being drawn in among tree by current at such time be forced to launch canoe overboard to roll up bottom of raft to lay great bundle of rush across pole now supported by inflated skin only then by vigorous paddling in stephen bore part be able to tow behind across current until reached point where force of stream be confined to regular channel at one point where river be broader than usual current in consequence slower crossed to other bank be getting near rapid now hurka said bank be least dangerous of two hitherto have have nothing force of stream to contend with now will have rock be for that constructed raft up to now must have done far better to have come down in canoe alone once among rock touch must break up while raft can scrape against without injury will see that aspect of thing will change altogether bank where rapid be be high steep inundation will cease for time once beyond fall will again be in flat country inundation will extend almost way down until reach amazon there be way of avoiding rapid suppose stephen asked none by getting out carrying everything round at fall have to be done there be other mean of passing in respect be safer to go down rapid now than be in dry season for greater portion of rock be far below surface will pas over small fall without even noticing day a rule passed pleasantly enough save where voyager have to work against cross current at night when tied up to tree noise be prodigious howling roaring of wild beast be incessant monkey chattered in terror occasionally almost human scream proclaimed that one of have be seized by snake other enemy hissing of reptile must at time be distinctly heard stephen often thought that must hear movement in bough above at length approached rapid stream became still more impetuous indian have cut long pole a drifted down one stood at corner of raft using pole occasionally a paddle to keep straight stephen remained in canoe in centre must gladly have shared in work be to be done here felt that must be of use to morrow will be in full force of rapid senor hurka said must advise to lay down in bottom of canoe to pas day in sleep will be safer so must there be accident for with weight at bottom canoe will be more likely to keep upright than otherwise must can not aid speed at will do next hundred mile will be great indeed in eight hour will be at foot of rapid will sit down at bottom of canoe must see what be going on be accustomed to aspect of sea in violent gale great body of water however fast rush will not be more trying to nerve than scene a there be one thing must wish to do let tie light rope round waist fasten other end to canoe then if raft doe go to piece will be able to get on board at rate if upset will be together will do if wish senor there must be danger of capsizing canoe not so much danger a there must be of canoe upsetting if be alone in for must be powerless even to keep straight must go broadside on to rock be dashed to piece senor be right hurka pita said gravely will do a wish rope must be long so that if be flung off raft there will be sudden pull on canoe must there be such misfortune will shout to will then swim towards boat taking up rope a go putting strain upon when reach boat one will aid senor to steady while other climb in after that will be easier to get second on board still think that be better to make passage than to carry whole kit canoe over must take many week senor besides though have never be here before have heard that difficulty be so great that river indian never attempt to carry even light canoe over be at service senor be willing to try if give order have be told by indian when river be a now in flood danger be by mean great of course will keep out of full strength of current accordingly started next morning hour after setting out be in sweep of rapid passage be intensely exciting one indian stood paddle in hand one at corner of front of raft pole lay ready to snatch up in case rock be approached paddle be needed to keep raft from being dragged out into full force of current here water rose in steep ridge have raft got among must have be torn to piece almost instantly at same time be desirable not to go too near shore a risk from submerged rock must be greater there stephen saw that unless rock came absolutely above surface must be swept over a raft drew two three inch of water except in middle stream rushed along with surface broken only by tiny eddy be only by seeing how flew past bank that idea must be formed of speed at be travelling in eight hour be over several time paddler have to exert to utmost to avoid spot where great swell of water showed that there be rock below surface on occasion did indian have to use pole bed of river widened sharply at foot of rapid just a stephen congratulated that passage have be safely made saw by increase in labour of indian that something be wrong standing up in canoe perceived that have be shot out of current into back water formed by sudden widening of stream in back water be very strong eddy sweeping round round in circle be about hundred yard in diameter with depression in centre round raft be carried at rate defied effort of two paddler to check at one moment be within twenty yard of flat forest covered shore next be near edge of torrent pouring down rapid in vain paddler tried to edge raft out little by little from whirlpool not only be current too strong for surface be dotted with floating log branch of tree that like coursed round round a long a be travelling at same rate in same direction danger of collision be comparatively slight more than once when rower succeeded in gaining short distance towards outside edge of whirlpool be forced to desist suddenly paddle straight with current to avoid great log bearing down upon pita took lariat from canoe prepared to throw so a to catch one of branch when neared shore tried several time distance be too great indeed be necessary to catch tree at little distance before reaching point opposite to in order to pull diagonally across current for jerk when canoe be at right angle must have torn raft to piece must launch canoe paddle out of whirlpool in stephen said might do hurka replied touch from of log must sink in moment besides must be sorry to lose raft for have skin to make float rush of constructed only grow in quiet water of upper river might take to canoe a last resource must be very loth to do how long must lariat be tied together with piece of thin rope brought to check raft in dangerous place rope be hundred fifty yard long senor lariat reach about thirty yard must be plenty stephen said idea be that might fasten end of rope to arrow shoot among tree might not catch first time doubt must after few trial rope will of course be coiled up so a to pay out easily must pull in pay out a went round round time a approach shore must pull on little edge raft few foot out slackening out again a came to nearest point to tree if there be log in way of course must not pull thus by choosing opportunity might get out little by little till be outside full force of stream indian did not quite understand stephen plan at once agreed to try pita chose heaviest arrow lashed end of rope firmly to close to feather stephen knotted lariat to rope coiled up so that must run out easily then prepared for first attempt illustration pita try stephen plan in order to escape from whirlpool chapter xviii captured by indian drawing bow till point of arrow almost touched wood pita stood like statue until boat be opposite to tree then loosed flew far into foliage instant boat reached opposite side of whirlpool stephen hurka drew in rope hand over hand leave go hurka stephen said a rope tightened will try a pas whether have caught in tree a canoe passed on put slight strain on rope yielded for moment then flew through finger rapidly have caught on something said now haul in rapidly time hurka a soon a pas opposite point so a to get strain on a quickly a can pita do keep eye on log shout if there be anything in way a soon a have passed half way point on way back to shore stephen hurka began to pull must get little tension on rope for boat be travelling almost a fast a must pull in still once twice be able to put strength on for moment raft moved foot two through water again again manoeuvre be repeated little by little gained ground until at last edged raft so near to edge of current that two indian seizing paddle be able to get into still water beyond rowed to tree there tied up be good plan senor pita said must never have thought of did think of shooting arrow across to tree saw that jerk must be so great that must tear raft to piece be time before stephen be inclined to talk for exertion necessary to pull rope in at rate exceeding that at boat be travelling towards tree coming a did after excitement of passage down rapid have completely exhausted be drenched with perspiration be glad to lie still in bottom of canoe for time well what next pita asked when breath came quietly will float down a before senor be flat country for next fifty mile great inundation will rob river of power will have several more rapid to pas think will be worse than then will get to fall there be several small one round will have to carry boat there be great one where whole river leap down hundred foot in mass on still night can hear be told nigh hundred mile away be greatest fall in south america though traveller once met told that in north america there be fall be higher that there be nothing like same quantity poured over a over at flood time once beyond there remain more fall rapid ship can sail up there from amazon good sized craft do come up sometimes for there be mission station there father carry on trade with indian who come from lower district to purchase good will be very glad when water get clear enough for to take to fishing again stephen said have caught fish of late have got few bird be getting very tired of cake three week stephen stood at foot of fall of river madeira flood of water poured down in one unbroken sheet be enormous noise be like of continual thunder stephen a stood watching swollen water at foot feeling very ground shake beneath felt spell bound at grandeur of scene mission house be inhabited by only two three old monk from learned that there have be bad outbreak of fever there several have died rest be so weakened that have be determined that monk with exception of men who have passed through many fever be thoroughly acclimatized must go down by boat to barra remain there until season of flood terminated sun have dried inundated country stephen be glad of rest for since entering rapid work have be hard continuous indian must have undertaken portage round various fall bad rapid insisted on doing share of work have day after day toiled with heavy weight over rough country be over now prospect of week spent at mission before proceeding on voyage be very pleasant must be careful one of monk said not to stray too far from house native of neighbourhood have long since be christianized be visited by party from long distance belonging to of other tribe who be still wholly wild eat human flesh here behave peaceably because credit with supernatural power seeing respect devotion with be regarded by native here of whom indeed generally keep strong body on guard during time that stranger most frequently visit be to say at time that flood be out at time most of people who live near river be forced to retire to great distance from home being deprived of usual pursuit take opportunity of coming here to purchase article require say that must harm assuredly might do so must therefore be best for to keep near mission house here be safe from danger whatever for even wildest indian must not venture to set foot inside wall fearing that if did terrible calamity might befall stephen took advice for although be not much affected by what old man said pita companion confirmed word told that many bad indian who must kill eat white man who entered district frequently visited mission house always carry gun with senor have not same terror of firearm a forefather have have heard enough to know that be weapon of war much more formidable than own bow arrow poisoned dart of blow pipe stephen accordingly never went out even to visit fall where spent greater portion of time without rifle generally one other of indian accompanied seeing that stranger visited mission house gradually abstained from doing so stephen preferred being alone tremendous roar of water rendered conversation impossible be quite content to lie dreamily watch flood pouring down unceasingly on evening before day on be to start moon be shining brilliantly stephen taking gun a usual went out without mentioning intention to companion strolled down to take last quiet look at mighty fall whose fascination grew upon oftener looked at came to realize more more marvellous power energy have be seated there for about hour when without slightest warning that anyone be near received sudden blow on head rolled over unconscious when recovered sens found in bottom of small canoe paddled by three indian overhead must see branch of tree knew from that be following bank of river presently to surprise turned sharply off be at once in gloom of forest paddled for hour then tied up canoe to tree one of lit torch at fire smouldered on flat stone three gathered round stephen must see that be closely examining rifle pistol watch money few remark be made stephen gathered from tone that be well satisfied with capture have fallen into bad hand time said to there be doubt about being stranger indian can understand arm being regarded by a most valuable capture why did not finish at once instead of taking away with be more than can understand unless be that be cannibal after examining bond assuring that be tight indian lay down to sleep in morning continued journey a soon a daylight broke from absence of undergrowth of liana stretching from tree to tree anywhere low down stephen came to conclusion that be following what be in dry season track through forest indian be quite young men laughed talked without of gravity distinguished older men among native for hour paddled on then progress be stopped by deep tangle of creeper stretching from tree to tree across way there be exclamation of surprise a stephen thought of apprehension began to talk rapidly eagerly together one pointing in one direction in quite opposite one have lost path said to perhaps took wrong turn at starting argument between be animated one until one pointed to ray of sunlight penetrated foliage fell on trunk of tree near water level looked surprised even graver than before head of canoe be turned started in direction from have come by stephen concluded that have unwittingly made half circuit now paddled steadily gravely watching dart of sunlight evidently steering by before have gone far character of forest changed tree grew somewhat further apart undergrowth of smaller tree rendering extremely difficult for to force canoe onward knife have frequently to be brought out to cut way through creeper angry word be frequently exchanged between be evident to stephen accusing others of being cause of disaster quarrel became more more embittered until at last two of started up drawing knife fell furiously upon one in struggle almost capsized boat catching at other to save went overboard together struggle be continued in water men stabbing other fiercely while indian on board endeavoured in vain by shout to induce to abandon strife presently one of struck to heart threw up arm sank other turned to swim back to boat after one two feeble stroke too sank lower lower water soon closed over head remaining indian stood for time immovable with terror consternation in face then shook fist threateningly at stephen whom evidently regarded a being in way author of misfortune then taking up paddle proceeded to row manner however be indecisive have lost confidence turned aside whenever way be barred by creeper instead of trying to cut through at time ceased paddling altogether sat gazing restlessly around at other time paddled with feverish energy water have come in over gunwale during struggle between indian stephen managed to turn round face downwards to take hearty drink when evening came on indian be paddling almost mechanically when from branch of tree above something dropped down for moment stephen must not discern nature there be swift rapid movement piercing cry from indian followed by sound of cracking bone then man be lifted bodily out of boat stephen must now see two great coil wrapped round body head of gigantic python then overcome by horror of scene became unconscious when recovered found that canoe have drifted away from tree now set to work desperately to loose bond after great effort suffering severe pain succeeded in getting one hand loose after that rest be easy in few minute be free seizing paddle rowed away from scene of tragedy presently tied up to young sapling whose head be just above water next step be to examine content of canoe contained however nothing two three fish dried in sun cake of whose composition be ignorant save that be certainly not made of flour having satisfied hunger taken long drink from water alongside fired rifle three time answering sound came back knowing that might only be paddling away from river stretched in bottom of canoe resolutely postponing thought of position until daybreak fell asleep awoke a soon a be light again loaded fired gun three time again listened for response be of use waiting here said to after thought pita have shadow of clue a to what have become of a may be thirty mile away from must take army to find have better try push on until get to dry land may then be able to work round inundation until reach rocky ground can make way along to mission a soon a sun rose be able to determine point of compass paddled steadily on eye fixed upon tree above other snake might be lurking wild beast taking refuge in branch that there be many of indeed be sure by number of uneasy howl that have heard before sun rose several time a rowed caught sight of leopard jaguar in tree one of latter unobserved until have passed beyond branch sprang down from above narrowly missing stern of canoe starting in pursuit a soon a came to surface again stephen however be able to drive boat through water at much higher rate than beast must swim be not long before have left far behind continued to paddle day felt that nerve be beginning to fail be only by great effort that be able to keep fixed direction by aid of sun through leaf tied up again at night paddled next day finding to gratification in afternoon that water now did not average more than four foot deep by noon next day saw break in line of water few minute later stood on dry ground did not attempt to go further throwing down fell at once into deep sleep be evening when awoke fire still burned on hearth in canoe have be careful to keep alight by breaking off piece of dead wood from tree now collected large store built up pile few foot beyond water level bringing brand from fire set alight scanty stock of provision be now nearly exhausted ate half of what remained then lay down before fire with pistol ready at hand in case wild beast must come near next morning started in what believed to be right direction keeping near edge of inundation memory of what happened afterwards be vague indistinct remembered that for several day kept on sometimes plucking fruit a went occasionally firing gun three time rapidly strength failed a went on often stumbled fell from exhaustion hunger power of thought altogether deserted at time fancied saw men approaching only to find that imagination have converted tree into moving object have long since left edge of inundation be parched with thirst mind wandered incoherent cry proceeded from parched lip at last thought saw native village before a drew towards figure came out from hut gazed at moment later fell headlong to ground lay there insensible when came to felt so weak that must neither turn raise head lay wondering vaguely where be a looked upwards thought be still dreaming for well known face of pita be looking down upon do know be certainly pita voice being unable to move stephen closed eyelid quickly in reply to question saint be praised indian exclaimed using ejaculation common among peruvian know hurka be sensible again after time hurka hurried up on other side of stephen be true exclaimed know also indian brought gourd poured liquor into stephen mouth talk said will have plenty of time for later on stephen closed eye obediently even now be not certain that be still in dream so many time of late have have vague fancy that indian guide be still with that doubted evidence of eye ear however soon went off to sleep again when awoke hurka be at hand ready to pour hot down throat be long before be strong enough to ask question indian positively refused to talk at last time came when be able to be propped up into sitting position on bed be composed of leaf covered with blanket be strong enough to hear about now pita tell where be how come to be here hurka will tell indian replied be long talk stephen looked to hurka who at once began when did not return that evening senor pita went out to search for knew where generally sat be gone went to mission got torch searching in sand between rock found trace of indian foot be able to follow up to point nearly mile below fall there ceased be sure that have be carried off in canoe a found sign whatever of blood mark of struggle felt sure that have not be wounded concluded that have be suddenly seized bound carried off roused of mission indian with three of took to canoe paddled down river for twelve hour a have weight to carry have four paddle felt sure that by time must have overtaken have held on down river for concluded by footmark that there be three of have weight in boat must hardly have counted on being pursued so closely must not therefore have made special effort then turned paddled back keeping close to tree in hope of getting sign of where canoe have entered forest found none a soon a got to mission set out to follow pita who have started inland thought likely that indian have come across inundation that might obtain news a to tribe belonged to of course followed high ground passed through several indian village be sure that have not come from for in case must have gone on foot to mission instead of taking trouble to pas through forest in canoe walked sixty mile next day then reached farthest edge of inundation leaving high ground followed have taken with bag of flour from mission kept on for week then thought must have gone beyond spot where have be landed have walked thought fifty mile day be more than three hundred from high ground concluded that unless canoe have come long distance up river must never have made so long passage through forest then went back again keeping further away from water four day later came upon group of indian hut there heard that strange white man have arrived at village twenty mile distant two day before none knew from whence came for have fallen down a soon a arrived be lying ill pita must not understand how must have arrived in such state unless indeed have killed captor after landing have then wandered in forest until chanced upon village hastened there greatly disturbed in mind in first place at thought of illness next because tribe be very savage one ate human flesh when entered village native crowded round be indian like dress showed that consorted with hated white men pita however pushed aside to astonishment spoke to in own language pita mother indeed have be one of very tribe father great chief among so that when told who be be heartily welcomed treated with great respect be lucky for that arrived for only day before too when gained news of whereabouts have reached village upon entering have at once be made prisoner gathered from what must understand of language be to be eaten think that manner in entered village mystery a to how must have come there saved life seemed to a something supernatural be attending carefully in order that if recovered might learn from how have come there after must no doubt have killed pita have difficulty in obtaining release upon saying that although belonging to tribe be great friend of handed over to since then have be a native of village have taken by turn to nurse by turn have hunted with men how long have be here nigh six month senor six month stephen repeated surely not hurka never must have be ill time must have died long ago be ill for six week senor with fever when at last that passed away mind did not come back to sometimes raved about great snake be about to seize sometimes thought that be wandering in forest more often lay quiet without saying anything gave plenty of food got stronger there be change in mind month before mind came back fever seized again have little hope that must live have got medicine from mission just when seemed to that be on point of death fell into deep sleep when after lying for twenty hour so opened eye knew pita found that mind have come back to again be pita have remained here for six month nursing stephen said holding out hand to indian be indeed good comrade faithful friend owe life to exhaustion caused by listening to hurka story prevented stephen from saying more in two minute dropped off to sleep next day related to two indian story of passage through forest be wonderful indeed that must have alighted upon mother village pita said be not to that three indian belonged to thirty mile away disappearance have be subject of much talk be at first thought that have lost way in inundation so perished when canoe be discovered at edge of water mark long after inundation have ceased one must account for village be three four mile from spot where canoe be found there be possibility of missing way must hardly have be three devoured by wild beast unless indeed have fallen in with herd of peccary be now thought must have be fate fortunately one associated coming with discovery of canoe gradually stephen regained strength be week before be fit to travel again suppose said one day to hurka that will follow track straight through forest to mission instead of going way round a did know yet senor will have difficulty in getting away skill with bow gun have so impressed that want to make pita chief keep here want to adopt into tribe for same reason till began to get stronger must roam about a liked alone of late have noticed that be always watched have be told that unless consent to remain will be killed eaten pita have put off giving decided answer can not do so much longer now that be well enough to travel will have to make off a soon a can have be told that if consent to remain with will take to place among hill eight day away where can find much gold return rich to own country be very awkward hurka must think that pita can contrive plan for getting off little indian nodded can manage that said have only be waiting until be sure that be strong enough to travel know that even now must not go far once in forest will be able to outwit to travel slowly pita have be hiding up store of food for journey if be willing will try to make escape to night there have for last fortnight be men posted round a soon a became dark will be able to crawl through to dispose of who may bar way pita presently returned from hunting carried dozen large pigeon in hand must go to night said briefly have be told that must give answer to morrow have be telling senor hurka said be ready to make attempt at once wish that have given day two longer for there will be extra vigilance to night pita made gesture of contempt will throw away life said let go out a walked along village woman looked curiously at while men watched closely with scowling look do see that large tree at edge of forest senor pita asked presently have lost bark trunk be white see pita well senor a soon a start to night do make straight for will join there stop if there must be fighting have fear for great point be for to get to edge of forest be not strong enough to run fast yet once in forest will be right night be dark for moon will not rise till hour after sunset do think that will be able to find tree think so pita will fix bearing in mind notice direction have to take on leaving hut wish have gun pistol can have gun when be once in forest senor must fight at first with bow there be hundred fifty men here a wish above thing to hide way have gone gun must not be fired unless be so surrounded that escape be impossible how will leave hut pita by back will cut hole through mud wall a soon a get dark must not leave until save watcher be asleep must have down upon instantly on alarm being raised when be through hurka will run in direction make long round before come back to tree so that will not know in direction to seek for will be sure indeed that will take to forest must be useless for to begin search for until morning will be in great haste for will know that be not strong enough to walk very far that when once strike on track will have difficulty in overtaking feel strong enough to walk good distance stephen said may feel so senor have not tried for month limb have done work will soon feel besides even have full strength vigour indian must easily outwalk for must run in four hour a much a must do in eight if escape must be by craft not by speed be quite sure that will do that can pita remember that be express wish that must not throw away life in vain attempt to save mine will do can if come close to can go further charge to leave to make way to river have already done too much for by throwing away eight month of life in wretched place few indeed must have done so much be most earnest wish that must not sacrifice life for sake in hopeless struggle against overpowering odds hurka laughed be not way senor be comrade comrade stick to other to last be employer have undertaken to carry through danger have be kind good to life be yours will either get together to mission none of will reach in other matter be ready to obey order life be own to dispose of a choose have by time re entered hut pita at once began to examine wall to decide where have best be cut through after conversation with hurka determined to make hole in side wall near rear corner of hut be more likely to be watching at back hurka explained to stephen a be there will consider most likely must make attempt to escape can begin hole a soon a night come on must not complete until village be quiet knife will make noise in cutting through soft stuff moment hole be large enough part remaining be so thin that can push down one of will stand bow in hand ready to shoot of watcher who may stop before once out senor make straight for tree men at back of house will attack turn sharp off run along close to back of next hut until be fifty sixty yard away then strike out for tree accordingly a soon a be dark two indian began to cut through wall when considered that be nearly through thrust blade of knife in a long a found wall still firm continued to remove further portion of earth until on pushing knife through found that moved freely knew that be within inch so of outside then continued work until hole be large enough for to be able to issue out one at time a soon a thin skin remaining be cut away a told stephen must be work of moment for starting at top together must run knife round edge of hole down to ground let whole of wall so separated fall inside together when must ease down noiselessly to ground sound in village diminished must by listening attentively hear occasional footstep outside will of watch at given spot stephen asked there be chance of that five six men on guard will wander round round a please sometimes separately sometimes together more often together for have never got over mystery of arrival have a have noticed several time when have returned late objection to coming near hut have often seen cross road to other side when came along in order to keep a far away from hut a possible of course have never given explanation of coming here have said that memory be weak that know be that be with at mission that found here presently pita announced that time have come handed gun to stephen while hurka swung across back of took up bow drew dozen arrow from quiver held in readiness for instant use then placed bow against wall close to hole opened long knife thrust through thin wall together then swept knife down until reached ground cut along until inclosed strip gave way fell inwards caught a moved lowered gently down then hurka crept through hole into open air chapter xix in brazil pita followed while close on latter heel stephen came out turning off at once behind next hut started at run a did so caught sound of twang of bowstring followed by stifled cry fall then came loud yell checked almost before be uttered alarm have be given loud shout rose from several throat ran a directed fifty yard behind hut then turned struck off across open towards tree sooner have done so than felt justice of what indian have said foot seemed heavy joint stiff needed effort to maintain speed at started until stopped at tree panting trembling from head to foot have be conscious while ran of great uproar in village whole mind be centred on effort be not until paused that heard full volume of outcry hundred voice be shouting dog be barking woman cry must be heard in uproar far away to left heard occasional shout be in direction that men of village be evidently running two indian have doubt led chase in opposite direction to have taken stephen be wondering how far must go before turning when almost noiselessly two men ran up to tree have shaken off hurka said there be two who followed closely enough to keep in sight arrow soon stopped now let go pita led way hurka followed placing a did so one end of bow in stephen hand saying eye be more accustomed to dark than yours keep hold of bow follow closely a soon a be well in forest darkness be to stephen absolute have not be for bow must not have followed little indian although treading almost on heel appreciated more strongly than have ever done before how much keener be faculty of indian in respect than own for went along at brisk rate making way through tree with a little hesitation a if have be broad daylight occasionally there be pause for instant a pita slashed through creeper barring way how can see stephen asked doe not see senor feel hold bow at arm length before so touch even smallest of liana large one can see plainly enough so must small one be level with eye be be foot two above ground be dangerous be marvellous to how can see anything hurka for can not make out even outline of figure be born so senor life in forest accustoms eye to see in darkness be same with wild animal run at night be not long before stephen breath began to come in short gasp perspiration streamed from held on until pita came to halt will stop till get breath again senor there be fear of to night must hold on until morning so a to get a long start a possible before can find track take up pursuit until have light can hing to disguise trail will stop frequently go at slower pace so that will not become exhausted must never do to wear out at beginning of journey through night march be continued stopped at frequent interval for minute two stephen found able to keep up with without great difficulty although long before morning broke felt terribly exhausted at last pita said in two hour will be dawn will wait here senor can take short sleep before go on again without word stephen dropped on to ground almost instantaneously went off to sleep when awoke be broad daylight hurka be beside must be moving now senor said pita have be away for hour have just signalled to to join stephen rose to foot heavily felt stiff sore over feeling wore off after have walked short distance from time to time cry like note of bird be heard towards directed step found pita standing by edge of stream fifteen yard wide without word entered water a came up began to walk down must have thought stephen said to hurka that must be safer to go other way for bit because must naturally suppose that must come way be just reason why pita be leading down said be of course way must take to get down to madeira because be so will think that must surely go other in order to deceive doubt will go up will go down in case will not have so many to fight mile further stream fell into be following turned up walked until came to bough eight foot above water pita sprung up hauled on to then leaned over stretched hand down to stephen with strength latter have hardly given credit for hauled up beside then similarly aided hurka made way along bough to main trunk then followed great bough on other side dropped from extremity nearly thirty yard away from bed of stream then struck off through wood until came upon stream after following for hour left by tree a before now can go on pita said will take hour to find track now continued course steadily pita before started taking off stephen boot wrapping broad band of soft leather have brought with round round foot heel of boot make track indian might almost follow in dark have better throw into next clump of bush come to can get pair at mission in course of day crossed two other stream at of took measure a before to throw indian off track kept on till nightfall then stephen pita lay down hurka saying that must watch until midnight think indian will follow at night stephen asked there be fear of senor dread wild beast there be so many in forest can scent human being long distance away have chosen tree because a see lower branch be near ground will be easier to climb up into if give alarm next morning shortly after starting came to bank of stream larger than of have passed on previous day here have short consultation then hurka pita set to work to cut down large number of great rush growing in water taking care to cut inch below level with aid of creeper raft capable of sustaining be speedily made on took place indian having cut two pole to steer by pushed off into middle of stream current be very sluggish must have made small way have not two indian poled vigorously stephen be thankful indeed for change upon previous day have only be enabled to keep up with greatest difficulty have felt that day labour must bring to stand still will walk quite a fast a be going said presently yes senor faster be probably still far behind will doubt find trail at point where have left stream thanks to pain have taken to throw off will lose much time in having to search very carefully up down stream come to will be same if trace to spot started from on raft must go up down side of stream must be carefully searched be going nearly a fast a will be able to do besides now can travel at night if overtake by evening of think there be chance will be so far ahead by next morning that will be perfectly safe indian seemed tireless through next night whenever stephen awoke found still at work soon after daybreak stopped at spot where there be great bed of rush number of cut down largely increasing size of raft adding to stability be now twelve foot long eight wide composed of great bed of rush two foot deep with weight upon floated more than foot above water four day later emerged from forest on to madeira stream by have come have received on way so many accession that be now river of size took four day of hard work to make way up to mission station although distance be fifty mile be only by keeping close to shore utilizing eddy back water that succeeded in stemming current mission have now full number of occupant be received with greatest kindness effect have be carefully stowed away in case must ever return although none thought that there be least probability of doing so a nothing have be heard of since six month before when indian brought message from pita begging supply of quinine for white companion waited day at mission stephen have regained much of strength during journey on raft be willing to make start at once good father of mission insisted upon staying with for few day felt that benefited great deal by good food wine gave there be longer occasion for original raft although have done good service be glad when took place in canoe started with steady stroke down river be no longer rapid stream fall though still grand be a nothing in comparison to scene presented when river be in full flood still there be enough stream to help materially to allow indian to lay in paddle at time let boat drift by at mission house have taken in supply of food sufficient to last to barra a be able to catch a many fish a must eat fared well journey took three week of somewhat monotonous travelling there be change in scenery thick forest bordered river on side a got lower down there be clearing small village met few boat passing between going up to mission be glad day indeed to stephen when great river entered still mightier amazon be here several mile wide crossing made way to barra place of considerable size with church many large building long companionship with two indian have by time made stephen a familiar with peruvian spanish a with chilian enabled to pas with great advantage among portuguese speaking brazilian a native of peru since have be known to be chilian might have doubted whether be good catholic must moreover be viewed with disfavour by portuguese officer a one of nation who have rebelled against spain lawful master therefore on landing made way to hotel close by representing a traveller who have come down from peru by madeira who wished to continue journey down amazon to para stephen next step be to purchase clothes in left peru a well a suit in wallet be unfit to wear first have remained at mission during long absence have indeed discarded a worn out be glad to find there on return for other suit have be torn into absolute rag during journey through wood have difficulty in obtaining country cut garment host who have looked somewhat doubtfully upon on first arrival be evidently relieved in mind when came down from room in new purchase how be thinking of travelling senor do desire to have boat to must travel in public boat there be many such constantly going up down river go through to para greater number stop far short of making voyage only two three hundred mile up down stopping at village be cheaper than long distance boat must have difficulty in exchanging into when reach furthest point care be stephen replied must a soon take passage in local craft a in indeed there be advantage that if one doe not find one companion agreeable one can make change try one luck in boat then if be content with senor will not have long to wait if not to morrow on next day there be sure to be boat going down river also wish to take passage up river for indian who have served most faithfully well whom regard a friend there will be difficulty about senor boat go occasionally from here up to frontier sometimes beyond stephen talked matter over with pita hurka found that must prefer to make bargain for with native boat carrying merchandise will be more at home so senor will go at much lower price than must cost by boat carrying passenger indeed by offering to help at oar when current be strong will probably pay nothing for passage a be glad enough of help going up stream will have to do will be to buy own provision at village stop at just a boatman will do must give address where letter will find pita be there anyone at lima to whose care must send juan fernandez merchant in santa maria street of callao number ten know well have several time recommended to trader gold seeker a trustworthy guide if address pita indian guide care of senor juan fernandez will know keep for until call upon will understand pita that in paying hurka only balance of wage agreed on do so because have more money with than be needed to carry home in way represents deep obligation feel towards say more of senor have done duty must have done a much have be one to whom felt bound in way beyond agreement with have be altogether different have be men of own race must not have treated more kindly have be comrade companion if saved life must remember that saved say nothing therefore of obligation hurka will always remember journey with a one of most pleasant that ever took toil have not be great for always went with stream while a to danger have passed through many vastly greater peril if be satisfied with service be content more than content two day later stephen took place in large boat with long cabin on deck carrying mast great sail parted with indian with deep regret watched a after looking after boat until have gone far down turned went along shore to little craft on have arranged for passage be to start hour after sailed then stephen turned round to look at fellow passenger one end of deck be reserved for white here be priest who have be up at barra on visit two trader who have disposed of merchandise be returning to para old portuguese official wife two daughter who have learnt be staying for month with married daughter at barra besides there be three four petty trader who have come up from village on bank to replenish stock of good in fore part of vessel be fully score of native among whom be several woman awning be extended over after part of upper deck be not long before stephen entered into conversation with fellow passenger hitherto have thought of nothing obtaining passage laying in stock of provision for be warned that passenger catered for saying last word to indian companion have therefore have time to obtain news of what be going on after telling that have come down madeira have be laid up for more than eight month by illness said to priest have now be sixteen month away from news feel like man who have dropped from moon then be ignorant priest said in surprise that southern portion of brazil have declared dom pedro emperor dom pedro stephen repeated in surprise be father king john then dead have returned to portugal know that be driven from country by french retired here ruled over brazil know stephen said also that there be incessant plot insurrection be so well war being over in europe portuguese wanted king back among again last year king john returned there leaving dom pedro a lieutenant regent portuguese having got back king wanted to bring brazil back to former position a subject to portugal provoked great opposition in southern province dom pedro be persuaded to throw off allegiance to father in independence of colony be publicly declared by time dom pedro have probably assumed title of emperor of brazil how long will maintain title be unable to say northern province of para bahia maranham be still portuguese be held by large number of portuguese troop have strong navy keep sea compels few ship of dom pedro to remain in port under shelter of gun of battery there can be one end to insurrection will be crushed dom pedro sent to europe a prisoner who supported executed if life be spared possession will be confiscated truly be sad time for brazil everywhere there be two party one for independence other for portuguese such a hold to former naturally keep silent what may happen in future man know at present none have hope that southern province can resist great force portuguese can bring against by sea land mass of people take interest in struggle native who be indeed mass care nothing whether be governed from lisbon from rio have to pay tax whoever be master of white family who have long be settled here be silent be to say be for independence while who have relation connection in portugal vehemently loudly support cause persecute whom suspect of entertaining opinion to contrary thing concern population of great town in interior take little heed of here cultivate field say mass carry on trade politics interest little if do interest at least speak of silence be golden son a have doubtless learnt for in peru how came so young man a to undertake so terrible journey a have made asked changing conversation may be father did not sufficiently recognize silence be golden in case friend recommended to take long journey because thought must be better safer for to travel to brazil a there be reason against taking passage by sea there be nothing for to strike across continent must posse courage resolution to have ventured out on journey nevertheless can understand risk be greater have remained have heard suppose that peru be now independent indeed stephen replied be there great battle there be fighting at chilian fleet so hemmed in spaniard that supply reinforcement must reach so agreed to evacuate country san martin be made dictator rather made so so great be oppression tyranny of officer that there be revolution month ago san martin have to fly to chili where have since remained a far a know served right stephen said be ignorant vain traitorous brute if peruvian have hung must only have got desert can understand son priest said with smile that peru be not healthy place for must doubt whether if come to take interest in politics here brazil will be safer place of residence for than peru voyage be pleasant very slow when wind be favourable great sail be hoisted when be not boat drifted down river passenger passed time away in eating many meal consisting principally of bread fruit purchased at village where boat stopped in sipping coffee smoking innumerable cigarette of evening three lady brought out guitar there be much singing by male passenger several of whom be able to take turn at musical instrument line be put over occasionally fish caught so week after week passed passenger changed frequently stephen found to be cheerful sociable twice have to change craft for of precisely same size rig slowness shore afforded slight amusement being low for most part wooded indeed river be for time so wide that land on hand be invisible once twice met with strong wind wave got up rapidly craft rolled heavily passenger be for most part prostrated by terror sea sickness at length after two month passage entered that branch of great river upon para be situated few day later moored alongside quay of town stephen at once went to hotel gave peruvian name then having indulged in bath very comfortable meal sallied out into town in street be large number of portuguese soldier while short distance down bay several fine ship of war lay at anchor good many merchant ship be moored alongside quay stephen determined on following day to ascertain about on return to hotel found portuguese official talking to landlord be gentleman latter said motioning to stephen have to ask for paper said politely have none senor stephen replied have just arrived from peru having come down by river madeira into amazon how did pas frontier without paper official said in altogether changed manner simply because there be frontier line on madeira so far a know portuguese official soldier within at least fifteen hundred mile at rate have never be asked for paper until now how be that started without paper official said sternly be matter never even thought of senor have be engaged in quarrel authority wanted to leave friend furnished with money left at hour notice have gone through several peril by way be captured by indian who took possessed must certainly have taken paper have have about be nearly killed eaten be only saved by courage fidelity of two native guide who accompanied well senor be not time when stranger can travel about brazil without paper may be emissary of usurper dom pedro if have be stephen said quietly must have come up coast must hardly have gone round by peru returned here after journey have occupied eighteen month be only after arrived at barra learned that king john have left country that son dom pedro have be appointed regent officer looked doubtful story may be true one said will lay before authority until hear decision will remain here in hotel be quite willing to do so stephen said in meantime senor will hear from captain of bahia now lying at wharf have at least come five hundred mile down amazon to place there be one senor vaquez who be now in hotel be at rate putting up here who came down with way from barra official at once sent upstairs for trader who be fortunately in room who at once confirmed stephen statement that have travelled together from barra have left there nine week before must be taken officer said to relieve from suspicion of having come here from insurgent province at same time there remains fact that have entered brazil without passport other necessary paper matter will have to be considered by authority at same time pending decision there will be occasion for to confine to hotel a offence can hardly be considered very serious one two hour later stephen be sent for to governor here few more question be put to a to absence of paper be then asked what be intention a to future by own confession officer who interrogated said be fugitive from justice although concern with crime committed beyond frontier must concern with movement of fugitive from justice who enter portuguese territory without proper paper intend to take ship to europe stephen replied family have business connection there will probably stay there until hear that can return home very well senor so long a remain here will be under surveillance otherwise movement will not be interfered with stephen bowed withdrew at hotel that evening learned news that surprised altered plan officer who have dined there be talking together stephen who be sitting near drinking coffee smoking cigarette heard to surprise name of lord cochrane there can be no doubt a to truth of news one said not only have english adventurer accepted offer of dom pedro to take command of fleet say be already on way be expected to arrive at rio in few week be afraid that will give trouble not said scornfully one of ship must dispose of whole of insurgent fleet be a know from friend there armed merchantman pedro primeiro being only real war ship among moreover equipment be villainously bad manning worse only real sailor have being countryman who will bring ship over to when first gun be fired even englishman can hing with such ship a against three well appointed fleet like ours did wonder on other side one of other officer said grant did odds be nothing like so great chilians be better sailor by far than people here must at least be relied upon to be faithful must think likely that will throw up command in disgust a soon a see what so called fleet be how hopeless be to struggle against such tremendous odds hope that may be so major own force of argument apparent hopelessness of attempt to meet at sea after what did on other side can not think that will at least give trouble at rate make conquest of insurgent province le easy than have anticipated man reputation alone will inspire even who regard position a most hopeless with sort of energy hitherto have never thought that there must be resistance anticipated that must surrender a soon a fleet appeared off shore troop landed think now that englishman may infuse of own mad spirit into indolent brazilian that will make at least show of resistance worse for captain laughed there will only be so many more confiscation so much more plunder for troop hope that will resist for otherwise will gain little prize money plunder think will get plenty of in case other said two third of people down there be rebel whether there be resistance not possession of kind will be justly forfeited be so be government who will forfeit small proportion indeed will fall to share of army navy conversation then turning upon other subject stephen rose strolled out of room going down to wharf seated on balk of timber to think matter out that lord cochrane must have be driven to resign position in chili must well understand for have wondered many time that put up with treatment that received utter ingratitude have be sole reward of great service be singular indeed that just a arrived on eastern coast of continent must receive news that cochrane must ere long appear on coast to take command of brazilian fleet of course now plan must be changed instead of going to england must endeavour to make way down to rio there join admiral question be how be to be done journey by land must be out of question distance be almost a vast a that have already travelled must be exposed to constant questioning upon other hand be certain that ship must be sailing from para to rio might get down to bahia same difficulty must present seemed to that there be one possible method of reaching rio namely to take passage by ship to cape de verde island there to take ship bound for rio distance be great under favourable circumstance journey might be made in few week next morning be early down at wharf there be several ship lading for europe one of be english learned on going on board must unless driven east by stress of weather make for azores direct without touching at st vincent there be however two portuguese vessel must touch at cape de verde must stay day there one of must start next day in secured passage forward for very small sum on saying that knew something of sea be willing to make useful have only now to purchase few rough clothes suitable for voyage be ready for start time voyage must take did not much trouble might be month six week yet before admiral reached brazil if what be said of fleet be true work of getting fit for sea must be long one a experience in chili have taught even then if voyage be much longer than expected might still be in time to join admiral before sailed went on board night in morning put on rough clothes assisted to make sail in short time vessel dropped down river in few hour be fairly out at sea stephen messed with crew forward seeing readiness to assist handiness when aloft soon became popular with though constantly expressed surprise that peruvian must be so good sailor wind be favourable steady although vessel be becalmed for three four day dropped anchor in port of santiago three week after leaving para mate of vessel have be very friendly with stephen during voyage said to day before arrived that if wished to go on to europe be sure that captain must give free passage a be a good hand a best of crew to tell truth senor stephen said want to get to europe to rio have friend there who will give employment only way must see to manage be to come here take passage in first ship bound there very well will inquire directly get in if there be ship in harbour bound there if so will be rowed straight on board will save expense of living on shore perhaps lot of bother with authority who be always prying into people business there be eight ten vessel in harbour when arrived mate after going ashore brought back word that one be british ship bound for rio will probably sail in morning mate said a port official have already be on board checked off passenger can take off after dark without risk of bother accordingly a soon a be dark two hand rowed stephen across to english barque what do want man mate asked when stepped on deck want passage to rio stephen replied in english be sailor be ready to work way if money have be not sufficient to pay for passage look like at present be one of lord cochrane officer a be now either at rio within short distance of wish to join there mate went into captain cabin on coming out again asked stephen to follow captain looked at attentively be rather strange yarn of yours be strange one captain be true if be one of cochrane officer what be doing here why be masquerading in dress have already served with be flag lieutenant on chilian coast captain repeated incredulously why must not guess to be above twenty be about age sir what say be nevertheless fact story be too long to tell now briefly be wounded in cutting out of esmeralda be sent back to be cured at valparaiso on way up in coasting craft to rejoin be wrecked on peruvian coast made prisoner escaped by aid of friend finding impossible to make way down to chili crossed andes came down by great river to para there heard that lord cochrane be about to assume command of brazilian fleet be absolutely impossible to make way there direct by land sea therefore took passage here in portuguese lying hundred yard away now want to be taken on to rio stock of money with started be reduced to twenty pound must have something when land a admiral may not have arrived be ready to pay fifteen for passage equally willing if be not sufficient to work way before mast well sir captain said if be one of cochrane officer will be proud to carry without charge for passage can if like pay five pound for cost of food a belongs to owner have right to give away be clothes stand in kit have bundle on deck with somewhat more respectable suit bought at bahia although be hardly dress one must choose on board ship be at least respectable being that of brazilian merchant will lend togs for voyage mate said have passenger on board so that if quite fit wo matter although think that be pretty much of size stephen warmly thanked captain mate for kindness then went to gangway told men waiting in boat to inform mate that be right that have arranged for passage voyage be pleasant one mate clothes fitted stephen very well messed with captain officer who be pleasant companion be five week on voyage stephen be delighted on arriving at rio to hear that lord cochrane be still there that fleet must put to sea in few day resumed brazilian dress after renewed thanks to captain for kindness be rowed ashore a soon a port official have paid visit chapter xx fresh triumph sooner have stephen reached landing place than hired native boat to take off to flag ship with several of consort be lying little distance off shore in front of naval establishment several others be close in by wharf look in slovenly state indeed said to infinitely worse than chilian ship did when first got out there there be two three by flag ship look in fair state of order rest might be fleet of big collier with yard up down anyhow rigging slack everything dirty untidy in ten minute be alongside of flag ship whose appearance presented strong contrast to of others telling boatman to bring up bundle after stephen ascended ladder petty officer came up to a stepped on to deck what be business asked in portuguese stephen now spoke fluently wish to speak to admiral sailor looked at from head to foot have appointment with have not will see nevertheless when know that be here on looking round while man hesitated stephen saw admiral speaking to officer in captain uniform petty officer after hesitation went up to officer on watch who at once came over to stephen want to speak to admiral do lieutenant see yonder if will be good enough to inform lieutenant embleton be here ready to report for duty will find that will not mind being disturbed officer looked at doubtfully have appearance of englishman of lieutenant said that may be sir doe not alter fact at moment captain left admiral side walked forward what be lieutenant romoro asked a passed gentleman hesitated over word say that be lieutenant embleton desire to speak to admiral lieutenant embleton captain repeated in english not admiral flag lieutenant in chili surely if so lord cochrane will be delighted to see have spoken of to several time believed to be dead yesterday be saying how missed service be man sir stephen replied have be eighteen month in crossing continent to get here from para have to make voyage to cape de verde back again congratulate on escape captain said shaking hand warmly name be crosbie be lord cochrane flag captain will take to at once admiral have left deck retired to cabin captain crosbie took stephen there at once knocked at door entered excuse troubling now admiral said object will be sure excuse intrusion have gentleman here that will know be glad to meet lord cochrane looked earnestly at stephen have not seen since have sent down to valparaiso after capture of esmeralda two year have elapsed have greatly changed appearance have grown from tall lad of eighteen into powerful young man flash of recognition came into face made step forward exclaimed good heaven can be stephen embleton sir have come on board to report for duty dear boy dear boy lord cochrane said holding out hand wringing of stephen be glad to see indeed thank god see alive well again never dreamt must do for thought that have died have be tortured to death in dungeon of accursed inquisition at callao where have sprung from where have be time by what miracle be here illustration dear boy exclaimed lord cochrane thank god indeed that see alive escaped night before be to be handed over to inquisition stephen replied then finding impossible to make way down to chili crossed andes have come down amazon have unfortunate adventure detained for eight month at least thought unfortunate at time can not think so now a have just arrived in time to join lordship here now admiral if will excuse will be off to duty captain crosbie put in must not deny pleasure of bringing in mr embleton story will assuredly be long one a know hand be pretty full well now lad admiral said when be alone sit down tell about here be with old worry again worse thought chilians be a bad a must be in matter of business fellow be infinitely worse have have end of trouble with have be obliged to threaten three four time already to resign a be have only be able to get four ship out of dozen ready even with exception of ship be in shameful state deficient in necessary what be worse can not even rely upon crew always must do in chilian service well before begin story must tell did not forget tried mean in power to effect release when got letter from wife mentioning that have sailed in store ship have be so long missing set about making inquiry sent boat ashore with white flag to inquire if such ship have be wrecked on coast for there have be heavy gale at time that be making passage be informed that hand have be lost from deserter however learned that be lie few sailor have got ashore have be killed then sent frigate down to place where wreck have be sent letter ashore to governor replied that english officer have be captured have be sent to callao handed over to authority there when frigate returned with news sent furious letter ashore to governor replied that be not before aware that officer in question have belonged to ship be wrecked that person spoke of have escaped from prison have not be recaptured few day after fresh governor be appointed at callao wrote to gave substantially same reply that other have done however opened negotiation with merchant there got to make inquiry sent word that have talked to of prison official that told same story a governor have done said that have in extraordinary way overpowered two prison official have made escape of course did not believe supposed that instruction have be given to people connected with prison to tell same story so sent again to merchant told to use mean be necessary to get at truth a bribery will do anything on coast found that new governor on taking command have found book with record a to disposition of prisoner on leaving be marked merely discharged others a returned to regiment many a having died in prison there be also large number of official document relating to matter among governor found order for to be handed over to inquisition on day following that on be said to have escaped a soon a heard seemed to that there be doubt about fate have be handed over cock bull story be only intended to throw dust in eye if captured callao therefore sent demand to peruvian authority for release surrender saying what have learned in reply declared that have be misinformed for have escaped that authority of inquisition denied positively that have ever be handed over to wrote strong letter in reply saying that one ever believed word of inquisitor that if must ever be good fortune to capture callao must burn building to ground hang official priest layman belonging to there matter dropped of course did not get chance of carrying threat into execution if have done so must have certainly carried out even if have found afterwards have be mistaken about must not have regretted for have deserved fate hundred time over well tell about escape story afterwards must keep know state chilian navy be in when took command well be much worse faction here be even more bitter unscrupulous than be in chili impossible a may seem to affair be very easy one sir for be by bribery rather than force got away then related manner in have be befriended by don filippo concha cousin noble young fellow admiral exclaimed when brought story to conclusion of course there be fine fellow among spaniard a among other nation have heard only of worst side that told by people who hated bitterly well will like better in future hope day may run across young fellow wife doubt be wife long ere let call crosbie in be fine fellow be very certain will be heartily glad to have with for at present have not soul can rely on on captain crosbie arrival admiral told that stephen be ready to set to work at once in capacity in must make useful will be glad indeed of aid captain said for there be not officer man who know work know admiral repeated there be not man who have faintest idea of must have liked stephen above thing for first lieutenant complement be complete think might manage captain crosbie said after few minute reflection captain have yet be appointed to command carolina might appoint morale to belongs to powerful family here must be pleased at promotion so might be politic step a well a serving purpose by making vacancy for embleton must be just thing admiral said be sure must be delighted captain crosbie went on for morale be of very little use with mr embleton to aid must be able to get crew into something like shape in time that must take to do single handed very well then thing be done have full power to make change appointment in fleet so will write out order at once if will send lieutenant morale in here captain crosbie will announce promotion to tell to take up duty at once then embleton can enter upon a soon a have provided with uniform stephen be about to leave room with captain crosbie when admiral stopped have doubt that be short of cash stephen said just at present moment of course can not draw upon banker in england for father will naturally have long since believed dead account will be transferred to so must be banker for present here be two hundred fifty dollar tell fellow who make uniform crosbie will tell where to go to will pay something extra to get one suit finished by to morrow will sail in couple of day after thanking admiral stephen retired just a lieutenant entered cabin on asking captain a to address of best firm of tailor latter said be just going ashore to see about store from dockyard will go there with a be known to will probably sharpen up more than if stranger went by a rowed ashore stephen learned from captain crosbie that fleet ready for sea consisted in addition to flagship of one fine frigate piranza maria da gloria converted merchantman mounting thirty three small gun liberal about same size take with two old vessel will be used a fire ship carolina ship be not yet equipped will join later on be first going to attack bahia where will have work cut out portuguese have three line of battle ship five frigate five corvette brig schooner worst of thing be that can not depend upon crew think that ship will be all right others be largely manned by portuguese who be a likely a not to mutiny directly get near enemy to take ship over to besides that equipment be simply miserable cartridge be unfit for service fuse of shell be absolutely untrustworthy powder be wretched marine know nothing of working big gun of use of small one be moreover insolent lazy set of rascal consider a something infinitely superior to sailor lord cochrane will doubtless add to own great reputation by deed will perform here assuredly will find that will be harassed well nigh to death by different faction will have difficulty placed in way at turn will be unable to obtain justice for crew will ere long find position altogether insufferable emperor be well intentioned honest be altogether devoid of real power be a completely in hand of clique of schemer round a be president of chili there be not english officer now in service of don pedro who must not be delighted to leave if must obtain appointment at one fourth of pay elsewhere on rd of little squadron set sail arrived off bahia on st of may portuguese fleet at once sailed out of harbour to meet force be altogether too formidable to be engaged by four ill manned ill equipped ship lord cochrane manoeuvred so that be able with flag ship to cut off four rearmost ship of fleet signalled at once to consort to join in attacking vessel to astonishment anger signal be disregarded not one of made slightest movement to join hoping that when saw actively engaged must bear down take part in fight opened fire upon portuguese gun powder be alike so defective crew so incapable of handling that did little damage to enemy be forced to draw off found that portuguese on other three ship have absolutely refused to obey captain order even on flag ship portuguese employed in sending up ammunition from below have so wilfully delayed in work that gun be often idle for want of ammunition wrote at once very strong letter to brazilian authority a to manning equipment of ship declared that must hing until matter be remedied for that be necessary for one half of squadron to be incessantly watching other however be not in nature to wait until complaint be attended to for experience have already taught that must be to condemn to protracted inactivity consequently sailed to nearest brazilian port there transferred best men most serviceable fitting to flag ship maria da gloria leaving other vessel to remain in port until properly refitted until captain must obtain disciplined sufficient crew sailed with maria da gloria for bahia a commander of smaller ship captain beaurepaire be active efficient officer good result be soon obtained by change several small capture be made of vessel coming in with supply port be completely blockaded portuguese squadron cowed by cochrane great reputation dared not venture out to engage after remaining there for three week admiral returned to port to see how other ship be getting on in six day be back again portuguese fleet have ventured out a soon a lord cochrane arrived withdrew again week later information be obtained from ship captured while attempting to leave port that portuguese be seriously thinking of evacuating place altogether before fire ship be have learned in course of preparation must arrive admiral despatched maria da gloria to port to lay in water victual for three month other ship there be also to be victualled piranza be directed to join at once in meantime lord cochrane determined to increase if possible alarm of portuguese though have now only flag ship off port enemy fleet lay ten twelve mile up bay under shelter of gun of fort a to attacking by daylight said when talking over matter with captain crosbie stephen must be altogether too desperate be ship manned with english sailor must do without hesitation even with chilians good deal might be effected although crew have gained greatly in discipline since got rid of portuguese must not count upon chilians have gradually gained experience confidence in crew be altogether new to work must not be trusted to fight against such enormous odds still by going up at night might get in among fleet unnoticed might even capture one two vessel at rate must heighten alarm even to know that have got up through channel into midst a soon a became dark on evening of th of june pedro primeiro sailed up river sounding way a went absolute silence be observed on board ship unfortunately just a reached outermost vessel wind began to drop so light that ship must hardly stem tide be running out however made way little distance further even in darkness so large ship be noticed alarm be given drum beat to quarter on board portuguese ship of war in answer to hail a to who be answer be given english ship satisfied portuguese a wind have now altogether failed tide be growing in strength nothing more must be done anchor be dropped with enough chain to allow to drag on ground stern foremost drifted out from shipping regained old position at mouth of river although material advantage have be gained moral effect more than answered admiral hope when became known that ship have be in midst of portuguese squadron something like panic took place on board be increased by news received that fitting out of fire ship have almost be completed dependent a garrison shipping be almost entirely upon provision brought by sea be already very seriously inconvenienced by blockade accordingly on nd of july whole squadron of war ship seventy merchantman transport carrying troop evacuated bahia on board flag ship be delighted when saw great fleet sail for even lord cochrane have felt that even with whole of little squadron must be desperate undertaking to attempt to attack when supported by gun of fort now however that be at sea must at least harass for if ship of war turned upon must bear away already immense service have be performed for evacuation of bahia practically handed over whole of province of name to brazil admiral have not be joined by two ship left in port maria da gloria have returned carolina nitherohy have be left at rio to complete outfit came up three hour after portuguese sailed directed three ship to pick up portuguese vessel lagged behind made off to right left hand while with flag ship followed close on rear of main body portuguese have intended to make for maranham where squadron be lying cochrane pressed so closely that be forced to abandon plan continued to sail men of war did not attempt to turn on pursuer kept steadily on while merchant ship transport scattered right left in order to escape from reach of gun did so be picked up by other brazilian ship while lord cochrane pursued main body five day after have sailed sent off other vessel with prize to pernambuco nearest port with despatch to minister of marine informing that enemy colour cannon ammunition store baggage have already be taken stated that must continue pursuit directing attention at present to transport in order that might if possible capture whole of troop so lessen risk of future operation by portuguese against brazil after effecting must said direct operation against war ship for week followed flying fleet night swept down among capturing many vessel causing utmost confusion alarm among rest chased past equator more than half way to cape verde then left to make way back to portugal report that single vessel have driven thirteen ship of war home accompanied by only thirteen of seventy vessel have started under protection pursuit must not have terminated even then must have be pressed until rest of convoy fell into hand several of transport have made escape during night attack lord cochrane be anxious to prevent from carrying troop safely into maranham upon abandoning pursuit therefore sailed for port entered river with portuguese colour flying authority at once sent off officer to congratulate supposed friend on safe arrival to express satisfaction at reinforcement to strength on arriving on board officer found that have fallen into trap lord cochrane announced to that flag ship must be followed by numerous fleet with military force resistance must therefore bring about destruction of place capture of fleet garrison then sent on shore with letter to governor to same effect will already have learned said of flight of naval military force from bahia have now to inform of capture of two third of transport troop with store ammunition be anxious not to let loose imperial troop upon maranham exasperated a be at injury cruelty exercised towards countryman a well a by plunder of merchant church of bahia letter have prompt effect on following day deputation came off surrendered city fort portuguese troop be at once embarked on ship allowed to sail to europe a have learned truth might again have obtained possession of fort town admiral have mean of preventing from doing delight of people at being free from dominion of portuguese be unbounded must have massacred civilian remaining have not lord cochrane interfered allowed who be willing to take oath of allegiance to brazil many of leading portuguese merchant trader did so admiral be obliged to remain two month in port to protect from effect of exasperation of native population although compelled to remain inactive for time admiral continued work by sending off captain grenfell with portuguese brig have seized in river to para last stronghold remaining to portuguese to follow there example that have set by reporting capture of bahia maranham announcing coming of great fleet demanding immediate surrender expedient be again completely successful astounded cowed at disaster have befallen countryman para ship of war in harbour at once surrendered troop be embarked without delay for portugal thus in course of six month lord cochrane have with practically one fighting ship put end to portuguese domination in brazil have captured three strong fortress driven three large body of troop across atlantic taken immense number of prize vast quantity of naval military store have annexed to brazil territory more than half a large a europe record unapproached in world history upon return to capital lord cochrane be received with greatest enthusiasm emperor came on board personally tendered thanks title of marquis of maranham be bestowed upon be made privy councillor of brazil however be empty honour sailor remained unpaid by system of wholesale fraud received insignificant fraction of prize money due to for portuguese faction be still predominant in brazilian ministry lord cochrane be so openly insulted that felt position untenable remained however for year longer in service in order to obtain for sailor portion of arrears of pay of insignificant amount of prize money be admittedly due resignation must not be much longer delayed finally be brought about by accident be cruising in piranza to have shifted flag when be carried far out to sea by strong easterly wind increased to heavy gale when be discovered that many of spar be so unserviceable that sail must not be set on rigging be absolutely rotten a be provision on board must hing run before gale a long a lasted by time have sailed far across atlantic return be impossible for seeing condition of ship fact that there be not more than week supply of wholesome food remaining therefore decided that only chance of safety be to continue voyage to england did reached portsmouth in safety first step be to advance l to refit ship enemy in brazil made out that voyage to england be absolute desertion sent instruction to officer crew no longer to obey order therefore sent off letter of resignation have so long intended thus at close of two command in have brought about expulsion of spaniard from western coast of south america that of portuguese from eastern lord cochrane so far from having reaped personal benefit from splendid service daring exploit be absolutely poorer man by l than when left shore of england stephen have by lord cochrane advice resigned commission a soon a admiral saw that there be hope of obtaining fair treatment from portuguese faction who determined that sailor must derive benefit from work have done chili be bad said in chili there be honest popular feeling acted a check prevented council carrying rascally course too far in brazil there be practically public opinion people be on level with in peru naturally indolent have grown so accustomed to oppression that dare not protest against iniquity foresee that will not be long before too will resign indeed must gladly do so now be not that be forced to stay here to do what can to obtain justice for fleet be one twenty life be before have have enough adventure to last ordinary man for lifetime have acquired six seven thousand pound by rescue of treasure chilian prize money a lieutenant of flag ship here ought to get more than can see already that fleet will be cheated out of great share of prize money still however meagre amount scoundrel may consider bound to dole out ought to get thousand out of a share of capture of hundred ship to say nothing of men of war store with six seven thousand pound can buy ship command yourself go in for trade can settle down on little estate in country buy share in business be there chance of further fighting here must keep with gladly a be must be pure waste of time for to remain stephen took advice resigned went home have of course written to father a soon a arrived in brazil when vessel touched at plymouth posted letter to prepare for arrival at home found somewhat altered lieutenant said be in excellent health now stephen disappearance cochrane letter telling that feared that must give hope broke down good deal felt be going downhill rapidly however

basest that man can commit will spare willingly on such errand captain concha wife be indeed delighted to see stephen spent very pleasant fortnight with on occasion of first visit to london made inquiry of mr hewson found that wilcox sailor who have be with when so nearly fell into hand of native be still in service when time afterwards ship in be in returned to port have wilcox down to ramsgate installed in place of gardener general factotum there when lord cochrane returned to england stephen went at once down to portsmouth must have done better if have come back with embleton must have spared nearly two year of trial humiliation disgust must have be good many thousand pound in pocket what be doing with be doing nothing at present sir two long absence of mine belief be dead knocked father down completely recovered bit gradually went back again fear that have not long to live however presence with be great satisfaction to for present can not think of leaving quite right lad man first duty be to father especially when father have be kind one be quite right in sticking to until end for reason lord cochrane abstained from urging stephen to accompany when shortly afterwards be offered command of naval force of greece be at time engaged in struggle for independence stephen be more pleased at decision to stay at home with father that intrigue want of mean caused eighteen month to pas before lord cochrane proceeded to take up command even experience of chili peru brazil have hardly prepared admiral for corruption incapacity faction rascality of greek effort be always crippled although accomplished that man must do in service obtained many minor success never have opportunity of repeating exploit have made famous in service of own country in of chili brazil
