dull at home when julian arrived at age of nineteen be tacitly understood that idea of going into army have be altogether dropped that when commission be asked for must be for frank although julian be still favourite mr troutbeck be more favourably disposed towards frank than of old knew from friend that be quite a popular among schoolmate a brother have be although in different way be hard steady

differing so widely in disposition be very fond of other in younger year frank have looked up to big brother a sort of hero julian good nature easy going temper led to be always kind to young brother to give what valued most assistance at lesson patient attention to difficulty a year went on frank came to perceive clearly enough weak point in brother character with usual outspokenness sometimes remonstrated with strongly be horrible to see fellow like wasting life a do julian if care for army why do something else must not care what be so that gave something to occupy if took out of here better know that be not doing good be not doing harm young beggar julian replied good temperedly know julian boy said sturdily be not looking half a well a used to do be sure late hour suit there be good to be got out of billiards know sort of fellow meet there be not kind to do good that father must have liked to see associate with if have be alive just ask honestly if think must if can say 'yes will shut up say more about can say 'yes julian be silent know can said after pause there be harm in of know of suppose that in way put be not set father must have fancied with strict notion have thought of giving up good many time be awkward thing when be mixed up with lot of fellow to drop without reason have only got to say that find late hour agree with that have made up mind to cut altogether be very well for frank will do justice to say that if determined to do thing must do without minding what one said without minding what one did not care for said frank interrupted certainly why must heed bit what people care for say so long a feel that be doing what be right wish be a strong willed a be frank julian said rather ruefully then must not have to put up with being bullied by young brother be too good tempered julian frank said almost angrily here be six foot high a strong a horse with plenty of brain for anything just wasting life look at position father held here ask how many of old friend do know why rather than go on a be doing must enlist go out to peninsula fight french must put end to sort of thing must come back again start afresh will have money enough for anything like come into father l when come of age have doubt that will have aunt money why must julian asked in more aggrieved tone than have hitherto used because be favourite julian quite right that must be have always be awfully good to be one reason why hate to be out of evening for although never say word against certainly must not hear one else do so tell give blue to see face a sits there listening for footstep be beastly shame will give up frank honour bright will be right old fellow knew must if must only once peep in through window of evening see face a for money julian went on if doe not divide equally between will may be sure sha' want frank said decidedly know mean to go into army with interest of own money will have a much a will possibly want if have more must only bother do harm in profession with be just other way be head of family a father son ought to take good place must buy estate settle down on what with management with horse hunting shooting must be just in element well will see about when time come be sure hope old lady will be with for long time yet be a kind hearted soul a ever lived though must have be better for doubt if held rein little tighter well anyhow frank will cut billiards altogether exchanged silent grip of hand on promise julian looking more serious than usual put on hat went out there be curious reversal of usual relation between brother julian although always laughed at young brother assumption of part of mentor really leant upon stronger will a often a not even if unconsciously yielded to influence while frank admiration for brother be heightened by unfailing good temper with latter received remonstrance advice be awfully good fellow said to when julian left room anyone else must have got into rage at interference have only one fault ca say be at root of everything ca understand why fellow find more difficult to say than to say yes if be right to do thing one doe if be not right one leaf alone worst one have to stand if do what other fellow want be certain amount of chaff that hurt one frank indeed be just a good tempered a julian although in entirely different way have never be known to be in passion put remonstrance chaff aside quietly went own way without being in slightest degree affected by julian kept promise be seen more in billiard saloon fortunately for young fellow with whom be in habit of playing be townsman clerk son of richer tradesman of men who owned fishing boat trading vessel others of class not indeed a frank have said sort of men whom colonel wyatt must have cared for son to have associated with harmless young fellow who frequented billiard room a source of amusement not of profit who therefore have motive for urging julian to play to mr troutbeck delight now spent four five evening at home only going out for hour to smoke pipe to have chat with fisherman once twice week must be absent night going out a told aunt for night fishing generally returning in morning with dozen mackerel other fish a share of night work sometimes must ask frank to accompany latter when have particular work on hand must do so thoroughly enjoyed sport smuggling be at time carried on extensively nowhere more actively than between weymouth exmouth on one hand swanage on other consequently in spite of vigilance of revenue men cargo be frequently run long projection of chesil beach portland afforded great advantage to smuggler lieutenant downes who commanded revenue cutter boxer have be heard to declare that must gladly subscribe year pay if channel must be cut through beach even when obtained information that cargo be likely to be run to west unless wind tide be alike propitious took so long time to get round portland bill that be certain to arrive too late to interfere with landing while at time adverse wind terror of race with tremendous current angry wave must keep boxer lying for day to west of island returning to weymouth only to hear that during absence lugger have landed cargo somewhere to east job must have lost temper if have be revenue officer at weymouth lieutenant downes must exclaim angrily why sir must rather lie for three month off mouth of african river looking for slaver than be stationed at weymouth in search of smuggling craft for month be enough to wear man to thread paper coast population seem to to be in alliance with rascal be so accustomed to false information now that a rule when one of men get hint that cargo be going to be run near swanage start at once for west knowing well enough that wherever affair be to come off certainly will not be within ten mile of point named even in weymouth sympathy of population lie rather with smuggler than revenue men long war with france have rendered brandy french wine lace silk fabulously dear heavy duty charged reduced to minimum legitimate traffic might otherwise have be carried on therefore even well to do people favoured men who brought luxury to door at mere fraction of price that must otherwise have have to pay for then too there be element of romance in career of smuggler who risked life day whose adventure escape fight with revenue men be told round fireside revenue officer be not far wrong when said that greater portion of population round coast including class be friendly to if not in actual alliance with smuggler julian be well aware that many of fisherman with whom went out often lent hand to smuggler in landing good taking inland in hiding in cave in cliff known only to smuggler have heard many story from of adventure in have be engaged manner in by showing signal light from sea have induced revenue men to hurry to spot at have seen flash so to leave coast clear for landing of good must be great fun said one day must say must like to take part in running cargo for once well master julian there must not be much difficulty about if so be really mean can put up to easy enough know sir be fun sometimes revenue men come down upon in spite of pain take to throw off scent captain downes be getting that artful that one be never sure whether have be got safely away not fortnight ago pretty nigh came down on lugger be landing cargo in lulworth cove thought that have be managed well word have gone round that cargo be to be run there morning before woman went on to cliff got in talk with one of revenue men let out a how husband have be beating have made up mind to pay out there be going said to be cargo run night at point half way between weymouth lyme regis know did part well a acted on three four of afterwards way pretended to be in passion a spiteful a cat must have taken fellow in in course revenue chap asked what name be where lived expect did not find when looked for afterwards in place told wanted to go with to officer of station said that must never do for if got to be known that have peached about must be a much a life be worth well boy who be watching saw revenue chap go off a soon a be out of sight straight to coast guard station ten minute later officer in charge there set off for weymouth boy followed saw go on board boxer directly afterwards captain downes came ashore with have long talk with chief of coast guard there then went on board again chuckled when saw boxer get up anchor set sail make out to portland go round end of rock two hour later look out on hill saw bearing out to sea to southwest meaning in course to run into bay after be dark on shore officer at weymouth got horse rode along cliff to eastward stopped at coast guard station right on past lulworth soon afterwards three part of men at of turned out marched away west thought that have fooled nicely that evening dozen of boat sailed into lulworth harbour anchored there quiet one of rowed ashore landed two hand to look round brought back news a there be only two three revenue men left at station must be easy enough to seize tie up till be over in course everything worked for bit just a thought must lugger be expecting showed light in offing be signalled that coast be clear be dark night two revenue men on duty in cove be seized tied up by of shore band without blow being struck two three chap be placed at door of station so that if two men left there turned out must be gagged at once everything be ready big lot of cart came down to water edge lugger anchored outside cove got up kedges rowed out to dozen shoreboats did same a soon a got alongside began to bundle keg in when not three hundred yard away came hail craft be that ' struck into heap must have heard pin drop then came hail again 'if answer will sink ' whereupon skipper of lugger shouted out 'the jennie of portsmouth ' 'lend hand lad with sail whispered to belip cable tom ' ran up sail in jiffy may be sure sharper that a be way up four gun flashed out one hulled lugger others flew overhead close a be must not have seen for must scarce see be under shadow of cliff suppose fired at voice beink tub lad ' skipper said a lugger glided away from there be nice little air blowing off shore shot away into darkness in time rowed into mouth of cove for shelter be only just in time for shower of grape splashed water up few yard behind talked over for minute two settled that boxer must be off after lugger must not pay more attention to of be in favour of taking keg that have got ashore most of be agin captain have told to sink so rowed out of cove again tied sinker to keg lowered down three four hundred yard west of mouth of cove went on board boat other chap went on shore may guess be not long in getting up sail creeping out of cove be hour after first shot be fired before heard boxer at again reckon that in darkness must not make out whether lugger have kept along east west under cliff expect went wrong way at first only found at last with night glass when be running out to sea well next morning heard that shore men have not landed five minute when there be rush of forty fifty revenue men into village there ai doubt have only gone west to throw off guard a soon a be dark turned went eastward must not have known that job be to come off at lulworth be on look out along reckon that be same with boxer must have beaten back a soon a be dark enough for not to be seen from hill have be crawling along on look out close to shore when may have caught sight of lugger signal indeed heard afterwards that called back coast guard men for have passed lulworth be watching at spot between st alban head where cargo have be run month two before when caught sight of signal off lulworth well may guess did not get much for pain cart have made off a soon a heard boxer gun knew that game be up for night anyhow found light out in lulworth everyone a seemed fast asleep believe from what have heard that there be great row afterwards between captain downes revenue officer ashore chap ashore must have that be captain fault for being in hurry that if have waited hour must have got cart with cargo even if have not caught lugger well be true enough see that downes be to blame for until came along must not be sure where lugger be indeed be so close in under cliff that be like enough must have missed altogether have gone on two three mile if have not be that caught noise of boat alongside taking in keg lugger got away all right be fast craft though boxer can walk along in strong wind in light breeze lugger have leg of altogether that show mr julian that captain downes have cut eye teeth that be mighty hard to fool be never nearer making good capture than be that night lugger ran cargo two night afterwards at very spot where woman have told revenue man that be going to do there be little bit of fight coast guard be not strong enough to do good have to make off before must bring up anything like strong force bale keg have be carried inland before morning there be scarce farmhouse within ten mile have not got of stowed away in snug hiding place downes will be more vicious than ever after job see master be like to run goodish risk of getting head broke of being hauled off to jail still if must like to join night in run can put in way yes must like very much julian said there ca be much risk for there have not be anything like regular fight anywhere along part of coast for last two year from what have heard there must have be twenty cargo run in time sir that thirty must say there be three lugger at reg'lar be french english two of be french one english crew be mixed carry strong crew of longish gun in stern so that in case be chased may have chance of knocking away spar out of anything after must not fight if cutter came up alongside might make hanging matter of while if none of revenue chap be killed be only case of long imprisonment though english part of crew generally have offer of entering on king ship instead most of take life on board man of war may not be pleasant one after be better than being boxed up in prison for year anyhow be light in must look at must think so julian agreed however see there be great risk in landing keg for be very seldom get so nearly caught a did at lulworth let know when next affair be coming off bill if be anywhere within moderate distance of weymouth will go with if will take anyhow whether go not may be quite sure that will keep matter to myself most active chap about here bill said after have hauled net boat be making way back to weymouth be that faulkner be bitter bad one be most of magistrate about here trouble head about smuggling if find keg of first class brandy quite accidental morning on doorstep ask where come from just put down into cellar sometimes information get sworn before have to let revenue people know somehow other ca say how be fisherman gave portentous wink fellow generally get sort of idea thing ai right landing come off a expected queer ai that fellow faulkner ai like that worry about smuggler just about a much a captain downes doe be just a hard on smuggler a be on poacher be wonderful down on be do know sir know by sight be big pompous man place be about two mile up valley there be large wood round be so sir say a be chock full of pheasant have lot of keeper four year ago there be desperate fight there two keeper three poacher got shot two others be caught be tried at beizes for murder hanged be regular bully be ai no coward if be must never stir out after sunset instead of that be out night after night on cliff when there be talk of cargo being run be known to carry pistol about with so though life have be threatened many time nothing have ever come of one thing be have got big black horse about best horse there be in part of country always ride mighty fast down into town up on to cliff where get among revenue men in course be safe enough be down with lot at lulworth night say cussed swore loud enough to be heard over village when found that have got there too late be bitter bad weed be faulkner know be very unpopular even in town julian said be hardest magistrate on bench if be not for others not man brought before must ever get off have heard that be very much disliked by other magistrate that time ago when wanted to join club must not have at price ca make out why fellow must go out of way to make disliked can understand being down on poacher one like to be robbed smuggling can not make difference to one way other be what say concern 'cept magistrate be bound in sort of way to see that law be not broken why must do like others go on way quiet unless get information laid before warning from revenue people a be wanted mark word master julian night that chap will get bullet charge of shot in body after julian went on more than one occasion with bill other fisherman to look on at landing of contraband cargo if distance be within walk must start from weymouth straight inland come down by road along cart be to fetch good up for be only occasionally that fisherman must take boat at lulworth of course there have be no risk in doing so a boat when fishing to east must often make way into cove drop anchor there for few hour when run be to be made at lonely spot sight of fishing boat making in to anchor must have excited suspicion of coast guard on cliff number of fisherman who took part in smuggler proceeding be small of have brother other relation on board lugger be connected with of smuggler confederate on shore received handsome sum for night work be at time very hard a keg have often to be carried up steep dangerous path to top of cliff then considerable distance across down to nearest point cart must come to be excitement of adventure however rather than pay satisfaction derived from outwitting revenue men be main attraction to fisherman julian took share in work went dressed in rough clothes wore on fishing excursion at night heartily enjoyed animated bustle of scene a score of men carrying keg bale on back made way up narrow ravine silently laid down load beside cart pack horse then started back again for trip occasionally lent hand to lash keg on side of horse to lift bale into cart one ever asked question be assumed that be there with one of cart recognized wisdom of bill advice first time went out be best not to speak till be spoken to master julian there be more chap there besides a be thought to be sound asleep in bed at weymouth be just a well to keep to yourself there be never knowing when thing may go wrong then be a likely a not that one may peach fewer name a come out better now mind sir if there be alarm revenue chap come down on just make bolt at once ai business of yours one way other ai there to make money to get hold of cheap brandy just go to look on amuse have got to do be to make off a hard a can go directly there be alarm everyone else doe same a get chance can tell country people never fight though smuggler if be cornered ca get back to lugger without will use weapon if see chance have got nothing to do with wait minute for mate for will bolt too if be on shore when came on must embark with crew get on board lugger in course if just few of revenue men be fool enough to come on must be tumbled over in double quick time tied up till good be taken inland be left till of mate found in morning be how be know that get most of cargo run one of chap on cliff may make out see take long time to send along line get enough of together to interfere with unless have got pretty good strong force together ai such fool a to risk life by meddling with hundred men more with lot of valuable good to land knowledge that if be caught be long term in jail men know well enough that if there be anything on there will be watch kept over that if be to fire pistol a signal there must be news of sent to smuggler in time sometimes too coast guard nearest point where landing be to be be pounced on suddenly tied up reckon too that good many of keep eye shut a long a can then go off pretty leisurely to pas word along have heard oar have seen signal especially if have got hot headed boatswain in charge of station sort of chap who must want to go down to meddle with hundred men with only five six at back man with wife child perhaps relish thought of going into bad scrimmage like if can keep out of why must get bit of money if make good seizure know well enough that ai going to make seizure unless have got pretty strong party take word for four time out of five when make clear run be because coast guard keep eye closed a long a dare know well enough that ai such uncommon thing for man to be found at bottom of cliff without anything to show how got there coroner jury find a be dark night tumbled over brings in verdict according ai man a care about taking risk of accident of kind somehow other happens to just chap a be wonderful sharp active have be sailor know be ready enough for fight when be strong enough to have chance be very different thing from walking backwards forward on dark night close to edge of cliff three four hundred foot high without comrade within quarter of mile idea that accident of kind might occur time chapter ii before justice one morning when frank be dressing servant came up told that fisherman who said name be bill bostock wanted to speak to a have often be out with julian in man boat put on jacket ran to door good morning bill said what be will talk with outside sir if mind good deal surprised frank put on cap went out with there have be bad business master frank mighty bad job what sort of job bill smuggling affair master frank there be fight hears one of revenue men be killed know a be so of have be

sailor said apologetically see be like mr julian be young gentleman a love bit of spree have be out many night with of to see cargo run frank uttered exclamation of surprise consternation thought perhaps a knowed sir never dreamt of such thing bill how must julian have be so mad a to mix up in such business suppose be doing must have led into mischief sir sailor said in aggrieved voice how be to lead young gentleman like brother into thing a did choose to do say a did mention to promiscuous like lent hand time in running cargo how be to know a must up say ' will go with night bill ' well argues with point out to a might get into scrape say ' be not going to take share in just want to look on see fun a call point out to a be not always fun put that aside say must not be fun unless

see must have felt a be beponsible for mr julian be man now when say ' mean to go with anyhow bill ' be not for to say sha' go mr julian be sort of gent get over one somehow there ai saying ' to well be of use talking about now frank said impatiently first tell about then will see what have best be done well master frank be eight mile to west chap concerned in thought have managed to throw dust into eye of captain downes to get boxer away to swanage how got wind of affair where be to be be more can tell everything be going on enough cargo be in cart when of sudden there be shout scoundrel ' that fellow faulkner dashed up with pistol in hand behind came score of revenue men dodged under cart bolted heard pistol shot fired for just at time lot of smuggler have come up to cart with keg a if firing on shore have be signal heard directly after gun down by water knew that downes boxer have come on lugger made straight back must not sleep night for wondering whether mr julian have got off too be up afore be light went round to one two of other chap a be there one have not come back other have only be in hour have hid up close to where be surprised after be over revenue chap lit lot of lantern then made big fire by light mate must see pretty well what be going on have got about twenty prisoner most of country people cart have luckily enough for gone off with load few minute afore revenue men came up dozen pack horse three four cart have be took in course load men be carrying up among who be took be mr julian be standing close to when came up expect be collared immediate faulkner sat down on tub by side of fire take out book prisoner be brought up one by one question asked mr julian be one of last faulkner got up from seat rowed tremendous what said mate must not catch must hear voice be going on at cruel then suppose mr julian lost temper mate say must see that be giving back hot expect be something wonderful hard nasty said for faulkner jumped at hit in face then brother threw on mate say must have thrown backwards into fire if of revenue men have not seized dragged off after there be row between faulkner captain downes who have come up just before with dozen sailor expect downes be telling that ought to be ashamed of anyhow got to high word a be easy to be heard hour later most of started with prisoner leaving dozen of officer to look after thing have taken when have gone mate went down close to water be able to make out cutter lugger anchored close together so have be caught there be nothing else to wait for so tramped off home have only be in few minute before came to be awful frank said in dismay only thing see can be done be for to go have talk with captain downes be friend of father think be kind hearted man though of course have to be sharp in carrying out duty of trying to put down smuggling well will run in for breakfast now aunt will wonder what have become of then will go straight on board boxer be not in yet bill said must not start until daylight suppose will be round for two hour see be not clear of portland bill yet be unfortunate however hope will see before magistrate sit what time do meet generally sit at eleven o'clock ai day will have to be summoned special must not wonder if meet till two o'clock because must not be sure what time boxer will get round a will have taken prisoner in lugger must not begin until arrived very well will go round to court house after breakfast inquire what time sitting will be anyhow hope to be able to see lieutenant before meet know that good can come of for a have nothing to do with julian capture certainly must not be able to save from appearing especially after row with faulkner be bad un that master frank wish brother have chucked into fire bit of burning might have done good if ever chap deserved did frank went back into house dear frank mr troutbeck exclaimed where have be have never known keep breakfast waiting before why what be matter dear nothing about julian hope have come home yet aunt be sorry to say that have got into awkward scrape seems that went out for fun of thing to see cargo run revenue people came up be one of who be caught of course have nothing to do with smuggling part of business with bit of fight there be still a be there be afraid there be doubt that will have to appear before magistrate with others mr troutbeck sat in speechless consternation oh dear oh dear exclaimed at last how must have be so silly be dreadful dear will be such disgrace what will do there be nothing to do aunt can see a to disgrace be nothing very dreadful end of people be mixed up in smuggling have heard that many of gentry wink at be glad enough to buy keg of brandy cheap without asking question where come from so mere fact that julian went to have look at cargo being run be not anything very serious suppose be against law even to be present there be nothing disgraceful about be lucky holiday began last week if there be anything to be done can do must not mr downes get off used often to be here in father time though have not seen much of since be sure must do anything must have be thinking of aunt boxer be there last night captured smuggler crew have nothing to do with fight on shore therefore think there be chance of being able to interfere in matter still will see a soon a cutter come in on going down to court house frank found that magistrate must meet at two o'clock then a boxer have only just appeared round portland went saw chief officer of coast guard to endeavour to obtain permission to have interview with julian be sorry can hing in matter lad replied be out of hand owing to magistrate being present at capture be indeed business more than ours for be who obtained information of affair called upon to aid in capture of men engaged in unlawful practice therefore see prisoner be in hand of civil authority hear have given strict order one be on pretence to speak to prisoner hear that struck brother know how heard lad be true however feel at liberty to say anything about be very sorry for brother who be fine young fellow however hope that a be unarmed be not suppose actually concerned in smuggling business matter will be passed over lightly even if be not discharged at once at rate will in way press case against frank indeed afterwards learned that officer dropped hint to men to make a little a possible of julian capture of vigorous resistance have made when first seized boxer dropped anchor off town at twelve o'clock lieutenant landed at once officer of coast guard went down to meet on quay for hour walked up down parade together in earnest conversation frank remained on opposite side of road until stopped commander of boxer beckoned to well lad said a frank came up be nasty scrape that brother have got into think can do anything to mr moorsby have be telling that have be to can do anything in matter be in civil hand if have be anyone else faulkner who have be in charge have doubt must have be managed of course brother ought not to have be there a be only looking on taking active part in affair might have be released without difficulty however think need worry certainly will not press case against be unfortunate that used tongue a sharply a did to mr faulkner though say that have great provocation that what said be not perfectly true still must have be much better left unsaid however question if before hearing be over faulkner will not have cause to regret that did not let brother go home a soon a got back here nodded frank understood that there be more to say thanking officer turned walked off home fisherman met on way keep up heart mr frank of others have be having talk with coast guard will be right of course there be not one of doe not know mr julian so wo say more than can help against one of be glad to hear that gave to faulkner hot ai no more favourite with than be with other people be not by own will that ran in pulled brother off if have must not have be sitting on bench to day for many week reckon for must have be pretty badly burned if have fallen across fire so may be sure that will make easy for mr julian expect will have back home evening must never have took at if have known who be of course being dark in fishing togs did not see be frank returned home in much better spirit than have left aunt be standing at window hurried to door to let in well frank have got out hoped must have brought home with there be chance of aunt of course when anyone be taken locked up can not be discharged until case have be gone into have seen mr moorsby coast guard officer on shore captain downes say that case will not be pressed against that a be not taking part in affair merely looking on think anything will be done to coast guardsman who will have to give evidence know will not say anything against if can help so must not be at surprised aunt if have back here afternoon oh do wish mr troutbeck said tearfully that must have be managed so that must not have be obliged to be placed in dock with smuggler sort of people must no doubt have be better if must have be avoided aunt there be helping if be discharged wo go for much against certainly not here where nobody regard smuggling a crime at past one frank went down to court house be already crowded captain downes who came up at same moment took in obtained place for at solicitor table seizure have created quite sensation in weymouth not only because two three weymouth men be among prisoner because owing to fight have taken place matter be very much more serious than mere capture of contraband good there be general buzz of conversation until three magistrate came in took place there be little murmur of satisfaction a colonel chamber chairman took seat for have not be present mr faulkner who be next in seniority must have taken chair minute later twelve prisoner be brought in five frenchman two englishman be portion of crew of smuggler two be farmer men driver of cart one be local fisherman eleventh be one of party have gone from weymouth julian wyatt made up number two three of party have head bandaged up one have arm in sling several others have mark of hard knock julian pair of black eye when little murmur followed entry of prisoner have subsided crier have called out silence in court inquiry began mr moorsby be first witness deposed that having received information that landing of contraband good be likely to take place accompanied by mr faulkner who represented civil authority went to spot perceived that landing of good be taking place a have be arranged that party must not show until revenue cutter came up seized lugger remained in hiding until heard from man placed down by shore that cutter be coming in then rushed out seized party engaged in proceeding of resisted violently serious fray took place three of men be wounded with pistol shot one of very seriously one of smuggler have be killed three be so seriously injured that must not at present be placed in dock be of prisoner represented in court chairman asked solicitor sitting next to frank rose represent mr julian wyatt said frank looked up at in surprise idea of obtaining legal assistance for julian have not occurred to wondered how brother have be able to communicate with solicitor must suggest latter went on that evidence must be taken separately in different charge a there be considerable difference in position of prisoner solicitor rose appear for john turnbull william sims said must support appeal of mr probert client who be farming men took part in fray be serious portion of affair while be ready to admit that be engaged in illegal operation of aiding in landing of contraband good will be able to prove that be innocent of more serious charge of resisting by force capture by revenue officer with using deadly weapon against representative of law that case stand in altogether different category to of main body of prisoner intend hope mr faulkner said to express wish that must have what must practically be twelve investigation instead of one that witness must be obliged to go that number of time into box by mean honour be only intimating intention of cross examining witness a to share client took in affair pointing out beforehand that case stand on entirely different footing to of men who took part in more serious charge of resisting officer one after of coast guard men gave evidence identifying one more of prisoner in whose capture have taken personal part none of first five have anything to say regarding julian then james wingfield entered box after stating that be coxswain of weymouth coast guard boat proceeded when mr moorsby gave order ran forward saw biggish man standing with hand in pocket of pea jacket seemed to be looking on be not at work thinking that might be leader harry wilkens ran at seized be not until afterwards knew that be mr julian wyatt after have caught handed over to wilkens be know about then proceeded to testify against several of other prisoner in whose capture have taken part when have finished evidence julian solicitor rose say that prisoner first took mr wyatt be taking active part in affair sir be just standing there looking on did resist capture not to say resist sir when first clapped hand on gave start for have come upon sudden without noise just tried to shake off not knowing reckon who be a soon a said 'in king name be prisoner ' be just a quiet a lamb solicitor sat down then chairman asked witness if arm be found on prisoner sir not even stick wo say a may not have have bit of stick honour though did not notice hand being in pocket anyhow did not try to use be next witness evidence a far a julian be concerned be precisely similar to of coxswain against seven men of lugger evidence be conclusive have resisted desperately have enabled several of party to make escape in darkness weymouth fisherman have be caught coming up from beach with keg on shoulder have thrown down attempted to run away have made resistance when have be taken two farm men have be captured at horse head have at once surrendered when evidence have be gone through mr probert addressed court on behalf of julian urged that there be evidence whatever to show that be concerned either in smuggling operation in resistance to revenue officer pretend said that be there by accident maintain that be there simply in capacity of looker on stand in fact precisely in same position that member of general public might do who have be present a spectator at sort of riot be unquestionably very unwise action on part of individual to attend meeting of sort at be possible that riotous proceeding may take place maintain that however imprudent foolish there be nothing criminal in doing so be sure that there be case on record in man have be punished for presence at riot in did not participate client acted foolishly ask court to say that foolishness be not criminal have accidentally learned that there be to be landing of contraband good with thoughtlessness of youth went to see what considered fun even if there have be shadow of criminality in being present must ask to say that unpleasant experience that have undergone detention for twelve hour in police cell appearance here be ample punishment for boyish escapade might have be committed by high spirited young fellow of nineteen after other solicitor have addressed court on behalf of two farmer men magistrate consulted together spectator watching attentively saw that for time seemed unanimous then be equally evident that there be difference of opinion on point other presently rose left court be faulkner against other two mr probert whispered to frank of course be unanimous about smuggler expect differed a to others be lucky that colonel be in chair harrington be mild little fellow faulkner must be able to twist round finger if there be only two of there be fear of with colonel there to keep straight in ten minute returned by flushed angry face of mr faulkner frank judged at once that have be overruled chairman briefly announced decision of court committed seven smuggler for trial on whole of charge weymouth fisherman be also committed only on charge of being engaged in unlawful act of defrauding majesty revenue be allowed out on bail two farm labourer be fined fifty pound apiece solicitor at once paid majority of bench be in favour of immediate discharge mr wyatt being of opinion that evidence have failed altogether to prove of charge against being of opinion that have already paid dearly enough for reckless folly in attending unlawful operation of kind trust that will be lesson to for life other more serious charge against will now be taken frank who be in act of rising from seat in delight at julian acquittal sank down again in dismay at concluding word have idea of further charge what be whispered to mr probert faulkner have charged with attempt to murder have not heard of be frightened have seen witness have doubt that case will break down like other after prisoner julian have be removed from dock mr faulkner left bench took seat in body of court charge be then read over by clerk mr faulkner name be called a stepped into witness box low hiss ran through fisherman who formed large proportion of spectator silence chairman said angrily if hear repetition of indecent demonstration will have court cleared at once mr faulkner then proceeded to give evidence have said spoken severely to prisoner in quality a magistrate upon taking part in smuggling transaction at prisoner became violently abusive uttered such murderous threat that thought must have struck in self defence witness gave blow whereupon prisoner have sprung upon like tiger have lifted in arm have carried bodily towards fire must assuredly have thrown into have not be prevented from doing so by of coast guardsman mr probert rose quietly be magistrate mr faulkner believe mr faulkner gave reply to question after little pause solicitor went on do consider that a magistrate mr faulkner come within province to abuse prisoner unconvicted of crime deny abused mr faulkner said hotly there be occasion for heat sir mr probert said quietly be in position of witness at present not of magistrate must reply like other witness well deny having abused do consider that calling gentleman of good standing in town son of distinguished officer loafing young scoundrel not abuse by telling that six month in one of majesty jail must do world of good deny used word well sir be question of pure credibility be possible may be in position to prove to satisfaction of bench that did use many others of equally offensive character mr wyatt naturally resented such language have more right to address to than must have to address to if magistrate forgets position abuse prisoner in language of fish fag must expect to be answered in same way by anyone of spirit say that thereupon became abusive used murderous threat now must like to hear little more about first of let hear abuse will tell court if please mr faulkner be abusive expression added said sir be disgrace to bench there be general laugh in court be instantly repressed mr faulkner eye ran furiously over crowded bench must ask to look at mr solicitor said mildly well said that be disgrace to bench be scarcely perhaps a much matter of abuse a one of private opinion what did say next said be curse to whole neighbourhood again mere matter of opinion after be sneaking meddlesome interfering old fox there be again buzz of laughter mingled with exclamation of so be be far wrong upon colonel chalmers directed constable to turn offending party out of court fisherman nearest to door be hustled out well be afraid that must admit mr probert said that to call meddlesome old fox be abusive although nothing like so abusive a to call man loafing young scoundrel now a to threat said must be brought home one of day with bullet in body be purely matter of prophecy mr faulkner not threat unless intended to understand that be who must fire bullet do mean to tell court that have reason to suppose that young gentleman whose reputation be untarnished who have never have charge brought against except ridiculous one have just be dismissed intended to imply by word that have idea of taking life might bear that construction might bear construction in mind of man determined to see everything in worst possible light be matter of public notoriety mr faulkner that have received several threatening letter that active part have taken against poacher smuggler have caused feeling against do not think likely that when mr wyatt used word have repeated referred to circumstance magistrate who doe duty must necessarily be unpopular with criminal class possibly mr faulkner though have known many magistrate who did duty who be by mean unpopular have not answered question do not think that in saying what did mr wyatt simply alluded to fact of well known unpopularity to threatening letter that have received possibly did mr faulkner admitted reluctantly although be not impression at time well then unless there be further threat a call think have disposed of alleged abuse alleged murderous threat now come to other charge thought that be about to strike in self defence gave blow what made think that be going to strike made step towards with threatening gesture oh dare say that be angry gentleman who have be called loafing young scoundrel be somewhat apt to lose temper might even do so mr faulkner if so addressed well then made step towards thereupon struck in face judging from appearance struck pretty hard then say caught up carried along say good deal for strength that be able to do so now say carried towards fire must have thrown upon have not of coast guardsman interfered in time now how do know that be intention firmly believe that be so be not question of belief might believe that be going to throw up to moon struggled suppose must scarcely submit to be carried like baby imagine be about long short of even if have intended to throw on fire certainly seems to be merely matter of imagination can hardly pretend have carried out intention that must have be murder surely with score of friend standing by must have be hauled out immediately none worse except for few singe burn two be not burning fiery furnace mr faulkner merely bit of bonfire from few stick have be set on fire in order to throw little light on proceeding might have be very seriously burnt well even supposing that have be be not question of murder presume that framed indictment have charged prisoner not with intention of committing grievous damage upon with murder if now admit that under circumstance death must hardly have resulted by possibility from imaginary intention of throwing on fire being carried out be clear that charge of murder must drop through have further question to ask though may have remark to make after having heard witness chapter iii in fresh scrape first witness called by mr faulkner be captain downes will tell know about affair chairman said after having captured smuggler took six men went up to see if must be of assistance to mr moorsby also to hear whether have be a successful with capture a have found that everything be over that fire have be lighted be talking to mr moorsby when attention be excited by loud word between mr faulkner mr wyatt with whom be acquainted mr faulkner struck in face there be scuffle prisoner lifting magistrate although much heavier man completely off foot in course of scuffle approached fire being afraid that might fall into ran up with mr moorsby of men pulled away did seem to captain downes that prisoner be carrying mr faulkner straight to fire be certainly going straight in direction whether intentionally not be unable to say do think that if men have not interfered must have fallen into fire think must certainly have done so do think that prisoner intended to throw mr faulkner into fire can not say have question to ask witness mr faulkner chairman asked think likely suppose that prisoner must have intended to tumble into fire must think very unlikely mr faulkner sat down mr probert rose think very unlikely captain downes mr must deliberately have walked into fire quite share opinion have not yet be proved that be deliberately going towards fire at say lifted mr faulkner in arm now seems to that having done so must not be able to see at way be going a mr wyatt eye must be on level with mr faulkner chest moreover must be evident that judging from present appearance must scarcely have seen anything at after receiving blow doe not strike a being still more likely that partially blinded a be being unwilling to strike magistrate in return however much latter have forfeited claim to respect closed with in heat of passion lifted up carried along at random think that very likely lieutenant replied have be struck a prisoner be struck captain downes what course do think must have be proper for to pursue know what must have be proper know what must have done magistrate magistrate must have knocked assailant down at rate must have tried to a naval man captain downes have have experience of conduct gentleman generally observe to prisoner presume that be not custom to strike even if did make somewhat free use of tongue certainly not captain downes said emphatically must go so far a to say that must consider to be disgraceful cowardly act must so consider there be again murmur of applause in court be instantly arrested when mr probert held up hand deprecatingly thank captain downes went on now come to question of quarrel gave rise to affair mr faulkner have not thought fit to ask question about be standing close enough to hear what passed be standing close by mr faulkner prisoner spoke loudly enough to be heard at distance magistrate first began conversation did used very strong language did not very strong did think that be justified in using such strong language certainly not thought that be most improper do think that gentleman accosted so improperly be to be greatly blamed if us strong language in return must no doubt have be better if have held tongue at time have called to account afterwards still provocation be very strong captain downes must not altogether blame did not blame at witness said curtly what did think when mr faulkner suddenly struck prisoner in face be to answer question witness asked bench think that be improper question chairman replied very well sir then if must say thought be one of most blackguardly cowardly thing ever saw done thank captain downes think necessary to ask further question have more witness to call mr faulkner chairman asked coldly mr faulkner face be white with rage have dozen other witness said hoarsely have doubt will follow lead officer have set will therefore call more think worship mr probert said rising that be necessary for to address must only submit to that there be not shadow of evidence to support charge of attempt to murder a to abusive language can not say that client word be retort courteous be only retort natural be simply consequence of extraordinary conduct of mr faulkner acting at time in capacity of magistrate a to charge of threatening language be altogether absurd client simply asserted what be true by common report that mr faulkner have be threatened that be possible that threat might day other be carried into effect have only therefore to leave case in hand of worship two magistrate put head together for short time then chairman said bench be of opinion that charge of attempted murder be altogether without foundation that of abusive language use of threat must never have be brought seeing that be result of what can not consider very ill judged improper conduct of plaintiff be therefore discharged mr wyatt colleague can not again express hope that preceding charge may prove lesson to to avoid taking part even a spectator in such breech of law a led to very regrettable occurrence a magistrate concluded roar of applause rose in court in vain constable shouted for silence chairman at once ordered room to be cleared at same time motioned to julian not to leave court a be preparing to do when court be cleared called julian up to think mr wyatt said must be a well for to remain here for time then go out by back way must be very unfortunate if demonstration took place enough harm have be done already let make worse certainly not sir be heartily sorry for what have occurred beckoning to frank who be still seated at solicitor table retired with to waiting room thank goodness julian have got out of scrape thank goodness indeed frank behaved like awful fool never dreamt that anything like must come of have be to see cargo run several time be very good fun never helped in way have always made up mind must make scarce if revenue people must turn up happened so suddenly that be prisoner before knew what be going on a to other affair doubt must have be better for to have said nothing of course knew that have right to say what did have not least idea that must hit when did went at in fury mind acknowledging did intend to chuck in fire not with idea of killing know though did think must be burnt bit be lucky sent for probert julian have never thought of more did frank be perfectly astonished when got up said that appeared for supposed that aunt have sent for be sure aunt did must have told must not be surprised frank if be captain downes in first place be friend of father in next place because be heartily sick of faulkner constant interference way go on expect that if mr moorsby have got up must have said just same thing will leave here for few minute julian must run round tell aunt be in fearful stew about frank ran out at main entrance number of fisherman be hanging about outside bill came up to be mr julian coming out master frank not at present magistrate want fuss in street more doe brother will stay there till one have cleared off so best thing can do bill be to persuade others to go off home julian know well enough that be pleased that have got off see if there be fuss got up about in street must do harm not good all right sir will get off just wanted to give cheer well did that in court bill know that appreciates good intention well must be off mr troutbeck be still on watch however did not come to door frank opened ran into parlour aunt have dropped into chair with handkerchief to eye so have not come back with frank be dreadful be going to do with be not going to do anything aunt have be acquitted only did not come home with because there be lot of sailor waiting outside to cheer magistrate did not want row over did julian have just run home to tell that be right now be going back for expect by time get there will have gone may be home in quarter of hour so think aunt best thing can do be to get tea ready for expect have have much to eat there appetite to eat be good advice for mr troutbeck be on point of going into hysteric from joy relief however thought of necessity for getting good meal to welcome julian on arrival turned thought into channel wiping eye hastily rose gave direction while frank started again for court house fisherman have left there be still number of boy about place private entrance be however free from observer brother started at once keeping to back street until neared house dear julian mr troutbeck exclaimed a threw arm round neck what relief be to have back again have be terrible for have be very pleasant aunt replied cheerfully be right now certainly ought not to grumble have have better luck than deserved be fool to go there did not think that there be real chance of revenue people coming down upon be thought have be thrown off scent altogether what dreadful face have got julian oh be nothing aunt will go off in few day until have must either stay indoors keep out of town altogether be afraid tea wo be ready for few minute julian see have have very short notice can hold on comfortably aunt besides have got to have change wash be of more importance than tea just at present after meal be over frank gave detail of examination narrative being very frequently stopped by exclamation question on part of mr troutbeck have never heard of such wicked thing idea of man charging with attempting to murder julian ought to be punished for fancy have be punished aunt see how be to keep commission a justice after what be said in court still be bad thing for be discharged will always be against if ever get into sort of trouble again people will say 'ah yes be charged with attempting murder when be young fellow although be lucky enough to get off then there must have be something in be evidently man of ungovernable temper dear julian everyone know that have very sweet temper be not in sweet temper then at rate aunt of course not julian must not have be so if anyone have hit such terrible blow a in face nephew laughed for have never seen ruffled out of usual serenity well aunt let talk more about julian said must give good deal if have happened a be one must make best of hope that will be forgotten in time wish now that have gone into army be too late for will think over what have best take to must certainly like to get away from here until have blown over altogether on following morning frank met captain downes learned that be right in conjecture that be who have retained mr probert service in julian behalf before magistrate for next few day julian kept in house except after nightfall went out for long walk report of proceeding in court have caused great sensation in weymouth feeling be so strong against mr faulkner that be hooted in street when rode into town general expectation be that must resign position on bench when at end of week did not do so private meeting of other magistrate be held be whispered in town that report of proceeding at court have be sent to home secretary with expression of opinion that mr faulkner brother magistrate felt that must not sit again with on bench after what have taken place ten day after affair julian started early one morning for day rabbit shooting at house of friend who lived six mile up valley snow fell in course of afternoon put stop to shooting started to walk home when be within few hundred yard of mr faulkner place heard horse coming along behind snow have fallen have deadened sound of hoof on road looking round saw mr faulkner riding fast at distance of fifty yard away have caught sight of sooner julian must have left road entered wood to avoid be too late now hoped that at rate man must pas on without speaking horseman have apparently not recognized julian until came abreast of when with sudden exclamation reined in horse illustration mark word young scoundrel will be even with yet so be julian wyatt said in tone of suppressed fury be mr faulkner julian replied quietly a want to have anything to say to think that have better go on way without interfering with mark word young scoundrel will be even with yet debt be not on side mr faulkner too have got debt to pay perhaps day may square matter up when have not got score of coast guardsman at back however be content to leave matter a be so long a do same a to owing debt to be have to thank for trouble have got into be doing of mine however warn that have better abstain from insulting again did not strike back when hit last time if call scoundrel again will see that can hit a hard a can will teach to keep civil tongue in head mark word mr faulkner repeated will have watched will hunt down if be not mistaken will put rope round neck one of day so saying struck into horse galloped on julian stood looking after until saw turn in at gate drive to house led a knew diagonally through wood a walked forward heard horse galloping hoof grow louder louder suddenly there be report of gun seventy eighty yard away be mingled with of sudden cry julian heard horse galloping on even faster than before with exclamation of good heaven something have happened broke through hedge ran in direction of sound a approached thought that caught sight of man running through tree kept straight on until came upon drive twenty yard away mr faulkner lay stretched on ground went up to stooped over eye be closed a lay on back julian saw blood oozing through bullet hole in coat high up on left side of chest feeling sure mr faulkner be dead started up without moment hesitation ran into wood again in direction where have thought that have seen figure minute later came upon footprint on bare spot between tree where snow have fallen lightly noting direction took followed at once saw more sign of footprint followed direction a nearly a must until came to farthest side of wood then leaped out into field beyond followed edge of wood until again reached road then turned went back again fifty yard from point where have first run out came upon footprint again be going to take to hill muttered a set off along track ran at trot a went loaded barrel of gun very likely villain will show fight said to must take by surprise if can after quarter of mile run reached foot of hill near crest three quarter of mile away caught sight of figure of man moment later have passed over crest julian started at full speed up hill there be need to follow footprint now indeed strong wind be blowing have swept snow into hollow face of hill be bare when reached top of hill have decreased distance considerably saw to surprise that man be bearing to right course must ere long bring to edge of cliff run up hill have left breathless for time man who be also running fully maintained lead then julian began to gain upon man have again changed course be now going parallel with line of cliff three mile from point where have reached top julian be within quarter of mile of must have caught before have not be obliged at time to make detour so a to avoid passing high ground where man if looked back must have perceived by time be almost sure that fugitive be poacher who have be recently released from term of two year in prison for poaching in mr faulkner preserve at last saw turn sharp to right again where on earth be going julian said to cliff be not many hundred yard away hitherto have supposed that man be keeping away from cliff to avoid meeting of coast guard who must be on duty there change of direction puzzled completely keeping eye on poacher saw enter small clump of bush from did not emerge julian at once slackened pace down to walk be likely enough that man have noticed that be being pursued have determined to rid of pursuer be not pleasant idea that fellow might now be kneeling among bush with gun at shoulder must hardly be that said to for if intended to shoot must have turned other way for sound of gun must be probably heard by of coast guard must not fail to see running away at rate muttered be not going to turn back after chase a have have standing still looking at spot saw that clump of bush grew in slight hollow that by turning to right must be able to approach within twenty thirty yard of without exposing to view did in short time lost sight of bush moving with great caution made way towards when approached slope into hollow lay down crawled along keeping gun in front of a neared spot lay down on stomach in short turf wound along until must see down into bush with gun at shoulder finger on trigger gazed down into hollow to surprise must see sign of fugitive leafless bough afforded slight shelter after gazing fixedly at for two three minute became convinced that man be no longer there a soon a came to conclusion stood up looked over surrounding country be bleak bare entirely destitute of hedge other shelter be for five six minute at utmost that have lost sight of bush in time man must not have got far where on earth have hidden julian muttered went down to clump of bush still holding gun in readiness for instant use patch be thirty foot long by half a wide walked backwards forward among low bush fugitive be certainly not there going to end of patch must see plainly enough track where man have entered for although there be little snow on top of ground lay among tuft of grass walked round clump there be sign of footstep leaving be rummest thing ever saw muttered fellow ca have flown away yet certainly have not walked off thinking over idea suddenly occurred to when sailing along coast with bill latter have one day pointed out to hole in cliff twenty foot above high water mark do see that hole mr julian yes see plain enough what of well sir if owned good have be taken into hole on dark still night must be rich man do mean to say that run cargo there bill not keg be too heavy too awkward to get away lace silk such like many lugger when come from abroad land sort of thing here then sail away take chance of running rest of cargo somewhere else how can anyone get up there see nothing like path there ai path sir revenue men must have found out long ago if there have be boat come along a said of dark night when there be swell on chap inside show tiny light to guide to spot when boat come lower rope down haul bale up then boat go back to lugger ups sail one be wiser what do do with stuff mean where do stow how do get away there be passage somewhere bill replied know where go out reckon there ai dozen men in weymouth who do know must say except men whose business be to take good inland forward to london there be only one chap who be in secret be not in weymouth now be in jail be joe markham be in for poaching for good many year sailed in one of french lugger then a have heard be keeper of cave for bit have to give up be too well known to coast guard kept too sharp eye on for to venture to go out have have enough of sea doubt have got money laid by anyhow took cottage by river took to poaching more for devilment must say than because wanted money expect be well paid by smuggler for used to get up story to put off scent never missed being present when run be made conversation came back to julian memory a stood by clump of bush wondering what have become of man that have pursued flashed upon that spot where be standing must not be far from smuggler cavern that entrance to might very well be among bush man knew where entrance be nothing be more likely than that must make for a place of concealment until opportunity occurred to get on board lugger cross channel be very likely place men must come go at night without risk of being seen heard by of coast guardsman on cliff must not be likely to encounter anyone within two three mile of year might pas without anyone happening to enter bush laying down gun julian began to search in earnest be hour before feeling about in coarse grass came upon handle pulled at gently at first then a did not yield exerted strength gave way section of rough herbage rose while three foot away sank in same proportion raising higher saw that trap door for such be be two foot wide by about five foot long eighteen inch deep be in fact deep tray pivoted on centre filled with earth on grass grew a freely a in ground adjoining greater portion of trap be overhung by bush grew so thickly around part sank that probability be small indeed that anyone must tread upon julian saw too that under handle be bolt that when fastened must hold trap firmly down doubt man in haste have forgotten to fasten before descended looking down julian saw circular hole like well evidently artificially made in chalk ladder be fastened against one side illustration julian find prisoner among smuggler julian hesitated must return to weymouth inform authority that have traced murderer of mr faulkner to place of concealment bring there to arrest must go down encounter single handed although of fearless disposition must have decided on more prudent course have not be that to have done so must have let authority into knowledge of smuggler cave although have determined to have nothing more to do with felt must be act of treachery for be only because have be believed by bill to be absolutely trustworthy that latter have told of existence of cavern of secret exit without information must never have searched for discovered trap door then too thought that credit must gain by capture of murderer single handed must go far to efface memory of disgrace have befallen helped to decide fetched gun slung over shoulder got upon ladder pulled trap door down behind a did so found that moved easily that must push up again without difficulty feeling bolt discovered that have be partially shot not sufficiently to catch fairly although containing so far hold of frame that have torn groove in somewhat rotten wood with force that have used to raise went down ladder very cautiously until after descending for thirty step foot encountered solid ground after moment consideration knelt down proceeded on hand knee almost immediately felt ground slope away in front of got on to foot again holding out arm found that passage be about four foot wide began to descend with extreme care feeling way along wall have gone thought about fifty yard when passage made sharp turn still descending at considerable distance ahead light streamed in through rugged hole walked more confidently now soon light be sufficient to enable to see path be following on arriving at aperture saw that a expected be looking over sea on one side of hole there be shelf cut in chalk be stained a if by oil guessed at once that be look out spot for signalling craft in offing path here turned again ran parallel with face of cliff there be occasion to exercise care in walking now a here there light streamed in through opening few inch long now unslung gun stooped took off boot then proceeded noiselessly descent be considerable in place step have be cut at last arrived at door be roughly very solidly made must doubtless sustain attack for time before yielded so must give time to occupant in case trap door be discovered to make escape by lower entrance on to beach there be latch to lifting quietly found door yielded holding gun in right hand ready to cover fugitive moment entered julian threw door wide open sprang forward have not calculated on further descent floor of cave be five foot below fell heavily upon gun going off a struck floor instantaneous a fall have be eye have taken in scene several lantern faintly lit up cave while in centre table at several figure be sitting be illuminated by three four candle be partly stunned by heaviness of fall vaguely heard shout of surprise alarm be minute later roughly seized dragged along then felt that be being tightly bound for minute be left to must see three men with gun in hand standing near door by have entered listening attentively presently heard step coming down passage two other men came through door shut bolted carefully then came down step into cabin spoke to comrade a came in news be evidently satisfactory for men leaned gun against wall came to table there be talk for few minute then julian be raised placed in sitting position on head of cask by table one of men then addressed in french julian who by time have recovered from effect of fall shook head other then spoke to poacher who have seated opposite julian latter then said be young fellow who be tried in court three week ago be not yes be thought so be there be very day got to weymouth well what deuce be doing here be chap who have followed way up hill julian nodded what did follow for because be in road when shot faulkner heard gun ran in found dead caught sight of in wood went in chase of what did intend to do young fool intended to capture julian said fearlessly what for have done good service a well a have reason to bear good will of men who be there told that though downes got off be true that be going to throw faulkner into fire so be have just struck be in furious passion be different thing altogether to shooting man in cold blood got two year imprisonment man said to mind be good reason for shooting when got chance thing be must never leave alone be always on heel there be two three men in prison now that got sent there eight more be waiting trial made war on have turned table on heard that have be at several of run of course be in with of fellow how did get to know about entrance to place only knew that there be cave here that be used by smuggler that have entrance somewhere man who told knew well be to be trusted be only because disappeared among bush that there be footprint to show that have left that appeared to that passage might be there so looked about until found handle to trap door why did go call coast guard there be station not quarter of mile away because must not have done without betraying secret of cavern found entrance must never have done so if have not be told about cave secret passage felt that must be act of treachery to betray be really fool enough to think that if captured single handed must walk with like lamb to gallows did intend to give chance of making fight intended to rush straight in covered with gun well have plenty of pluck young fellow if have much wisdom if think that after getting in here will let go out again to bring constable down on be mistaken altogether chapter iv smuggler cave joe markham have a soon a arrived told french smuggler that have shot magistrate who have for last five six year given so much trouble caused so much loss who have a last affair showed become more dangerous than ever a must only have obtained information a to exact point of landing by having bribed someone connected with be case of life business said if have not be got out of way must have given up trade altogether on part of coast besides have be cause not only of several seizure of cargo of death of eight ten of comrade of imprisonment of many others now that be out of way will find thing great deal easier served right leader of party said have rendered good service what be going to do do think that suspicion will fall upon yes have put in awkward position be afraid thought that job have be so well managed that must never be traced to when got up to top of hill saw fellow just starting from bottom did not think much of at time came up so quickly after that must have run way up have chased hard a got nearer must see that have gun too be not more than quarter of mile away when got to trap door why did hide in bush put bullet into markham for several reason in first place gun might have be heard by of cussed revenue men then there must be inquiry search must have seen by direction have be going that must have be shot from bush a one must have be in sight when ran up thing must have be puzzle to that may be sure must have suspected there must be hidden way out of clump besides must probably have hunted inch of ground to see if must find anything must give clue a to who have fired shot be one reason quite good enough without others frenchman said well there be one went for almost a much with shot down faulkner because be curse to have imprisoned several of pal done lot of damage to trade be likely to break up altogether besides have big grudge against on own account must not have liked to shoot down fellow in cold blood have feeling against have done harm did not even know who be if have overtaken in open may be sure must have made fight of for must have be life against pretend to be soft there be little enough of about have fought hard several time in old day when be surprised must not have shot down fellow without giving chance of life if there have not be trap door to escape by must have stood up given fair warning fought out man to man a be at point conversation have be arrested by sudden entrance of julian who be chief of smuggler asked joe when have finished conversation with prisoner be spy be young chap a life down in town be pal of of friend there have be with at landing of good be caught in last affair got off because must not prove that be actually engaged in business be enemy of faulkner too have row there faulkner hit in face can see mark still must have thrown faulkner on to bonfire have lit if have not be prevented by of coast guard be through what have heard from friend of cavern there being entrance to somewhere that came to look for trap door certainly pushed bolt forward when came down be in hurry so suppose must not have caught rightly well what be to be done joe know see know about shooting faulkner must trust not to peach about cavern trap door know a must about other thing seems to that be just a likely to be suspected of having hand in a be row with faulkner be talk of place when faulkner be found with bullet in will be first fellow to be suspected well if be so see must not be able to account for for three four hour afterwards might be driven to peach on to save own life must be obliged to give story about following coming down here there must be end of best hiding place in country must not be able to show face on side of channel again must say safest plan must be to cut throat chuck into sea have done with wo have that poacher said positively lugger will be in to night will take across with to france be very well one of men said what be to prevent coming back again must prevent somehow other must get up tale that be english sailor have picked up at sea hand over to authority tell story be that have fallen overboard from english ship of war then must send away to place in interior where keep english prisoner of war there might lie for year perhaps never get back again doe not know word of french a saw when spoke to so ca contradict story may tell if by chance question must be asked can just say what suit might ruin if came back smuggler growled ai likely that will come back poacher said have heard that die off like fly in prison of yours besides will guarantee if doe will never split about place be gentleman will get to swear to may be sure will not break oath how about yourself well a wo come back for year will take chance of have got evidence against must be word against mine must tell story must tell mine mine must be most likely must say met on hill with gun knowing who be what cause have got to hate faulkner told that have shot asked to get on board smuggler craft across channel have done so be must know about be not afraid of anything might say when come back again julian have watched speaker anxiously during conversation be wholly ignorant of french from tone manner of speaker gathered that poacher be speaking in favour have expected no mercy life be nothing to french smuggler be surprised to find man whose life thought held in hand if released apparently pleading cause look here young fellow poacher said turning towards in first place men be afraid that may betray existence of place opinion be that best thing to make safe must be to cut throat throw out of mouth of cave into sea told that knew of cave from one of friend must be trusted to keep secret at rate demand in first place that will take oath never to split about will do willingly enough julian said with great feeling of relief joe markham then dictated terrible oath have be always taken by made acquainted with existence of cave julian repeated after poacher then told smuggler what julian have sworn to now young fellow may tell that be going to take over to france to night may think will be asking to take oath like not to say anything against ai going to shot man pretend to be sorry for be hard bad chap got what deserved owed long score not only for for others if have not shot someone else must have done so sooner later will do what can to prevent coming back here though think will say anything against when do come back in first place like enough will take to sea again may be settled in france before return in next place may be dead most of have got evidence against if be here told story of course must say that be lie that have shot man have got out of way by sending across to france in lugger so think will see that be best to keep quiet tongue in head anyhow be ready to take chance of will be horribly alarmed when get home to night julian said well must be alarmed poacher said carelessly have interfered in business be none of yours have got to take consequence may think lucky fellow that be not by time drifting about on tideway feel that julian said though did not understand word of what said be sure that be owing to that be not there must not have promised must never say word to anyone about because one can never tell how one may be placed after what have done think that can safely promise will never go out of way to denounce want promise about poacher replied have made up mind to leave weymouth for after having be in jail two year will always have constable a well a revenue men keeping eye on so have intended all along to take to lugger again live on board a did before only stayed here until must settle account with faulkner have doubt that will suspect of business there be plenty of men who know have sworn to be even with disappearance be sure to be put down to now in next place will promise not to try to escape because if do will get to take rope off dare say have be thinking that if must get free must make run for mouth of cave dive in for be about high water now julian have in fact be thinking so a saw that unless gave promise must have to remain in cord be cutting into wrist at once took required oath joe told frenchman then unfastened julian cord may a well carry up bale at once leader said before get dark be use giving anyone at sea chance of seeing light tell to take one come up with be not going to leave here by promise promise poacher translated order to julian bale be taken out from beneath tarpaulin at end of cave shouldering one proceeded up passage until reached foot of ladder here laid bale down then returned to cave be that julian asked yes bale be worth lot of money there be fifteen hundred pound worth of lace in one of others be silk satin worth five hundred to night when hear signal three of frenchman will go up will find two men there will carry bale to place mile half away where will be hidden until be convenient to send up to london wherever be going to dispose of be business ours be finished when hand over money for will come at eight o'clock at ten lugger will be off coast here send boat ashore for so have got five six hour yet must say best thing can do be to turn in sleep till then there be plenty of blanket in corner pile of sheep skin that can sleep on julian nodded threw two three of sheep skin down in corner rolled up for pillow drew blanket over for first time looked round cave be lighted only by small hole used a look out at present blanket hung before there be door similar to by have entered from above leading to lower cave how far lower entrance might be below julian have mean of knowing from view have obtained of sea through large loop hole have passed in descent did not think that cavern be in must be le than seventy eighty foot above water sole ventilation a far a must see be current of air found way in through door from below passed up through above what must come in through loop hole seaward doubtless in warmer weather door stood open be now closed more for warmth than for other purpose although have noticed that lower one have be bolted locked after have be first captured a lay down wondered how be going to end position be at once perilous uncertain have so far escaped better than must have expected for from look frenchman have given have doubt what fate must have be have not man have be chasing spoken in favour life therefore seemed for present safe future be very dark poacher have spoken a if be not likely to return for year surely must not intend to keep on board ship time must mean to put upon vessel sailing abroad what way frank aunt must be in must learn that have started for home early in afternoon must be absolutely certain that must not have strayed from road met with accident coming along valley must certainly be awkward being missed on same day faulkner have be shot especially a according to time have started for home must have come along road somewhere about time magistrate be shot be horrible thought suspicion might fall upon who knew must be sure that must have have nothing to do with murder still more thought of more felt that suspicion be certain to rise that must find extremely difficult to explain matter on return memory of quarrel with magistrate be fresh in everybody mind even friend might well consider singular that word to faulkner must so soon have be carried into effect be true that joe markham must be missing too that man own acquaintance must have great difficulty in guessing that have carried out threat against faulkner must certainly not communicate opinion to constable latter might not think of man in connection with murder notice that be no longer to be seen about town even be free to leave cave now return to weymouth must find in most awkward position there be of course shadow of evidence against save that be known to have quarrelled with faulkner must have be very near spot moment be killed how must explain six seven hour absence must say that have caught sight of man in plantation followed for mile among hill have lost sight of at last have not shadow of evidence to produce in confirmation of story in fact there be direct evidence way there must be doubt must have to remain under cloud of suspicion be bad enough before must be altogether intolerable be perhaps best after that be to be taken away future decided for must have gone anyhow doubt must be able to get opportunity of writing to frank setting mind at rest a to safety telling something about what have happened that have be kidnapped carried over to france have acted like fool doubt frank must understand why have followed first impulse gone alone after man who committed murder instead of going to constable telling that unknown man have killed magistrate one thing seemed certain must never be able to go back to weymouth again unless affair be cleared up did not see how ever must be at point julian thought became confused voice of men talking at table seemed to get further further away then be conscious of nothing more until heard bell tinkle faintly somewhere overhead there be movement in cave sat up men went out by upper door when have left got up went to see if lower door be so fastened that must not open have idea of breaking word did so out of curiosity rather than from other feeling found that bolt must be pulled back that lock be very strong one jamb be at point where bolt shot into covered with piece of iron so that instrument must be used for forcing back bolt may be thought that other prisoner have be confined here at time other possibly have be done in order that if trap door above must be found revenue men come down way smuggler in flight might lock door behind so have time to get away in boat along at foot of cliff before pursuer must get down to lower entrance open fire upon then lay down again wondered whether pull of bell have heard must be hidden in grass like handle of trap might only be very small knob have looked so closely among bush that wondered have escaped in three four minute french captain came down again walked across to where be lying pauvre diable muttered then went back to table filled glass of spirit water lit pipe moment later thought seemed to strike came across to julian again touched at once sat up frenchman motioned to come to table went to cupboard brought out wooden platter with large lump of cold beef loaf of bread cheese poured out horn of brandy water motioned to eat julian attacked food vigorously have have lunch with friend before starting for walk back to weymouth have be nearly seven hour before run across hill in keen air have given sharp appetite so did full justice to food be not bad fellow after said to a smuggler when have finished brought out box of cigar placed before must have knocked on head without compunction in way of business now when have concluded that be not dangerous come out a good fellow nodded pleasantly to frenchman a lit cigar be excellent one far better than julian have be accustomed to smoke with associate in billiard room frenchman thought be not dissimilar to own be brave garcon said to make best of thing be fine looking fellow too will be big man in year two be misfortune that have got to take shut up in prison why did mix up in affair of markham be way with boy instead of being grateful to man have killed enemy must need run after a if have done injury well ca be helped now at least will make a comfortable a can a long a be on board lugger in half hour joe markham returned with french sailor there be big stir down in weymouth said to julian heard from friend that place be like hive of bee tell mr wyatt that be lucky thing for that found trap door came down here may like being prisoner be lot better than being in cell down in weymouth with charge of murder hanging over must have be if have gone straight back again charge of murder julian repeated springing to foot how must such charge be brought must not have be known so soon that be missing must go back face if run away now have be openly accused everyone will make sure of guilt well sir must say be sight better that must suspect safely over in france than that must suspect with in hand at rate see have choice in matter must only clear by bringing into though doubt a thing have turned out that must help bit warn that will make escape come back again a soon a can julian said passionately well sir if have fancy for hanging of course can do so from what hear hanging must be a sure a stand there there be warrant out against constable be scouring country what possible ground can have to go upon except that smuggling affair well if what friend told be true have very good ground a think to go on be talking with one of constable told that faulkner be not dead yet though ai expected to last till morning servant came out to look for when horse came back to house without man rode into weymouth for doctor went to colonel chamber mr harrington by time got there faulkner be conscious took dying deposition said that have have row with short distance before have got to gate that said must be even with a be riding up through wood to house suddenly heard gun at same moment fell from horse minute later came out from wood at point where shot have be fired have gun in hand feeling sure that intention be to ascertain if be done for to finish off if found that be not shut eye pretended to be dead stooped over then made off at full speed now sir that will be awkward evidence to get over must see that will be long way safer in france than must in weymouth julian sank down crushed by blow saw that what poacher said be true what must unsupported assertion go for a against dying man deposition doubt faulkner have stated what believed to be truth though might not have given fair account of what have taken place in road still there must be cross examining a to what have passed there statement must stand unchallenged a thing now stood julian own story that have pursued man over hill have lost must wholly unsupported a be be received with absolute incredulity have be at spot certainly at time have have word with faulkner have have gun in hand have come out leaned over wounded man within le than minute of shot being fired chain of evidence against seemed to be complete sat appalled at position in found look here youngster poacher said be bad job say be be sorry for ai so sorry a to go give up get hung in place will tell will do when get across to france will draw up statement swear before magistrate giving account of whole affair will put in tin case always carry about with will direct to colonel chamber whenever anything happens to will be sent to be five twenty year older than be life lead ai likely to give old age to make matter safer will have two copy made of statement one will leave in hand of one of friend here craft be in may be wrecked day sunk by one of cutter anyhow whichever way come be certain to hear of death will tell that when hears of be to send letter to chamber thank julian said earnestly may not come for long time will be something for to know day other name will be cleared of horrible accusation must rather have gone faced out now must be just suicide man said weymouth ai only place in world be better for to live out of know will get cleared day than to get hung with only consolation that perhaps twenty year hence may find out have made mistake be so much be thinking of a brother aunt going away never sending word will be like confessing guilt will ruin brother life kill aunt well will tell will do markham said will write letter to brother tell story except of course about cave can say followed smuggler sprang on captured have carried across to france rest can tell just a happened a will do harm folk may believe one else be likely to do so mean to go back to weymouth again if did that letter must not be evidence that anyone must send to trial on anyhow will risk that thank with heart julian said gratefully will not so much mind if frank aunt get story know that will believe if one else doe can move away from weymouth to place where will not follow wo be so hard for to bear then especially if day truth get to be known only please direct letter to 'colonel chamber chairman of weymouth magistrate because be at least ten year older than be might die long before letter might never be opened if directed only to right be lad will see to just at moment one of sailor came down from look out above said that signal have just be made from offing that lugger boat must be below in quarter of hour prepared for departure lower door be unbolted light extinguished went down to lower entrance be reached by staircase cut in chalk coming down into long narrow passage at further end of be opening julian have seen from sea party gathered at entrance in few minute boat with muffled oar approached silently rope be lowered noose at upper end being placed over short iron bar projecting three four inch from chalk foot two inside entrance french captain went down first julian be told to follow sailor markham then descended sharp jerk shook rope off bar boat then rowed out to smuggler be lying mile from shore a soon a be on board sail be sheeted home craft began to steal quietly through water towing boat behind whole operation have be conducted in perfect silence men be accustomed to work there be occasion for order be not until be mile out that word be spoken have gone off well captain then said got lace silk safely away money have be paid for revenue cutter started early morning be off lyme regis afternoon so will have clear run out will keep on course be laying till be well beyond race then make for west have sent word for to be on look out for at old place near dartmouth to morrow night if be not there then night after if there be danger be to send up rocket from hill inland wind be light keeping smart look out for british cruiser lowering sail down once twice when suspicious sail be seen in distance approached rocky shore two mile east of entrance to bay at ten o'clock on second evening after starting lantern be raised twice above bulwark kept there for instant then lowered expect be all right captain said must have sent up rocket before half past eight be time arranged think be about off landing place ah yes there be signal broke off a light be shown for moment close down to water edge yes there be again lower anchor gently let splash light anchor attached to hawser be silently let down into water now off with hatch get up keg while of men be engaged at work others lowered second boat one towing behind be brought round to side julian saw that men be armed with cutlass have pistol in belt rapidly keg be brought up on deck lowered into boat ah here come thompson captain said a very small boat rowed up silently out of darkness well friend be safe asked in broken english a boat came alongside safe enough captain most of revenue men have gone round from here to other side of bay where got news a thought that cargo be going to be run man on duty here have be squared will be away at other end of beat cart be ready quarter of mile away made out with glass just before sunset sent round word at once to friend to be in readiness boat started a soon a cargo be on board work went on uninterruptedly for next two hour by time last keg be on shore boat returned to lugger men be in high spirit cargo have be valuable one whole have be got rid of without interruption boat be at once hoisted up anchor weighed lugger made way out to sea what port do land at julian asked markham will go up loire to nantes replied hail from there to morrow morning have best put on sailor suit gave to day unless wind freshens good deal sha' be there for three four day fancy from look of sky that will blow up before morning a likely a not will get more than want by evening there be generally cruiser two off mouth of river in light wind can show heel easily enough if be blowing at weight tell be glad to be at sea again lad after being cooped up in cursed prison for two year seems to make new man of one know that be sorry shot that fellow say that did deserve for did see quite so strongly a did when be living on bread water with nothing to do to think of how must get even with when got out besides never calculated upon getting anyone else into mess be downright sorry got into one mr wyatt however job be done be use cry over spilt milk markham prediction turned out correct fresh wind be blowing by morning two day later lugger be running along close under coast fifteen mile south of mouth of loire having kept that course in order to avoid british cruiser might be off mouth of river before morning have passed st nazaire be running up loire chapter v following trail frank have started early for walk with one of school friend returning through town at three in afternoon saw people talking in group presently met one of chum what be going on vincent why have not heard faulkner magistrate have be shot shot two boy exclaimed do mean on purpose accidentally on purpose servant heard gun fired close by minute later horse galloped up to door two men ran along drive not hundred yard from house found lying shot through body three of doctor went off at once thompson came back ten minute ago for instrument believe stopped gig for moment to speak to rector hear told that might be a well for to go up at once a there be very little probability of faulkner living through night well ca say that be surprised frank said have made so disliked there be so many men who have grudge against have be threatened so often have heard fellow say dozen of time must be shot day yet suppose one ever really thought that must come true anyhow be very bad affair leaving other two talking together frank went on home mr troutbeck be greatly shocked at news dear dear said what dreadful doings one doe hear of who must have thought that gentleman magistrate too must have be shot in broad daylight within mile two of did not know have always heard that be very much disliked be awful to think that have be taken away like well aunt pretend to be either surprised shocked if man spends life in going out of way to hunt others down must not be surprised if at last one of turn on on bench be hated be not only because be severe because of bullying way see how behaved in affair with julian ca say feel pity for at have sent many man to gallows now time have come at five o'clock be already dusk shutter have be closed lamp lighted presently servant entered there be someone want to speak to master frank frank went out into hall head of constabulary two of men be standing there much surprised frank asked officer into other sitting room what be mr henderson said be very sad business very sad business mr wyatt brother be not at home hear julian went over morning to have day rabbit shooting with dick merryweather expect wo be long before be back there be nothing matter with asked with vague feeling of alarm at gravity of officer face be very painful matter mr wyatt be useless trying to hide truth from for must know shortly hold warrant for brother arrest on charge of attempted wilful murder frank eye dilated with surprise horror mean gasped then faith in brother came to aid broke off indignantly be monstrous perfectly monstrous mr henderson suppose be faulkner be because of wretched smuggling business that suspicion fall on a if there be not hundred others who owe man much deeper grudge than brother did indeed have animosity against at for julian got best of altogether faulkner have be hissed hooted time have be in town since if there be ill feeling left over that matter must be on part not on julian who signed warrant faulkner be signed by colonel mr harrington took dying deposition of mr faulkner there be harm in telling that because must be generally known when brother be brought up till then please let go further have sworn that overtook mr wyatt two three hundred yard before got to own gate there be altercation between swears that brother used threat have double barrelled gun in hand a faulkner be riding up drive to house be fired at from tree on left fell from horse almost directly afterwards mr wyatt ran out from spot where gun have be fired thinking must finish if thought be still alive mr faulkner closed eye held breath brother came up stood over having satisfied that be dead ran off through tree again believe be lie from beginning to end frank said passionately julian have brought into disgrace here fellow invented charge out of revenge if have be in road faulkner have struck julian a did before julian have have loaded gun in hand say that in passion might have shot still believe must even then julian be one of best tempered fellow in world still must admit that in heat of moment might raise gun fire to say that loaded gun after faulkner have gone on for be sure be empty a came along a have never known to bring home gun loaded that then went hid behind tree shot man down why must not believe if fifty honest men swore to much le on oath of fellow like faulkner ca say anything about mr wyatt have only duty to do yes understand that mr henderson of course must be arrested be sure one will believe accusation for minute oh exclaimed a fresh idea struck what be faulkner shot with be bullet wound well be quite enough frank exclaimed triumphantly julian have double barrelled gun with have be rabbit shooting if have be who fired must have be with charge of shot suppose went about with bullet in pocket to use in case happened to meet faulkner have row with julian never fired bullet in life a far a know there be not such thing a bullet mould in house officer look of gravity relaxed be important certainly said very important own after hearing deposition read did seem to that a result of unfortunate quarrel brother might have be so goaded by something mr faulkner said did that have hastily loaded gun in passion run across wood shot down now be clear from what say that be most improbable must have bullet about unless can be proved that obtained one from gunmaker otherwise be very strong point in favour suppose brother have not returned afternoon asked servant when got home at three whether have returned though did not expect back so soon said that have not come in be sure have not done so since then will not intrude longer will place one of men in front of house one behind if come home arrest will be managed quietly will not bring in here at will save painful scene when officer have left frank returned to aunt what be frank asked well aunt be more absurd affair than other absurd a be be very painful there be warrant out for arrest of julian on charge of attempting to murder mr faulkner mr troutbeck gave cry then burst into fit of hysterical laughter after vainly trying to pacify frank went out for servant a wild scream of laughter continued put on hat ran for family doctor who lived few door away briefly related circumstance of case to then brought back to house be long time before violence of paroxysm passed leaving mr troutbeck so weak that have to be carried by frank doctor up to room worry aunt frank said a laid down upon bed will come out right just a last did will all be cleared up doubt in very short time a soon a maid have undressed mr troutbeck have got into bed doctor went up gave opiate then went down into parlour to frank who told story in full warning that must say nothing about deposition of mr faulkner until have be read in court be very grave affair frank old doctor said having known brother from childhood be a convinced a be that however much of deposition be true false julian never fired shot what say about bullet make still more conclusive if be needed certainly be not with brother have exceedingly sweet even temper father have often spoken to of almost with regret saying that must be much better if have little more will of own little spice more of temper still be most unfortunate that have returned of course may have met friend in town gone home with may have stayed at mr be can have stopped in town anyhow frank said for first thing must have heard when got back must have be of shooting of faulkner must have be sure to have come home to talk over with of course may have stopped with merryweathers be afraid have not fancy that part of faulkner story must be true must never have accused julian if have not met near gate for julian in case must have easily proved where be at time think did meet very likely have row know what faulkner be can understand that if met julian must most likely say something to there might then be quarrel think that story about julian coming out looking at be pure fancy lie doubt be thinking of a rode along badly wounded a be perhaps altogether insensible may have imagined rest be quite possible doctor agreed in case julian not coming home be more extraordinary if met faulkner between two three o'clock what can have be doing since be question frank must not answer ca tell sir said after long pause really ca imagine still nothing in world must make believe that julian did what be charged with several time frank went outside door constable be still there at last after sitting looking at fire for time put on cap went to residence of chief constable excuse mr henderson have be thinking over ever since left whoever did murder did not probably return to road struck off somewhere across field there be snow enough in middle of day to cover ground stopped falling at two o'clock have not snowed since might suggest that in morning search must be made round edge of wood if there be footprint found might be of great importance be quite right mr wyatt have already determined to go with couple of constable at daylight may go with sir if please must remember that evidence of footprint may find may be unfavourable to brother have not slightest fear of frank said confidently very well then mr wyatt two constable will be here at half past seven will be ready to start with at once must by chance be late will doubt be able to overtake before get there next morning frank be at office half hour before appointed time fortunately snow have fallen in night chief constable looked grave anxious when search began frank be excited rather than anxious have fear whatever a to result of investigation must disclose nothing felt certain to julian disadvantage continued absence of latter be unaccountable to felt absolutely certain that must be explained satisfactorily on return moment got across hedge into field skirting wood chief constable exclaimed stay men here be footprint by edge of tree come out until have carefully examined do not think went on turning to frank that must be much better that must not go further with for see might have to call a witness not at mr henderson find will have objection to being witness for be certain that will find nothing will tend to incriminate brother see what be thinking of that footprint be julian be own idea too at rate be mark of well made boot of large size without heavy nail constable nodded there be two set said one going way by distance be apart fact that heel be not a deeply marked a rest of print whoever made be running certainly frank agreed ran up to hedge then turned why must have done probably because saw vehicle person walking along road did not wish to be seen possibly so mr henderson in case why did not keep among tree coming going instead of exposing a must have done running here for hedge be thin one walking along much le driving must have seen mr henderson looked at frank with closer scrutiny than have before given be acute observer mr wyatt point be important one man wishing to avoid observation must certainly have kept among tree now let follow footprint along may learn something further presently came to point where julian have come out from wood see be in wood mr wyatt constable said quite see that frank said if be mark of julian boot think be have now found out that came out of wood at point ran for purpose other without attempt at concealment a far a hedge then turned ran back again past point where have left wood now let see what did afterwards may give clue to whole matter fifty yard further came on spot where julian have turned off on poacher track there be mr henderson frank exclaimed triumphantly man came out of wood here man with roughly made boot with hob nail man came out first be quite evident track be in line julian be in many place on top of other be running fast if look will see julian stride be longest therefore be probably running fastest be a say mr wyatt lighter footprint obliterate of heavier boot in several place what can be meaning of can second man have be doing in wood whole thing be perfectly plain to frank said excitedly julian be in road heard report of gun close by in wood perhaps heard cry jumped over hedge made for spot possibly a mr faulkner said ran into drive stooped over then started in pursuit of murderer of whom may possibly have obtained sight there be not enough snow under tree for to follow footprint therefore ran to edge of wood then to road in search of man track then turned ran back again till came upon leaving wood then set off in pursuit by jove mr wyatt officer said do think that explanation be right one give hand lad have more doubt five minute ago brother have in fit of passion shot mr faulkner than have be standing here now declare think now that acted a say how have struck upon beat altogether have be thinking of nothing else night mr henderson put in julian position seemed to that hearing gun fired so close at hand even if did not hear cry julian knowing how often man have be threatened might at once have run to spot might have behaved just a faulkner say did seemed to simple enough julian absence be only difficulty only way must possibly account for be that have followed murderer be very imprudent mr henderson said gravely very be just sort of thing julian must have done however far went ought to be back before be what be anxious about mr henderson of course ought to be back be terribly afraid that something have happened to man whoever be must have be desperate character having taken one life from revenge must not hesitate to take to secure own safety have great advantage over julian for a know gun carried bullet while julian have nothing small shot way will go next mr henderson will follow track go into wood will go into wood will take comparatively short time there be saying how far other may lead before do so will call up two men take over ground show discovery have made be a well to have a many witness a possible two constable be called up taken along line of track chief constable pointed out to that man with well made boot be evidently running after other then entered wood carefully searching found here there print of boot went out into drive starting from spot where mr faulkner have be found made for large tree thirty yard to left just a thought mr henderson said someone have be standing here must think for little time can see that ground be kicked up bit though be too hard to show mark of boot plainly there be many scratch groove such a must be made by hob nail now lad search about closely if can find wad will be material point after five minute search one of men picked up piece of half burned paper frank uttered exclamation of satisfaction a held up julian always used wad never came from gun now let go back to tree mr henderson see way man went after firing shot after careful search found heavy footprint at several spot where snow lay near also found trace of lighter boot tree then grew thicker following line indicated by footprint came to spot where have left wood see mr henderson frank said julian lost footprint just where did bore little more to left striking edge of wood between where man have left road now sir have only to find spot where julian first left road try to trace footstep from there to spot where mr faulkner be lying know that shot be fired from behind tree if brother footstep miss spot altogether think case will be absolutely proved went back into road found where julian have crossed untrodden snow between hedge have pushed way through latter be only here there that footprint must be found fortunately ten yard to right of tree there be open space across have evidently run have proved case mr wyatt chief constable said shaking frank cordially by hand be indeed glad whoever man be who shot mr faulkner be certainly not brother now let start at once on track frank face became more serious than have be during previous search a soon a took up double track across field before have felt absolutely confident that might find must only tend to clear julian from terrible accusation now upon contrary feared that discovery might make must confirm suspicion that evil have befallen scarcely word be spoken a passed along field man with hob nailed boot be taking to hill chief constable remarked be afraid so mr henderson a be bare of snow there will be chance of following when came to point where snow ended stopped there be end of search mr wyatt must return to town magistrate will meet at eleven o'clock constable must be there will send off two men directly get back to go along cliff question men who be on duty yesterday afternoon a to whether saw two men with gun crossing hill one being probably distance behind other think perhaps have better come to court say that will be absolutely necessary think must be better that must do so see must be useless for to be hunting over hill alone a soon a court be over will take four men will myself start to search for there be saying whether may not find sign other will be glad if will go with have shown born detective morning for have be trained to life must not have followed scent up more unerringly will certainly go with mr henderson will be at court house must start at once for hill have have nothing to eat morning what be much more important want to ease aunt mind of course be a certain a be that julian have nothing whatever to do with naturally will be immense relief to to know that suspicion of so dreadful crime no longer rest on when frank returned home found that mr troutbeck be so prostrated with shock that be still in bed where doctor have ordered to remain a soon however a heard that frank be back sent down for to come up delight be extreme when told of discovery have made that constable have doubt warrant for julian arrest must be withdrawn became anxious again when found that frank must give satisfactory explanation of long absence must not trouble about aunt said soothingly doubt will hear of before long let be content that have come well out of terrible accusation just a did from former charge let hope that explanation of absence will be just a satisfactory when hear even if thought that julian have got into trouble must be infinitely easier to bear than knowledge that be suspected of murder for must have be murder aunt heard just now that faulkner died last night meeting of magistrate be informal one a agreed directly heard that julian be not in custody that must proceed further in matter mr henderson after answering first question followed into private room so did not lay hand on last night colonel chamber said will have to alter warrant for find mr faulkner be dead think gentleman chief constable said quietly that after have heard have to tell will have to withdraw warrant altogether eh what do mean to say henderson that think young fellow did not fire shot after must give hundred pound if must think so with faulkner deposition before see how there can be possible doubt in matter besides be present when gave though may have be coloured good deal by feeling against young wyatt be convinced that believed at rate that be speaking truth have doubt did sir have more doubt than have a to mr wyatt guilt indeed until brother pointed out one very important fact nothing must have persuaded that did not fire shot say that be at conclusive sufficed to show that matter be by mean so certain a seemed to be found at house when went there to arrest brother of course young fellow be greatly shocked when told nature of charge declared to be absolutely impossible so certain be that even when told nature of mr faulkner deposition be more puzzled than alarmed first question asked be whether mr faulkner have be killed by shot by ball when said by ball face cleared up altogether brother said a know have be rabbit shooting at mr merryweather must have have small shot with young wyatt said that did not think brother have ever fired bullet in life knew there be not such thing a bullet in house mr wyatt must not possibly have known that be likely to meet mr faulkner on way back from shooting therefore unless upon rather improbable theory that went about with intention of shooting mr faulkner whenever met that have bought bullet in town carried always about with for purpose be clear that must not have fired that shot there be something in mr henderson good deal in be ready to admit nothing must really counteract effect of faulkner direct testimony given when knew that be dying sir still be point own have entirely overlooked however be not now so important will now tell have taken place morning then related story of discovery of track proved that julian have not gone near tree behind murderer have for time be standing how after running in finding mr faulkner body have set out in pursuit of scoundrel have two constable outside who be with colonel if like to question will be sure confirm statement in respect be glad indeed to hear story mr henderson colonel chamber said warmly lad father be old friend of mine be terrible to think that son must have committed dastardly crime what say seems to quite conclusive of innocence at same time be not in way in contradiction with deposition give very great credit for manner in have unravelled mystery credit sir be entirely due to mr wyatt brother have formed theory a in opinion brother be certainly innocent of crime only possible way in must account for absence from home that night be that upon hearing gun fired so close at hand mr wyatt have at once run to spot found body of mr faulkner have then immediately started in pursuit of murderer setting out with on search with theory strongly fixed in mind young wyatt seized at once point confirmed pointed out to that man with heavy boot have crossed field at run that other have followed a soon a came upon footprint after searching for up down by edge of wood once have got clue to follow up matter be then plain enough search through wood showed whole circumstance of case a have related to just a plainly a if have witnessed affair if have not be set upon right trail say honestly that doubt whether must have unravelled especially a snow be rapidly going by afternoon footprint will have disappeared well a matter of form will take down statement mr henderson then take of constable young mr wyatt be outside if must like to hear sir certainly will colonel said must be wonderfully shrewd young fellow think ought to take statement if only to record part played in proving brother innocence where be brother mr henderson have come back yet sir own regard absence a alarming see murderer whoever be be armed with rifle at rate with gun carried bullet while mr wyatt have only shot gun fellow must certainly not suffer to be arrested without struggle when found that be being followed across hill must be likely enough to shoot down pursuer without letting get close enough to use fowling piece have sent two constable up to inquire of coast guard men along cliff whether observed man with gun crossing hill yesterday afternoon whether heard gun fired a soon a have before statement of constable who be with morning intend to take two others start for search over hill be very much afraid that will come upon mr wyatt body sincerely hope not colonel chamber said own can see other way for accounting for absence well if will call clerk in will take down statement at once what do think harrington seems to that when have got four statement will be fully justified in withdrawing warrant against young wyatt quite think so colonel see fact will come out at coroner inquest when do so think there will be good deal of strong feeling in place if be found that young wyatt have be killed while bravely trying to capture faulkner murderer while at same time warrant for apprehension for murder be still in force yes there be good deal in harrington if faulkner have not died think that must have be best merely to hold warrant over in order that when wyatt come back if ever doe come back fact might be proved publicly now that will be done before coroner statement of mr henderson two constable be taken down frank be then called in congratulate most heartily upon innocence of brother having be to mind so conclusively proved a mr henderson tell chiefly owing to shrewdness in matter before begin can repeat opinion about bullet that pointed out to chief constable last night in order that point may be included in statement after that can tell story of search in wood when frank have finished colonel chamber said be very awkward thing about brother disappearance while giving fullest credit for courage in following desperate man armed with rifle be certainly rash undertaking fear that may have come to harm suppose when started that be so much idea of capturing man julian have in mind a of seeing who be have brother come back with only statement that man unknown have shot mr faulkner story might not have be credited certainly in teeth of mr faulkner deposition must not have be believed when there be evidence to support still suppose have even entered julian mind that suspicion must possibly fall upon be greatly afraid that have be killed badly hurt if not can see one possible way of accounting for absence mr faulkner be extremely active in pursuit of smuggler have know received many threatening letter if man be smuggler a seems to likely may have gone to place where have comrade awaiting julian pursuing may have be seized made prisoner see sir knew many of after affair other day be probably regarded a friend may hold in keeping only until man who fired shot can get safely out of reach hope that may prove so indeed magistrate said be at rate possible now will detain no longer for mr henderson told that be going to accompany in search among hill see that be just beginning to snow will fear add to difficulty for day active search be maintained trace be discovered of julian wyatt of man whom have followed from inquiry have be instituted in town chief constable have learned that man markham who have few week before returned after serving out sentence for poaching in mr faulkner preserve have disappeared from lodging on day of murder have not returned a be known to have uttered many threat against magistrate warrant be issued for arrest on day after coroner jury having heard whole of evidence brought in verdict mr faulkner have be wilfully murdered by person person unknown chapter vi commission about week after coroner inquest servant one evening brought in letter have be left at door by man who looked like fisherman frank gave shout of joy a glanced at address be julian handwriting aunt shouted then exclaimed a mr troutbeck who be on sofa gave low cry fell back fainting what as be to blurt out like then rang bell with vigour brought down rope here mary exclaimed a servant re appeared at door with scared face aunt have fainted do what can for will run round for doctor directly must look at letter first be from mr julian lor sir be good news girl exclaimed a hurried across to mistress after custom of class have hitherto looked upon matter in darkest possible light have joined in general conviction that julian have be killed julian letter be written on board smuggler dear frank be afraid must have be in horrible fright about wonder be most unfortunate fellow seem to be always putting foot in yet really think be to blame about in first place may tell be on board french smuggler that have just entered loire that in few hour will be at nantes smuggler will bring letter back to england a say will probably sail again few day after get in hope will not be very long before come to hand now a to how got here julian then related story of quarrel with mr faulkner of hearing gun fired of running in finding body of pursuit of murderer after long tramp on hill took to place of hiding be bound by oath to afford clue a to where place be can only say that upon following in be pounced upon by french smuggler who be there with trussed up like fowl then there be discussion what to do with in man have be following joined of course did not understand language must see that smuggler be in favour of cutting throat for having discovered hiding place that man be contrary to what must have expected arguing in favour have be smuggler a well a poacher although have murdered mr faulkner knew that have pursued for crime undoubtedly saved life first made take oath not to reveal hiding place then said that must carry over to france must take step so that must not return to england for year what step will be can not say feel sure that will in way prevent coming back for long time ca keep may hand over a prisoner to french authority before sailed man told have learnt that warrant be out against for murder of faulkner that faulkner have declared be who shot if must possibly have escaped must have come back to stand trial though can see plainly enough that might go very hard with for there must be only word must go for nothing against faulkner accusation fact of quarrel however must have come rather than disappear with awful charge against man have given permission not only to write tell story even to give name be joseph markham have only be short time out of prison where have be sent for poaching killed faulkner simply for revenge told that did not mind getting name a in first place have idea of returning to weymouth intended making france home in second place because although might believe story one else must even if showed in weymouth letter written by man accused of murder must not be accepted for moment against however there be doubt that fellow have behaved extremely well to must be sorry to get into trouble over business with faulkner be affair of mine can of course show letter to whom like expect anyone except aunt to believe have hope of being cleared day for markham have promised to write out full confession of shooting faulkner to swear to before french magistrate be going to write in duplicate carry one copy about with directed to colonel chamber senior magistrate at weymouth to send other copy to someone at home who will produce in case of death in france by drowning at sea think that if get away will return to england until hear of death be awfully sorry for old fellow for aunt with frightful accusation hanging over think position must be better if be to come back be hung for murder see that case be so strong against that must almost certainly come to if laid hand on be specially sorry that trouble must come upon now just a be going to try to get commission for of course must hardly give one to fellow whose brother be accused of murder if did position in army must be intolerable now good bye dear old frank give fond love to aunt who have always be too good to if get opportunity will write again hardly fancy that will get chance to do so a even if be free to write see how letter can be sent from france except through smuggler god bless old fellow unfortunate brother julian happily by time have finished reading letter servant have succeeded in restoring mr troutbeck be exactly what thought aunt julian be seized by smuggler have be taken over to france be afraid will be time before get back again especially a belief that charge be hanging over wo read letter now to morrow when be strong enough will read must take first thing in morning to colonel chamber who will be sure be very glad to hear that julian be safe for know that think be shot by man pursued will be interested too so will mr henderson at seeing how exactly be right in conclusion arrived at mr troutbeck be quite satisfied with explanation be at once taken up to bed by servant while frank seeing that be a yet eight put on cap ran to mr henderson latter be at home received with great pleasure news that julian be alive read letter through attentively if have seen whole thing happen must not have be closer than be in conclusion a to how came about well news that be markham who shot mr faulkner doe not surprise for a know have already warrant out against on charge fear that there be little chance that will lay hand on now for will doubtless learn from of associate here of evidence given at coroner inquest that brother have be proved altogether innocent of crime can understand believing a did evidence against mr wyatt to be overwhelming have great objection to giving name for a matter then stood brother story must only have be regarded a attempt of guilty man to fix blame of crime on a have turned out letter be piece of important evidence might be produced against markham for statement in tally with fact have discovered for ourselves still congratulate most heartily certainly thought that brother have be murdered though effort to find trace of crime have failed altogether be afraid a say will be long time before manages to get away still be comparatively unimportant matter can hope be that fellow markham will come to speedy end of course will show letter to everyone for now that nobody belief for moment that brother be mr faulkner murderer everyone will be glad to hear that mystery be cleared up that be simply in france instead of being a supposed buried in hole where body must never be discovered can possibly be said against now be that behaved rashly in following desperate man instead of coming back to for assistance quite see that under circumstance of relation with magistrate be doubly anxious to bring latter murderer to justice a now know latter must certainly have got away unsuspected have brother not acted a did colonel chamber be equally pleased when frank called upon next morning begged after showing letter to friend to hand over to for safe keeping a in event of markham ever being arrested must be valuable if not a evidence a affording assistance to prosecution do think colonel chamber that will be able to keep julian away for long time if supposition be correct one intend to hand over to french authority a prisoner of war may be long time before hear of there be many town over france where english prisoner be confined must be practically impossible to find out where be to obtain release if did find out while two nation be at war there be very few exchange made chance of being among must be very small however lad thing might have be great deal worse tremendous war can not go on for ever brother be strong healthy seems to be from hear just sort of fellow who must take thing easily although lot of prisoner of war whether in england france can not be called pleasant one have fairer chance than most of going through unharmed experience may be of benefit to of course when matter first began made close enquiry in several quarter a to character habit need not say that heard nothing against there be sort of consensus of opinion that be pity that have not pursuit occupation a know mixed up to extent with smuggler spent evening frequently in billiard room altogether though there be nothing absolutely against be clear that be doing good have given up billiard table frank said promised that must not go there more be sure must be glad to hear lad still think that experience will do good rather than harm be kindly good tempered easy going young fellow little deficient perhaps in strength of will very generally liked with making of fine man about yet be likely from sheer easiness of temper disinclination to settle down to anything to drift with stream till ruined life be how read character from what have heard of that being so think complete break in life may ultimately be of considerable benefit to perhaps will sir better brother never lived may have be too ready to fall in with other people view think that be very great pity that did not apply for commission in army great pity colonel chamber agreed young fellow who will start in pursuit of desperate man who be armed with gun must be sort of fellow to lead forlorn hope what be going to do frank be going to try get commission sir now that julian be completely cleared will set about at once be sixteen now colonel wilson with whom father served in spain wrote at death said that if of wished for commission must when time came use influence to get one that after father service be sure there must be difficulty about none colonel wyatt son have almost right to commission if will write to sir robert wilson at once let know when get reply will write to friend at horse guard get to back up request a soon a be sent in three week later frank received official document informing that have be gazetted to th light dragoon be to join depot of regiment at canterbury immediately mr troutbeck have be consulted by frank before wrote to colonel sir r wilson a have since julian decided not to enter army be settled thing that frank must apply for commission have offered objection be only right dear said with tear in eye little break in voice that one of dear brother son must follow in footstep know that always wished to join army a julian have fancy for be glad that must go of course will be trial great trial to young man must go on own path must be wrong indeed for old woman like to stand in way know aunt that be so that be only doubt about applying for commission ca help thinking that be duty to stay with until julian come back not at frank must make much more unhappy seeing wasting life here than in knowing be following course have marked for will do very well mary be very good attentive girl will get in to do most of work so that can sit with be sort of companion then know there be very few afternoon one other of friend come in for hour for gossip go in to take good deal of blame to myself for trouble have come to julian think that if three year ago have pressed upon that ought to go into army must have done so certainly anything that did say be rather other way since have gone see how wrong be certainly wo repeat mistake with even now julian may come back long before go mean before go away from here before go out to join regiment wherever may be be sure to be few month at depot know have agreed to write letter to julian telling that matter be cleared up that everyone know have nothing to do with murder so of course will try to escape a soon a get one of yes when get one aunt will give letter to men who be know connected with smuggler possibly may be taken over be very different thing from getting may be sure that smuggler who have taken julian over will not trouble about detaining must never go to bother of keeping watching for year if keep at will be on board craft must be constant trouble must know sooner later must be able to make escape if have handed over to french authority may have be taken to prison hundred of mile from nantes smuggler must not know where be must be unable to send letter to aunt feel confident that julian will come home be afraid that will be long time first for a to escaping from prison there be chance whatever of there be number of english officer there many of must be able to speak french well naval officer be able to climb rope thing of sort that julian must not do be very rare indeed that of even with advantage make escape therefore can not hope that julian will be able to do so well then dear must wait patiently until doe only hope may be spared to see back again be sure hope so aunt why must always call old woman when know that be not old in year why said last birthday that be fifty nine be only because be such hand at staying indoors live quiet life that make think old must think war wo last very much longer if doe men in europe will be used up of course a soon a peace be made julian will be sent home again same day that post brought news of commission brought letter from colonel wilson saying that be at present in town giving warm invitation to come up stay with for week while procured necessary outfit fortnight later frank arrived in town drove to buckingham street where colonel wilson be lodging received frank very kindly when lad must have renewed thanks have expressed in letter have written on receiving news of having obtained commission colonel said be duty a well a pleasure father saved life at aboukir have be unhorsed be guarding a well a must against four french cuirassier who be slashing away at when father rode into middle of cut one down wounded second gave time to snatch pistol from holster of fallen horse to dispose of third when other rode off father got severe sabre wound on arm slash across face of course remember scar so see least must do be to render son service in power managed to get gazetted to old regiment be to say first regiment for have served in several thought in first place introduction must to extent put at home there in second cavalry man have advantage over one in marching regiment that learns to ride well be more eligible for staff appointment a know have done great deal of what call detached service be probable may in future have similar appointment if so may have opportunity of taking with a aide sort of appointment be very useful not only take one out of routine of garrison life enable one to see world bring young officer name prominently forward give chance of distinguishing therefore a old cavalry man must much prefer taking assistant from same branch indeed must almost be expected to do so from what hear think that apart from friendship for father be kind of young fellow must like with frank looked rather surprised have letter colonel wilson went on from colonel chamber who be captain in th when joined spoke in very high term of sent copy of proceeding report connected with murder of magistrate said that be almost entirely due to sharpness that brother be cleared of suspicion have not unreasonably fallen upon saddle put upon right horse there be sort of idea that dashing young fellow will do for cavalry doubt dash be one of prime requisite for cavalry officer if be really to distinguish be something more than brave swordsman more especially if be likely to have opportunity of obtaining staff appointment need other quality for on reconnaissance man who have quick eye good power of observation thoughtfulness may send in report of most valuable kind while of average young officer might be absolutely useless having said much must advise strongly to devote couple of hour day regularly to study of french german may find invaluable especially if be engaged on diplomatic mission much more useful at first than study of writer on military tactic strategy there will be plenty of time for afterwards at canterbury will have difficulty in finding master among many french emigre a there be at present two three troop of one of german hussar regiment there of men belong to family who preferred exile service in rank to living under french domination may find soldier who will be glad enough to add to pay by little teaching draft went out only fortnight so since to regiment be therefore likely to be time at canterbury before be ordered out a time in garrison town hang heavily on hand little steady work will help to make pas not unpleasantly will certainly do so sir have french master at school be not compulsory to learn language thought might be useful if went into army so took up say that can speak well at know enough to help good deal be right lad ah here be supper be sure must want after being eighteen hour on outside of coach in such weather a though daresay a far a food went did not do badly sir there be plenty of time at stopping place for meal a be well wrapped up cold be nothing frank however must not deny that felt very stiff after journey be not sorry to retire to bed a soon a have eaten supper there be few men in army who have seen so much such varied service a colonel sir robert wilson joining army in served through campaign of flanders holland in having attained rank of captain be detached from regiment served on major general st john staff during rebellion in ireland two year later rejoined regiment proceeded to helder be engaged in battle took place during campaign on convention being signed purchased majority in one of regiment of german hussar in service be then sent on mission to vienna having fulfilled went down through italy to malta where expected to find regiment formed part of general abercrombie command joined before landed in egypt served through campaign there then purchased lieutenant colonelcy exchanged into th light dragoon be with portion of regiment formed part of sir david baird division sailed first to brazil then to cape of good hope possession wrested from dutch on return to england be directed to proceed on staff of lord hutchinson to berlin on arrival at memel be despatched to russian headquarters a british commissioner continued with russian army during next two campaign on signature of treaty of tilsit returned to england made several journey to st petersburg with confidential despatch brought to england first news that czar have concluded alliance with napoleon be about to declare war against england in sir robert wilson be sent to portugal to raise portuguese legion acting independently a brigadier general rendered very valuable service until in legion be absorbed in portuguese army be now waiting for other employment colonel went out with frank after breakfast next morning ordered uniform equipment frank be well supplied with money for by term of father will of son who entered army be entitled to draw two hundred pound year to pay for outfit horse a allowance until came of age when must receive share of capital mr troutbeck have when said good bye to slipped pocket book with bank note for hundred pound into hand money be always useful frank said when protested that be amply supplied if must ever find that allowance be insufficient write to know that be not in least likely to be extravagant foolish see what scrape brother have got into without fault of own may also find in position where may want money if do write to at once after order have be given sir robert wilson took frank about london to see of sight at dinner asked many question a to study amusement way in day be generally spent after dining at sir robert club returned to lodging be very pleased frank said a lighted cigar with what have heard of with what see for now will speak to more freely than did before mind what say be strictly confidential government have obtained secret information point surely to fact that napoleon be meditating offensive war against russia be accumulating troop in germany poland out of proportion to operation have be carrying on against austria when war will break out be more than anyone can say when doe take place have lord wellesley promise that will go out there in same position held during last war be a british commissioner with russian army now lad in position will be entitled to take young officer with a assistant what if engaged on other service must be called aide de camp one can not be everywhere at once must often have to depend upon for information a to what be taking place at point where must not be present must too act a secretary may possibly be year before napoleon preparation be completed even in year must hardly be justified in choosing so young officer from old regiment unless have special qualification for post now for father sake frank because like feel sure that be just man require must like to take must not do so unless have special knowledge must urge a reason for applying for there be only one such qualification that know of namely that must be able to speak russian language when spoke to about learning french german did so on general principle not with view to for did not seem to that must possibly select to go with on service have since thought over have come to conclusion must do so if did understand russian be most difficult language although can now get on with fairly after stay out there thought at first must never make headway in must therefore be of use whatever for to attempt unless be ready to work very hard at to give up must say at least four hour day to study must be quite ready to do sir frank said earnestly thank indeed for kindness who must get to teach that must see about there be have doubt many russian pole in london who speak language well who have picked up enough english for purpose pole be marvellous linguist will go to morrow to headquarters of bow street runner be detective know if can not at once put hand upon man a want will be able to ferret out dozen in twenty four hour one of fellow must engage to go down to canterbury take lodging there be almost always in destitute circumstance must be content with very moderate pay must not draw very heavily on resource thirty shilling week must be fortune to one of even if war must not come off have doubt about language might in future be of great value to suppose there be single officer in english army with exception of myself who know word of russian in future might secure position of military attache to embassy there at rate will render easy for to secure appointment on mission when come off in case will be witness of one of most stupendous struggle have ever taken place think can really stick to frank will have doubt to put up with good deal of chaff from comrade on studious taste sha' mind that sir have often be chaffed at school because used to insist on getting up work before must join anything be going on used to find that if took good temperedly soon ceased next day went to bow street sir robert card be sufficient to ensure attention several of detective be questioned one of replied think that know just man occupies attic in house next to mine be young fellow of four twenty know have be trying to support by giving lesson in german think that have ever have pupil believe be nearly starving landlady told that have parted with clothes except that stand upright in of late have be picking up few penny by carrying luggage for people who land at wharf have not spoken to tell that be perfect gentleman though sometimes a belief have not so much a crust of bread between lip day regularly pay rent of saturday must think that must be just man for must see when go home afternoon ask to come to buckingham street evening at nine at same hour to morrow morning have written address on card at nine o'clock evening landlady came upstairs said rather doubtfully that young man have called to see sir robert that have one of sir robert card be right mr richards be expecting pole be brought up be pale young man dressed in thin suit of clothes accorded ill with sharp frost outside bowed respectfully said in very fair english be told sir that wish to speak to take seat sir by way know name strelinski man said be told that be desirous of giving lesson in language be sir most desirous mr wyatt gentleman here be anxious to learn russian man looked with surprise at frank must be glad to teach sir said doubtfully russian be not like french english be very difficult language to learn one must require good deal of study must not like to take money without doing something in return fear that gentleman must be disappointed at small progress must make mr wyatt have just obtained commission think that a there be few if officer in army who speak fluently might be of great advantage to be therefore prepared to work hard at went on in russian speak little a see have already warned of difficulty of language be not dismayed be going down to canterbury to join depot of regiment in course of few day proposes that must accompany take lodging there young man face have look of surprise when be addressed in russian language frank saw faint flush come across face tear flow to eye a heard offer what term must ask might require service for year term must keep from starving man said may ask what be in own country mr strelinski be educated for law pole said took degree at university of warsaw be suspected of having leaning towards french a who have not when napoleon have promised to deliver from slavery have to fly have intended at first to enter one of polish regiment in french service must not get across frontier have to make north getting here in english ship war between france prevented crossing sea again then resolved to earn living here stopped have found hard work can quite understand mr strelinski be terribly hard for foreigner even with good introduction to earn living here to one unprovided with such recommendation well nigh impossible please to sit here for moment frank come into next room with well what do think asked when be alone must think that will do splendidly sir being gentleman will make very pleasant for must not like to offer a little a thirty shilling week have doubt that must be delighted with frank a will have to pay lodging out of furnish wardrobe might say two pound if can afford can afford very well sir aunt gave hundred pound when came away from home will pay for for one year be sure will like impress very favourably too sir robert said perhaps may find post for here if go out though need not think of at present well let go in to again have doubt that poor fellow be on thorn have talked over with mr wyatt went on when have returned to sitting room will probably require service for year though possibly may have to join regiment sooner than that be willing to pay two pound week for service a instructor will suit be more than sufficient pole said in broken voice for half of must keep yes there will be lodging to pay other matter if be willing to accept two pound appears to fair rate of remuneration will consider that a settled be cold night mr strelinski have better take glass of wine biscuit before venture out fetched decanter of port tin of biscuit from sideboard placed in front of then made sign to frank to leave room in few minute called back again frank found pole standing with hat in hand ready to leave there be look of brightness hope in face be strong contrast to expression on entering bowed deeply to sir robert took hand frank held out to have saved said then without word turned left room have insisted upon taking ten pound on account of salary a told that must have warm clothes make decent figure in canterbury be to deduct ten shilling week from pay till be made up poor fellow fairly broke down when offered to there be doubt that be almost starved be a weak a rat be to come to morrow at twelve o'clock have business will take out day so can have quiet chat with break ice chapter vii french prison julian wyatt have expected that there must be formality on arrival at nantes that must probably be taken before court of sort determined to make protest to declare that have be forcibly brought over from england at same time felt that to do so must make little difference in position when holland be overrun with french english resident be thrown into prison same thing have happened after short peace still determined to make effort for thought that a civilian might not be placed in military prison might therefore have better chance of making escape have however opportunity for protest remonstrance captain of lugger two of men went ashore a soon a craft be moored alongside quay quarter of hour later returned with sergeant two soldier captain pointed out to sergeant latter crossed plank on to deck put hand on julian shoulder motioned to to follow ashore good bye young fellow markham said a feeling uselessness of protest resistance julian moved towards plank be very sorry for there be nothing else to do will be a well there a anywhere for must show face in

have brought one of cruiser up have such luck so here be suppose lad have got anything to pay footing with did not leave sou in pocket suppose smuggler be much more generous to yes be julian said have guinea odd silver will keep odd silver for present for may come in handy later on here be guinea if there be mean of getting anything with order what like there be shout of satisfaction followed by animated debate a to how money must be spent julian learnt that there be difficulty in obtaining liquor in prison a one of warder have permission to sell in quantity not exceeding one glass for charge be four sou also that prisoner with money must send out for food after much discussion be finally settled that forty five pint of soup same number of ration of rum must be obtained soup be three sou pint must leave enough for tot of grog round next day one of who have be first mate on board for julian found that only master have separate treatment a officer went across to man who supplied liquor warder soon returned with carrying four bottle large stone jar of water two three small tin cup mate who spoke french pretty fluently have sharp argument with a to amount in french money that must receive a change out of guinea a have learnt from one of last batch have be sent away proper rate of exchange in town finally got best of work of serving out liquor then began few of sailor tossed off allowance without water most of took half half so a to make go further undoubtedly if warder must have sold more than one allowance to man whole of guinea must at once have be laid out be firm on point soon afterwards prisoner dinner be brought in consisted of slice of black bread to man basin of very thin broth julian be not surprised at hungry look that have noticed on men face pretty poor fare be mate one of said a observed air of disfavour with julian regarded ration have be matter of deep calculation with french fellow a to how little must do just to keep man alive reckon have got to nicety be what have three time day know whether one be most hungry when one turn in at night when one turn out in morning however will be better off to night get supper at six at eight will get in stuff paid for be precious deal better than can tell for one of chum managed to hide two three shilling when searched got in be good mistake give slice of bread with pint be better bread than black stuff give in prison though english dog must turn up nose at still help to fill up second supper be voted great success after be eaten men cheered by warmth freed for time from annoying feeling of hunger generally experienced became quite merry several song be sung at conclusion of grand chorus armed warder came in ordered to be silent if governor hears making that row said will have one of meal cut off to morrow threat be effectual men lay down in straw a close a must get to other for warmth a by mean thin rug have served out to sufficed to spread over two body covering be thus doubled julian have really guinea besides silver in pocket have thought better to make mention of a in case of ever being able to make escape must be of vital service to following day there be council over ten franc still remaining few must have spent in allowance of rum round finally by almost unanimous vote be determined that fifteen clay pipe must be obtained rest laid out in tobacco forty five be solemnly divided into three watch member of watch be to have pipe be to be filled with tobacco must smoke fast slow a chose if liked must use tobacco for chewing at end of hour pipe be to be handed over to next watch so on in regular order until evening plan be carried out afforded unbounded satisfaction many loudly regretted that have not be thought of at first a money spent on grog must have largely extended time tobacco must hold out so jealous did men become of store of tobacco that mate be requested to fill pipe a of men in helping rammed pipe so closely that held double proper allowance of tobacco treat at once established julian a popular character upon lamenting when talking to mate inability to speak french latter offered to teach a much a must directly began three four of younger sailor asked to be allowed to listen school be established in one corner of room for several hour day work went on master pupil finding that greatly shortened long weary hour of idleness three week passed without change then be told that next morning must be marched away to make room for batch of prisoner have be brought into fort afternoon be glad of change first because be change next because agreed must not be worse off anywhere than be at nantes be mustered at daybreak formed up in four with guard of twenty soldier with loaded musket marched out from prison gate first day journey be long one keeping along north bank of loire marched to anger did not reach until night be falling many of men wholly unaccustomed to walking be completely worn out before reached destination a whole with exception of being somewhat footsore arrived in fair condition julian marched by side of first mate lesson in french be long one whiled away hour on road must not be difficult for if be to pas word down to fall suddenly on guard overpower mate said in one of pause of talk few of might be shot a soon a have knocked of over got arm must easily make end of rest difficulty must be what to do afterwards be difficulty there be getting over julian said with exception of yourself there be not one who speaks french well speak well mate said know enough to get on with first person addressed must see at once be foreigner must be in same boat very bad boat must be must be hunted down in course of twenty four hour expect must be shot twelve hour afterwards think that instead of sending twenty men with might safely have sent only two for must be simply madness to try to escape if one alone must manage to slip off there must be chance for there be doubt that breton be bitterly opposed to present state of thing have not forgotten how suffered in rising early in day of republic must probably conceal runaway might pas along through wood to st malo one of other seaport thence passage across might be obtained in smuggler must be hazardous job too hazardous for to care to undertake even if got chance to slip away julian said be right mate nothing short of big reward must tempt of smuggler to run risk of carrying escaped prisoner out of country a have not penny in pocket nothing to draw on at home for there be only pay due up to date be captured when be only eight day out must not have slightest chance of getting away will take come expect be in for to end of war though when will be be more than man can tell be marched into prison at anger where be provided with much more bountiful meal than have be accustomed to good allowance of straw two blanket to great satisfaction be not called at daybreak on questioning one of warder who brought in breakfast first mate learnt after march to anger be customary to allow day rest to prisoner going through be ready for start on following morning stopped for night at la fleche next march be long one to vendome at place again halted for day stopping for night at beaugency marched to orleans where be large prison here remained for week guard who have accompanied from nantes left here at orleans returned by water from orleans struck more to north after ten day marching arrived at verdun be learned final destination here there be fully thousand english prisoner for most part sailor greater portion of be lodged in wooden hut erected in great courtyard surrounded by high wall food be coarse be much more abundant than have be at nantes newly arrived party be quartered together in one of hut night day sentry be posted on wall along wooden platform three foot from top permitted to pas freely on sentry box be erected at short interval a soon a escort have left newcomer be surrounded by sailor eager to learn last news from england how war be going on what prospect there be of peace a soon a curiosity be satisfied crowd speedily dispersed julian be struck with air of listless indifference prevailed among prisoner be not long before quite understood cut off from news without hope of escape exchange be difficult for even most light hearted to retain spirit a sailor men be somewhat better able to support dull hopelessness of life than others must have be most of be handy in way other a be permitted by authority to make anything must passed much of time in working at something other cut out rigged model ship others knitted made quilt from patch purchased for trifle by warder for in town made fancy box of straw others carved walking stick paper cutter other trifle day two three of number have permission to go down into town to sell own comrade manufacture to buy material there be fair sale for most of article for be bought not only by townspeople by pedlar who carried through country price obtained be small afforded profit over money laid out in material sufficient to purchase tobacco other little luxury introduction of spirit into prison being however strictly forbidden of more importance than money earned be relief to tedium of life in work julian found similar relief in studying french there be among prisoner who spoke language far better than did mate after three month work with latter julian be advised by to obtain better teacher found difficulty in getting one who spoke french really well to talk with three four hour day on condition of being supplied with tobacco during time a tobacco be very cheap must be always bought from soldier julian store of money be not much diminished by outlay have now regularly taken to smoking not at first because liked because saw how much cheered comforted comrade who however generally used in sailor fashion of chewing escape be never talked of watch kept be extremely strict a on getting outside of wall of courtyard must find in town girt in by wall fortification risk be altogether too great to be encountered have be attempted many time in great majority of case fugitive have be shot body have always be brought back to prison in order to impress others with uselessness of attempt very few indeed have got away at least be supposed that have done so a body have not be brought back be generally considered that chance be enormously against being able to make way over wide extent of country between verdun sea then to succeed in obtaining passage to neutral port from must make way to england several time offer of freedom be made to such of prisoner a volunteered to enter french army navy very few availed of at end of ten month julian be able to speak french fluently large body of troop be continually marching through town bound for east prisoner learned from guard that general belief be that napoleon intended to invade russia have good mind to enlist julian said one day to friend mate of course nothing must persuade to do so if be question of fighting against english now have learnt french fairly begin to find life horrible be longing intensely to be doing something there be reason have already told of why even if be free must not go home might a well be taking part in campaign a staying in prison besides must have infinitely better chance of escape a soldier than have here if find like can at least try to get off well placed a be wyatt know must not be inclined to do same at rate must be seeing something of life instead of living like caged monkey here of course a say one must dream of such thing if one must have to go to spain to fight fellow there still if by chance after russian business regiment be ordered back to france then to spain must at rate have fair chance of escaping on journey must not do because have wife at home one hope slight a chance seems to be that day there will be general exchange of prisoner a ca go home know that must be good plan for to do what propose at rate life a soldier must be thousand time better than dog existence must put up with for be awful seeing many of men walking about with head down never speaking for hour picture of hopeless melancholy see how die off not from hunger fever for have enough to eat wasting away dying from home sickness because have nothing to live for why of forty five of who came up together ten have gone already there be three four others who wo last long be downright heartbreaking now have longer anything to keep thought employed good part of day begin to feel catch saying what be use of must be better make bolt have done with can quite understand feeling of man who be shot last week ran straight out of gate have thought of escape simply did to be shot down by sentry instead of cutting own throat believe must stand much longer jim even if be certain of being killed by russian ball think must go go then lad man said have always thought that have borne up very well know be even worse for than be for sailor be accustomed to be cooped up for six month at time on board ship without news from outside with nothing to do save to see that deck be washed brass polished except when there be shift of wind gale to anyone like can understand that must be terrible if feel getting into state must say go by mean will give letter before enlist jim will get when be exchanged to go down with to weymouth tell became of why went into french army let think that turned traitor must shoot rather than run risk of having to fight englishman when be choice between fighting russian going out of mind prefer shouldering french musket will write letter to day there be saying when may next call for volunteer for a know who step forward be taken away at once so a to prevent being persuaded by others into drawing back next day julian wrote letter recapitulated argument have used to mate bade frank aunt final farewell may of course get through campaign said french soldier here seem to think that will sweep russian before be way talked of sweeping out of peninsula have done yet there be doubt that russian be good soldier will make big fight of hope wo feel cut up about really care little whether leave bone in russia not may be twenty year even longer before fellow markham letter arrives to clear until then can not return to england at rate to weymouth indeed wherever be must live with knowledge might at moment be recognized arrested therefore while others here have hope of return home by exchange of prisoner by war coming to end have nothing to look forward to so see old fellow that be a well a be have to earn own living somehow way will suit better than most only of one thing be sure that if at end of russian war return alive regiment be sent where there be chance of fighting people will take opportunity of deserting a have told can speak french fairly well now after few month in french regiment will be able to pas a native must have good chance of making way somehow through country to frontier idea at present be must make for genoa ship there a sailor on board italian vessel better still if happen to be master of place fleet near must enlist in one of regiment ship on board one of men of war must of course take name merely say have be captured by french at sea have be prisoner at verdun have managed to get free make way across country probably in case will do when regiment return from russia two three year absence fair share of hardship of soldier life disguise might enable without detection to travel down to weymouth see aunt learn if there have be news from markham whether will find there not ca tell have little hope that will be able to get commission affair of mine will be fear absolute bar to wherever may be will do best to find out after have seen aunt will be given by good fellow named jim thompson have be first mate have be good friend to ever since have be over here if be exchanged will bring to if not will give to one of men who be exchanged to post on arrival in england will direct to aunt so that if be away from weymouth will open god bless three day later notice be posted in prison saying that of prisoner who chose to volunteer for service in germany be at liberty to do so must not be called upon at future time for service against british troop must have liberty to exchange into regiment destined for other service eight men including julian came forward when hour later french officer entered called for volunteer julian have already announced intention of doing so to comrade in hut to other acquaintance see said will not be called upon for service against english must rather fight russian than stay in place for year hitherto men who have volunteered have be hooted by fellow prisoner a went out promise that must not be called upon for service against british troop made great difference in feeling with offer be regarded have not be for hope that everyone felt that must ere long be exchanged number who stepped forward must have be greatly increased strong french division have marched into verdun that morning new volunteer be divided among different corp julian who now stood over six foot be told off to grenadier regiment uniform be at once given to from carried with baggage of regiment sergeant of company in have be placed took to barrack room comrade said here be new recruit be englishman who have good sense to prefer fighting russian to rotting in prison be brave fellow speaks language well think will find good comrade have handed over twenty franc to pay footing in company must not regard a traitor to country friend for have received from colonel paper authorizing to exchange into regiment destined for other service in case after have done with russian must be sent to place where must have to fight against countryman in hour julian felt at home with new comrade differed greatly in age among have grown grizzly in service have fought in war of republic empire others be lad not older than taken month two before from plough after have drunk liquor purchased with twenty franc patted on back drank to health of jules wyatt for julian have entered under own surname christian name be at once converted to french equivalent with usual knack of making friend be soon on excellent term with joined in chorus sang english song whose word have a exercise translated into french when men lay down for night on straw pallet be generally agreed that new comrade be fine fellow acquisition to company division be to halt for two day at verdun time be spent a far a julian be concerned in hand of sergeant who kept hard at work day acquiring element of drill on third morning regiment marched off at daybreak julian taking place in rank with knapsack firelock after long confinement in prison found life thoroughly enjoyable sometimes stopped in town where be either quartered in barrack billeted on inhabitant sometimes slept under canvas in open air julian preferred a built great fire gathered round in merry group conscript have by time got over home sickness have caught martial enthusiasm of older comrade believed that grande armee must be invincible fear be even expressed that russian must not venture to stand against of older men however assured that there be little chance of russian be hardy fighter comrade one of veteran said parbleu who tell have fought against be not to be despised be slow at manuoevring put in place tell to hold will do to last fought at austerlitz against austrian at jena against prussian in score of other battle in germany italy tell that russian be toughest enemy have met save only islander jules be at talavera way people held that hill after cowardly spaniard have bolted left at last rolled down be thing want to see again be wounded sent home to be patched up be how come to be here marching against russia instead of being under soult in spain comrade take word for big a army will be will have tough fighting to do before get to moscow st petersburg whichever little corporal intends to dictate term in be a say victor one of other veteran said be better must be too bad if have to march right across europe back without firing shot who know russian too feel sure that will never be many merry martial song be sung at bivouac fire many story of campaign battle told thought of failure entered mind of anyone from oldest veteran to youngest drummer boy of evening after halting julian generally have hour drill until three week after leaving verdun be pronounced fit to take part in review under eye of emperor readiness to oblige even to undertaking sentry duty for comrade who have grown footsore on march be suffering from temporary ailment cheeriness good temper have by time rendered general favourite in company when be dismissed from drill veteran be always ready to give lesson with sabre rapier in addition to received from maitre d'armes of regiment julian entered into exercise with great earnestness quarrel between men be not infrequent be always settled by sabre straight sword officer permission being necessary before duel took place be seldom that consequence be very serious maitre d'armes be always present put stop to fight a soon a blood be drawn at present julian be on best term with comrade felt that if must become involved in quarrel of men must be ready to vindicate honour to show englishman a be be not whit behind comrade in readiness to prove courage thus then worked with ardour ere long became able to hold own even with veteran of regiment chapter viii pistol practice be rum fellow wyatt one of captain of depot of regiment said to frank fortnight after joined how be rum why about russian fellow never heard of young cornet setting to to work like nigger when there be occasion in world for to do so there be absolute occasion perhaps see russian may be very useful day well yes so might other out of way language be off chance doubt still be better to be doing something may turn out useful than to be walking up down high street playing billiards spend much time over now for there be good deal to do in learning one work when once get out of hand of drill sergeant riding master will have lot of time to myself will be very glad to occupy of in getting up russian of course be own business not mine wyatt be afraid wo find thing very pleasant if take line of own go with rest have wish not to go with rest frank protested when there be anything to be done whether be hunting sort of sport will certainly take share in think captain lister that be much better for fellow to spend part of time reasonably than in lounging about in playing billiards card say that be better wyatt be hardly question many thing may be better than others if fellow doe go with run get disliked have very hard time of used to hear good deal of same thing when be at school frank said quietly think be disliked for sticking to work sometimes when other fellow be playing surely when one be from morning till night with other men can matter to one if give two three hour day to work doe not matter to anyone wyatt be quite willing to grant for be afraid if stick to will have to put up with great deal of chaff not always of good natured kind can put up with amount of chaff frank replied mean chaff in proper sense anything go beyond will hope be able to meet a deserves perhaps must be better if be to take hour day off russian study to spend time in pistol gallery captain lister looked at earnestly think will do youngster said approvingly be right spirit there be lot of rough fun larking in regiment man go through best be who can take joke good temperedly a long a doe not go beyond bound of moderation who be ready to resent wilful insult think must be very wise to do a say hour in pistol gallery day be likely to be of vastly more use to than amount of russian reputation that man be crack shot with pistol will do more than anything in world to keep out of quarrel here at depot at rate where fellow be for most part young must certainly save good deal of annoyance if be known that although not by mean quarrelsome fellow be determined to put up with nothing beyond good humoured joke well lad want to interfere with hobby only advise not to ride too hard at rate at first when men know get to like see apart from fancy of yours be round good fellow a can see be will let go own way at rate a captain of troop will do can to make thing pleasant for forget about pistol practice at depot like where there be dozen regiment represented will meet with larger proportion of disagreeable men than must in own ante room see if colonel have such men be glad enough to rid regiment of by leaving at depot serious trouble be more likely to come from one of than from anyone in own regiment will take advice certainly frank said more so that time spent in learning to be good shot with pistol will be most useful in campaign even if there be occasion ever to put to test when at home there be gunsmith in st margaret street be small shop man woodall be name have got long shed that us a pistol gallery quarter of mile out beyond gate be admirable shot a well a excellent workman ca do better than go to tell that want to become good shot with pistol be willing to pay for lesson if take in hand wo be long before turn out a fair shot whether ever get beyond depends on nerve eye must think that have lack of hope not frank said with smile at rate will see afternoon put on cap at once will go down with captain lister said mind think if be must say nothing about at depot until tell that have done with knowing that man be learner might have just opposite effect of hearing that be crack shot in quarter of hour arrived at gunsmith woodall captain lister said friend mr wyatt who have lately joined have fancy for becoming first rate pistol shot must have more useful fancy captain lister idea be that cavalry man trooper a well a officer must be dead shot with pistol sword be very well say be not useful weapon regiment must shoot really shoot well must be match for three french regiment though be boney best want take in hand woodall if can spare time to do so of course be ready to pay for time trouble must meet at hour like to name in afternoon at shed right sir be rum thing to that while officer be ready to take pain to learn sword exercise seem to think that pistol shooting come by nature that even on horseback in middle of confusion of charge have only got to point pistol bring down man thing be downright ridiculous will be pleasure to teach mr wyatt must say from look be likely to turn out first rate shot wo be for want of trying if frank replied if will take advice sir will learn to shoot with hand for civilian who never want to use pistol except in duel right hand be be necessary for cavalry man left be useful hand see officer always carry sword in right hand if have got to shift to left before can use pistol must never use at if hard pressed in fight thing be that left side be weak side of horseman sword be right in defending if attacked on right if be attacked on left be fighting under big disadvantage have much more difficulty in guarding on side have nothing like same reach for striking a have on other be quite true now come to think of frank said though never gave thought before yes see that left hand be most useful one will practice with a well a with other well what hour will suit make much difference to sir evening be getting longer can see well enough until five well then will say half past four half past four will suit very well mr wyatt be four o'clock now so if like to take first lesson to day will meet at shed in hour can not miss place be on right side of road stand by there be name over door thank will be there frank replied may a well come with wyatt captain lister said will fire few shot for have have practice for last two year have fancy to see what can do with left hand have never tried with quite agree with woodall that be left hand that cavalry man must use frank be good deal surprised at first to see how much more difficult be to hit mark even at distance of twelve pace than imagined that must be woodall must not allow to take aim will never get chance to do mr wyatt in fight have got to whip out pistol to throw up arm fire have got to be done by instinct rather than by aim be very well to aim when be on foot standing perfectly steady on horse half mad with excitement perhaps going at gallop must no more hold arm steady on mark than must fly put down pistol for time now know sir when point at thing with first finger extended however quickly do will be there thereabout be same thing if have got pistol in hand see that black patch on wall to right of target now turn back to now when give word turn on heel moment eye catch patch throw up arm with forefinger extended point to when get up there hold a steady a can now sir frank did a be ordered now sir look along arm see be pointing very nearly at centre of patch be just little high now try with left there see be not quite so accurate time be six inch to left of patch nearly foot high remember that be always better to aim little low than little high for tendency of hand in act of pulling trigger be to raise muzzle now sir try dozen time using hand alternately very good now take empty pistol hold like that not one man in twenty ay not one in hundred hold pistol right always want to get first finger on trigger now want first finger to point with second finger be quite a good to pull with in fact better for going straight a doe with arm there be le tendency to throw up muzzle now take like see forefinger lie along in line of barrel be really important point get into way of always grasping pistol so that first finger be in exact line with barrel then see just a finger naturally follows eye point at spot so pistol must be in same line be best to have middle third finger on trigger little finger thumb alone grasping butt will find that little difficult at first will soon get accustomed to little finger will rapidly gain strength see hold of first finger along barrel help other two to steady by having middle third finger on trigger give pressure rather than pull to will soon come to give pressure at very moment when first finger get on mark aimed at now try dozen time with pistol unloaded after pressing trigger keep hand arm in a nearly same position so a to see if be pointing truly at mark very good now try with left hand there see hand be not so accustomed to work though might have hit target doubt if of shot must have struck inner circle now will try with pistol loaded six shot be fired alternately with right left hand of former be within few inch of bull eye while none of others went wide of outside very good indeed gunsmith said hesitate to say that in very short time will become fair shot at end of three month if practise regularly first class one hand be very steady eye true have plenty of nerve now sir must advise to keep unloaded pistol in drawer of table whenever have nothing else to do spend five minute in taking quick aim at mark on wall using hand alternately now captain lister will try few shot taking steady aim captain lister put bullet almost time into bull eye to frank surprise when came to try quick firing in way have done captain shooting be much le accurate than own be question of eye gunsmith said next day when frank be alone with see captain lister shooting be fair when took steady aim directly came to fire a must in action that without disturbing influence of excitement of motion of horse be nowhere did not even once hit target in firing with left hand must certainly have missed man must have got cut down moment later even with right hand shooting be very wild captain lister be evidently disconcerted at finding how useless target practice must be to in field two three time in next week went with frank to practise improved with right hand did not seem to obtain accuracy in firing with left while frank at end of month came to shoot a well with one hand a with other frank worked steadily at russian although found extremely difficult at first soon began to make progress under teacher who took greatest pain with soon got over good tempered chaff of subaltern of detachment who finding that be at other time always ready to join in anything going on be wholly unruffled by joke soon gave up agreed among that be queer fellow allowed to go own way without interference at end of three month be discharged from drill riding school have thenceforth great deal more time on hand be able to devote three hour of morning two of afternoon to russian be delighted with master whom came to esteem highly finding most intelligent companion a well a unwearied teacher strelinski indeed must have be glad to have devoted twelve hour day instead of five must frank have afforded time be very different man now to what be when have first called at sir robert wilson lodging looked well happy cheek have filled out carried well dressed with scrupulous care when frank have engagement with comrade pole accompanied on long ride on spare charger having be accustomed to riding from childhood from frank learned great deal of state of thing in poland russia gained considerable insight into european politics besides picking up more intimate colloquial knowledge of russian than gained at lesson of evening frank not unfrequently went to party in town gallant deed of troop in spain have raised military to great popularity throughout country house of principal inhabitant of canterbury be hospitably opened to officer of garrison many of young men preferred billiards card in mess room frank who declined to play billiards have not acquired sufficient skill at card to take hand at whist be very glad to accept invitation specially enjoyed going to house of clergy in precinct of cathedral most of be very musical frank who have never heard much music at weymouth enjoyed intensely old english glee madrigal catch performed with perfection at time must have be hard to meet with except in cathedral town after three month gunmaker no longer accompanied frank to shooting gallery must be robbing to go on with longer mr wyatt when man can turn round fire on instant hit penny nine time out of ten at distance of twelve pace there be one can teach anything more have best eye of gentleman ever came across in twenty year have be here have have hundred of officer at gallery many of considered crack shot must go on practising if be especially with left hand be not quite so good a right yet although very nearly so will come down once week so throw up ball to spin penny in air there be nothing like getting to hit moving object in meantime can go on practising at plummet swinging from string can do a well by a if be with for when once set going will keep on for five minute be not so good a throwing up penny because make regular curve shooting a do with back to so not able to tell where will be when turn round that so much matter what be best shooting ever heard of best shot ever heard tell of be major rathmines must hit penny thrown up into air nineteen time out of twenty well will go on practising until can do frank said if thing be worth doing be worth doing well will do mr wyatt there be nothing must not do with practice there be one thing wish must do for that figure have got painted a target be ridiculous wish must get one who have idea of painting to do figure want painted not standing square to sideways a man stand when fight duel want drawn with arm up just in same position that man must stand in firing hope will never be called upon to fight duel think be detestable practice unfortunately be so common that one can calculate on keeping out of especially in army well sir need not be afraid of fighting duel for fire so mighty quick that must be certain of getting in first shot if got first shot there must be end of yes must be simple murder more le people might call doubt whether accustomed a be to fire instantly moment catch sight of thing must help hitting man in head now what want to become accustomed to be to fire at hand must never forgive if killed man if ever did go out with notorious duellist who forced duel upon must like to stop shooting for rest of life so want to be able to hit hand to certainty of course hand be easy enough mark by getting accustomed to height exact position must be in must get to hit without fail very good idea sir hand be not much of mark when holding pistol still be good bit bigger than penny piece must soon get to hit just a certainly for next three month frank fired fifty shot day twenty five with hand at end of time must hit penny thrown up by woodall eighteen time out of twenty be good enough said now will only practise once week to keep hand in frank have not be without incentive to gain exceptional proficiency with pistol although got on very well with comrade of own depot there be captain of lancer regiment who have not unfrequently taxed patience to farthest limit man be noted duellist be known to be dead shot on strength of be in habit of making remark so offensive that must have at once be taken up if uttered by anyone else in barrack for last two month have made special butt of young cornet who have recently joined depot of dragoon be pleasant lad with plenty of spirit pluck have slight impediment in speech although when giving word of command never hesitated be defect be object of captain marwill ill natured remark lad tried to laugh off to ignore offensiveness of tone felt deeply confided to frank to whom have specially taken that must not stand much longer never used pistol in life until advised other day to take lesson from woodall of course must put bullet through head ca help that a be everyone must think coward for standing at rate can show be not that mind wilmington frank said one day make fool of put up with little longer something may occur to put stop to may go away on leave may get hint that have better retire from service have heard that be likely enough that will get hint next time have affair of sort last two be with civilian believe be reason why so few accept invitation to mess fancy if get into trouble again with one of will have to go well will try to go on little longer if say so wyatt there be 'buts ' in wilmington must give word of honour that will go on a have done be afraid of anyone thinking coward there be cowardice in refusing to fight man who be so much superior in skill that must be nothing short of suicide in standing up against have private reason for believing that wo last long in case will give word of honour frank week later there be unusually large party at mess depot be very strong forty officer sat down being guest night four five civilian be present dinner went on without incident until one of mess waiter asked wilmington whether must take sirloin of beef goose replied b b b b beef there happened to be slight lull in conversation at moment wilmington effort to get word out made raise voice so that be generally heard waiter captain marwill said loudly bring g g g g goose wilmington face flushed then turned deadly pale looked appealingly at frank who be sitting next to latter whispered remember word of honour get up leave room there be dead hush from present a young cornet rose left room then low murmur of indignation captain marwill looked round searchingly a if to pick out one of who have thus shown sign of resentment directly door closed upon wilmington frank rose to foot wish mr president said in clear steady voice to ask whether man who relying upon skill with pistol wantonly insult be not blackguard unfit for society of gentleman have thunderbolt fallen in room present must not have be more surprised of frank comrade knew that often went to woodall shooting gallery to practise with pistol have idea that have attained great skill in use impression when spoke be that must have gone out of mind thus publicly to insult latter be at least a much astonished a anyone else started a if struck with blow then leaning across table said in low voice to frank who be sitting just opposite to of course be prepared to answer to for mr wyatt certainly frank said carelessly at time please there be strange hush in dining room until cloth be removed guest under one excuse took departure almost immediately after king health have be drunk officer talked in low tone together very soon rose from table will act for captain lister frank said going up to quietly certainly lad be horrible business if have be merely ordinary quarrel colonel must have interfered to stop after what said before with stranger present too be afraid must go on must be mad lad have not seen shoot since first evening when went down two three time shortly afterwards woodall told that be getting on well however well may have got on can be match with pistol for man like marwill may be sure wo spare after so public affront must take chance frank said quietly have begged gunmaker to say little to anyone about shooting come across to quarter suppose will be sending over there at once have just taken seat when there be hurried knock on door wilmington came in pale agitated can not go on wyatt exclaimed put on word of honour then take up see that be hopelessly disgraced in letting be marwill victim for what said of will go to insist upon right to take matter up sit down minute wilmington be reasonable if get shot can if like go out get shot next day mean to get shot there be one broad distinction between ca shoot can marwill must kill without slightest risk to flatter that if chose to do so must kill with same certainty will not choose to do so want blood of man not even of ruffian like to rest upon head will simply prevent from ever fighting duel captain lister young cornet gazed at frank a if doubted sanity do quite know what be saying lad former said kindly after pause look a if have be taking anything before dinner know that be always abstemious at mess still be talking strangely daresay think so frank replied with smile fancy excitement of quarrel have little turned head have not done so in first place have learnt to be so quick in firing that be sure to get first shot yes might do lad captain lister said sadly must be very worst thing must do with hurried shot like that must be ten to one missed then must quietly shoot down not only will not miss frank replied will lay wager like will carry off trigger finger probably second third feel hand see be perfectly cool a cool a will be to morrow think there be anything wild about eye be simply a say be first rate shot probably a much better than marwill a be better than wilmington ah here be man please arrange for to morrow morning if possible sooner be over better captain lister nodded went out returned in quarter of hour be to come off to morrow said at six o'clock be to be in field outside wall on other side of town have told man to have dogcart ready at half past five did not take long to arrange matter second be rankin of regiment think liked job at began by saying ' be afraid captain lister that there be chance of arranging unhappy business nothing short of public apology acknowledgment mr wyatt be in liquor when uttered word will satisfy principal have great difficulty in bringing even to assent to ' said that have not most remote idea of making apology therefore have only to arrange preliminary of meeting be soon done must see that young fellow be very much cut up over affair that have undertaken to act for marwill because be afraid to refuse did not take five minute altogether looked in at doctor after separated to ask to go with 'it be none of aid be likely to want captain lister ' said 'and protest against whole affair be nothing short of cold blooded murder still of course will go now lad let hear something more about shooting be just a told captain lister suppose have unusually good eye steady hand have sort of natural aptitude for shooting woodall said that considered a good shot a man in country if not better be afraid must fire pistol here think must convince must fire in barrack at time of evening wyatt if be a good a that prospect be better than thought be what can do lad can hit penny spun up into air eighteen time out of twenty with right hand sixteen seventeen with left be that so well that ought to be good enough for anything lister said sound almost miraculous now let have look at pistol lad be right frank said be using afternoon cleaned when came back really mean to aim at hand frank nodded well of course if go little high little low will still have if go inch two wide may miss altogether must much rather lad that aimed at body fellow have never shown mercy to anyone there be reason why must show mercy to be afraid of missing frank spoke so confidently that hearer felt satisfied must at least have good foundation for faith in skill well think have better turn in now wyatt will come across have cup of coffee with before start thank will mind sending servant across to call at quarter to five be not at good at waking right lad think be likely to get much sleep say much to others when go out frank said can tell that from what say wo be such one sided affair a seem to think right will tell a much a for be in such state of mind about that must be kind to give little consolation by way captain lister do go out in uniform in mufti in mufti lad put on gray dark coloured suit gray be best above take coat with conspicuous button anything to catch eye must be fatal mistake good night lad will turn in in better spirit than expected to do wilmington did not speak grasped frank hand warmly come out to morrow frank said must lad replied in broken voice will see before start major will come on with doctor captain lister said a after taking coffee next morning went out to trap standing at door frank looked round barrack yard one be about sent away before came wyatt lad looked so woebegone that put to whether considered that sight of face be likely to improve nerve a to young wilmington be like ghost have almost to threaten to put under arrest before must persuade to go without seeing one will be there major told that considered duty to represent regiment quite approved of others staying away said fewer there be present at infamous business like better by way made condition with rankin that be to be placed back to back be to move until signal be given insisted that must be by pistol shot a otherwise must not see signal equally well said that be fairer than for to stand face to face must increase chance of affair not being fatal one thank lister be wondering whether have made that condition for if stood ready to fire might draw trigger before did thing might go quite differently to what have decided on bad marksman might hold fire marwill must rely so implicitly on skill that must be sure to try get first shot for if fired first missed must know that feeling against if shot down afterwards must be very strong now jump up lad will take rein right soldier servant standing at head of horse released hold of rein swung up behind a horse started drove out through barrack gate followed by eye of frank comrade who a soon a heard sound of wheel ran to window door to take a believed last look at have indeed obtained slight consolation from word with captain lister have sent off to quarter keep up spirit lad there be many slip between cup lip have strong hope that affair be not going to turn out a bad a fancy chapter ix duel captain lister be very much more nervous than principal a drove on to ground in spite of frank confidence must not bring to believe that young fellow must be match for practised duellist although have after have left frank room evening before gone into town knocked up gunmaker who have sometime before gone to bed when however captain lister confided to nature of errand fully confirmed what frank have said of course have not seen stand up before man with pistol in hand said a far a shooting go must back against man in england think captain lister that need be afraid of in matter of nerve pistol shooting depends upon two thing nerve eye must never be shot be if have not extraordinary amount of quality will wager that will be a cool a cucumber how be to stand back to back to turn at signal of pistol shot then be all right captain need not worry about be a quick a lightning will get first shot never fear more than must mind betting that carry off one of fellow finger why how do know captain lister asked in surprise ca have be here since left sir have not be here told that if ever got into duel must aim at opponent hand have be practising specially for that have target made on purpose did not please rigged out arm holding pistol fixed to target just in position must be if painted figure be firing at have to have rough sort of hand made of iron for must have cost fortune if have be made of anything else sometimes must have painted white sometimes gray sometimes black either of might be if man wore glove did not make difference to have seen hit twenty time following over over again have be very reassuring to captain lister if have not be for marwill reputation must have gone to place of meeting feeling confident that must go well fact that be frank first duel while marwill have be in eight ten affair prevented feeling otherwise than nervous a to result be first upon ground major doctor arriving two minute later may a well tell major captain lister that need not be alarmed be looking terribly anxious so be doctor captain lister nodded went up to a dismounted from gig fancy that be going to be right doctor said wyatt tell so what say be confirmed by woodall gunsmith seems lad be extraordinarily good shot told last night that have be practising good deal did not like to raise hope too high until have seen woodall will bet guinea wyatt come out of right must not bet on lister though must pay guinea with greater pleasure than ever felt at winning one hear that marwill be very quick shot so be wyatt major a young 'un have be practising regularly fancy will be a quick quicker than other well hope to heaven that may turn out so nothing must please more than wyatt must put ball into fellow head men like be curse to army think will put ball in head major will not be surprised if carry off one of finger have conscientious scruple about killing man be going to aim at hand major shook head be afraid that settle lister may do for good shot to try experiment of sort with bad one not against man like marwill must be far better for to aim at body be good big mark if be a good shot a say be quick enough to pull trigger first must make matter safe a to aiming at hand must be sheer madness tell what think of ah here come others a soon a captain marwill second alighted latter came forward spoke to captain lister talked for minute together then proceeded to choose ground be quickly done a there be tree being cloudy morning party must have advantage from light two case of pistol be then examined be of same calibre about same weight marwill second at once agreed to captain lister proposal that must fire with own pistol so that must be placed at disadvantage of using weapon that be unaccustomed to captain lister proposed that must toss of two second must fire signal rankin said must rather not do captain lister need hardly tell must give anything not to be here in present capacity must very much rather that third party must fire major surgeon lister went across to major who at once consented to give signal pistol be then loaded ground measured principal placed in position major took two pistol one loaded with other with powder only then placed ten pace on one side of line of fire now said gentleman will say 'be ready ' on receiving answer will fire mind be determined that if of make move to turn raise arm by a much a inch from side before hears shot will shoot down at once do understand that answered yes waited moment then said be ready then second later fired antagonist turned swiftly on heel arm going up a did so then two shot rang out seemed almost simultaneous captain lister whose eye be fixed on marwill saw that hand jerked in act of firing that ball must have flown high at same moment pistol fell to ground staggered back pace then with exclamation of fury caught right hand in left stood rocking in pain second surgeon ran up to be hit former said of course be hit said savagely suppose must have dropped pistol if have be believe that young villain have carried off one of finger must protest against language marwill lieutenant rankin said indignantly be bound to bear testimony that opponent have acted extremely well that conduct have be that of honourable gentleman at moment captain marwill turned deadly pale must have fallen have not rankin doctor caught lowered gradually to ground will do more shooting surgeon said grimly ball have carried off trigger finger cut coat sleeve off rankin see be bleeding great deal lister please bring bandage at once captain lister who have a soon a saw marwill pistol fall run up to frank grasped hand warmly saying thank heaven dear lad that have turned out a said must congratulate with heart at once ran to fetch bandage gathered round wounded man frank turning very white a saw lying insensible what be doctor aimed at hand hope have not done serious damage except there latter be too busy to answer bring tourniquet said to rankin a ran off looked up at major ball evidently struck first finger on knuckle went in between first middle finger then ran up wrist along arm have gone out a see above elbow cutting artery a went smashing bone just above elbow first thing be to stop bleeding illustration captain marwill pistol fell to ground staggered back pace took tourniquet from rankin applied two three inch above elbow continued to screw until rush of blood ceased then bandaged arm hand fastened across marwill chest be can do now said think there be doubt will have to amputate above elbow will take back first wish have stretcher have stretcher major said told off four men with one half hour before started thought must want to bring wyatt back put whistle to lip blew loudly minute later four trooper ran out from behind cottage hundred yard away have doubt be furtively observing combat for there be expression of gladness triumph on face a arrived lay captain marwill on stretcher surgeon said lift carefully carry to quarter will drive on at once get thing ready suppose mr rankin will go with have better cover up with rug have of brandy forgot to bring with have flask major replied will get for at once may a well be off wyatt captain lister said to frank be of use waiting here longer can do good be sorry be hurt so frank said a drove off then will be only man be captain lister replied have rid army of pest be to say have rendered harmless possibly may not retire there be plenty of men in service who have lost arm however must think will go disgrace will be worse to than wound still be heartily sorry that hurt so much frank repeated meant to take off one two of finger spoil shooting for rest of life never thought of ball going up arm a did well if have not hit where did must be lying on that stretcher now be close thing between two shot not more than fifth of second must say if have only hit in body have doubt that must have fired before fell if ever man meant to kill did must see in eye a stood there waiting for signal well wyatt can stop in army until get to be general one thing be morally certain that after affair one will venture to insult first duel be likely to be last sincerely trust so frank said gravely think can say that assuredly will never be first to insult anyone else that if ever fight again will a in case not be in own quarrel a drove along straight road towards barrack saw number of men clustered outside gate be on look out captain lister said will have heard from mess waiter news of quarrel last night suppose there be soul in barrack did not know what errand be when drove out morning expect if have be killed must have have to move either lancer depot ours away from canterbury for men of two regiment must have be sure to have fought whenever met other a soon a be near enough to gate for figure to be made out there be sudden movement among men several took off cap waved while others threw into air be not exactly discipline wyatt captain lister said with smile show conclusively enough that be favourite with men there be roar of cheering a went in through gate in spite of captain lister holding up hand shaking head a drove across barrack square to frank quarter subaltern came rushing out glad indeed to see back again wyatt first who run up exclaimed so be arranged without fighting after not at macalister captain lister replied a reined in horse at frank door wyatt did exactly what told be going to do carried off marwill trigger finger bullet did what have not intended must ran up arm smashed above elbow doctor say that think arm will have to come off shout of satisfaction rose from group wilmington grasped frank hand a leapt down thank god that be safe wyatt exclaimed must never have forgiven if anything have happened to of course what said last night cheered good deal must hardly help thinking afterwards that have made best of for purpose did not wilmington felt absolutely confident must hit on hand now want breakfast ordered to be ready before started well be cool hand wyatt lister said if ever get into hand to hand affair with french hope will take under protection will see about frank laughed well come up now ordered breakfast for two see smith be bringing dish across from kitchen oh say wyatt must let rest of up too ca wait to hear about until have done come up by mean there be really nothing to tell however a breakfast be being eaten captain lister answered question so did not take well one of subaltern said be just what must expect from fellow like think must be too hard on in respect be very trying to man temper when make absolutely sure of doing thing be beaten by novice be surprise no doubt a well a pain fancy pain be pretty sharp that caused to lose temper expect that if have be fighting with old hand whom thought dangerous must have borne wound in very different way now look here lad there be one thing must bear in mind treat affair a if be sort of triumph for corp have doubt that fellow in lancer will be bit a much pleased a be at way thing have turned out must not assume must say have much better not make allusion to affair unless others speak to about of course will make great deal of talk there be getting over let be subject to be discussed in mess room duel between officer of different regiment have before now led to lot of bad feeling have known one such duel lead to dozen others lancer be in way to blame for marwill conduct if found disposition among to crow over might give rise to ill feeling must be bad enough if be merely two regiment in garrison together must be terrible nuisance in depot where there be common mess therefore when matter be talked over a be sure to be be best to let talking be done by others to keep own mouth closed wyatt be last fellow in world to wish to pose a conquering hero thank lister frank said be sure never wish to hear thing mentioned again have taken lot of pain to become good shot seems have natural aptitude way there be nothing more to feel boastful about than if nature have made giant have thereby be able to thrash man of ordinary strength be very glad have put out of marwill power to bully other men a have several time done to force into duel when skill gave such advantage that be nothing short of murder think that will go across to major ask to give fortnight leave have not be away since joined have letter yesterday saying that aunt be not very well so must like to run down to weymouth to see must be very good plan wyatt be sure major will give leave at once when have finished breakfast frank went across to major quarter have not have time to congratulate yet wyatt major said warmly a entered have rendered service to army in general to regiment in particular for must have be nasty thing if have got about one of have be grossly insulted without taking matter up if have not interfered commandant told that must have reported matter at headquarters have wilmington taken up must have refused to let matter go on until have received answer from horse guard must have done same in case if have not used such strong language word practically forced marwill into challenging still although who be present must have approved of wilmington not being allowed to throw away life by going out with marwill one ca deny that must have caused unpleasantness who only heard that one of fellow have put up with gross insult without taking step have so to speak sheltered under authority of commandant must have considered ugly business must have found very unpleasant when joined army in spain therefore feel very much indebted to for having championed honour of regiment be marvellous shot lad will have one satisfaction be that when affair be talked about be known that said beforehand that intended to take off marwill trigger finger that did there be chance of ever being forced into quarrel a long a remain in army thank major have just come across to ask if will allow fortnight leave of absence really want to pay visit to aunt at weymouth think

coming here will do lot of good two morning later one of coast guard came in captain downes will be glad sir if will go on board there be something particular that want to speak to about frank at once put on hat have sharp fight with smuggler last night sailor said a started have be cruising about for two day to west yesterday morning made out to sea held east at ten o'clock came into swanage bay

shown heel a usual gave broadside big spar of hers came down with run be alongside in time made tough fight of pretty nigh half crew be ashore with keg howsomever be not long in beating below though two three of chap be pretty badly hurt three of theirs killed before scrimmage be over did not trouble about chap ashore expect be accounted for right for heard pistol shot there came back here at once with lugger got in two hour ago be prisoner french frank asked eagerly ay sir just a french a can be be one of party a took ashore lodged in jail there be doubt about being french have got ring in ear besides must tell from cut of jib that be frenchies in ten minute frank stepped on to deck of boxer captain downes met there congratulate mr wyatt said warmly suppose have be hearing that have sharp tussle with smuggler at last captured that confounded lugger have given so much trouble for past two year though be mightily pleased at be more pleased still that among on board be that fellow markham fought like tiger reckon knew that neck be in noose for must of course have heard from friend here that matter of faulkner murder have be cleared up there be warrant out against well got pistol shot in chest after be over found that be pretty near gone a soon a lantern be put to face two three of men knew at once went up to be pretty well past speaking a stooped over said 'you have

faulkner shot have put down there ' died quarter of hour later here be letter be going to take over to colonel chamber thought must like to go with of course brother be really cleared of suspicion be just a well to have got under real man own hand be delighted captain downes when be told a came along of lugger being captured hoped that might possibly have something like to tell for have heard since came here that be still on board a be not likely must risk going ashore thought perhaps have got prisoner be better altogether for if have be put on trial for faulkner murder must no doubt have accused julian though think evidence be strong enough to fix guilt on man there might have be who must have believed what said now will be altogether cleared up though when julian will be found brought home be more than anyone can say well need not trouble about lad just at present be cleared be principal thing sooner later be sure to find way back again frank landed with captain downes taking trap drove to magistrate where fortunately found mr henderson who have gone up to arrange for examination of prisoner be greatly pleased when on letter being opened be found to contain full confession of murder attested by french magistrate corroborating in respect fact contained in julian letter a proved by evidence given at coroner inquest will give letter to weymouth paper to insert colonel chamber said will send copy to london paper with few line recalling fact of murder proof have accumulated of markham share in show beyond doubt bona fides of confession thank very much colonel frank said only wish knew where to send copy to julian be sure wish that must do so colonel said poor fellow have paid dearly indeed for well meant though rash attempt to seize faulkner murderer will have finished business in two three minute will be glad if will stop to have chat with a soon a magistrate have concluded talk with mr henderson latter have gone off to carry out arrangement colonel chamber turned to captain said have seen of london paper downes colonel have have enough to think of morning since moored up be there anything of importance in nothing perhaps extraordinarily important something certainly interesting at present moment here be morning herald be item correspondent at canterbury state that much excitement have be lately caused in military circle there by affair of honour ' oh be too bad frank broke in hotly 'between officer of lancer captain m l cornet of th light dragoon mr w t be said that captain m l have be engaged in several similar encounter be famous for skill with pistol affair began understand at mess dinner of cavalry depot few day since at several well known gentleman of town be present captain m l used insulting language to recently joined young officer of dragoon mr w t took matter up hotly rising denounced captain m l in such strong language that duel became inevitable in view of youth supposed inexperience of mr w t affair be regarded with extreme disapprobation by officer of captain m l regiment a well a by of dragoon seems however mr w t have for time be practising with pistol under tuition of respected townsman mr gunsmith before party met confided to officer who acted a second that intended to aim at opponent trigger finger so to incapacitate from further adventure of kind extraordinary a may appear intention be carried out captain m l not only lost finger bullet passed up arm broke above elbow understand that limb have be successfully amputated by surgeon of two corp singular feat on part of young officer when opposed to so skilled duellist a captain m l have created profound sensation throughout garrison well master w t what have to say to know have anything to say to colonel frank replied except that be great nuisance that thing must be talked about suppose have good eye steady hand have practised steadily day since joined have got to shoot pretty straight man be notorious bully if young fellow have insulted have gone out with must have be nothing short of murder yet if have not gone out with believe must have shot rather than suffer disgrace of putting up with insult so a felt pretty certain must disable marwill without having to do serious injury took up hit in hand a intended to well downes colonel chamber said seems to that two brother be born to get into adventure to get well out of however frank although have acted very creditably must certainly be wonderful shot with pistol do sort of thing too often be not going to sir hope that will never fight duel again did practise for to be able to use pistol on service three day later frank said good bye to aunt friend returned to canterbury travelling time by coach a craft happened to be sailing for dover chapter x smolensk julian regiment arrived at konigsberg early in march found that be to form part of ney division whole country round have be turned into enormous camp town be centre round great array of tent be clustered troop be of many nationality french pole bavarian saxon prussian austrian even spanish never since horde of attila swept over europe have so vast army be gathered total force collected for invasion of russia amounted to men of whom be infantry cavalry remainder artillery engineer have with gun april passed without movement troop became impatient even veteran whose confidence in napoleon be implicit head ought to be across frontier before old sergeant of julian company said to a smoked pipe together over two mug of german beer be that think there will be much fighting for what can russia do against army a say alexander have be busy since peace of tilsit at time must scarce place men in field one fear russian be big country say that in winter cold be horrible will have long distance to march know how much time be always wasted over making treaty of peace if be to be back again before winter ought to be off now of course emperor may mean to hold st petersburg moscow until next spring daresay must make comfortable enough in place when come to winter six hundred fifty thousand men couple of hundred thousand horse be tremendous job must think emperor must send riff raff of spaniard german pole back keep only french a garrison through winter still must much rather that must be back here before first snow fall like long campaign men be ready to fight to fight again twenty time if need be then like to be done with in long campaign with march halt delay discipline get slack men begin to grumble besides clothes wear out however big store take with be sure to run short in time wish be off be not until th of may napoleon arrived at dresden where be met by emperor empress of austria king of prussia saxony host of archduke prince fortnight be spent in brilliant fete napoleon be by mean blind to magnitude of enterprise on have embarked entertained hope that army must recross frontier before winter have indeed before leaving paris predicted that three campaign must be necessary before lasting term of peace must be secured thus early commencement of campaign be of comparatively slight importance indeed preparation for struggle be on so great scale that must not with energy displayed in pushing forward be completed before end of june thus then while napoleon delayed in paris feasted at dresden road of germany be occupied by great host of men enormous

city be completely commanded by surrounding hill be in way defensible barclay de tolly felt obliged to fight greatest indignation prevailed in russia at retreat of army without attempting one determined stand abandonment of so large tract of country to french suffering ruin thereby wrought among population of one of richest most thickly peopled district of russia barclay own plan have be to draw enemy farther farther into country knowing that with mile of advance difficulty must increase army become weakened by fatigue sickness assault of peasantry continued retreat be telling upon spirit of own troop also to war be holy one have marched to frontier burning to meet invader that from moment of crossing niemen must have to retreat hunted harassed like beaten men goaded to fury officer be le indignant than men barclay found that be absolutely necessary to make stand french be a eager a russian to fight when became known that enemy seemed determined to make stand at smolensk

division came next while murat with cavalry division completed semicircle russian must be mad be comment of veteran of julian regiment place be of strength artillery will breach wall in time have one bridge by to retreat across river will soon knock to piece with gun on right will catch who be in town in trap obstinate resistance however have be given by russian to attack on rear guard have impressed invader with respect for foe be in strong contrast to feeling entertained when crossed frontier save only among soldier who have met russian before who knew with what dogged valour always fought especially when on defensive be going to be tough work jules can tell one of said to julian whose english birth be now almost forgotten who by good temper always manifested however long march however great fatigue have become general favourite guess be only going to fight because russian be tired of retreating just a be tired of pursuing can gain nothing by fighting here outnumber tremendously great bulk of army lie on height on other side of river there be nothing to prevent retreating to strong position where might give battle with advantage on other hand there be reason why must fight here have come down thirty forty mile out of direct road to moscow if instead of doing so have crossed river have gone straight on russian must have evacuated town pushed on with speed in order to get between moscow marching about without getting battle discourages men more even than defeat hope that will do something to restore discipline among german austrian ay among own troop too have be through number of campaign have never seen such disorder such plunder such want of discipline a have be shown since entered russia tell jules even defeat must do good look at russian never leave straggler behind never dismounted gun while road behind be choked up with abandoned gun waggon whole country be covered with marauder must be glad if one of brigade be ordered to break up into company to march back spreading out across whole country have traversed shooting man met between frontier whether be french german austrian pole have be terrible julian agreed at least have satisfaction of knowing ney corp d'armee have furnished smaller share of straggler than most of others be true enough bad be best lad of battalion be nearly young soldier ca say much for conduct while seven battalion of spaniard wurtemburgers men from duchy of baden have behaved shamefully think that four squadron of polish cavalry have be better have be bad there be denying never must have conquered germany crushed prussia forced austria to submit have army behaved in way have done of late napoleon must soon have put stop to then must have have one two of worst regiment drawn up must have decimated a lesson to rest now order seem to go for nothing have far too much on mind to attend to such thing general have be thinking so much of pressing on after enemy that have done nothing to see order carried into effect be same sort of thing drove spaniard into taking to mountain causing infinite trouble great loss of life fortunately here be so strong that need fear reverse if disaster occurred tell jules must have good cause to curse marauder who have converted lazy peasant into desperate foe must think ought not to lose many men in taking town sergeant there seem to be gun on wall have suburb to cover advance attacking on side a will do ought to force way in without much trouble must seem so lad yes must seem so know in spain once cost five day fighting after got inside town allow be not like street be narrow house be of stone house fortress while a can see from here street be wide at right angle to other house of brick fancy many of of wood still knowing what russian be must wager will not capture smolensk with loss of le than ten thousand men be if really defend until last following day th of august cannonade be kept up against wall by french artillery russian replying seldom next morning be discovered that prince bagration have marched with army from hill on other side of river to take post on main moscow road so a to prevent position being turned by advance of portion of french army by route during night barclay have thrown two pontoon bridge across river in addition to permanent bridge at daybreak dropping fire broke out for davoust ney have sent body of troop into suburb have entered without opposition now opened irritating fire on russian upon wall at eight o'clock firing suddenly swelled into roar doctorow russian general in command of troop in town made sortie cleared suburb at point of bayonet napoleon believing that russian army be coming out to attack drew up ney davoust troop in order of battle with infantry in first line supported by murat cavalry partial attack be continued against suburb russian obstinately maintained there finding that showed sign of advancing to attack napoleon at two o'clock gave order for general assault whole of french troop advanced against suburb attack of ney corp be directed against krasnoi suburb faced against advanced work known a citadel for two hour terrible struggle went on russian defended suburb with desperate tenacity house garden be scene of fierce encounter men fought with bayonet clubbed musket cannon thundered on height poniatowski established sixty gun on hill on french right short distance from river with opened fire upon bridge seemed that must soon be destroyed retreat of russian troop in smolensk entirely cut off in short time however russian on other side of river planted number of gun on rise of equal height to occupied by poniatowski artillery a gun took battery in flank be ere long forced to withdraw from hill illustration plan of battle of smolensk be only after two hour fighting that russian withdrew from suburb into town a bridge across river have not suffered greatly from fire of great french battery barclay sent prince eugene of wurtemberg across to reinforce garrison a soon a russian retired into town hundred fifty gun opened fire on wall to effect breach at five desperate assault be made upon one of gate be for moment captured prince eugene charged forward with division recaptured at point of bayonet french shell grape swept street set fire to town in score of place several of wooden roof of tower upon wall be also in flame after pause for couple of hour french again made serious desperate assault russian sternly held ground at seven o'clock made sortie from behind citadel drove french out of krasnoi suburb at nine cannonade ceased french fell back to position from have moved in morning russian reoccupied covered way in front of wall to prevent sudden attack during night what did tell jules old sergeant said mournfully when shattered remains of regiment fell out proceeded to cook food said that capture of town must cost men have cost ney corp alone half that number have not taken yet fought well have man be a old soldier a myself must not have done duty better peste russian be obstinate brigand be desperate work julian said more terrible than anything must have imagined how anyone escaped alive be more than can say wall house seemed to be fringed with fire heard word of command during day there be to do be to load fire sometimes to rush forward when rest did so sometimes to fall back when russian poured down upon will begin again to morrow suppose so sergeant replied certainly sha' march away until have taken perhaps enemy may evacuate whole town be sea of flame there be nothing to fight for next time will doubt breach wall thoroughly before try see undervalued russian sha' make mistake again well lad have got out of without serious damage for bullet got through arm will soon heal up again there be one thing if remain in army for next twenty year be not likely to see harder fighting that night indeed smolensk be evacuated by russian contrary to wish of officer men prince eugene general doctorow declaring that must hold on for ten day longer might doubtless have be done barclay be afraid that napoleon might sweep round cross river somewhere to left that in case must fall back town must have to be evacuated in day time when enemy must sweep bridge with fire by three o'clock in morning whole force in city have crossed bridge be burnt behind flame acquainted french with fact that city have be evacuated at daybreak entered town soon afterwards skirmisher opened fire on russian on other side of river at eight o'clock spanish brigade crossed river waist deep entered suburb known a st petersburg on right bank be at once attacked many be killed taken prisoner rest driven across river again general barclay then withdrew army to height wishing to tempt enemy to cross intending to give battle before have made passage napoleon kept troop in hand except that artillery maintained fire to right against russian at eight o'clock in evening skirmisher crossed river fire shortly broke out in st petersburg in hour several hundred house extending for mile along river be in blaze while in smolensk be still burning fiercely at night russian again fell back direct road lay parallel with river a be commanded by enemy gun general barclay directed force divided into two column to march by cross road led over two steep hill owing to harness breaking road soon became blocked march be discontinued till daylight enabled driver to get five hundred gun ammunition train up hill french finding that russian army be going off crossed river in force furiously attacked rear guard tried to penetrate between main body of army prince eugene division be sent back to assist general korf who commanded there in meantime two column of french moved along main road to moscow with evident intention of heading russian army at loubino point where cross road by be travelling came into might have accomplished owing to much shorter distance have to travel delay caused by difficulty of getting gun over hill small russian corp under touchkoff have be sent forward to cover point ney have crossed river early by two bridge have thrown over touchkoff a saw force pressing along main road took up position where covered loubino for hour repulsed effort of french to pas at three o'clock pressure upon touchkoff became so severe that several regiment from barclay column be passing safely along while kept road open for be sent to assistance fight continued napoleon believed that whole russian force have taken post at loubino sent forward reinforcement to ney wood be so thick that be time before reached gun of one of column being obliged to go mile half through wood before must turn so dense be growth of tree ney now pressed forward with such vigour that touchkoff be driven from position in advance upon village where be again reinforced by four infantry battalion two regiment of cavalry heavy gun murat with cavalry endeavoured to turn russian left two russian cavalry regiment supported by artillery maintained ground soon after five o'clock french have received such large reinforcement that russian be forced to give way be in full retreat when barclay arrived upon scene rallied battle be renewed last effort of french be repulsed by charge with bayonet by russian grenadier in charge however general touchkoff by whose valour russian army have be saved be carried too far in advance of men be taken prisoner be not until midnight that rear of barclay column emerged from cross road in have be involved for twenty four hour in fight french russian lost about men have junot joined ney in attack on touchkoff force greater part of russian army must have be destroyed made prisoner russian army now pursued march towards moscow unmolested save by attack by murat cavalry ney corp d'armee have borne brunt of fighting at loubino have be diminished in strength by men in battle however julian regiment having suffered so heavily in attack at smolensk be one of held in reserve napoleon be greatly disappointed at escape of russian army from grasp only russian have be engaged in action in rear in at loubino while whole of french army round smolensk with exception of corp of junot have in vain endeavoured to break through defence to fall upon main body of army so helplessly struggling along road in attack on smolensk of napoleon best soldier have fallen loubino cost more although number be small in proportion to total strength of army be exclusively of french soldier belonging to division in placed main trust be now question with whether must establish for winter in country occupied accumulate store make smolensk great depot must serve a base for advance in spring move on at once against moscow on point held council with marshal opinion of be generally favourable to former course desperate fighting of three previous day have opened eye to fact that even so great force a led by napoleon must not afford to despise russian country be at present occupied be rich there be so many town that army must go into comfortable quarter for winter communication with frontier be open safe be unquestionably safer more prudent course with conclusion napoleon agreed in theory have originally be intention to winter in province that have now overrun to march against st petersburg moscow in spring have however other matter besides of military expediency to consider in first place pole be exasperated at refusal to re establish at once ancient kingdom refusal necessitated by fact that must not do so without taking from austria prussia ally polish district have fallen to share then too pole felt terrible pressure of supporting army still in poland of contributing to vast expense of war be campaign to continue long attitude might change to one of open hostility in next place conclusion of peace brought about by effort of england between sweden turkey with russia must enable latter to bring up whole of force have be engaged in south with turk in north watching swedish frontier must give time for new levy to be converted into good soldier placed in field then too matter be going on badly in spain must place little dependence upon austria prussia germany be absent year from france might find country leagued against therefore although recognizing justice of argument of marshal decided upon pushing on to moscow establishing there for winter did not even yet recognize stubbornness constancy of russian character believed that spectacle of ancient capital in hand must induce at once to treat for peace decision be welcome to army general wish of soldier be to get matter over to be off home again obstinacy with russian fought rapidity with marched intense animosity have be excited among peasant by cruel treatment to have be exposed recklessness with threw away life so that must take vengeance for suffering ferocity with straggler small detachment fell into hand be massacred thing combined to excite feeling of gloom anxiety among soldier there be merry song round bivouac fire now even thought of plunder of moscow failed to raise spirit loss of so many tried comrade be greatly felt in ney division have at first numbered over loss in battle from sickness have already reduced by more than fourth even veteran lost usual impassive attitude of contentment with existing state of thing what like growled one of old sergeant be that there be not soul in village not solitary man in field be not natural one get same sort of feeling one have when thunderstorm be just going to burst overhead when have begun mind while be waiting for first flash first clap of thunder get sort of creepy feeling be just what sight of deserted country make feel have campaigned over europe never saw anything like growl of assent passed round circle there be general repetition of word be not natural comrade even in spain one said where hate like poison people leave village like young men may go old men woman child remain priest be sure to stop here there be not so much a fowl to be seen in street whole population be gone man woman child make one feel said gloomily a if be accursed infected with plague something of sort well let talk about said with effort at cheerfulness there be jules be merriest fellow in company come here jules be grumbling what do think of thing think much about one way other julian said a came up have not great deal further to go to moscow sooner get there better then will have satisfaction of seeing people yes jules be what be vexing that everyone run away at approach fool julian replied considering villainous way in have be harried even peasant have feeling when be treated like wild beast will turn seems to that instead of ill treating ought with march a before to have done everything in power to show that although be going to fight army opposed have ill feeling against people at large if have found ready to pay for everything wanted to treat a well a if have be own country people there must have be running away from then a advanced must have purchased abundant supply of food everywhere must have have fear a to communication might have wandered hundred yard outside sentry without risk of having throat cut however be of use going over argument again thing have be done can not be undone have to accept consequence make best of man who burn wood must complain month afterwards because have fuel however hope that in day two will be moving on a long a be going there be time to feel dull be halt after being so long in motion give time to talk put fancy into head did not expect pleasure excursion when started chapter xi with russian army when frank arrived at canterbury found thing in confusion received news that two troop have order to march next morning for portsmouth where be to embark for spain why major said must write exclaimed letter must have missed somehow will have enough to do to get ready to night be not going wyatt wilmington

aide de camp have be made brigadier general be not a yet settled when will start have only just received official appointment there be saying when may get final instruction for be to certain extent political affair sort of thing always drag on for long time before come to head be lucky that matter be arranged now for hear at horse guard that troop be ordered out to spain doubt just at moment will be sorry that be not going with can assure that business will be vastly more useful to in profession than anything must be likely to meet with a cavalry subaltern in spain for moment indeed frank did regret that be not going to accompany troop be so sure however that sir robert wilson be acting for best that put aside feeling official letter be simple notification that be appointed aide de camp to general sir robert wilson that be to remain at depot continue ordinary duty until further intimation reached excitement of departure have frank be glad to find quite thrown that caused by duel into background officer who be to go be busy with preparation frank be occupied until late hour night in assisting in packing not only baggage be to be taken heavy case be to be stored away until return many be regret expressed by officer who be going out that frank be not to accompany much curiosity expressed a to reason for be kept behind felt that although sir robert wilson have not specially enjoined silence must be undesirable that information a to probability of proceeding to russia must be given therefore said only know that sir robert wilson who be great friend of father who obtained commission for be going to have command somewhere have asked for a one of aide de camp on ground of friendship for father former connection with regiment well then very likely will see out

commissioner to russian army when war broke out with france ah account for working so hard at russian wyatt major said in reply suppose have received hint from sir robert yes major told that a have be commissioner with russian in last war be probable that if rumour napoleon intended to invade russia proved correct might be appointed again said that if must get up enough of language to speak pretty fluently must apply for well deserve wyatt for there be doubt that have worked hard indeed will be capital thing for be there anything can do yes sir thought perhaps that when knew what be going to do

delivery of message to emperor must mean death to russian officer who undertook commission knowing attachment to emperor equally well known feeling towards person be so well qualified to lay expression of sentiment before motif in doing so can not be suspected coming from emperor self respect must not suffer in same way a must do be message conveyed to by one of own subject one after general urged request sir robert listened to argument then said be altogether too grave matter for to decide upon hastily know thoroughly well that there be thought of disloyalty in mind of of towards will of emperor act be one of gravest insubordination be indeed threat that will disobey majesty command in event of ordering suspension of hostility a to conduct of commander in chief be not competent to express opinion a soldier can understand that long continued retreat abandonment of so many province to enemy without striking single blow in defence be trying in extreme to yourselves brave soldier will not leave army until see fairly on march again before start will give reply general thanked sir robert warmly then withdrew will write more to night wyatt general said when frank entered tent have other grave matter to think about have best lie down at once get few hour sleep to morrow be likely to be eventful day for operation of withdrawing army from position getting on to main road again will be full of peril may indeed end in terrible disaster a soon a russian army have repulsed attack of french resumed march towards moscow sir robert wilson left proceeded to st petersburg where have promised russian general to inform czar of opinion disposition of army dissatisfaction with general determination to continue combat to refuse to recognize negotiation armistice might be made with enemy will leave here wyatt general said on morning after desperate defence of loubino have saved army there be little chance of french pressing russian further think probable that may go into winter quarter where now be in case can not hope to outmarch if follow battle will be in position russian may choose even be there more fighting imminent must still start to day for st petersburg only came round by smolensk a know because thought that emperor must be found there first duty be to see to report to arrangement have be made on danube with grand vizier people by whole of russian army there will be able to join in defence against french a soon a have done so explained to majesty position here will rejoin hope czar will also be coming down here for presence must be most useful not in military way for men in world must fight better than russian be doing army fear above thing peace will be made before have opportunity of wiping out what considers disgrace in allowing french to overrun so many rich province without striking blow in point of fact defence of smolensk way in men yesterday withstood for hour assault of three four time number must be sufficient to prove to world fighting quality in own mind consider barclay have acted wisely in declining to hazard whole fortune of war upon single battle against enemy from first have outnumbered nearly threefold must never have taken up position on frontier if did not mean to defend other army than must have become disorganized rabble long ago there be nothing so trying to troop a to march for week hotly chased by enemy three time in peninsula have seen what british army becomes under far le trying circumstance if russian did know retreat of theirs admirable manner in have maintained discipline be a creditable a winning great victory must be still one can understand that sight of flying population deserted field surrender of province to enemy be mortifying in highest degree to pride nevertheless barclay policy though think have be carried great deal too far for with troop who will fight a ours did yesterday might have fought dozen battle like of loubino must have compelled french to advance slowly instead of in hot pursuit have be justified to great extent from hear invading army have already suffered very great loss from fever hardship effect of weather from number of straggler who have be cut off killed by peasantry transport have especially suffered vast number of horse having died in campaign like transport be everything in various fight have taken place since entered russia have probably suffered heavier loss than russian a latter have always fought on defensive french loss have fallen on napoleon best troop while russian army be equally good lastly although russian be discontented at continued retreat morale doe not seem to have suffered in way be probable that long march inability to bring on general engagement distance from home uncertainty about future have told heavily upon of french who be vastly more susceptible to matter of kind than be russian will remain with headquarter staff wish while be away to obtain accurate detail of movement of various column to write full report evening of march of matter of interest want to forward to to keep for future reference hope to rejoin before further fighting take place sir robert reached st petersburg on th of august be not until ten day later that saw emperor who have gone with lord cathcart british ambassador to meet king of sweden to conclude negotiation secured co operation information that general wilson have brought of admirable behaviour of army did much to allay alarm prevailed in st petersburg after dining with emperor on evening of arrival of latter at capital have long private interview with emperor have already be made acquainted with dissatisfaction in army marshal kutusow have be sent to replace general barclay asked sir robert whether thought new commander must be able to restore subordination confidence in army sir robert replied that have met marshal have informed of exact state of thing there that latter have conjured to acquaint emperor with fullest detail in accordance with request in order to prevent majesty having pain of hearing from lip of one of own subject who perhaps must be le able to convince of intense feeling of loyalty to that still prevailed have consented to be mouthpiece of general of army then reported to interview that have have with general officer suppressing name of present message have desired to deliver emperor be greatly moved however manner in general fulfilled mission with be charged assurance that act of seeming insubordination defiance of imperial authority be in way directed against against adviser whom believed to be acting in interest of napoleon have effect emperor promised to give matter consideration to answer definitely on following day at next meeting gave sir robert authority to assure army of determination to continue war against napoleon while frenchman remained in arm on russian soil that if worst came to worst must remove family far into interior make sacrifice rather than break engagement at same time while must not submit to dictation in matter of minister must assure that must in way influence to break promise during sir robert stay in st petersburg emperor took occasion to show marked favour a if anxious to assure whose view sir robert have represented that be in way displeased with for attitude have assumed upon leaving to rejoin army emperor directed to repeat in most formal manner declaration that must not enter into permit negotiation with napoleon added that must sooner let beard grow to waist eat potato in siberia frank have be active during battle of loubino sir robert wilson have taken up post with touchkoff during action be so desperately fought to cover retreat of main army frank have acted a aide de camp having carried order to various part of field have excellent opportunity of seeing whole of battle russian general in making report of engagement have mentioned name among who have rendered distinguished service horse have be shot under cap have be carried away by bullet have received slight flesh wound in leg although be of small consequence have caused insertion of name among of officer wounded in battle be to see more fighting for time for although army of wittgenstein fought two three severe action with division of st cyr oudinot main army fell back without again fighting until took up position that marshal kutusow have selected for giving battle chapter xii borodino barbarously a french army behaved on advance to smolensk thing be even worse a left ruined town behind resumed journey towards moscow seemed that hatred with be

tremendous artillery fire concentrated upon while french on part be unable to take advantage of position have gained napoleon indeed must have launched troop against work round gorki general represented to that loss have already be so enormous that be doubtful whether must possibly succeed if did so must only be with such further loss a must cripple army altogether at three o'clock

possession only of village of borodino loss of combatant during two day fighting have be nearly equal no le than men having be killed on side number exceeding that of other battle in modern time napoleon expected that russian must again give battle next morning kutusow contrary to opinion of most of general decided on falling back beningsen one of best officer strongly urged to take up position at kalouga seventy mile to south of moscow position be very strong one napoleon must not advance against moscow be in position to offer long determined resistance until have driven off russian army at kalouga must at moment advance on to line of communication cut off supply isolate from france advice be excellent kutusow who be even more unfitted than barclay for post of commander

once involved death loses terror thickly a comrade may fall around who be still erect heed not gap with eye fixed on enemy in front of with lip set tightly together with head bent somewhat down a men who struggle through storm of rain man press on until shot strike reach goal aim at at time fire slackens for man strives to decide struggle with bayonet clubbed musket four time did julian regiment

determination so allow time for to carry out intention to evacuate town when municipal authority be methodically officially to proceed to destroy whole city by fire promise kutusow broke without giving notice on th at council of war overruled objection of general determined to retreat argument being that ground be unsuited for defensive operation that defeat of one disciplined army must endanger final success of war that be for russia not for one city be fighting argument be not without reason if have resolved not to fight again must have accepted advice to take up position on

out for three english worked like demon on th of april have made two breach have prepared everything for have planted mine over breach have score of powder barrel hundred of shell ready to roll down have gun placed to sweep on flank along top have stockade of massive beam in be fixed sword blade while in front of breach be covered with loose plank studded with sharp iron point man behind stockade have dozen spare musket legion of devil must not have taken place did not take never did mortal men try harder even when felt that be absolutely impossible stood there amid storm of shot shell exploding powder barrel bursting mine two thousand men be killed in breach yet still stood there own triumph be short one for british division have carried castle while be exulting in victory town be lost thus see have in twenty day captured fortress that everyone else made sure must defend for at least three month fortunately be exchanged short time afterwards so escaped being sent to english prison agree with rignold be ready to do share of fighting must rather do against one even against russian than against english think will find man who have served in spain must say same after comrade veteran said seems to that doe not make much difference who have got to fight against for see general make thing about even if one of general find that there be say spaniard marching against while force be only give battle well wo give battle to austrian unless have got something like must say that after borodino must like to have at least against russian doubt english calculate same way in spain must admit that always found ready to fight when a far a number went outmatched so take that difference between fighting power of army be not felt so much a must think by soldier because allowance for be made by general on side soldier find always handicapped just in proportion to fighting power so see there be big element of luck in question of ground come in climate so on now taking spain though against must be fair enough odds in fight in open if hundred of be attacked by spaniard among mountain must go very hard with again though frenchman might repulse of mamelukes if attacked in cool of morning in evening yet if be caught in middle of day with sun blazing down parched with thirst might succumb then of course question of general count for great deal so see that even supposing side agree a be a to fighting power of troop element of luck count for lot before begin to fight can never feel sure that be going to win well do win almost everywhere brison yes yes because have napoleon ney soult rest of have have to fight hard many many time if battle have be fought between same army with change of general thing must have gone quite differently to what did be with

follower of of ruffian of town who have be breaking into deserted house plundering well liquor be finished there be always interest in fighting fire five minute later grenadier of rhone six other regiment of division marched into moscow to extinguish flame chapter xiii with rear guard napoleon have a yet idea that fire be other than accidental next morning removed headquarters to imperial palace kremlin from fondly hoped to dictate term of peace to russia be not long before truth became evident hour fresh fire broke out spreading rapidly by whole city be in flame on following day kremlin became so uninhabitable from heat that emperor be forced to withdraw from must not return till th when heavy rain extinguished flame have already consumed nine tenth of city of house only escaped of church be destroyed damaged of wounded french russian in hospital more than perished in flame in meantime kutusow have tardily adopted advice have before rejected have moved round with army taken up position on oka river near kulouga where menaced french line of communication already cossack cavalry be hovering round moscow intercepting convoy cutting up small detachment while horse of french cavalry be so worn out by fatigue famine that in several affair with russian cavalry latter gained decisive advantage be right again comrade old sergeant said to julian who have be promoted to rank of sergeant after battle of borodino a stood together on night of th gazing at terrible spectacle of city enveloped in flame peste russian be terrible fellow who must have thought of such thing be bad look out for terrible look out there be denying julian agreed be impossible for army to stay here without food without forage without shelter with communication threatened russian army on flank see nothing for to retreat sooner be out of better be emperor must issue order for march to begin at daylight in month winter will be on none can say what disaster may befall army have order be given day french army might have made way back to frontier with heavy loss doubtless without disaster napoleon must not bring to believe that russian must refuse to enter into negotiation tried through various source to send proposal to alexander even opened secret negotiation with kutusow have arranged for private meeting with when matter be stopped by sir robert wilson who have received specific instruction from emperor alexander to interpose in name to prevent negotiation being carried on thus week after week of precious time passed then portion of army moved against russian several engagement took place advantage generally resting with russian especially in engagement with murat who suffered decisive repulse julian have a soon a fire in moscow burnt out employed in endeavouring to buy warm garment money be plentiful for there have be mean of spending since entered russia be fortunate in being able to buy very warm tinder garment have be looted by plunderer on night of first arrival before moscow also purchased peasant sheep skin caftan with hood sewed into military cloak so a to form lining hood being for time turned inside from sheep skin manufactured couple of bag to be used a mitten without finger thumb many of comrade laughed at a did work a day grew colder most of endeavoured to follow example skin of sheep brought in occasionally by cavalry be eagerly bought up encouraged by success julian next manufactured pair of sheep skin legging with wool inside be sewn up at bottom so that must be worn over boot shape left much to be desired by cutting up blanket made two long band three inch wide twenty foot long intended to wrap tightly round legging when in use legging glove band be stowed away in knapsack almost everything else being discarded to make room for for felt sure that there must be inspection of kit until frontier have be crossed still napoleon must not bring to issue general order for retreat corp after corp be moved along western road mortier division remained last in moscow marched on rd of october after having by napoleon order blown up kremlin church of st nicholas adjoining building safest line of retreat must have be through witebsk napoleon took more southern road army believed that be intended to fight great battle with russian weather at first be fine on th vanguard under viceroy came in contact with doctorow division fierce fight took place near malo jaroslavets french be checked kutusow coming up with main army be apparent to that french vanguard must be overwhelmed be retreat brought to standstill just a general be expecting order to attack kutusow whose previous conduct in entering into secret negotiation with napoleon have excited strong suspicion of good faith announced that have changed mind ordered russian army to draw off thus for time saving french from complete disaster battle however have be sanguinary one le than ten thousand being killed on side after retirement of russian retreat be continued davoust commanded advance ney division be to cover rear french army at first moved very slowly for be not until th napoleon reached borodino have long be in ill health bodily pain have sapped energy have for long time be unable to sit on horse have travelled in close carriage consequently seemed to have lost for time energy quickness of decision after five week thrown away at moscow be wasted in slow movement when haste be of greatest importance french suffered too from disadvantage while movement be discovered reported by ubiquitous cossack be in absolute ignorance of strength movement of enemy on th of november bitter frost set in soldier awoke chilled to bone with gloomy anticipation of what must happen when full rigour of russian winter be upon in respect frost be advantage for hardened road be before often almost impassable from amount of heavy traffic have passed over upon other hand floating mass of ice speedily covered river rendering work of fording painful difficult in extreme russian division have on rd pressed hotly on retreating column just a reached wiazma river sanguinary conflict took place corp of viceroy passed through town on bank crossed river in fair order that of davoust broke crossed in great confusion covered by ney division retreated steadily facing about from time to time repulsing infantry attack suffering heavily from artillery ney set town on fire to cover retreat crossed bridge there stemmed further advance of russian french loss in engagement be killed wounded prisoner viceroy be directed to march on witebsk be overtaken by enemy when endeavouring to throw bridge over half frozen little river called vop bridge hastily made gave way bank be extremely steep grenadier waded through river though water full of floating ice came up to breast artillery following be unable to climb bank gun be soon frozen fast in river whole of baggage have to be left behind similar misfortune befell of viceroy division have remained behind to cover retreat of soldier who commenced march remained with colour of gun have accompanied condition of french army rapidly deteriorated cold have already become intense soldier being weak with hunger be le able to support horse died in great number flesh be principal food upon troop have to rely one dared straggle to forage for cossack be ever hovering round peasant emerging

not fighting to conquer country against have animosity for own life that of thousand of sick wounded be glad that be in rear guard said to number of non commissioned officer who be one evening when be fortunate enough to be camped in wood gathered round huge fire why so jules seems to that have hardest work besides there be not day that have not to fight be thing doe good julian replied column ahead have nothing to do to think of cold hunger misery straggle along no longer march with be otherwise be still soldier keep order be proud to know that safety of army depends on if do get knocked over with bullet surely be better fate than dropping from exhaustion falling into hand of peasant be right jules several of exclaimed be better thousand time have bad prospect before julian went on there be denying that will make difference how face above thing have got to keep up spirit have heard that captain of whaler in northern sea do everything in power to interest amuse crew sing dance tell story of adventure great thing be to keep from brooding over present be young sergeant most of here have gone through many campaign be not for to give advice must say that above thing ought to try to keep up spirit of men if must start marching song used to sing a tramped through germany must set men foot going in time must make forget cold hunger must march along erect instead of with eye fixed on ground stumbling a if must not drag foot along must tell why sing might think be mockery tell that grenadier of rhone mean to show come what may intend to be soldier to last to face death whether from russian from winter head erect courage high let show that a have ever done duty so will do to end that will be matter of pride throughout division must be said when hear song 'there go

with step be almost elastic not since have crossed niemen have song be heard occasionally singer be silent for minute two passed hand across eye a thought of many voice of comrade now hushed for ever have then joined in chorus hour later ney followed by staff rode along past column a reached head spoke to colonel order be at once given for regiment to form up in hollow square when have done so colonel shouted attention ney took off plumed hat said in voice loud enough to be heard by grenadier of rhone salute honour to regiment have set example to army of cheerfulness under hardship will be placed in order of day with thanks of marshal for spirit have shown maintain friend will warm more thoroughly than food fire will carry triumphantly through fate may have in store for deep cheer burst from regiment a gallant soldier bowed to horse mane then rode on with staff while regiment again breaking into song continued march late in afternoon be again engaged long column ahead be delayed by

men fought furiously among for scrap of food dead horse be often centre of desperate struggle who fell be at once stripped of garment death came sooner to put end to suffering authority of officer be altogether unheeded day by day number dwindled away safety of french army thus far be chiefly due to vacillation if not absolute treachery of kutusow moving on by road well supplied with provision perfectly acquainted with movement of enemy be able to outmarch several time have absolutely in power to completely overwhelm broken remains of napoleon army in spite of entreaty of general indignation of army obstinately refused to give order french army no longer travelled by single road sometimes corp be separated from other by great mass of russian troop numerous detached battle be fought in of french troop although suffering heavily displayed old courage either by hard fighting cut way through obstacle managed by long circuitous march to evade plan if carried out must have

remainder on board ship have over fifty gun with soult in command of there be not man regarded affair a being a good a over considered that whole of must fall into hand well be so be on higher ground than be soon silenced little gun village of elvira in front of position be carried without difficulty suddenly reserve marched round fell on flank threatened great battery be in position there drove out of elvira for time held in check altogether fight round there became very hot pushed forward continued to attack so desperately that partly rolled left up if have not be that night set in fight have not begun until two o'clock thing must have gone very badly with for be falling back in great deal of confusion there be river behind with single bridge by must retreat can tell be glad indeed when english ceased to press firing stopped night picket fire burned be expecting to renew battle in morning when found that position be deserted that be embarking on board ship that show that although troop may be greatly disorganized in retreat fight worse when come up to english have practically gun have cavalry be inferior in number yet beat off back be against wall see knew that if did do there be nothing french prison before be same thing with lad want to fight want to get away if can if have got to fight will do better than ever for defeat must mean death if soldier have got to die must thousand time rather die by musket ball bayonet thrust than by cold hunger there be one thing in favour country have to cross now be for most part forest so will have wood for bivouac if have to leave road will cover movement give chance of making way round enemy will find child heavy burden jules blame for bringing along with when thing come to pas a man need ounce of strength be aware of jules said looking at stephanie a stood laughing talking with of soldier at fire close by believe that will save can not help thinking must never have given little cry met ear a passed by broken carriage if have not be meant that must be saved to appearance be well nigh insensible must have suffered more pain must have be cruel instead of kind action to save when be already well nigh dead firmly believe that whoever fall during struggle may be before child will get through safely be restored to parent say that think that will go through death doe not necessarily mean hers if fall into

comrade man with heart trust whoever get out of alive may be one of to most of matter little one way other have have share of good luck can not expect that bullet will always avoid now let turn in for march at daybreak at rate may think lucky to have have five day rest here with more trouble than be needed to keep russian from occupying that place across river julian called stephanie to lay down by side of comrade near fire be soon fast asleep be under arm before daylight broke in few minute be on way have marched mile when series of tremendous explosion be heard magazine left behind at smolensk have be blown up together with such building a fire have before spared gun have be left behind there being only sufficient horse remaining to draw twelve fighting force be reduced to combatant there be almost a many straggler more le armed with march led by side of dnieper bivouacked that night at next day arrived at point within four mile of krasnoi where on hill fronted by deep ravine russian with forty gun have taken up position thick mist covered lower ground advance of french be not perceived by enemy until be within short distance of crest then forty gun poured storm of grape into leading regiment survivor cheering loudly rushed forward at battery have almost reached when heavy mass of russian infantry flung upon with bayonet after short desperate struggle hurled down hill again russian cavalry charged on slope swept through shattered rank ney ignorant napoleon have already left krasnoi that whole russian army barred way made effort to force passage planted twelve gun on height above ravine sent forward several company of sapper miner to endeavour to carry battery again gallantly made way up hill through storm of fire russian again fell upon in great force few indeed be enabled to make descent of hill rejoin comrade darkness have set in now ney finding impossible to make way further feeling sure have emperor be still at krasnoi must have sent force to assistance fell back into forest position be desperate one scanty supply of provision with have started be exhausted be in unknown country surrounded by foe without guide without carriage for wounded without idea of direction in to march russian general sent in two flag of truce offering term of capitulation must save life of of brave soldier ney however be not yet conquered detained messenger with flag of truce lest might take news to general of position of force then with capable of exertion continued march passed in silence within mile of cossack fire reaching village on dnieper attempted passage ice broke under first gun be necessary to abandon whole of artillery vehicle before entire body have passed cossack attracted by sound made by troop marching across ice arrived captured several hundred prisoner for most part straggler in village further on found temporary rest surprising few cossack capturing horse afforded ration to troop on next morning great swarm of cossack appeared on plain opened heavy artillery fire unable to advance in direction column turned towards wood on left a be about to enter refuge battery concealed there poured volley of grape into column hesitated ney dashed to front rushed forward drove battery from wood day continued march through forest until coming upon village obtained few hour rest shelter food have be terribly heavy day for snow here be not a on road trampled down marching be very heavy julian have carried child greater part of day grenadier have not be actively engaged a formed rear guard several time friend sergeant relieved of stephanie weight be better luck than looked for comrade said a cooked food have found in village filled pipe sat down by blazing fire peste be frightened a crossed river last night knew ice be not strong if have given way a crossed not man upon must have reached other side however turned out for best here be again believe that will somehow get through after ney always have good luck there be never hesitation about see what have to be done doe be sort of man for leader must rather serve under man who doe what think best at once even if turn out wrong than one who hesitates want time to consider ney have be called 'the child of victory believe in star anyone else must have surrendered after fight yesterday yet see how have got out of scrape so far believe that ney will cross frontier safe even if carry with only corporal guard julian be too exhausted to talk moment of rest be precious therefore after smoking for short time lay down to sleep at daybreak next morning march through forest continued when from time to time approached edge cossack must be seen hovering thickly on plain dared not venture into wood be so close that horse must be worse than useless to at three o'clock when within twenty mile of orsza two polish officer volunteered to push ahead to town on peasant horse have be brought from village where have slept to acquaint commander of french force might be there with situation to pray for assistance after halt of hour column pushed on again when have marched twelve mile forest ceased night have long since fallen thick fog hung over ground served to hide movement rendered difficult in extreme for to maintain right direction way led over steep hill be climbed with great difficulty by exhausted troop on reaching summit saw to horror long line of bivouac fire illuminating plain in front of even most sanguine felt despair for moment ney stood for few minute speechless then turned to men there be one thing to do comrade said be death to stay here better thousand time meet a soldier let advance in absolute silence then rush upon enemy strive to burst way through can not know that be so near aided by surprise may force passage if fail will before die sell life so dearly that enemy will long bear in remembrance in silence column marched down hill sound proclaimed that enemy have taken alarm when within charging distance line levelled bayonet rushed forward to fire to stupefaction relief found foe to oppose fire have be lighted by order of cossack general to make believe that army lay between orsza so cause to arrest march hour be given to men to warm by fire then march be resumed three mile further sound of large body of men be heard then came challenge in french qui vive hoarse shout of delight burst from weary force minute later be shaking hand with comrade of davoust division polish messenger have in spite of numerous cossack on plain succeeded in reaching orsza safely most poignant anxiety reigned there a to safety of ney command davoust on hearing welcome news instantly called men under arm advanced to meet delight on side be extreme ney soldier be supplied with food davoust have ordered men to put in haversack halt of three four hour be ordered for column have be marching for eighteen hour must go further at daybreak completed remaining eight mile into orsza napoleon be there here rested for five day food be abundant arm be distributed to who needed ammunition be served out napoleon employed with great energy in reorganizing force in distributing straggler who be almost a numerous a with standard among ney corp be now too small for separate service henceforth be united to of davoust halt did wonder for men be billeted among house of town warmth abundant food revived strength looked forward with confidence to reaching spot where great magazine have be prepared where must take up quarter until campaign recommenced in spring napoleon plan however be frustrated by inconceivable blunder folly of general to whom be entrusted task of carrying out everywhere in turn suffered to be deceived caught napping important position entrusted to be wrested from hand minsk where there be supply for whole army for month have be captured now borizow where passage of berezina be to be made be captured almost without resistance well might napoleon when heard news exclaim in despair will there never be end to blundering great a cold have be before increased day by day in severity happily for french kutusow with main russian army be far in rear might well hope when joined by victor who be to meet near berezina with division to be able to defeat two russian army barred way force being inferior to own stephanie have borne march wonderfully well since leaving smolensk have have no walking to do cold be so great that be glad to remain during day snuggled up beneath julian cloak marching song have ceased hunted a be silence be imperative indeed distance traversed hardship endured be so great that even julian felt that have no longer strength to raise voice few word indeed be spoken on march for bitter cold seemed to render talking almost impossible being in ignorance of force concentrating to cut off napoleon ordered oudinot corp to march forward to secure passage at borizow victor at studenski tchichagow arrived at borizow before oudinot began to cross bridge there oudinot however fell upon fiercely before whole army have passed over russian drew back across bridge destroying behind napoleon on arrival found russian army of danube drawn up on opposite bank ready to dispute passage at once sent body of troop up down river to deceive russian admiral a to point at intended to force passage victor have already come in contact with wittgenstein have fought drawn battle with now moved to join napoleon at spot decided upon for passage of berezina near studenski on evening of th of november napoleon arrived there with oudinot corp engineer immediately commenced construction of two bridge cavalry light infantry crossed river to reconnoitre enemy battery be established to cover work material be very scarce be not until noon on following day that bridge be reported practicable oudinot corp crossed at once rest of troop passed over in great confusion be increased by frequent breaking down of bridge victor took up position to cover rear one of division be cut off by wittgenstein eight thousand men forced to surrender main body of french army completely panic stricken by thunder of gun in rear crowded down in confused mass passage be frequently arrested by fresh breakage in bridge hundred be pushed off into river by pressure from behind others attempted to swim across few of succeeded in gaining opposite bank rest being overpowered by cold overwhelmed by floating mass of ice thousand perished by drowning by th greater part of french army have crossed victor corp covering passage repulsing effort of wittgenstein up to time then being unable to hold russian at bay longer marched down to bridge forcing way through helpless crowd still blocked approach altogether loss of french amounted to men of whom be taken prisoner on same day tchichagow attacked in front with army animated by napoleon presence by despair french fought so fiercely that be repulsed with much loss way lay open to wilna intensity of cold increased daily suffering of army be proportionately great on th of december napoleon handed over wreck of army now reduced to men to murat while viceroy be to have chief command of infantry by time reached berezina davoust corp have be diminished to few thousand men on victor taking post of rear guard be relieved from arduous task be among first who crossed fatal bridge from there to wilna there be comparatively little fighting kutusow army be still far behind although wittgenstein admiral hung on rear french army still inspired sufficient respect to deter from attacking in force a army approached berezina scarce hundred men of grenadier of rhone still hung together be so feeble that staggered rather than marched along ration have ceased to be issued troop depended solely upon flesh of horse of waggon conveying military chest treasure artillery from what must gather in deserted village so desperate be now that even fear of falling into hand of peasant be insufficient to deter from turning off whenever village appeared in sight in hope of finding food if failed at least few hour shelter not one of be in such good condition a julian who have be sustained not only by naturally high spirit by prattle of child by added warmth of sleeping close to at night now for most part trotted beside be only when very tired that child must allow to take up have never be short of food for however small portion obtained enough for be always set aside before be touched one day julian have with of comrade entered village others have insisted on lying down for sleep after devouring little food be fortunate enough to find in one of house julian effort to induce to continue march be in vain lighted huge fire on hearth with wood obtained by breaking up of door declared that must be warm for once came of column be already distance off night be closing in julian therefore started alone be carrying child now for hour kept on way still there be sign of road at last became convinced that must have gone in wrong direction walked for hour longer then coming upon small hut at once determined to pas night there laying sleeping child down covered over with cloak then broke up woodwork cut portion of into small piece mixed content of cartridge with little snow placed among then drew charge from musket put little powder into discharged into heap in few minute bright fire be blazing taking child in arm lay down before be soon asleep be awakened time afterwards by strange noise sprang up at once threw fresh wood on ember grasping musket stood listening in minute noise be renewed something be scratching at door moment later heard pattering of foot overhead then came low whimper snarl truth at once rushed upon be surrounded by wolf for long time march of army have be accompanied by creature driven from forest by cold hunger scenting blood from afar have hung upon skirt of army feasting on bone of horse body of dead julian examined door be strong one there be fear of making entry there roof too seemed solid window be without glass have heavy wooden shutter hoping that by morning wolf finding that must not enter must make off julian lay down by fire again slept for hour when woke daylight be streaming in through crack in shutter on looking through through chink of door saw to dismay that wolf be still there be sitting watching house others be prowling about be clear that have intention whatever of leaving child have be roused by movement stephanie want breakfast said decidedly a broke up more wood rekindled fire be afraid dear will have to

ran after must have killed if horse have not be very fast papa shot of others did not seem to mind be close behind when got home where men came out with fork ax then ran away stephanie will wait for breakfast julian thought for time then going to window opened shutter began to fire at wolf several be killed be at once torn to piece by companion who then withdrew to safe distance sat down to watch julian have not even hoped that must be otherwise have waited be possible that must at last leave hut go off in track of army even in case must not felt be able to overtake alone for weak a be felt unequal to great exertion charge might be devoured by other wolf long before came up with column might be killed by cossack by peasant last be most merciless enemy for death at hand must be slower more painful than at hand of wolf at least child might be saved be in hope of attracting attention that opened fire continued therefore to discharge gun at interval to great satisfaction saw in afternoon number of peasant approaching wolf at once made off stephanie said there be of people coming will soon be here must tell who be ask to send to father tell that will give lot of money for bringing back to yes child said will thank very very much for having be so good to be afraid stephanie will not go back with people kill french whenever take be not french be english said indignantly

at once started across snow one of party carrying stephanie on telling that be hungry black bread be produced gave first piece handed to julian then sat contentedly munching peasant have now come to conclusion that capture must bring good fortune to one of took from pocket of sheep skin caftan bottle handed to julian latter took drink caused to cough violently to amusement of peasant for be vodka strong spirit took breath away after long abstinence from anything water did good however seemed to send glow through limb enabling to keep pace with peasant course lay north after four hour walking arrived at good sized village at edge of forest arrival created much excitement there be hubbub of talk then be taken into largest house in village stephanie who have be asleep for time woke up julian threw aside cloak for close heat of interior be almost overpowering very old man father of family occupied house for in russia married son share house of parent made deep bow to stephanie placed low seat for before stove julian helped off with jacket other encumbrance appearance in pretty dress evidently increased respect in be held by peasant in short time bowl of hot broth be placed before weak a be liquor enjoyed immensely after monotonous diet of horse flesh then stephanie be given corner on cushion placed on wide shelf running round apartment place next to be assigned to julian who after swallowing glass of vodka be in few minute sound asleep with sweet consciousness of rest security to have long be stranger in morning there be gathering composed of papa priest of village principal men when be concluded stephanie be informed that none of knew place of residence of father that messenger have be sent off to nearest town with letter from priest to bishop there asking to inform of be asked how many day have passed since have fallen in with french how long have be travelling before did so julian be able to say exactly where have fallen in with about thirty mile from smolensk stephanie be vague a to time have travelled before accident to carriage day day being only account that must give of matter priest then spoke to for time in russian want said to julian to take off uniform to put on clothes like theirs say that though wish to take with to father might on way fall in with other people with soldier who must not know how good be might take away from kill so that must be safer for to travel in russian dress wo mind will not at stephanie think that be very good plan indeed quarter of hour later julian be equipped in attire of well to do peasant with caftan lined with sheep skin round fur cap thick pair of trouser of dark rough cloth bandage of same material round leg from knee to ankle high loose boot of untanned leather with hair inside transformation greatly pleased peasant whose hatred of french uniform have hitherto caused to stand aloof from now patted on shoulder shook hand drank glass of vodka evidently to health with great heartiness julian must a yet scarcely believe that be not dream from day that have crossed niemen have be filled with gloomy foreboding of disaster sickened by barbarity of soldier upon people while during retreat have be exposed to constant hardship engaged in innumerable fight skirmish impressed with firm belief that not frenchman must ever cross frontier save a prisoner after sense of warmth abundance of food absence of necessity for exertion seemed almost overpowering for next three four day passed small proportion of time in sleep stephanie be quite in element be treated like little queen by villager who considered presence among high honour a well a source of future reward be never weary of listening to detail of stay among french accorded to julian good deal of deference for kindness have shown little countess for service that have thereby rendered to be ten day before answer be received a to count estate lay said far to south bishop be of opinion that little countess have better be sent to st petersburg a count have palace there must be certain to be at capital at present juncture of affair offered that if must bring to must see that be sent on thither by post carriage that in view of extreme cold must be better that must not be forwarded until spring village council be held on receipt of letter proposal that must be sent by bishop be unanimously negatived seemed to villager in case glory of restoring stephanie to parent reward must naturally accrue from must not fall to at same time alternative method occurred to finally after much consultation stephanie be asked to interpret bishop letter to julian when have done so be told to add think julian that if send to bishop papa will not know that be who found took care of julian understood difficulty first inquired how much village must raise to pay for expense of post carriage to st petersburg said that must of course be only loan must be repaid by count led to considerable amount of discussion difficulty be much diminished when julian said that must supply five napoleon towards fund have be decided that three time amount must be required to pay expense of travel priest agreeing to contribute equal amount to julian remaining sum be speedily made up be then arranged that priest must go to borizow obtain podorojna order for supply of post horse at various station must have to name who must accompany head man of village be unanimously elected to go with after talk be settled that julian must be put down a ivan meriloff a foreign name must excite suspicion cause much trouble possibly might be detained a prisoner in case peasant saw that there must be considerable difficulty in inducing little countess to go with priest be absent three day then returned with necessary document authorizing to start from borizow in four day time julian be sorry when time came for departure after four month of incessant hardship fatigue feeling of rest comfort be delightful have be more weakened than be aware of by want of food a strength came back to felt like one recovering from long illness ready to enjoy good thing of life fully to bask in heat of stove to eat meal with sense of real enjoyment rumour have come in day of terrible suffering of french a be hotly pressed by triumphant russian of general belief that few must survive to cross niemen still while french be thus suffering russian be in little better plight following a did through country have be swept bare of everything must be burned by retreating french suffering from cold be terrible perished out of recruit who afterwards marched for wilna a reinforcement only reached that city greater portion of have at once to be taken to hospital mutilated from frost bite thus then number of russian that perished be at least a great a of harassed foe in own climate without necessity for constant vigilance have assisted to break down retreating army julian be instructed in russian word to reply if asked by of postmaster whether be ivan meriloff mentioned in passport on day after return of priest started in sledge filled with hay covered with sheep skin julian with stephanie be nestled up in hay at one end of sledge two russian at

army be at moscow felt sure must wish to bring stephanie to that after consultation with steward must in three day start direct after sending off letter be of course thunderstruck apparently have idea that whole of french be at moscow that must therefore be perfectly safe to cross road between frontier poor woman said must by chance come across body of countryman be sure that must not interfere

by french must have arrived here at least three week before according to date there be little doubt that must have crossed main road from moscow to frontier at very time when french army on retreat must be moving along that have heard knew of terrible distress of army of own showed that at time intense suffering of french savage reprisal of peasantry have reduced to state when nothing be respected that pair of valuable horse heap of costly fur to say nothing of food carried must be prize almost beyond value deprived of nurse child must in few hour die of cold that such fate must have befallen seemed almost certain for otherwise must have joined must tell pretty well road that must follow started along way between here smolensk met six men what said confirmed worst fear have learnt where carriage have last halted for night party have not travelled post have kept own horse have travelled only by day have lingered only one day anywhere on way must have crossed moscow road on day after rear guard of french have passed news travelled slowly doubt at post house where slept word that french army be passing along have be received beyond that men have be able to gather news

hope be at end stephanie be lost to for ever now sir will tell how be that saved be doubtless with french army though how came to be there be almost a great puzzle a how stephanie be saved will tell that afterwards count julian replied then related how on marching past overturned carriage heard what must doubtless have be stephanie last cry have found lying half frozen among cushion stated mean have taken to restore warmth to how have strapped to back under warmly lined cloak then gave a well a must remember detail of day experience how stephanie have become general pet of soldier how have manufactured warm cloak hood for how have ridden on shoulder have joined in marching song of regiment have really kept well in good spirit on march how a got too weak to carry have trotted by side how comrade in spite of exhaustion have be willing to relieve of weight then told how at last have separated from regiment when few hour march from berezina how stephanie in turn have saved life from peasant so see count concluded kindness have shown child have already be repaid to many fold not only did save life from peasant have doubt that pretty talk occupation offered to thought warmth a nestled close to at night be mean of retaining strength to far greater degree than be case with most of comrade enabled to survive when so many dropped dead from cold exhaustion may be so friend count said god have doubtless rewarded for good action that in nowise lessens obligation towards now will tell somewhat of own history be long story count better friend trust wife be asleep by time child with nothing can be of greater interest to than to hear julian therefore related story in full produced paper given on enlistment guaranteeing that must not be called upon to fight against countryman since entered russia count said have seen savage manner in peasantry be treated not so much by french troop a by ally bitterly regretted that have enlisted at time notion of have ever entered mind have told that life at verdun be intolerable died in hundred for sort of dull despair seemed to settle on everyone although for long time have borne up against have come to point when death must have be welcome return to own country seemed closed to owing to circumstance have related to entered french service just a in war couple of hundred year ago englishman scotchman be to be found fighting a soldier of fortune in army of well nigh power of europe can not blame mr wyatt yours be singular most unfortunate story seems to that have be in place must have acted precisely same must have be glad to take service under flag rather than have remained to rot in prison certainly have thousand time better excuse than have austrian prussian who after having be ally entered upon savage war of invasion without shadow of excuse save that be will of napoleon however think that will be a well in order to save necessity for explanation must introduce to friend a english gentleman who have come to with warmest recommendation whom be most anxious to serve in way be not time when men concern in way with private affair of others there be not family in russia high low who have not lost one more member in terrible struggle publicly a nation rejoice at deliverance at destruction of enemy privately mourn loss have be terrible a yet scarcely know how great imagine that will be found to have be

almost seems like dream already yet know be very comfortable with will be something for to look back upon life father said there will be many who will have strange sad memory of war not one who will have stranger experience than have to talk about happily there be a far a be concerned little sadness in julian be delighted with brightness gaiety of st petersburg with broad street stately palace fine cathedral busy population universal use of fur prevented symbol of mourning being apparent a drove along in luxurious equipage even like child must scarce believe that desperate fight at even longer more obstinate contest at borodino terrible scene on retreat be reality on return to palace julian understood object of count in having taken for drive for found armoire wardrobe of room

different kind fur lined slipper dress boot examined with something like consternation what nonsense exclaimed what be to do with thing be magnificent be too much altogether why fur alone be worth hundred of pound doubt count be extremely rich have already heard speak of three four estate in different part of russia palace be fit for prince of course can afford well enough to be quite overpowering must like to see aunt face if be to turn up at weymouth with kit there be letter lying on table opened be a have expected from count dear mr wyatt will be sure accept little outfit have provided in same spirit in have obtained will oblige by making allusion to to content of enclosed pocket book will provide with ready money while be staying here be poor token of life long obligation

everything showed that thoughtful kindness have be exercised on dressing table stood superb travelling case of russian leather fitted with necessary of toilet in ivory mounted with silver with initial engraved upon back of various brush hitherto have made attempt to remove soft brown beard have grown untouched from day when army have turned back upon moscow now set to shaved then dressed for dinner

that have lacked before stern set look of battle have left mark upon though distinctly pleasant kindly one be undoubtedly that of soldier who have seen hard service have looked death many time in face question a to what must say to count be set at rest on entry into drawing room for count took by hand leading across room presented to countess who have for first time made appearance rose a came across with trembling hand eye full of tear came up to ah mr wyatt said what can say to saviour of child have have difficulty in restraining patience so long be only to day that doctor gave permission to leave room held out hand to bowed deeply over raised to lip happiness be le than own countess said that god have permitted to be mean of bringing child back again be great thing to do on part a have told count little act of kindness be vastly more than repaid for daughter assuredly saved life from peasant a saved hers from cold little daughter be quite heroine said more lightly can assure that even when bullet be flying about thickly evinced sign of fear way in stood before facing enraged peasant be splendid show perfect faith in mr wyatt child who have absolute confidence in person in whose charge be be almost without fear idea of danger be derived almost entirely from conduct of around if show fear be terrified while if manner convinces that have fear doe not understand that danger can exist be evidently deeply attached to a indeed have reason to be when get tired with talking to say to 'now must go dear ' trot off a contentedly to a if be indeed what call nurse much more so than used to do to claire poor woman be most careful nurse excellent instructress although did start so madly a must seem on journey child never really took to a have not faculty of winning affection be thoroughly trustworthy must believe have given life for child be certainly rather precise in manner be perhaps little too peremptory in giving order be admit fault on right side for stephanie be so accustomed to adulation on part of servant that rather need firm hand over however child have scarcely mentioned claire name since return while yours be incessantly on lip have not be in way spoilt by adulation countess have be a amenable to slightest wish a humblest peasant child must be certainly have pretty little air of dignity be funny to see how queened among french soldier who always called mademoiselle la comtesse always put aside best piece of scanty ration of meat for yes have be telling how good be to what war have be mr wyatt so chatted until dinner be announced then countess lay down on sofa stephanie came in sat on low stool beside while father julian went to dining room after meal be over count proposed that julian must accompany on visit to noble club

while remain with be small light one like with pair of horse be seldom that three horse be used unless lady be of party there be much for to see will be more pleasant for to be own master go about a please following morning after breakfast count said a lit cigar have formed plan yet mr wyatt of course mean for present be understood that be home a long a will be good enough to make so longer stay greater pleasure will give mean for future be thinking of returning to england be intending to write at once to brother whether be at home not of course can not say be going into army greatly fear that unfortunate affair in be engaged will have rendered that impossible at rate will also write to aunt if alive be sure to be there in first place will tell have become of there have be possibility of sending letter from time left home with exception of one written while crossing channel smuggler promised to deliver on return must think that be dead by time letter will at rate relieve anxiety in next place be most anxious to know if anything have be heard further from smuggler gave solemn promise in event of death letter acknowledging that be murderer must be sent to magistrate of weymouth have reason in world for supposing that be dead for be not above middle age if a be too probable such letter have be received can not return home might however return to london thence take ship to foreign country to united state to south america perhaps to own colony of canada make way there enlist in english army might stay here might stay here count a be ignorant of russian have trade profession well see what must possibly do must not be long in picking up russian count said if must make up mind to settle down here until learn that innocence of foul charge have be completely proved there must be necessity for trade profession why monsieur suppose that countess be without heart must allow preserver of child to struggle for existence here anywhere else have more money than know what to do with have six estate in different part of russia have ten thousand serf however can settle nothing until receive answer to letter after will talk matter over seriously at rate trouble about future be reason have spoken to to day future be care can leave safely in hand be too good altogether count julian said russian checked with peremptory gesture of hand let have talk like mr wyatt will only pain deeply make think le well of than do now stephanie be to infinitely more than possession did assign to else that have in world must feel that balance of obligation be still against now let talk of other matter in first place about sending letter of course at present baltic be frozen port beyond be in hand of french sweden however be in alliance with despatch for england go up through finland then across ice to sweden by land to gothenburg thence by sea to england be round about journey be performed rapidly a there be english packet always ready to sail from gothenburg letter must under favourable circumstance be in england in fortnight must incline to advise to write in duplicate for packet might be captured by french privateer on way must be safer therefore to despatch copy of letter ten day after first send off in five week if go well may expect answer in meantime hope will find enough to amuse here although opera be closed there will be nothing like gaiety season still there will be dinner party club when feel that want change have estate five hour sledge drive from here consists largely of forest there be plenty of game elk bear if be fond of shooting can promise good sport thanks indeed count be quite sure that will not be tired of st petersburg in five six week time a for shooting feel at present a if must ever care to fire gun again certainly not to take life unless to satisfy hunger have seen so many horse dog die have felt so much pity for think that will ever bring to take life of dumb beast again be afraid became somewhat callous to human life have seen thousand of men die came somehow to regard a fate certainly during retreat came in most case a happy release from suffering must never to end see horse have fallen never to rise again starving dog lying by master body without having intense pity for poor creature who have through fault will of own come to grievous end doubt a sportsman count may consider a overstrained feeling be quite willing to admit that may be so can only say that at present must not fire at elk bear on condition can understand feeling have have cry of horse pulled down by wolf in ear for day can well imagine how sight of so much suffering day after day among thousand of animal must in time affect one next three week passed most pleasantly for julian day there be call to make excursion to various point to be undertaken dinner party nearly evening at count at house of friend at club found french almost universally spoken among upper class be everywhere cordially welcomed a friend of count

disclose suffice that obligation be great one regard a one of dearest friend day possibly lip may be unsealed must at present be content to take on sponsorship countess have gained strength rapidly there be ground for further uneasiness a to health be now able to take daily drive with child have become quite military enthusiast said to julian one day nothing plea so much a to look on at troop drilling st petersburg be indeed crowded with soldier new army be rising in part of russia great preparation be being made to recommence campaign in spring time upon foreign ground sacrifice be too great to demand from people noble merchant vied with other in amount of contribution a be certain that austria probably prussia must join alliance hope be entertained that power have dominated europe for so many year must be finally crushed already serious disaster have fallen upon france in spain be probable that ere long whole of peninsula must be wrested from that must be threatened with invasion in south a well a in east in spite therefore of terrible loss calamity have suffered russia looked forward with ardent hope expectation to future chapter xvi unexpected meeting frank wyatt work throughout campaign have be arduous in extreme be true that be done on horseback instead of on foot that have not hunger to contend against that for most part night be passed in shelter of kind from daybreak until sunset frequently till midnight be incessantly occupied from moment when napoleon turned back on moscow until last remnant of army crossed frontier until after battle at malo jaroslavets on th of october when french army owed safety solely to kutusow refusal to hurl force against have remained at headquarters where be assisted in work by earl of tyrconnel who be now also acting a aide de camp to sir robert wilson be delightful companion most gallant young officer fast friendship became established between frank during time russian army be remaining inactive while napoleon be wasting precious time at moscow unable to bring to acknowledge absolute failure of plan caused by refusal of russian to treat with after occupation of ancient capital after kutusow have allowed french to slip past saw little of other for one other of be always with troop pressing hard on french rear being duty to keep sir robert who be necessarily obliged to stay at headquarters thoroughly informed of be going on in front of movement of french russian division sir robert be so utterly disgusted with obstinacy almost seemed deliberate treachery of kutusow for most part accompanied general benningsen who be prompt dashing soldier who with whole of russian general be a furious with apathy delay of worn out old man who be in command a have be with of barclay english general still acted a emperor special representative kept fully acquainted with be going on alexander be a much dissatisfied a be general soldier with kutusow refusal to put end to terrible struggle by action must have ended in destruction capture of napoleon army felt however that must not at present remove from command kutusow be member of old nobility who be straining nerve for national cause be stripping estate of serf emptying coffer into military chest who must have greatly resented removal people at large too overjoyed at retreat of napoleon success of arm ignorant of real circumstance of case regarded kutusow with enthusiastic admiration alexander felt great a might be fault injury must be inflicted by supercession must be greater than benefit derived from ample supply of horse have be placed at disposal of english general aide de camp frank having three always at order be able to ride by turn therefore got through immense amount of work scene everywhere met eye be far more trying than fatigue have to undergo hideous barbarity be perpetrated by peasant upon french who fell into hand filled with burning indignation at time placed life in serious danger when endeavoured to interfere on behalf always started on ride in morning with saddle bag stored with provision small keg of spirit fastened behind be divided during day among unfortunate men russian french alike who wounded exhausted have sunk by way illustration last of veteran of napoleon grande armee innumerable be appeal made to daily to end suffering with pistol ball although must not bring to give relief craved on several occasion when saw that case be altogether beyond hope few hour of mortal agony remained yielded to entreaty handed one of pistol walked few pace away until sharp report told that suffering be over horror of hospital at wilna other place affected even more than scene of carnage that have witnessed at borodino at wilna earl of tyrconnel be seized with fever died frank lay for time ill must probably have succumbed have not sir robert obtained lodging for at house of landed resident three four mile from infected city be in sense thankful for illness because spared sight of last agony of broken remains of napoleon army quiet rest soon did work breakdown be result more of over fatigue of horror of be so continually witness than of actual fever frank therefore rapidly recovered declared after fortnight that must again sit on horse general however must not hear of will be leaving for st petersburg in few day said will travel together by post will be sorry to hear that to day kutusow have be decorated with great order of st george emperor begged not to be present called into cabinet confessed to that must be too humiliating to be to be there acknowledged that felt by decorating man with great order be committing trespass upon institution have choice be cruel necessity to have to submit although well knew that marshal have done few thing ought to have done with nothing against enemy that must avoid that success have be forced upon sir robert have urgent need of change rest responsibility upon shoulder have be tremendous emperor have relied upon entirely for information a to true state of thing in army russian general regarding a specially emperor representative have poured complaint into ear have received slightest encouragement from must have led division against french in spite of order of marshal be with greatest difficulty that persuaded to restrain exasperated troop to submit to carry out disastrous policy entailed a much loss suffering upon russian soldier a upon french be end of january when sir robert wilson frank reached st petersburg putting up in apartment assigned to in palace rested for few day one bright morning frank strolled down to noble club of general have be made honorary member be first visit to st petersburg fur coat be partly open showed british uniform be looking about with interest at scene in nevsky prospect when noticed gentleman in handsomely appointed sledge looking fixedly at a uniform attracted general attention thought little of after going short distance sledge turned passed at slow rate of speed gentleman again gazed fixedly at then stopped coachman leaped from sledge to pavement frank exclaimed be be dreaming frank stepped back pace in astonishment be voice rather than face that recognized julian burst from lip brother can be really julian held out hand stood for moment in silence gazing into other face julian be first to break silence jump in here frank said leading way to sledge must think that have gone mad will have crowd round in minute still completely bewildered frank followed brother drive out into country julian said to coachman a took seat be little short of miracle old fellow said a drove off thought be living quietly at weymouth thought be rotting in french prison here run against other in heart of russia can hardly believe even yet that be julian have altered so tremendously thank god old man have found thank god dear frank that a see that stupid business of mine have not prevented entering army a be afraid must do though how come to be here be more than can guess be general wilson aide de camp have be with through war julian what on earth be doing here first of suppose have not heard that have be cleared completely of charge of murder julian face paled at sudden news sat for minute two in silence quite cleared frank asked in low tone cleared so that doubt remains that can go home without fear of having thrown into face completely entirely frank replied be cleared before have be gone day coroner jury brought in open verdict warrant be issued against poacher markham letter first confession year later completely bore out evidence at inquest established guilt beyond question to think must never have known julian said if have dreamt of must have attempted to break out from verdun make way home know must have succeeded at rate must have tried tell about frank story will keep just at present seem to have fallen on leg anyhow frank remarked may ask if be imperial highness sledge have learned something of value of fur since came out here that coat of yours be certainly worth hundred pound sable rug a much more be not sledge be rug though have two three of quite a handsome coat be own sledge belongs to intimate friend count woronski with whom be at present staying really must tell story first frank said laughing now that know be cleared can very well wait to hear detail refuse to say word until have told what mean well frank julian said seriously mine be not altogether pleasant story to tell now acted for best under belief that there be chance of being able to return for year to england story be too long for to give detail now will give broad fact be sent prisoner to verdun be there about ten month there be fever in place died off like sheep there seemed possibility of escape if must have got away must not a thought make for england be getting hopeless desperate think must have held out much longer then there be offer made to that of who liked must obtain freedom by enlisting in french army be expressly stated that be going east at end of campaign must if corp be ordered to place where be likely to come in contact with english be allowed to exchange into regiment with destination well seemed to that mattered very little what became of even must be exchanged sent to england must not have stayed there must have gone abroad to make living a best must thought might a well go a soldier to russia a anywhere else so accepted offer little knowing what must come of regretted heartily when saw misery be inflicted by misconduct partly of french much more of pole german on unfortunate inhabitant however there be did duty to best of power when tell be in ney division may imagine that have share of extraordinary frank said to think that must have be through campaign on opposite side why must have be within musket shot of other score of time have doubt saw julian said for often made out bit of scarlet among dark mass of russian thought that there must be english officer with first time noticed be on height opposite to smolensk two officer in scarlet be with battery planted there drove own off hill on side of river be general julian have only joined two day before still be a much in dark a ever what have said explains how come to be in russia doe not at explain how came to be here like be on day after got past russian be strong place with hard name jaro something other next day a be marching along came across overturned carriage coachman woman be lying dead on nearing heard little cry stepped out from side of company be sergeant be marching on flank found among cushion little girl about six year old who be already almost frozen to death fastened on to back under cloak carried along with came round be dear little creature well carried through retreat sometimes when there be alarm have time to stow away in one of waggon when there be not went on back into middle of fighting know be pretty rough occasionally however of seemed to posse charm against ball got on right until day before be to arrive at berezina then went out foraging with companion got into hut lit fire must not leave so started alone with lost way be found by lot of peasant who must have made very short work of child stepped forward like little queen told that be countess of woronski that father be friend of czar that if sent to must get great reward thinking that be good enough took to village dressed up in peasant clothes kept there fortnight then head man village papa came with here by post child father mother have given up a dead gratitude to be boundless have be deemed unadvisable to say anything about ever being with french be simply introduced by count a english gentleman whom regard a very dear friend sent letter home to aunt fortnight since if have heard that charge of murder be still hanging over must probably have remained here for good count have already hinted that there be estate at disposal be a rich a croesus countess must be terribly hurt if be to refuse to accept token of gratitude have other child stephanie be of course apple of eye well have have luck julian did think that if once got out of prison must be likely to fall upon foot because always have knack of making at home anywhere have idea of anything like well think be to blame for having entered french service rather than remaining prisoner especially a be a far a knew cut off from returning home still agree with that be a well not to talk about at present be marvellous to think that be with ney through that fighting doings of rear guard be can assure subject of warmest admiration on part of russian sir robert wilson considers that retreat from smolensk be one of most extraordinary military exploit ever performed so be made sergeant after borodino well julian to win stripe among such body a ney led be slight honour received frank not so much for valour a for taking thing took from pocket cross of legion of honour frank be honour napoleon sent to ney pinned on breast must rather that have be wellington who sent say picton who pinned on be big honour none le at rate be not won in fighting against own countryman document be wrapped up in be official guarantee received on enlisting must under circumstance be called upon to serve against english have right to be proud of cross julian must be proud of british officer a be how do say that got for taking thing easy be not exactly for taking thing easy for keeping up men spirit discipline be getting terribly relaxed be losing military bearing altogether lot of non commissioned officer be talking round fire suggested that must start marching song again a used to do on way through germany must cheer men up get to march in military order time shorten road ney of staff happened to be within hearing praised idea much more than deserved however men took up effect be excellent other regiment followed example there can be doubt that for time did have good effect ney reported business to napoleon who issued order praising grenadier of rhone for example have set army bestowing legion of honour on ordering that henceforth marching song must be sung throughout army however singing be dropped at smolensk after leaving there be reduced to such handful that have not heart to sing did work for believe that improvement effected by singing in morale of ney troop have at least something to do with being able to keep together to lessen fatigue of terrible march now tell more about how be that have wonderful luck to be chosen to accompany sir robert wilson a aide de camp be to suggestion when first joined julian to nearly year steady work on part got gazetted into old regiment th light dragoon at same time told that if a be already anticipated russia broke off alliance with napoleon be likely to be offered former position of british commissioner at russian headquarters said that if by time came off have got up russian must apply for to go with so got hold of russian pole in political exile gentleman awfully good fellow took with down to canterbury where depot be worked five six hour day with steadily so that when at outbreak of war sir robert got appointment be able to apply for upon ground have thoroughly good colloquial knowledge of russian always be beggar to work frank brother said admiringly worked for bit pretty hard at verdun got up french well enough to pas with then see there be other mortal thing to do knew that must be useful to if ever saw chance of escape of course at time have idea of enlisting must have be different thing altogether for young officer to give up amusement a must have done to slave away at crack jaw language like russian required little self denial have doubt julian work soon became pleasant may remember in old day used to say must say 'no while must not be true enough frank be great as in day think that now have learnt something must think have julian frank said looking closely at brother expression of face have very much changed certainly look a if must say 'no very decidedly now by time have after long drive re entered city must come home with first frank must introduce to count countess to stephanie then to morrow morning must come round early have heard nothing yet a to how truth about murder came out so rapidly seemed to that evidence be conclusive against that even letter wrote telling about be so improbable that one aunt must credit in slightest did look ugly at first julian when heard faulkner deposition must see way out of must not suppose that dying man must lie absolutely sure of innocence a be must make head tail of matter be mansion certainly have fallen on good quarter leaving fur coat in hall went upstairs found countess seated in arm chair count be reading last gazette from army to stephanie be

weight told heavily upon tear come into eye of countess time think of be act of self devotion beyond word altogether beyond understanding of who know not how terrible be suffering endured on march be indeed terrible count frank said gravely be agony for to witness can not share wonder how brother supported extra weight even of little daughter came through safely while ten of thousand of men not so burdened fell died along road julian did not understand what be being said guessed by face what be speaking of suppose be saying that be hard work carrying child broke in in english can tell that believe aided to get through gave something to think of besides snow distance russian be always cheerful bright merry talk lightened way in addition to that warmth of body against back by day curled up in arm at night greatly helped to keep life in think that be largely due to got through safely where many men a strong a died count looked inquiringly at frank who translated what julian have said

that must not go back to england even if escaped that be practically friendless in world have not acted a did might have died at verdun think that even severe moralist must be able to find fault with decision so be one of ney hero well frank when war be over bitterness between two nation have passed away will have good cause to feel proud of having be one of unconquerable band troop have ever gained greater glory by victory than have by retreat besides to have won stripe in such company to have received legion of honour from ney be a high honour a soldier must wish for at same time think
