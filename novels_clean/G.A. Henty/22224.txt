that two fellow have be expelled town for must never have felt easy a to edgar safety so long a be here few minute later party set out edgar valise be fastened to saddle of one of sheik follower road ran along sandy dune divided low country formerly covered by lake mareotis from sea a soon a be well out from town horse be broke into gallop while in point of actual speed even best arab horse can not hold own against moderate english race horse whose greater height longer stride give advantage be greatly superior in last posse extraordinary endurance stamen brought up a if belonging to family of owner intelligence have be cultivated a have that of dog be exceedingly docile affectionate pace be very easy one edgar be delighted indeed at manner in new acquisition flew along without apparent exertion continuing pace without check until reached arab encampment in hour twenty minute from leaving alexandria here leapt from horse in front of group of black tent oasis be of small extent extending two hundred yard across in centre be group of thirty forty palm tree near herbage be thick gradually dwindling away until became lost in sand in centre near tent be well irregularly shaped

called to one of arab boy take beauty first went on to edgar be best that talked to little gave sweet will soon get to love be well that must hear voice a often a possible will lead out edgar replied then mulick can tether will know time how to do then patted arab glossy neck rubbed ear praised giving handful of sweet while did so beauty evidently appreciated attention replied to by low whinny then took off saddle led to spot mulick pointed out then watched boy tether took off bridle carried back to tent woman came out from largest of be not veiled for except when go into town bedouin woman seldom conceal face ayala sheik said be young white lord who saved sidi from who attacked henceforth be a one of tribe may blessing of allah fall upon woman said sidi be only child have be taken from life must have be desolate indeed be very glad happened to come along at time edgar said have be most fortunate occurrence for a much indeed a for sidi have friend of own age will be great pleasure to to have a sort of brother be sure that will get on capitally together besides husband have given grand horse such a must never have obtained for money sidi will be able to teach arab way daresay will be able to show something of custom life edgar be now shown tent have be newly erected for use furniture be simple consisting only of handsome eastern carpet covered ground pile of rug for sofa bed hanging from one of stick supported tent be porous jar of water when have hung up rifle pistol powder horn bullet pouch furnishing be complete be tribe asked sidi a came out from tent oh tribe dwells in large oasis hundred mile to south fifty mile west of cairo there be other portion of tribe dwelling not far from same spot can ride five hundred strong when go to fight berber of morocco father be only sheik of section there be generally six tent left here to keep possession be often away for month find that can buy such good a tribe requires cheaper at alexandria than at cairo where indeed often go for ill blood exists between authority there who ventured on complaint to send out party of mamelukes against beat back handsomely have to leave oasis for time a must not withstand force must be sure to send against be thirty year ago filled up well cut down palm tree well be soon cleared out again palm grove have grown up have not interfered with again even now care not to visit cairo though may be that matter be altogether forgotten there edgar remained fortnight with new friend enjoyed life much took lesson from sidi in hurling lance discovered that must need long practice indeed to enable to do so with accuracy shown by arab also practised with rifle pistol when left gave warm invitation to sidi to come stay with however arab lad declined must not be comfortable in european dwelling said must be miserable sitting on one of chair father be busy so be must be altogether out of element might have said same thing here sidi oh be easy to fling off restraint to throw on sand to ride shoot hurl spear be sport that can enjoy a much a do will come over often see ask to stay edgar saw that be better not to press matter at rate for present in time when sidi became more accustomed to european way might perhaps come to stay if came now must be penance rather than pleasure after time young arab rode over frequently leaving camp at daybreak arriving in time to spend long day with edgar sometimes rode together sometimes walked along sea shore sidi soon learned to enjoy a much a friend row sail on water to be at first altogether novelty merchant possessed several boat used in business pretty gig carried sail in went off to visit ship brought good for be at other time at edgar service have learned even before going to school to manage therefore be unnecessary to take anyone with sidi at first did not take kindly to oar trained to hard exercise on horseback in sport of tribe have yet great aversion to anything like steady labour be unable even to understand edgar willingness to exert at oar when must have have men to row about in time however when have mastered initial difficulty of art took to exercise often spent whole day in boat coasting along aboukir bay more often shooting on lake arrival of british fleet have created quite excitement in alexandria news brought that large french fleet have left toulon carrying many thousand of troop destined be believed to operate in egypt have caused intense feeling of dismay among british merchant settled there corresponding exultation among french will french fleet be stronger than sidi asked a edgar leant on parapet looked at long line of british ship there may be more of very likely there be edgar said carelessly that make matter be sure to thrash in first place always do so somehow in next a fleet be commanded by one of best admiral have there be fear of being beaten only fear be that fleet may fall in with french until have landed troop troop must not stand against mamelukes sidi said scornfully must soon drive into sea be not so sure of edgar said doubt mamelukes be splendid horseman suppose be a good a in world horseman can not win battle alone french infantry be very fine doubt whether number of horseman must break square then artillery be immensely superior to of egyptian will give very great advantage if fleet meet beat how must ever get back again expect mean to stay here hold country edgar said know what good must do to still suppose think must must not take trouble to come over if must take country must be very bad for men like father for must be sure to put english in prison must be ruin of business must put in prison know expect so must hold english a prisoner must come out to will be quite safe there if soldier came must never catch must move about anywhere know place where water be to be found must only die of thirst if went after into desert well hope that be not going to be so sidi if french must land here must like very much suppose must fight against french if came to take egypt of course must then must see fight with against must be very jolly sidi must like nothing better of course will have to do a father tell expect must shut up place get good on board ship go away till be over if be able doubt must want to go with that evening edgar learned that have rightly guessed step that father must take in case french army landed be awkward business lad said of course if nelson come up with french fleet may hope that will come out right if before catch manage to land twenty thirty thousand troop position here must be most serious one intend to charter petrel have just discharged cargo brought here will put most valuable good on board at once especially egyptian carpet other oriental work so that within few hour of hearing that fleet be off coast must be ready to sail for england of course there must be end to business here so long a french remained in egypt doubt british subject must lay hand on must be thrown into prison just a be case when occupied holland must not however propose to shut up house altogether for although a english must be seized thrown into prison place closed france be not at war with germany muller must carry on shipping business without interruption own name being substituted for mine must instruct to do trade with interior everything will be turned topsy turvy trade of sort must be at end on other hand with french master here considerable number of french italian ship will be coming in with store of kind will often need supply repair so on a have men capable of doing anything in way of refitting muller must keep thing going carry on business must pay expense must probably leave margin of profit at rate house must not go to wreck ruin business be entirely lost think french occupation must be likely to last very many month may be sure that there must be great effort made at home tremendous fleet must be sent out here difficulty of bringing in store reinforcement for army must be enormous possibly too may land army certainly must nowhere fight french so advantageously a here must be case of india over again a long a be superior at sea a must bring troop here more safely more expeditiously than must however that seems to best arrangement can make if french land to must make great difference for a know have arranged to sail in three week for england only alteration must be that must accompany instead of staying here even putting aside fact that must be made prisoner must if stayed here be hindrance rather than help to business muller must carry on a purely german firm while if be here must be evident that have merely left temporarily that be representative must be fatal to muller doing business with french see that although must say must rather stop to see fun mr blagrove smiled suppose must see much of in case edgar however be out of question daresay correspondent in london will be able to take into office get situation of same kind elsewhere so that if stop in england year will not be wasting time however french have not come yet can hardly think that can intend to undertake expedition where even if fleet be not strong enough to do so at once will ere long certainly be raised to point when will completely cut off from france even if come father may not succeed in conquering egypt think that mamelukes will be able to make head against know how strong french be even if come in great force if mamelukes be well handled edgar ought to be able to prevent from advancing far inland ought to hang in cloud round driving in cavalry whenever ventured to leave shelter of infantry fire ought to harass night day prevent obtaining supply of sort be afraid that nothing of kind will be done mamelukes have be spoilt be so puffed up that believe to be invincible that have only to make grand charge to sweep french away however will make great difference to when be once fairly away for of course will not think of returning here until matter have settled down again french trader have have bad time of since war began most of left long ago for be so seldom that vessel got through cruiser that must not rely upon regular supply of good of course there be many small shopkeeper who take good of retail out to native importer left be afraid be going to be turn now be unless nelson manages to intercept fleet very easy matter for might land anywhere along coast between syria imagine that descent will take place near town for from must follow fresh water canal to point where flow from nile so on to cairo may however land at damietta rosetta mouth of river still think that be more likely to come here seeing that ship must more closely approach shore british fleet remained few hour off alexandria short peace of campo formio have caused greater portion of british fleet to be recalled from mediterranean be not until french preparation be almost complete that news reached england that vast number of transport have be collected by french at various port that provision of kind be being put on board be rumoured that army be about to embark for unknown destination nelson be at once sent off with fleet to blockade toulon from port be evident that men of war intended to guard great fleet of transport must start arrived there on first of june only to learn that french fleet have set out three day previously idea that egypt be destination have not entered mind of british minister although nelson have be furnished with instruction a to course to be taken in case of almost contingency have never be even discussed french fleet consisted of vessel of line frigate corvette despatch boat of with exception of few of smaller vessel be furnished by toulon here too men have embarked in transport be to be joined by transport from marseille from corsica from genoa from civita vecchia bringing up total to transport carrying men in one arm army be extremely deficient a only horse must be put on board of be for cavalry of whom however took with saddle bridle rest be for artillery train nelson started at once in search of enemy having clue to direction have taken be able to obtain news of whereabouts until heard that have captured without resistance island of malta then returned with speed imagining for first time possibly be object of attack made for alexandria on arrival there heard that nothing be known of french movement although in fact fleet be on day lying at anchor off cape harzet twenty league to west supposing therefore that must after have sailed for coast of syria constantinople steered for alexandretta learning that after having captured french fleet have sailed to candia left for rhodes searched everywhere through island of archipelago be only when anchored off cape matapan southern extremity of morea that first learned that french army have landed in month before object of french expedition be vast one mean with be undertaken be insufficient for execution difficulty in way be infinitely greater than have be supposed in paris bonaparte have be chosen for command principally because directory feared that great popularity of victorious general must render formidable to knew already that be by mean favourably disposed towards be therefore anxious to remove from public eye napoleon on part be perfectly aware of reason for be appointed to command accepted under belief that vast amount of glory be to be gained must plan of directory be entirely carried out india wrested from english name must be placed by side of alexander in history already negotiation have be carried on for time with tippoo sahib commissioner have be despatched to alliance proposed against british power have be greatly overrated by french feeble idea be entertained of enormous difficulty of scheme proposed be that after completely subduing organizing egypt must march through syria damascus thence to head of persian gulf thence down through india account have be taken of enormous difficulty of journey there be thought of powerful warlike people of northern india only idea be to revenge total overthrow of french power in india by british to re establish on firmer wider base than ever so not only to humiliate pride of england to obtain monopoly of trade of east news possibly french fleet might at moment appear before port spread greatest dismay throughout native population be furious foreigner scarcely dared to show in street mr blagrove edgar be busy from morning till night on day after british fleet have left in transporting good from store to ship have be chartered be quite possible that be needle merchant said to edgar when sat down to hasty meal late in evening think that be almost absurd although mean to leave anything to chance be purely surmise that french expedition be intended to operate against egypt seems to that greece syria be much more likely to be destination have just have letter put into hand brought by captain of small maltese trader be from correspondent in malta state that french fleet have appeared off island summoned knight to surrender that be thought probable that demand will be acceded to said that sent line by little coaster intended to sail late that evening be taking cargo of grain for alexandria that certainly look a if expedition be intended to operate farther east for malta be altogether out of way for fleet coming from toulon hither still be just a well to continue work there be naturally enough violent ferment among native population may not improbably find vent in fanatical attack upon christian at rate will get rest of good of value on board then await event by next evening preparation be completed ferment have now somewhat cooled down people be beginning to think that excitement roused by mere vague report be absurd next morning at breakfast mr blagrove said to son think edgar that a thing have quieted down be beginning to hope that scare be altogether unfounded must be just a well that must ride over to friend in desert stay night there come back to morrow must think strange discourteous if be to leave suddenly without communicating with a hope absence will be of short duration must be very sorry to give people so well disposed towards ground for offence return by to morrow evening in extremely remote possibility of french fleet being made out before time must embark at once if only for mother sister sake must be madness to wait here simple madness even putting aside certainty of captivity for very long period be by mean improbable that there must be sudden rising on part of population massacre of foreigner consider contingency so remote that be scarcely worth speaking of if french fleet must arrive during thirty six hour that will be away be obliged to embark sail off must stay with arab friend see have l worth of good on board petrel loss must be extremely heavy one for have besides l in cash will leave l in muller hand will be ample for need a there be very heavy stock of ship store in warehouse will of course instruct to supply with money that may require understand regard a extremely improbable be just a well to make arrangement for contingency then must french fleet come in sight can embark on board petrel set sail without great anxiety on account more to relieve mind than because think there be reasonable ground for thinking necessary here be fifty pound in gold have best sew up securely in band of trouser to night will be no great trouble will be safer there than if loose in pocket a edgar rode away next morning must not help thinking that must be great fun if french be to arrive before returned thought of year two passed in stuffy office in london be not agreeable one while be to stay with bedouin might have life of excitement adventure doubt other tribe must fight against invader impelled in first place by intense love of independence in second because invader be christian thought of dashing charge of skirmishing with french cavalry of pursuit of flight be very fascinating to high spirited lad of seventeen after indulging in fancy for time sighed a thought how small be chance of becoming reality be heartily welcomed on arrival at oasis news that sidi have brought of visit of british fleet fact that be in search of great french fleet carrying army might possibly be intended for invasion of egypt have created great excitement in camp do think can be true sheik asked that so wild idea can have come to people a to think that must conquer country can not say edgar replied if did come must be very formidable opponent for have conquered many country in europe soldier be well trained disciplined will have great number of gun father think that can hardly intend to come here for if landed must soon have enough ship of war here to prevent return must be cut off from france altogether there be news of fleet except that have arrived at island of malta whither sailed thence know not fleet have gone in search of will fight when find if must escape must really come hither father will embark on board ship have loaded with most valuable good will at once sail for england be for reason have ridden over morning if must go departure will be very sudden for must get up anchor a soon a french fleet be made out in distance at rate a soon a became dark enough to hide departure must have be sorry indeed to go without saying good bye to for how long will go brother sidi asked until trouble be over here might be only two three month might be a many year will be glad to go back to own country sheik asked indeed there must have to work in office in london must be very dull while here work be light have amusement have friend here why not stay behind with until father return know that must be most welcome that must gladden heart to have with must like above thing sheik edgar said warmly thank most heartily for invitation of course must do a father wish think best that must go to england if french come for must keep a prisoner must seize good merchandise however doe not seem to likely that french will really come here be only because considered that be just possible might do so that suggested must come over stay here until to morrow afternoon lest if must have to leave suddenly might not think that have forgotten in haste to be off for wish must stay here suppose that if french came must fight must fight with tribe assuredly will fight sheik said why must frank come here to molest love not turkish rule much be in way molested assuredly arab through desert will ride against aid mamelukes to drive into sea how great army must bring against hear from officer of fleet that news received in england said that men be preparing to embark for unknown destination thirty thousand sheik said scornfully why there be mameluke cavalry fully infantry janizaries spahis besides levy of whole population desert tribe can put horseman into field will never dare to come against unless with force very much larger than speak of be not against egypt that expedition can have sailed be what father think edgar said not because of force must bring against because must know that might be cut off at time from returning by fleet position must then become desperate have long blockaded in own port if be not strong enough to get out of still le must be able to leave egypt let not talk more of sheik said contemptuously be dog if come hither will know how to deal with chapter iii left behind sheik spoke few word to two of follower who at once mounted horse rode off will bring news if anything happens said will go into alexandria be late in evening when returned have news sheik said a came up to fire by be sitting moon be shining brightly lighting up wide expanse of sand round grove frank have come one said edgar sprung to foot with exclamation of surprise alarm when did come sheik asked when reached city be quiet man said except soldier be working at fortification when asked why be said that bedouin have come in two hour before with news that sea near cape harzet be covered with ship that be sailing way many did not believe story people soldier be ordered to work on fortification to bring up shot for great gun to carry stone to mend wall where be broken to prepare for defence sun be nigh half down when saw great many white dot on edge of sea be still league away when everyone pointed cried out 'it be enemy worked harder than ever be not for two hour that be sure that be ship when be so went a bade to english merchant be busy directing men who be going backwards forward to ship in harbour said to beaster sheik have sent to carry news must fleet of frank come here told to come to if did so a might wish to send for son 'it be too late ' said 'too late for son to come to be on point of starting now a see many of ship have already put to sea captain have sent to say that can not risk vessel by staying longer french will be here within two three hour although will not venture to enter harbour till daybreak must capture vessel going out tell son that regret much that let go away for day have thought that enemy must come so soon bid not be uneasy about for will be dark in hour french will not be up until two hour later will have hand full without trying to catch craft be putting out from here here be letter for be going to leave here in case returned ' five minute afterwards took place in boat be rowed off to ship saw men getting up anchor then sail be spread sailed out of harbour then not wishing to be shut up in town went out through gate rode to mound by sea shore be called marabout then got off horse to see what must happen be dark when frank vessel came along of sailed on towards harbour most of anchored let down sail presently one must see vast number of boat rowing towards shore when man have finished edgar opened note be handed to be written in pencil dear edgar in face of probability french fleet be in sight will be here soon after be dark city be in state of mad excitement captain of 'petrel have just come in saying that french be coming along coast from west must be on board before be dark for reason regret that be not with believe that will be quite safe with arab friend possibly may be more to liking than long stay in london take care of lad god bless affectionate father edgar first thought at hearing news have be regret that must not accompany father be very speedily succeeded by feeling of delight that must be enabled to witness stirring event be glad sorry sheik asked be much more glad than sorry replied father doubt be disappointed that be not returning home with must on account have remained behind have be possible to join in time a be be fault a think stroke of good fortune now chief can accept kind offer of hospitality hope that if there be fighting that will ride by side of sidi arab smiled gravely that assuredly will do be a say one fault will of allah have left in charge doubt not that good fortune will befall thereby now what think be meant by frank landing at marabout instead of sailing on to attack port mean doubt that be going to assault city by land probably know how weak be fortification fear that fleet might suffer much injury from gun may therefore prefer to attack from land side can take city way have doubt that can gun must blow in gate in very short time moreover from high ground near pompey pillar must harass defender of wall if chose make breach in wall be very old in many place in bad state of repair must go into city aid in defence sheik asked there will be no entering from side sheik french army will be between alexandria moreover gun from war ship will be able to sweep sand might pas round by south enter city from other side forty men must add little strength to defence must be far more useful a horseman when french begin advance how long will take think to capture town help can come down from cairo in week think that french will lose little time sheik so long a town hold out fleet might be attacked by nelson must come back way while a soon a have captured town light draught vessel must find shelter in harbour may be sure that must lose time in mounting gun from ship on fort render perfectly safe from attack say that bonaparte be in command of french be ablest general very active enterprising must not be surprised if capture place before sunset to morrow sheik made reply seemed to that edgar opinion that city have withstood many siege must be captured in few hour be too absurd to need argument there be nothing to be done now said let sleep to morrow before sunrise will make detour round south side of city approach eastern gate then decide whether to enter town not in few minute there be silence in camp long before sun rose everyone be astir woman be to be left with boy old men preparation be of simplest character of thirty eight men going hung bag of date at saddle bow looked to firearm mounted a oasis be situated to south west of city did not strike old bed of lake mareotis until half way along what have be south shore at present be silent in distant city sheik said shortly will wait till see what be going to be done presently two three arab be seen galloping across cultivated ground belonged to henedy tribe one of wildest most savage of people of desert when saw group of horse made way towards a sheik advanced few pace one of leapt from saddle came up to what have happened brother ben ouafy asked last evening frank began to land night continued to come ashore at midnight koraim commander of town went out to see what be doing at head of twenty mamelukes fell upon company of skirmisher charged killed many carried head of captain in triumph into town at five morning tribe arrived rode up near saw that have horseman cannon be divided into three column be marching towards town dashed in between column cut down many of skirmisher be only five hundred dared not attack column opened heavy fire that be forced to draw off sheik ordered to ride south to carry news to ramanieb that frank have landed may have sent news from town thought best to make sure 't be well sheik said arab threw into saddle again with companion rode south at gallop see sheik went on to edgar frank can not mean to attack town what must do without cannon must assuredly be desperate enterprise sheik think that may attempt seeing that be important to to obtain possession of port before fleet can return party remained sitting with patience of race until sheik must give order for to mount edgar got up several time walked backwards forward be le accustomed to waiting be burning for action just at eight o'clock there came suddenly to ear outburst of firing boom of cannon sound of crackling roll of musketry french have lost time in beginning said young arab nodded flush of excitement glowed through olive skin hand tightly grasped spear eye be fixed on distant city suddenly sheik raised vibrating battle cry of arab in whole of follower joined then at wild gallop dashed forward horse seeming to share in excitement of rider after maintaining pace for couple of mile reined in horse somewhat at canter swept along neck divided in old time lake of aboukir mareotis slackened down into walk a approached fresh water canal where stopped for few minute to allow horse to drink then continued at leisurely pace until mounted high ground at ramleh from here obtained view of eastern side of alexandria must hear din of battle on other side of town must see great fleet anchored mile from shore two mile to west of town wind have be blowing strongly night before have seriously hindered work of disembarkation of french troop have now subsided of men of war be engaging fort at so great distance that be evident that be demonstration to distract attention of besieged rather than serious attack four five ship under shortest sail be cruising backwards forward parallel with shore eastward of town occasionally white puff of smoke burst out from one other of shot be sent in direction of scattered band of horseman near shore after gazing at scene in silence for minute sheik turned horse rode back to spot near canal where moisture permeating through bank have given growth to luxuriant crop of grass here dismounted tethered horse four of arab be appointed to watch over safety rest reascended mound squatted down on sand gradually other party of horse gathered there sheik gravely consulted together have conviction that alexandria must hold out until help came from cairo question of entering town be discussed presently sound of cannon ceased rattle of musketry continued unabated why have gun ceased firing think sheik asked edgar be one of two thing sheik either french have got so close up to wall that cannon can no longer be brought to fire upon have stormed wall fighting be now in street of town there be two wall sheik said one known a arab wall inner defence be impossible that can have carried must seem so edgar agreed a musketry be a hot hotter than ever be evident that fighting be going on at close quarter that gun can not be fired have be captured see wall be in many place weak attempt have be made during past three four day to repair breach existed be very incompletely done be very much afraid that be a said that french have gained entrance hour later number of horseman followed by crowd of people on foot poured out from eastern gate one of leading horseman drew rein for moment a passed group of arab town be lost said frank have won way into street koraim have surrendered exclamation of fury broke from arab will be turn next ben ouafy said shaking spear towards city be beginning of work may take city sand will devour a knew that french have cavalry arab remained quiet stream of fugitive continued to pour past men woman child will return ben ouafy said at last will move south join rest of tribe then see what government of cairo be going to do capture of town have not be effected without loss menou column have attacked on right kleber in centre bon have moved round south of town arab wall be obstinately defended kleber menou be wounded a led grenadier to assault bon however have met with le resistance have captured inner wall before other column succeeded in doing so for time battle have raged in street captain of turkish vessel have be sent by napoleon to governor pointing out that further resistance must bring destruction upon town while if yielded french troop who came a friend to deliver from tyranny of mamelukes must do harm to anyone koraim thereupon capitulated be at once attached to general staff charged with maintaining order in town disarming inhabitant proclamation be at once sent out through country declaring that french have come to destroy mameluke domination that be friend of sultan of turkey protection be offered to village submitted did not do so must be burnt seven hundred turkish slave who have be delivered at capture of malta who have be extremely well treated be at once sent to home in tripoli algiers morocco syria smyrna constantinople being provided with ample sum of money to support on way measure have excellent effect koraim sent out messenger to arab tribe of neighbourhood influence among be great sheik for most part went at once into alexandria agreed to keep road open from alexandria to damanhour to sell deliver within forty eight hour horse dromedary camel be presented with dress of honour money by time transport have entered old port of alexandria be busy discharging cargo troop carried in short time whole french army be on shore scarce word be spoken among ben ouafy party on homeward ride sheik gave order on arrival will wait for day two said to edgar a dismounted french have cavalry must not come out here let see what other tribe be going to do be small body when two day later messenger arrived from koraim sheik after reading content of proclamation indignantly tore in piece tell koraim said to messenger hitherto have regarded a honourable man now spit upon a traitor others may do will fight against frank till last a soon a messenger have departed gave order for tent to be struck must be going sidi said of tribe may be taken in by promise may give aid to enemy in case must doubtless obey order to attack who refuse to do so three of can put four five hundred spear into field will move away at once with fifty men can not fight two thousand process of packing up occupied short time a soon a tent be made into bundle thirty camel be brought in loaded woman child took place on top of baggage then men mounted horse cavalcade started across desert way do travel sidi be not going direct there be few well distance be long between mounted men alone can do journey without difficulty be painful one with woman child never go way unless in case of great necessity will travel towards south east keeping near edge of cultivated country until reach nile then follow along river bank until within few mile of cairo thence be three day journey to south west there be well half way after proceeding ten mile perceived party of arab galloping in direction of alexandria changed course however soon came up with ben ouafy caravan two of sheik of party rode forward exchanged salutation with chief whither be journeying ben ouafy be going south to join tribe be going to alexandria be going there at once hast not news reached that frank have captured truly have heard so messenger came to morning saying that have come to deliver from turk inviting to go in thither see have not received message also received such message indeed word be idle for turk mamelukes have great love prey upon land enrich at expense frank must doubtless do same must rather be fleeced by of true faith than by kaffir come a friend ben ouafy smiled why must come a friend chief of oulad a'ly what have done for why must cross sea in ship at great expense much danger to save whom know not from turk might a well expect lion to come to rescue deer attacked by jackal might be true drive away must only be that might slay devour stag have heard of frank how have taken italy other country think that if must overpower osmanli defeat mamelukes that will say 'we have accomplished purpose have freed from oppressor now will sail back to france leave to manage own affair promise to respect religion sheik said to buy horse camel from at fair price to give rich present to treat with honour doubt doubt 't be easy to speak soft word when one need aid such promise be forgotten when object be attained to day be friend of arab to morrow will be master if aid kaffir against follower of prophet will well deserve may befall then will not go in to gathering to invite assuredly not even be for other reason must wait see what come of matter know not yet that will conquer mamelukes if fails to do so assuredly vengeance will afterwards fall upon who have assisted people sheik cast eye over ben ouafy cavalcade a if estimating strength saw however that contained a many armed men a have with if idea have entered mind of commencing campaign by plundering concluded must be at once abandoned have intention said of taking part with frank against government be going to sell horse camel frank money be a good a turkish moreover threaten to attack destroy who refuse to aid tribe life far away though indeed may abide here at time there be nothing of yours that can destroy have people to think of village flock herd horse therefore will go see great man hear what say will if can keep on term of peace with army so strong so fierce that have captured alexandria after four hour fighting be too formidable for arab chief to resist assuredly have thought of fighting on side against countryman sheik bowed courteously man have own way of looking at thing in matter like must do a seems best to go in peace may good fortune attend formal salutation be returned sheik rejoined party kept on course a before met there son ben ouafy said to sidi see how desire for gain influence men to evil deed in order to sell few hundred horse a many camel oulad a'ly be going to assist frank against true believer be true that may not be going to fight for animal that sell to will enable to fight come to same thing of course professes that be thinking of saving village from destruction must know well enough that frank have other thing to think of than to spread over country here give ample time to mamelukes to prepare for coming moreover a be clear that french have cavalry must not make excursion for if seized horse in alexandria must not suffice to mount party strong enough to assail tribe like oulad a'ly who can put nigh thousand horseman into field party travelled without haste before arriving on nile edgar suggested to sheik that must be a well be to discard european dress for arab one when be at damanhour said marked how people scowled at a rode through street a doubt will ride into cairo ere long must save trouble be to be so attired that must escape notice must be good plan sheik agreed daresay sidi can supply with suit can purchase what be needed at next place come to edgar said have money for necessity may arise even putting aside trouble of being constantly questioned must prefer arab dress for under baking sun think must be good deal more comfortable than english clothes accordingly at next town passed through sidi edgar went together to bazaar latter purchased after usual amount of bargaining clothes similar to worn by friend expense be small for costume of arab chief differed little from of follower except burnoose be of finer cotton silken sash of brilliant colour richer more showy with exception whole costume be white although of arab sheik wore coloured burnoose edgar chose white one a friend father wore that colour bought two three change of clothes for knew that water be often scarce that washing of garment must not be indulged in frequently that night when camp be pitched donned new costume placed pistol in sash in arab fashion sidi wound turban for gave instruction how clothes be to be worn have taken off be made into bundle so that must be resumed if necessary felt rather awkward a with friend sallied out from tent now shared between look well edgar sheik said approvingly will need to stain arm leg will be better for to stain face neck also for must attract quite a much attention a white arab a must in european dress be thinking so sheik will be much pleasanter for to be able to pas anywhere without comment be taller than thought sheik said have not struck that be much taller than sidi see now that be a tall a be suppose flowing garment make one look taller edgar said have often be surprised when standing near native who looked to good deal taller than to find that be really not above own height wife will make stain for a soon a can get material there will be difficulty about for often dye burnoose brown especially when be starting on long journey sheik wife other woman be voluble in expression of satisfaction at change in edgar have be little in town comparatively tight fitting european garment be in eye ugly unbecoming seen in more graceful dress of arab recognized for first time that guest be good looking young fellow tall active not ungraceful in figure that must even compare not unfavourably with sidi who be favourite with whole camp even men impassive a usually be uttered few word of satisfaction at edgar having adopted arab costume at appearance in on following day sheik taking son edgar two of follower left caravan rode on to cairo leaving others to travel by easy stage to join rest of tribe doubtless will find many other sheik assembled there said a rode along government be sure to have sent order already for bedouin tribe to hold in readiness to gather there to oppose advance of french levy of city neighbourhood will also be called out not so much perhaps to fight a to labour at fortification that will not ask of arab for arab must work like fellah will fight will leave to peasant to work mamelukes will however in first place oppose frank love not be oppressor of egypt lion of desert be not more courageous be proud of believe to be invincible will not believe that frank can stand for moment against know that night that frank landed twenty mamelukes rode out against killed many brought in head in triumph must not ask to charge with must deem shame to ask for aid in such encounter will be willing enough to accept help in cutting off fugitive in preventing others who may land from spreading over country then still feel sure that mamelukes will defeat french edgar said if be will of allah son mamelukes be not like people who defended alexandria be warrior arab be brave fear death when from time to time tribe refuse to pay annual tribute band of mamelukes be sent against truly son of desert can not withstand in combat even when much more numerous be destroyed forced to make submission men regard not a simple soldier be army of emir have two three slave to wait upon to groom horse polish arm dress be arm trapping be encrusted with gold gem carry wealth on person there be few who can not show hundred piece of gold while many can exceed that by ten time be true that be oppressor of people egypt have be drained of wealth for support yet who suffer from can not feel proud of be not follower of prophet be men like whom great sultan saladin led against christian host who strove to capture syria have tale how brave be how rode clad in steel from head to foot yet bone whitened sand true believer remained in possession of land mamelukes be men such a be until see contrary will not believe that can be defeated by frank hope that may be so sheik doubt in way valour be gun discipline of french will fear decide conflict chapter iv battle of pyramid little party have ridden few mile when saw party of five six hundred arab horse approaching sheik rode to meet after short conversation with leader returned need go farther for order said mourad bey with mamelukes a many janizaries be within few mile order have be sent to arab tribe to hasten to oppose march of enemy from part be riding doubtless brother who be great sheik of tribe of be branch be already on way to join will at once ride bring back fighting men caravan can proceed without guard even hostile tribe must respect at present time when be engaged with enemy will speedily overtake must not have started for hour after mounted can not have gone many mile before come up with riding at full gallop soon overtook caravan arab received with shout of satisfaction order leader gave to retrace step old men who be to proceed with caravan be told that in event of meeting with party hastening towards ramanieh to tell that order be to harass french a advanced to say that sheik fighting men be already engaged in work then after brief adieu to woman arab rode at full gallop towards river be on morning of th of june that french have taken alexandria on th of july that commenced march general dugua with kleber division have be taken by water to rosetta occupied without difficulty with large flotilla of boat carrying provision store proceeded up nile a far a damanhour at town main portion of army arrived after two day painful march french met with resistance owing to fact that almost bedouin near coast have accepted napoleon tempting offer nevertheless troop be already discouraged have expected to find rich fertile country with palm tree lovely town abundance of supply of kind nile be now at lowest during previous season have not a usual overflowed bank fertilized country consequently march lay through sandy waste dust rose in cloud under foot sun beat down upon suffered agony of thirst many dropped from exhaustion disappointment be great when found that instead of rich prosperous town damanhour be collection of hut affording mean of subsistence booty of kind beyond town large band of arab have gathered french army be obliged to keep rank a marched to maintain constant watchfulness to travel at slow pace in order that might not be separated from baggage general muireur be seized with serious fever result of heat thirst disappointment mounted horse on morning after arrival there rode out beyond outpost have gone short distance when party of arab hiding among bush sprang to foot poured in volley fell dead body be stripped arab mounting horse rode off before outpost must arrive on spot from time french dared not straggle man who left rank lagged behind be killed arab be seldom seen lay concealed behind inequality of ground clump of bush occasionally when there seemed to be opening horde of arab must sweep down always recoiled from steady fire of french infantry on th of july leading french division commanded by desaix reached ramanieh on nile here after terrible march french troop be seized with delirium of pleasure at seeing verdure on bank of river water disregarding order broke rank rushed wildly to stream into thousand of plunged in uniform in cultivated field great quantity of melon be found affording delightful food for since have left alexandria there have be nothing to eat biscuit have brought with many paid dearly for over indulgence in fruit number being prostrated with colic while not few died next day army rested horse needing halt even more than men for have not recovered from long confinement of voyage when started from alexandria scanty supply of water cloud of dust heaviness of passage across deep sand have caused death of large number have rendered rest unserviceable have learnt from native mourad with large number of mamelukes be in front of indeed on day of arrival there appeared in such force that french formed in order of battle outside town mamelukes rode backwards forward in front of line brandishing weapon threatening charge few round of artillery however speedily taught power of french gun retired to chebreisse french be not disturbed next day here army have satisfaction of being rejoined by dugua division with flotilla by fleet of boat from alexandria bedouin under sheik have taken part in irregular skirmish there be already a many arab a sufficed for cutting off straggler compelling french to march in military order sheik determined to hold small party together until opportunity for general encounter presented sometimes from crest of sand hill follower watched progress of dark mass of infantry march very slowly said to edgar why do not go on quicker fancy that be keeping pace with baggage train animal must be completely exhausted last night a followed came upon many dead horse know only safety be to keep together doubt not that men be well nigh a exhausted a animal even on horseback heat be terrible although have water skin well filled feel very much of course men on foot carrying musket ammunition knapsack must feel very much more think will go on faster after have left ramanieh will have nile by side will have want of water sand be firmer too moreover will be able to obtain what require from boat on evening of th french arrived at village near chebreisse at sunrise next morning battle began between flotilla egyptian gun boat have come down from cairo together with battery have be established on bank mamelukes sallied out from chebreisse charged down with such ardour that seemed a if be about to hurl on french infantry when within short distance however suddenly stopped horse checking almost instantaneously then discharged carbine retired a rapidly a have come repeated several time shell of french battery played havoc among never before have mamelukes encountered shell fire destruction wrought by novel missile bursting among caused to retire at full speed leaving three four hundred dead behind abandoning of gun have placed in position before chebreisse large arab force have be drawn up in front of town when mamelukes charged in readiness to follow latter a soon a have broken french rank be first opportunity edgar have have of seeing considerable body of famous cavalry acknowledged that nothing must be more superb than appearance splendour of dress beauty of horse magnificence of arm trapping excited admiration to highest now will see sheik said exultingly how will gallop over frank edgar said nothing sat watching splendid array a swept down upon french line of french division be formed up in square with artillery dismounted cavalry in interval volley of musketry received charging mamelukes be sufficient to quell ardour of boldest horseman in world in vain before drawing off circled round round french formation seeking for weak spot upon must hurl when at length drew off french soldier ran out from rank to plunder fallen in silence arab followed mamelukes chief did not say word until have ridden at leisurely pace distance beyond town be right said at last to edgar did not think that men on foot must have resisted that charge frank stood a steadily a if be flock of sheep be approaching cannon be terrible who must have thought that ball shoot must explode fly into piece when reach mark how be done edgar explained a well a be able nature of shell how when be fired fuse be lighted of length just sufficient to burn down to powder within ball at time reached object at be fired fight on river have be more severe have be maintained with great obstinacy at one time two gun boat be taken by egyptian however be recaptured admiral ship burnt admiral perre who commanded first flotilla be wounded by cannon ball loss on side be severe for eight day french continued to march forward suffered terrible hardship at time be almost in state of mutiny interminable extent of sand utterly dispirited came to believe that that have heard of egypt be false that have be deliberately sent there by directory to die doubted even existence of cairo in despair threw into river be drowned many died on march from sunstroke exhaustion than from despair at last pyramid came in sight spirit rose again for here be told whole army of mamelukes janizaries arab be assembled to give battle hoped therefore to terminate campaign at blow during whole march be harassed by arab many be cut off killed march be always performed at night at ten o'clock in morning halted for day preparing for slumber by dip in nile on st of july advanced from omdinar at ten o'clock made out enemy drawn up in line of battle have constructed large entrenched camp with forty piece of ancient cannon incapable of movement in camp be infantry janizaries spahis militia from cairo on right be mameluke cavalry strong with one two foot soldier to horseman to left of mamelukes between pyramid be arab horse french army be drawn up in same order a in last fight in great square of division left resting on nile right on large village napoleon with staff reconnoitered enemy entrenched camp by mean of telescope discovered that cannon be not upon field carriage be simply heavy ship gun have be taken from flotilla be served by sailor therefore must not be moved be evident that if infantry left camp must do so without gun entrenchment be not formidable have be begun three day before although might be impracticable for cavalry must offer serious obstacle to attack by infantry discovery that cannon be immovable decided napoleon in disposition for battle gave order that army must move across to right must thus be concentrated for attack upon mamelukes arab mourad bey seeing napoleon object at once ordered two third of cavalry to charge french while be in motion while others be to remain near entrenched camp so rapidly did sweep down that french square fell into confusion desaix with division formed head of column have difficulty in maintaining rank being somewhat broken by grove of palm tree through be passing however received mamelukes with so terrible fire of musketry grape shot that charge be not pressed home mamelukes however fought with desperate courage sweeping round french square even endeavouring to back horse into line of bayonet in hope of breaking wall of steel at length however must do more mourad with men rode off towards gizeh while rest not noticing way that have taken owing to cloud of dust smoke rode back to entrenchment french now pressed forward with speed division be thrown across plain so a to prevent horseman from retreating by line that mourad have taken latter seeing what have happened charged again again with mamelukes to endeavour to break opening through french by rest of force must join division of general bon menon advanced to attack of entrenchment infantry panic stricken at defeat of cavalry did not await attack after two three round of shot have be fired by cannon deserted position fled in wild confusion to river here succeeded in making way across by boat while many swam over mamelukes also attempted to swim horse few succeeded more be drowned total loss on egyptian side amounted to men including infantry cavalry slave of mamelukes prisoner be taken camel horse fell into victor hand great booty be captured by french soldier for day occupied in recovering body of drowned mamelukes amply repaid trouble a four five hundred piece of gold be often found upon besides jewel other valuable great bulk of le portable property have however placed on board sixty boat when battle be seen to be lost be set on fire content destroyed arab have taken little share in battle when mamelukes charged have be ordered to remain in reserve only to charge when latter have broken french square burning with impatience watched mighty torrent of horse sweep across plain then came roar of artillery incessant rattle of musketry then saw with astonishment cavalry recoil witnessed charge after charge then saw sweeping round square while plain where have first attacked be strewn thickly with body of men horse right up to bayonet of french line arab burst into cry of dismay nothing can stand such fire a edgar said to sidi musketry grape from cannon be mowing down like grass be terrible for time mamelukes be hidden from sight by cloud of smoke by dust raised by horse hoof then be seen to emerge there be mourad banner sheik exclaimed be making for gizeh surely can not be there there be not more than with then body of about equal strength broke out from dust of battle went towards entrenchment let join there arab shouted at full gallop rode across joined mamelukes then heralded by tremendous artillery fire french line advanced pouring heavy volley of musketry into cavalry upon defender of entrenchment in two three minute infantry be seen to be throwing away gun leaping from entrenchment flying in disordered crowd towards river have french possessed cavalry not one of fugitive must have escaped mamelukes seeing that be lost have ascertained that mourad have ridden towards gizeh now started to endeavour to rejoin while among arab cry rose to desert turning horse galloped away passed foot of pyramid out into desert where halted seeing once out of reach of fire of french gun there be fear whatever of being pursued be will of allah sheik said a party dismounted truly be right friend edgar know not how to fight who must have dreamt that men on foot must have withstood charge of five thousand horseman yet mamelukes fought a always bravely did indeed sheik edgar agreed did be possible for men to do against fire of infantry artillery horseman be powerless have infantry be a well trained a of french instead of remaining in entrenchment where must render assistance whatever marched against french infantry broken square mamelukes must then have be able to dash down upon not french soldier must ever have reached ship again without infantry horseman must hing then think that be lost edgar assuredly be lost for present sheik mourad bey party with may get away rest be penned in between french river few of will escape a for infantry be mere mob even if get away will never venture to stand against french napoleon will enter cairo to morrow there will remain number of horse will fall into hand of french will take many more in cairo before long will have cavalry a well a infantry then part of country will be safe from then be egypt to fall altogether under rule of french only for time fleet will soon return troop here will be cut off from country may remain here for time at last will have to go think that will send army out to fight against will know what strength be that can not be reinforced will find in long run although may have captured egypt be prisoner what must advise sheik asked understand way custom of frank while know more than little child thus see in matter be graybeard boy therefore speak freely what think will be best then must say sheik that best course must be to return at once to oasis french army will doubtless remain near cairo will send cavalry light artillery over country to search out enemy to reduce to obedience around alexandria will be quiet so long a french convoy be not attacked force there be not likely to interfere with peaceable people if return there will live unmolested can wait see how matter go if there be great rising against french will be open to to take part in at present hostility against french must only bring down vengeance may be that arab in great oasis to west will continue war in end will be sure to suffer by so doing think that advice be good sheik said sidi will return home at once with half follower will ride at daybreak with other half in one long day ride will reach spot where woman baggage have gone will escort back road will certainly be safe from frank who will for time be occupied with cairo though be hardly likely that town will resist ibrahim after destruction of mamelukes defeat of army can not hope to resist great attack for fortification like of alexandria have be suffered to decay french must assuredly soon force entrance however after march that have made will need rest for time road will be safe be not so with regard to arab whole country will be in confusion unarmed caravan might well be plundered by party of arab who met though must not interfere with be headed by sheik with armed follower therefore will go to fetch son will ride fast take possession again of home lest of neighbour finding deserted must occupy then trouble must follow accordingly next morning at daybreak troop divided rode off in different direction greater part of gathering have scattered evening before determined to return home wait event four day rapid travelling took sidi companion back to oasis found exactly a have left tribe in neighbourhood having be too busy in following french army picking up baggage left behind by break down of horse to attend to other matter next day sidi edgar rode into alexandria everything there be going on a peacefully a usual french soldier lounging about street number of labourer under direction of french officer be at work restoring fortification on sea face of town shop be open market be a well supplied a usual to edgar surprise good many french sailor be to be seen in street fleet can not have sailed said to sidi let ride out through east gate to ramleh may be of course that there be despatch boat lying in port though did not see one can hardly fancy that french admiral must have kept fleet here for nelson must sooner later get news of what have taken place be certain that when doe will hurry back at full speed from elevation of ramleh however french fleet must be made out lying in aboukir bay in long line hurrah edgar exclaimed there be mean to see battle sidi if have to stop here month can not be long before nelson arrives can not think why french admiral must have risked being caught in trap like when defeat must cut french army off from europe altogether what will do will go into town buy three four of arab blanket put up little tent here will share with sidi replied will send one of two men back tell to return with two more there will be four of to look after horse to fetch thing out from town a may require must like to see battle too must be something terrible to hear noise of so many great cannon inaction of french have never be satisfactorily explained admiral brueys bore high reputation a sailor be personal friend possessed complete confidence of bonaparte latter have given strictest injunction to sail for toulon a soon a have completed discharge of store that have on board instead of doing however anchored in aboukir bay there waited may have be that feared that napoleon might never reach cairo that might be defeated in great battle there that might be necessary for to return to port to re embark army other explanation be possible of delay in carrying out imperative order that have received after despatch of messenger two friend rode along shore until must not only make out exact position of french fleet count gun in broadside of vessel consisted of thirteen line of battle ship comprising flag ship orient of gun three of nine of together with four frigate four mortar vessel number of gun boat while on island ahead of line be battery of gun mortar many party of arab be riding about on shore there be several of encampment have be attracted to spot from considerable distance in order to view great vessel of report have reached others again be simply there from spirit of restlessness pervaded population news of battle of pyramid have not yet arrived be in suspense belief that mamelukes must defeat french be universal have taken place whole of arab tribe must at once have harassed retreat of defeated army with mamelukes pressing upon be probable that not single frenchman must have reached sea a edgar friend be watching french fleet vessel be seen over spit of sand be three mile out at sea there be of ship of war sidi wonder whether have be scouting along coast to gather news a to where fleet may be at present when came abreast of extremity of bay changed course bore closer in be coming in to join others wonder what news brings when however approached within two mile of french fleet again changed course bore along parallel with coast suppose be going into alexandria have got colour flying be curious too ship here be flying look there be men at mast head of several of ship examining with telescope be curious too for be not signalling there be turning again making out to sea perhaps be british ship sent on ahead by nelson to discover position of french if be so will most likely have fleet here to morrow then will see big battle at least will if french run away see there be twelve oared boat starting from admiral ship rowing right away must be going to alexandria be rowing hard too watched for time then returned to tent two hour later number of ship boat be seen coming out from alexandria be men of war boat edgar said think must have be right that vessel saw must have be english frigate boat have be sent to order sailor saw in street of town to return at once for hour boat continued to pas filled with men there be sign of movement on part of ship if be one of frigate french admiral must have made up mind to fight have got great advantage covered a be by two land battery besides know that there be spit of sand running out there will make very awkward for enemy not knowing position to attack there be one thing french will find difficult to sail out if want to see wind be on shore be riding head to there ca be much water inside doubt must get out right if have plenty of time one to interfere with must be difficult business to manage if british fleet be upon at ten o'clock next morning number of large vessel be seen in distance bore down towards alexandria wind be light made slow way be five in afternoon before having changed course formed into line of battle headed for french fleet scene from shore be intensely exciting in fleet there be thirteen battle ship french ship be larger more heavily armed carried forty six more gun weight of broadside be pound to pound while carried more men be ton heavier have too in addition four frigate besides mortar vessel gun boat battery on island of aboukir soon after six o'clock two leading vessel of british fleet being within range french opened fire a did gun of battery edgar uttered exclamation of disgust a one of largest of english ship be seen to stop suddenly in course have run on shoal exclaimed look ship be steering for head of french line mean to go inside a british vessel reached head of french ship anchored one after laying broadside to broadside against opponent battle commenced with terrible energy tremendous roar of gun astounding arab who be gathered on sand hill at first french reply be feeble be taken entirely by surprise by nelson manoeuvre believing that must only attack from outside have prepared only on hand for fight in clearing deck for action useless gear fitting have be piled over on other side be little time before must be cleared away gun got ready for action then for time fire be a heavy a of british nevertheless of have suffered terribly before be able to return shot contributed in small degree to british victory loss of culloden be vessel struck on sand of leander went to assistance be serious have french rear admiral villeneuve who commanded five vessel at rear of french line cut cable come to assistance of comrade eight british ship engaged with a many french must have be in serious position did not do so however possibly fearing to run ship aground consequently alexandria swiftsure came in to assistance of british ship of be being terribly damaged by greatly superior weight of french fire bellerophon dismasted disabled by enemy fire dropped out of line alexandria took place while swiftsure attacked franklin leander seeing how hard be fight relinquished attempt to get culloden afloat sailing in engaged in battle illustration battle of nile st august for time issue be doubtful three english seventy four gun ship be matched against one of hundred twenty two of eighty four darkness did not put stop to engagement continued to rage with unabated fury battle being practically between twelve british ship eight french ship of line four frigate gun boat by ten o'clock five of french van have surrendered great hundred twenty gun ship orient be in flame excitement of arab a battle continued be unbounded seemed to that mortal men must not sustain so terrible conflict exclamation of wonder admiration rose constantly among light of burning vessel enabled whole of terrible scene to be clearly witnessed ship be partly wholly dismasted rigging be cut to piece sail be riddled with ball splintered side bulwark shot away port hole blown into one showed how terrible be damage inflicted on side higher higher rose flame on board orient men must be seen leaping overboard into water from burning ship soon after ten blew up with tremendous explosion concussion of be so great that many of arab be thrown to ground for ten minute dead silence succeeded roar of battle not gun be fired on side british vessel near spot where orient have lately floated lowered what boat there be uninjured set to work to rescue survivor who be either clinging to spar be swimming several of too be hauled in at lower port hole of ship french ship franklin be first to recommence firing after few more broadside from swiftsure hauled down colour firing continued without abatement until three o'clock in morning then died away for time recommenced at six o'clock with fresh fury be not until two in afternoon that came to end villeneuve seeing that be lost now woke up cut cable three of ship ran aground with guillaume tell genereux two frigate made off there being only one british ship be in condition to make sail in pursuit two line of battle ship one of frigate be afterwards captured by british squadron thus of thirteen french ship of line eight have surrendered one have blown up two have escaped two be on shore if culloden must have got into action be probable that not one of french fleet must have left aboukir bay british loss in killed wounded be of french including wounded be captured perished in fight victory be most decisive be ever won at sea chapter v street attack not until last gun be fired did edgar arab friend return to tent utterly worn out by excitement watching told what must be sidi edgar said a went along be certain that must thrash be tremendous victory see be a important for a be for for french army be now cut off will be long time indeed before french can fit out fleet strong enough to have even chance of fighting ours a far a can see only possible escape for army be to march way round by syria to constantinople must think that after sultan will at once declare war with for by conquering egypt have taken one of province turned out to be case news of capture of egypt have filled sultan with indignation rage fear excited by success of french arm in europe deterred from declaring war against so formidable foe until report of destruction of fleet reached constantinople when at once plucked up courage declared war against france ordered two army to be gathered for reconquest of egypt news of destruction of french fleet caused intense excitement throughout egypt showed that french be not a many have be inclined to consider invincible that be improbable must be able to receive reinforcement from beyond sea week previously arab have felt completely crushed now feeling of independence hope sprang up again whole situation be at once changed sidi have directly fight came to end sent off one of follower to meet father to inform of what have taken place four day later man returned have met chief party just a have reached river latter have resolved at once to rejoin desert tribesman to escort caravan back to oasis wife woman animal be to remain there party now at encampment with sidi be to join at once sheik bid say messenger went on to sidi that must that must not wait until others be ready to start if be willing must at once ride with white friend to cairo if be disposed to go with there from knowledge of language of frank must be able to gain much information a to design bid regard a leader to act a may advise two of be to go with to look after horse begs that one of will come to base of great pyramid on twelfth day after left be in ten day from now to tell what news have gathered to consult with be convinced that news sent will call arab to arm again be just what must wish edgar said have be thinking for last four day must like to be at cairo be place of interest now friend talked matter over will be better edgar said that must go a simple arab that must take two horse of le value than now ride must send up by party will rejoin father a two young arab on ordinary horse must attract attention must encamp with two men just outside town go in out a pleased one must be likely to notice question might even wear dress of fellah must be safer still for if arab begin to make attack upon french party a be likely to do of wandering in street of cairo might be regarded with suspicion by soldier will do just a advise edgar suppose that have better start at once certainly a soon a have eaten meal will man who brought news in be fresh enough to start again at once certainly must sidi said in tone of surprise arab never feel fatigue on horseback of course must have fresh horse will pick out man to accompany two horse for there be two must suit well for be sound fast though poor animal to look at one will cast eye of envy upon be just what want sidi in le than hour be galloping across plain journey of mile be accomplished in two day party without entering town encamped on waste ground outside wall here be many small hut belonging to poorest class of population together with many small shelter tent of black cloth erected by party of wandering arab like have on previous night changed attire have nothing to distinguish from poorer class of arab who having given up desert life earned precarious existence in town two men with looked with disdain at surroundings edgar felt obliged to warn must remember said that lion couch before spring crawl conceals until be within reach of prey so be needful also for to bear humbly be come to see what french be doing how comport what be feeling among population be a spy who come to examine country before be attacked to carry out object must bear so that suspicion may not fall upon if be questioned remember that be four men ready to act a guard to caravan on such service may present leaving two men to look after horse edgar sidi entered city scene be intensely interesting cairo being vastly more oriental in appearance than alexandria narrow street be crowded strict order have be issued against plundering napoleon being anxious to win good will of population merchandise of sort be displayed in shop trade have special bazaar gold silversmith dealer in silk in carpet richly embroidered garment tobacco long pipe with jewelled mouthpiece narghile with long twisted stem worker in iron vendor of yellow shoe used by woman in walking dainty gold embroidered velvet slipper for indoors pointed upturned shoe of men have own bazaar scattered throughout street woman in long dark blue garment hideous white linen yakmash covering whole face below eye falling to breast moved through crowd others of higher rank seated on donkey attended by eunuch made way back from bath from visit to friend stout turkish merchant functionary rode along perched on high saddle looking a if must bear to ground little donkey that nevertheless went lightly along with burden french soldier abounded gazing into shop occasionally making small purchase chattering laughing fatigue suffering of march being now forgotten there be comparatively few of richer class in street many of having left city at approach of french while on night before latter entered there have be serious tumult in city house of many of bey have be broken into sacked through crowd edgar sidi wandered unnoticed doe not look a if there be strong feeling against frank sidi remarked a issued into large square be comparatively deserted seated on bench in shade of tree near fountain be not here that one must expect to find sign of disaffection doubt trader be doing good business for officer soldier will be sure to spend pay in present for at home in memento of stay here be sure thing be pretty enough to tempt anyone be in poorer quarter trouble will be brewing presently group of french officer came along seated at short distance from two young arab having not slightest idea that must understand what said talked loudly unrestrainedly thing be serious gentleman one of who be clearly of superior rank to rest said since news of most unfortunate affair arrived there have be great change in situation for last two day there have not be single horse brought into horse market number of bullock have fallen off so greatly that commissariat have difficulty morning in buying sufficient for day ration for army worst of be that assassination be becoming terribly common in last three day fifty two men have be killed there will be general order out to morrow that men be not to go beyond certain limit unless at least four be together that be not under pretext whatever to enter native house besides known to have be killed there be twenty three missing there be doubt too have be murdered body buried egyptian head of police have warned that there be gathering in lower quarter that belief that of mourad emissary be stirring people up to revolt good many party of arab be reported a having be seen near city altogether fear that be going to have serious trouble not that there be fear of revolt can put down without difficulty system of assassination be alarming if go on men will never be safe outside barrack except in main thoroughfare one doe not see how to put down open enemy one can fight there be discovering who fellow be in large population like must be of use inflicting fine on city for french soldier killed must affect only richer class trader there be doubt too that news that fleet have be completely destroyed have dispirited soldier who feel that for present rate be completely cut off from france be certainly serious general one of officer said there seems only project of invasion of india march to constantinople after march here though be little over hundred mile greater portion of way along bank of river with flotilla with store abreast of of alternative look a easy a seemed to before set foot in country indeed colonel campaign at home gave idea of what march of army must be across desert certainly seems to that idea of twenty thousand men marching from here to india be altogether out of question if fleet have beaten english gone back brought twenty thousand more men have then sailed round cape come up to suez to fetch land in india thing must have be feasible enough in alliance with sultan of mysore might have cleared english out altogether land march seems to be impossible small body of men must never fight way there large body must not find subsistence fancy that constantinople will be place at will emerge march to palestine will of course be hard be only three four day from egyptian frontier fancy that there will be difficulty on way up through syria asia minor almost everywhere will find cultivated land abundant supply of provision for army a for turk have doubt that will thrash if venture to interfere with a easily a did egyptian have fear for safety of army if egyptian venture on rising here before start will give lesson that few thousand men left here must have difficulty in keeping country in order chatted for time longer then moved off edgar repeated to friend substance of conversation then returned to tent next day wandered through poorer portion of town group of men be assembled in many place talking excitedly when a sometimes happened party of french soldier came along broke up only to assemble at spot sidi edgar mingled with gathered that in short time there must be trouble be agreed that so long a whole french army remained there nothing must be done be regarded a certain that must soon break up be argued that must not remain at cairo mourad be gathering large force higher up on nile arab be moving again damietta rosetta must have to be occupied there be number of mamelukes between cairo suez french must not remain quietly until whole country be in arm against doubt column must be sent off a soon a be gone time for rising must come be going down quiet lane when two men came out from house one of looked fixedly at sidi exclaimed be arab boy who got into trouble at alexandria now be turn paying attention to edgar who be so entirely altered by disguise a to defy recognition two men seized sidi began to drag into house edgar sprang forward struck one of so heavy blow in face that released hold of sidi staggered back against wall then with shout of fury drew knife rushed at edgar latter also snatched knife from girdle shifted into left hand threw into usual boxing attitude with left foot forward maltese paused in rush line of defence be altogether new to have be engaged in many fierce fray opponent have always like fought with knife in right hand momentary indecision be fatal to with speed of practised boxer edgar changed foot springing forward with right foot in advance caught opponent wrist with right hand snatched man arm across body plunged own knife to hilt under other arm be just in time for greek who having hurled sidi into passage have turned to assistance of comrade be close upon giving vent to hoarse howl of fury a comrade dropped edgar faced in same attitude a in have met maltese man paused out of reach then crouched swaying body from side to side in readiness for spring never gave sidi although thrown heavily down have leapt up again with activity of cat with single bound from door reached greek buried knife between shoulder almost at same moment there be shout from other end of street two three men be seen running towards through house sidi edgar exclaimed rushed in closed fastened door then ran out into yard behind house be fortunately empty be over wall in moment into yard entered door stood open went noiselessly along passage for be barefooted opened door went out into lane beyond pausing for moment before did so to see that there be blood stain must attract attention on dress a arm be bare there be few spot of blood to be seen wiped blood from hand held knife on inside of dress then walked quietly out pulled door to did not attempt to close walked quietly down lane took first turning turned again four five time then quickened pace to fast walk in ten minute emerged from labyrinth of lane have be traversing up to time not word have be spoken from moment entered house be well out of sidi edgar said who must have thought of meeting two scoundrel again be sorry have to kill man be life mine have assuredly again saved life edgar be sure that must have murdered doubt must edgar said a be with be not likely to stand look on while did be fight of two against two did share be poor share brother drew off attention of man must have killed have to strike down without danger to myself again have saved life may be think that in turn saved mine for doubt whether must have got on a well with second fellow a did with first oh have doubt must young arab said confidently how did kill saw nothing of be simple enough edgar replied related how short conflict have begun ended must really teach thing edgar be wonderful how quick be with knife too for have heard say that in england people never fight with knife one learns quickness from boxing edgar said carelessly be one of advantage of teach one to think quickly act quickly if one can fight with one fist of course one can fight with knife be boxing trick used very useful one more easy than must be against good boxer who must have hit with left before must strike blow of course fellow have idea of doing so that unless have failed to grasp wrist be certainty did other hurt heard go down with crash feel stiff sidi replied expect that will be good deal worse to morrow for be sure be bruised down back be matter be good thing that have done with two men felt sure that must try to be revenged on if ever fell in with again next day anniversary of establishment of republic be celebrated by grand review of troop few day later news came that desaix division have set out in pursuit of mourad on day after battle of pyramid have overtaken fierce fight have ensued charge of mamelukes have broken one of french square for time great confusion prevailed desaix shouted to soldier to throw down on ground then next square opened so terrible fire on mamelukes that be forced to retreat two day later kleber marched with division for damietta in native quarter agitation continued so far peace have not be broken french took little heed of what be passing have idea that there be danger of rising have be object to provoke such movement must hardly have taken step better calculated to bring about have in first place after arrival proceeded to largely strengthen increase fortification in doing so have altogether disregarded feeling of people have pulled down house mosque have desecrated tomb cleared away building on space of ground across gun must play desecration of sacred place have given rise to deepest feeling of exasperation among people in next place many of fortification be converted so that gun menaced town instead of country round at citadel especially dominated whole city gun be placed to overawe next step be deeply resented by people for interfering with ancient usage cairo be divided into fifty quarter of have wall gate gate be closed at night indeed at time by order of chief of quarter interruption caused by break in line of communication have given rise to many quarrel between soldier townspeople inconvenience be distinct one french without giving notice of intention sent strong party of engineer supported by troop to demolish gateway tax be onerous in extreme by mean of council have be appointed consisting of notability who have by fear bribery be brought over to side of french crushing taxation be imposed rendered trading upper class upon whom burden principally fell a hostile to french domination a be lower class thus french have by high handed conduct absolute disregard for feeling religious sentiment of people prepared mine be on point of exploding afternoon messenger arrived from sheik saying that must be at pyramid on following morning at nine o'clock that wished to meet there must take men with edgar think must be best to leave be well established here now have come to be looked upon by around a having left tribe altogether a intending to work a carrier must tell one other of to go into town day see how matter be going on if father a hope decides to take part in attack on french here can easily send messenger to recall accordingly next morning mounted at daybreak rode down to boulak be with horse ferried across river then mounted again rode to pyramid hour later cloud of dust be seen rising to south west in few minute sheik with fifty follower rode up what be news asked son a leapt from horse heard that people of cairo be about to rise against frank number of people have already ridden to join in attack city be in very disturbed state father a yet rising have not begun that be good son be unable to strike blow at frank in battle here time will do share with aid of allah think that be well broke off a glanced at edgar be for to decide sheik edgar said for part believe that rising will be successful be true that large number of french be absent desaix have gone with division to capture northern province drive out mourad bey mamelukes kleber marched yesterday say to damietta there be still strong force here doubt not that rising will be successful at first many french soldier away from regiment will be cut down killed detached party may be attacked overpowered believe that in end discipline will triumph cannon will sweep street gun of citadel new fort that have armed will shell town although if really desperate defence be made town can hardly be captured without great loss bonaparte be sure to do so sooner later for if necessary can call back kleber desaix be matter of life death to be country to hear that cairo have be recovered french driven out with heavy loss there must be rush to arm army must believe be able to fight way down to alexandria when beleaguered there unable to obtain store from country round retreat from sea cut off position must be desperate say that be not right sheik said gravely understand mode of warfare of frank much better than do have be right in prediction of what must happen may be danger be clear to that must be faced brave men shrink from encountering death how can follower of prophet shrink from death in battle with infidel number of countryman will assuredly take part in struggle did ride away without sharing in conflict must not be able to lift up head again may be that be fated that will not return so be if be will of allah must die now who be to oppose let there be more said on know friend that be not afraid of danger that counsel be not prompted by thought of personal fear acknowledge that say may come to pas mind be made up thousand of arab will fight there will not draw back sidi will of course fight by side be not quarrel there be reason why must risk life in struggle that believe to be hopeless assuredly chief will ride with have treated a one of tribe have come to regard a such sidi be a brother be there no other reason must ride to battle by side moreover be a much business a yours country be at war with france if at present egypt be invaded by be not because france desire to capture egypt because by occupation of country hope to strike blow at england be well chief said think not that sidi will fall allah sent to aid when be in danger must hardly have done so have be will that must perish so shortly afterwards be in hand will die when

instant delay be giving time for frank to prepare said have already lost advantage of surprise after first shot be fired there must not have be moment of delay shot must have be fired until have given

horseman have be sent to order division have just marched to return at once by to morrow evening may be here have spoken truly one of leader said that shot must have be fired until be in readiness that must then have attacked at once with force impatience of individual have destroyed plan evil have already be done frank be gathered together can receive reinforcement until to morrow night while in morning will be joined by fully men therefore nothing must be gained much lost by attacking to day majority of present agreed with opinion sheik returned to cemetery be right said to edgar moodily to be successful such rising must have be prompt must have wasted time in killing tradesman plundering shop must have hurled at once upon troop cut to piece before have time to recover from surprise have acted thus might have succeeded now have allowed whole of french to gather with gun after what happened in battle fear there can be little doubt of what will occur when attack doe not alter determination to do best towards gaining victory even if defeated affair will not be without advantage frank will begin to see easy a be first victory egyptian be not flock of sheep to be maltreated robbed without even venturing to murmur that can not afford to scatter force over country moreover news that cairo be in insurrection will spread through country excite feeling of resistance many will die blood will not have be shed in vain french think that have conquered egypt have in fact marched to capital only hold ground stand on will not be long before feel that even be trembling under foot

disgusted at murder of unfortunate shopkeeper than thinking of personal danger to morrow there be nothing brave patriotic in slaying unarmed men deed done yesterday be rather of street ruffian thirsting for plunder than of men trying to shake off subjection to foreigner such doings a bring disgrace upon cause view of case be new to sidi in war that arab carried on with other with tribe of morocco there be fine distinction between combatant non combatant woman a well a men be killed carried off a slave that there be anything wrong in have never occurred to be enemy ventured to protest be foreigner not enemy edgar replied many of be settled here long before french landed like father lived peaceably among be not in way responsible for action of french government of bonaparte army among civilized people save that after capture of town by storm soldier become maddened behave sometimes like demon life of peaceful people be never menaced soldier fight against soldier not against quiet trader cultivator of ground to have be done to day be nothing short of murderous butchery to morrow must much more willingly join in charge on rabble who have done thing than upon french soldier who be for most part honest fellow have injured one since came into town though may have looted house found deserted by inhabitant however a country be at war with have opportunity of fighting will do so must rather have done with arab force alone out on desert than in conjunction with blood stained ruffian however matter be settled now at rate will be satisfaction to fight by side of brave father who see a well a do that defeat be almost certain so saying lay down to sleep with sore foreboding of what be likely to take place next day when daylight broke soon became evident that insurgent have leader fixed plan be in favour of attacking at once while others urged that must be better for french to do so argument be that whereas at present french be assembled ranged in order ready for attack

fighting frank be boy of whom be so proud ought not to have taken with think must wish to live go back to tell mother took to death be not killed sheik assured ourselves of before carried away found that with twenty other arab two three hundred of townsman be taken prisoner to citadel look of pain passed across sheik face news be not good be bad said with more energy than have hitherto shown be better have died in battle than be shot in cold blood think that will spare whom caught in arm against news be good sheik edgar said calmly have be otherwise must have left to think that have died on field of battle have reason to believe sidi have be released that will soon see for moment sheik eye expressed incredulity then assured tone calm manner of edgar convinced that at least believed that be true be sure be quite sure asked in tone so low that edgar must scarce hear be quite sure must not buoy up with false hope sidi be free be not far off now will speedily be here directly know that be strong enough to see for minute sheik eye closed lip moved sound came from edgar knew that be murmuring thanks to allah for son preservation then looked up again be strong enough said news have made man of again send here edgar walked away joined sidi be very calm quiet said father be very very weak break down know that be close by be prepared to see beg of agitate let talk talk much be calm restful with turned away walked to end of tree where engaged in short conversation with two arab then turned again went near enough to catch sight of sheik sidi be kneeling by side holding hand to heart smile of happiness illuminated drawn face of wounded man satisfied that be going on well joined men in basket will find small cooking pot said pick up of driest stick that can find so a not to make smoke put kabob into pot with a much water a will just cover then place over fire let stew until meat be in thread strain broth off will give to sip at time need not be afraid of smoke one of men said went down to village to get bread date man saw that be arab asked for news of what be going on in cairo fugitive passed along yesterday evening said that french be killing moslem told that be not a bad a that many have assuredly be slain called down malediction upon french seeing that be true man said that have wounded comrade with that be lying in grove told that be owner of that be welcome to use prayed not to come to again for if frank came along in search of fugitive happened to search grove found that have be supplying wounded man with provision might cost life told that need not fear for must not betray at rate must not come to shop again then make fire immediately hassan sooner sheik have little nourishment better if seems strong enough to bear want to carry off to mountain at once be quite possible that french may be searching village round for wounded fugitive must fain get up among hill sidi too have ugly wound in head need few day rest think have everything that can want for next two three day have good supply of fruit must find place among rock sheltered from sun when be dark must go down to fountain fill up water skin there hour later edgar carried cup of broth to sheik sidi do lift father up little very little want to take of broth be question of keeping up strength now sheik hope that will try drink little too want to get strong sheik said have something to live for now drank few mouthful then motioned to son to lower head down again 't be strange said that three must be together again when seemed that none of must meet on earth be very pleasant to be together again edgar said heartily will be more pleasant still when be able to get about again together there have be few word exchanged between father son to be restored to other be sufficient sheik have not even wondered a to how son have so unexpectedly arrived after drinking broth closed eye in few minute be evident by quiet breathing that be asleep edgar moved quietly away beckoning to sidi to follow when joined at edge of grove told of plan that proposed do think that be strong enough sidi asked think that will do harm sidi indeed think that if before go to sleep lay on blanket that brought here in might carry without waking of course must tell evening what thought of doing may be that french will make search for wounded saw proclamation signed by of principal sheik ulema calling upon people to be tranquil announcing that bonaparte have consented to forgive past know did not prevent trying prisoner morning doubt not executing large number of therefore although may leave lower class alone may seize of leader may find if came upon father wound must show that have be engaged in fighting if took to town many of who saw there might denounce a sheik who led horseman against one of column of course may not search be a well to be on safe side be better to run slight risk that journey might do than to chance being captured here sidi heartily agreed now sidi may a well get rid of clothes put on peasant suit bought will do same then must be caught sight of at distance must simply be taken for two fellah who have gone up into mountain to shoot game for other purpose while white clothes must excite suspicion be sorry now that did not get for hassan ali be likely enough may be able to buy such thing in village by way father said when be riding from pyramid to town that there be good many old tomb up in hill of course for to night must be enough if take short distance up then to morrow can search if can find one of tomb will be safe place for to stop in being cut in solid rock must be pleasantly cool there will be fear whatever of french soldier coming along entering there can live quietly until be fit to sit horse when have taken off thing have on have better tear off number of long strip for bandage did what must roughly when first carried father off field can bandage wound carefully now yours also must want looking to badly when sheik woke after two hour sleep drank broth voice be louder clearer be evident that even small quantity that have taken before quiet sleep have refreshed greatly now sheik edgar said hassan ali be going to bandage wound carefully say that be accustomed to doubt have experience for wound be common enough in raid foray edgar by time have put on dark blue blouse reaching down below knee girt by belt at waist form main article of dress of egyptian peasant on head be brown cap of rough wool of something of same shape a fez pair of low turkish shoe completed costume underneath wore european one trouser being rolled up above knee so a not to show while operation of dressing wound be going on went down into village finding shop where sold such thing bought similar suit to own for two arab when returned sheik wound have be dressed blanket rolled up under head be looking altogether more comfortable edgar now told plan of carrying off will be best said much best though have said nothing have wondered to day whether french must come along have troubled besides will gain strength faster up in hill plan be good one think that will sleep well in blanket even if wake will not matter motion will be easy wound have be well bandaged have fear of breaking out again in addition to severe sabre cut on face sheik have on left arm third have struck slantingly on right side a arm be raised to strike musket shot have also made deep groove on hip when in village edgar have purchased among other thing several stick of kabob when became dark two arab now in peasant dress went down filled water skin at village well sheik drank off rest of broth be then carefully lifted laid down on blanket be still attached to spear other blanket be then placed under head in hour son who be watching be glad to see that be again asleep more kabob be put in pot to stew when ready broth be poured into wine bottle edgar have emptied a soon a moon be fairly up started a before two arab taking pole at sheik head edgar at foot where weight be comparatively light one sidi must have divided with edgar laughed at idea will be well pleased sidi if can do walk without needing help weight be really nothing if have be big fleshy englishman must be different thing altogether arab be simply bone muscle divided between three weight be not worth talking about blanket have be rolled up placed across men shoulder water skin hung by strap on side carried basket on be also placed bundle of clothes between stir movement showed that sheik be conscious of being lifted from ground after twenty minute walking got beyond area of cultivated ground be able to head directly for hill two hour later be well up among edgar sidi agreed that there be small chance indeed of french party especially of cavalry searching such broken rugged ground spot be chosen where end of spear must be laid on two flat stone high enough to keep bottom of hammock from touching ground between sidi bent over father listening to breathing saw that be sound asleep only share of burden have be small willow iron pot in little charcoal fire glowed brightly small bag of most common fuel in egypt have be bought in village broth be poured into tin be hung short distance above fire so that must warm slowly then edgar sidi who be completely worn out wrapped one in burnoose other in blanket lay down hassan ali who have by turn slept during day undertaking to keep watch by side of sheik to give broth a soon a woke edgar dropped off to sleep instantly when awoke sun have risen saw that sidi be still asleep hammock have be lowered to ground ali be holding cup to sheik lip edgar saw at once that be better drawn expression ashen shade round lip have greatly abated eye be brighter living so frugal active life arab like red indian can bear wound must be fatal to dweller in town a none of sheik wound be in very serious be loss of blood alone have brought to death door night rest nourishment that have taken above joy at finding son living have already placed on path to recovery be glad to see looking much better than did yesterday edgar said heartily a came up hope that have slept well have woke twice time took of broth straightway went off to sleep again did not feel move here be indeed surprised on first waking when ali told that be safe up in hill see can already lift right hand will not be patient long there be hurry edgar replied after have have breakfast will start out to look for one of tomb told of there will have shelter from heat of sun from night dew there will be fear of french lighting upon indeed think that now have cairo under foot again will trouble more about matter have other thing to think about although cairo will be quiet for long time after french will know that merciless slaughter of mussulmans will excite deepest feeling of hatred against that will be even le safe than before for small party to move about kleber will doubt start again with division for damietta desaix be many day journey to south probably force will march to suez heard said by french officer that must probably be next move napoleon will not care to further weaken garrison of city by sending out search party be sidi wound bad one be nothing like so severe a received on cheek be downright blow turban saved be pretty deep scalp wound extending down to ear lost good deal of blood be anxiety for prospect of death for in morning caused to seem more serious than be in three four day will be nearly again did escape unhurt deemed certainly dead horse be shot at same moment got bullet through arm beyond loss of little blood be of consequence ran into house close by sheltered there until french column came out then went out in european clothes found there have more trouble chapter viii egyptian tomb while arab be preparing breakfast edgar searched for spot where sheik must lie in shelter during mid day heat for hot a be on desert sand heat be fully a great on bare rock of hill after search found spot where two ledge of rock ran parallel to other with passage of six foot between on side of rose perpendicularly twelve foot in height fissure ran nearly north south therefore except for hour at noon bottom be entirely in shade be within mile of spot where encamped for night returning sheik be carried there at once be laid on blanket spear be found to be long enough to reach across at top blanket have formed hammock being unrolled formed sort of awning must when sun be high be moved little one way other so a to keep in shade learning from sheik in direction tomb that have spoken of be situated edgar started with hassan after hour walking came upon be for most part square cut hole in face of perpendicular rock of be only flanked by pilaster cut in stone others have more ornate design have originally be closed by great stone slab have long since be moved broken up by treasure seeker plan of most of be similar short passage terminated by chamber of from ten to twenty foot square vestige of painting originally covered wall must still be seen choosing one of larger tomb edgar aided hassan to remove fragment of stone projected above dust sand lay six inch deep over floor well satisfied returned to sheik have found good place said air be quite cool in there sand will make much more comfortable bed than bare rock sheik made reply lay looking at with expression puzzled be about to turn to sidi to ask whether father be worse when latter said while have be away son have be telling that have done for that be who saved life a well a mine be weak now can not say what be in heart be too full for word say thing about sheik edgar said earnestly did not adopt into tribe doe not sidi call brother have not sheltered in tent when have nowhere else to go be not natural then must do in power to repay benefit to rescue brother sidi from hand of enemy deem most fortunate have be enabled to do so indeed ran little risk in case be small thing to search for among dead to have carried off while having found disguise of european there be risk of being recognized a having fought against french when went to testify in favour of sidi save a to own name have need to go little beyond truth have won sidi gratitude by aiding against two ruffian have slain man who be about to attack though did not take place a supposed at time of massacre of european shopkeeper main fact be true there be fear that in telling of must get into trouble sheik shook head 't be well to say so friend suppose that be way with people to make little of good action be not risk may have run many men be brave who charged column of frank after in front of have be swept away by cannon have right to say that be not coward see difference sidi thought dead beyond resolving to avenge did nothing idea that might disguise ourselves after frank have advanced gone searched street found whether be still living never occurred to think that arab must have thought of have scarcely passed through first danger of being discovered than began to think of learnt that many arab have be killed when poured out of city that others have be taken prisoner wounded lose moment in finding two follower night search among dead for carry off to place of safety then without rest without pause return to city begin to take measure to rescue sidi be in citadel strongly guarded by french troop there be one way of succeeding thought of way planned out invented likely story be yet very close to truth went into midst of men that have be fighting against so sustained character that have chosen that none of french officer suspected for moment that be aught what seemed so listening to pleading on behalf let go free well did say other day that though might be beaten believed that son must escape for allah have clearly sent to save from danger that must therefore assuredly preserve illustration ali ayala appeared page be allah who be god a well a yours who be to be thanked sheik that life have be preserved edgar said reverently that be again united when so many have perished in spite of shade of blanket overhead edgar found tremendously hot in middle of day a soon a sun have passed west be able to get hour comfortable sleep short time before sunset started again carried sheik to cave two arab did while edgar sidi loitered behind pulling up parched up bush that grew here there among rock making into faggot a soon therefore a sheik be laid down fire be lighted giving cheerful air to dark chamber ali hassan went down again brought up provision water bundle air be cool pleasant in tomb hearty meal be made by sheik who however not only drank cup of broth ate date with something like appetite now sheik edgar said after have put more stick upon fire can chat about future plan have be talking with sidi must be fortnight three week before be fit to sit horse again be very fortunate by way that sent favourite horse a well a sidi mine back by two of follower from pyramid when decided to enter town that rode other horse in charge in cairo must have be loss indeed if noble steed of ours have be all killed be one of first thought when be able to think sheik said next to wife son love zeila must have sorely spoiled joy that be reunited have fallen in battle be advice that saved life also idea be edgar went on that hassan ali will go back to town get one of horse ride to oasis where spare horse of follower be have thirty men there sheik said thought a well not to bring for have misfortune happened woman child must have be left without protector there be surely occasion for hassan to go yet in three day might be there be back in three though hope to mend quickly surely must not mount horse in week time that quite see sheik a wife woman be there also thought well that must start at once two three of men may have escaped from fight must be sure to make for oasis will doubtless report that save have be killed wife will be mourning for sidi a dead be for reason must send one of men at once with good news how thoughtful be lad gray beard must think of thing more than do have not once thought that news might reach a say may well be that two three at least of men may have escaped ali will start to morrow at daybreak when have given message to wife what next be to do must say sheik that must bid men be at great pyramid in twenty one day from on following morning will join there at daybreak may be well enough before that sheik said that can not say for certain edgar said 't be best that must name date when may hope that will be fit to ride long far again if need be know not what be plan of french 't be like enough that though may have granted pardon to people of city bonaparte will endeavour to strike heavy blow at arab know how terribly harassed on march here that wheresoever troop may move will again swarm round have overawed cairo can safely leave small garrison there if march away may well seek to overawe arab by making expedition against oasis can now easily do a cavalry be mounted on egyptian horse capable of supporting thirst making long journey may think that by striking at camping place cutting down palm tree filling up well may compel to promise to cease from attack upon troop might certainly damage greatly in way sheik agreed few of horse be equal to ours may be sure that tribe near alexandria who basely sold horse did not part with best while frank took at cairo be not accustomed to desert save indeed of mamelukes of whom there be few for most of horse be killed with master be even a well mounted a be might indeed reach oasis do terrible damage a for ourselves must laugh at for must have to carry far heavier weight be not that french soldier be heavier than be with riding boot accoutrement valise other matter must ride from forty to fifty pound heavier than must horse unaccustomed to such burden must soon tire must not be well to bid say four men to come straight to act a guard think not sheik fewer of there be about here better be discovered four men forty must be useless might defend mouth of tomb for short time even be to beat off attack must be matter of hour before be forced to surrender for want of water hassan can start with ali to morrow morning bring second horse back here will be very useful for bringing up water provision now hassan have peasant dress on must attract little attention be noticed riding among hill will tell to buy two more skin larger than have four will then bring up sufficient water to last horse for three day at least so that will only have to make occasional journey down to village indeed there be several village within short distance of other on river bank by going sometimes to one sometimes to for food water will not attract attention at so be sheik said voice now have weakened after drinking more broth composed for sleep example be speedily imitated by others sidi gave ali hassan necessary instruction before started edgar took former apart have private conversation with be possible ali that sheik wife will when arrive there want to start at once to attend if doe try to dissuade will be great comfort to to have with will aid recovery know that be skilful in dressing of wound will be able to cook thing such a must like far better than must one can guide here of course when be once fairly across river will take off long blue gown ride in arab dress will ride with in own dress until get within short distance of river beyond of course will again put peasant dress on before start to day get such dress also for let slip on over own be best that did not approach ferry until be getting dark must do well to bring comrade to take two horse back ayala must not use one frequently see woman riding on donkey for peasant woman to be mounted on horse must be unusual besides must not know what to do with here must have to go down day for water if start at noon to day from cairo will be there on afternoon of third day if start again next morning will be here on sixth day will light fire short distance from front of cave so a to act a guide to when get into rough ground if be not here that night will know that be not coming will say nothing about to sheik sidi be better that must not be looking forward to if did not come might be fearing that misadventure have happened on journey in case understand that be not to propose to be to remain altogether silent on subject unless insists on coming hassan returned with horse carrying four water skin provision including supply of coffee just a darkness set in reported that ali have started before noon next six day passed quietly hassan went down twice with horse for water fresh meat fowl other provision supply of grain for horse be stabled in next tomb to that occupied sheik gained strength slowly indeed steadily at meal took basin of broth prepared either from fresh meat chicken to edgar satisfaction hand remained cool there be sign of fever on sixth day be able to sit up leaning against wall of chamber at dusk that evening edgar strolled out a usually did to enjoy cool evening air told hassan to accompany soon plucked up withered dead bush among growing between rock be piled twenty yard on one side of entrance to tomb then hassan went into chamber picked up piece of glowing charcoal out of fire with to light pipe placed on bowl after taking two three draw went out into air piece of charcoal be placed among dried leaf twig blown until flame shot up then dried stick have be collected for purpose be placed carefully on fire soon burned up will do hassan edgar said want big blaze can be seen long distance away sit here feed carefully so a to keep up flame not more than foot two in height hassan obeyed order ali have told on leaving that might possibly return with sheik wife that be not to mention to sidi sheik edgar walked up down near fire hour later heard voice below gave exclamation of pleasure two three minute later ali ayala appeared within circle of light former leading horse on be sitting how be exclaimed a slipped from saddle hurried forward to meet edgar be getting on very well be gaining strength have have fever will lead to hassan can put out that fire now bring of brand into tomb will make cheerful blaze perhaps have better do that before go in if sheik asks why do say be by order thought must be more cheerful than glow of charcoal will not be minute ayala be to go in now must scarce see with patient obedience of arab woman stopped at once ali have told said turning to how much have done for how saved life of husband son be fortunate in being able to do so replied that without slightest risk to myself then changing subject went on thought that must wish to come certainly must said place be by side be sidi well also ali said that also be wounded mine be trifling business said sidi be not much worse suffered from loss of blood perhaps be good thing a have have fever though wound be somewhat sore have almost ceased to think of there can see by light that fire be burning up inside now will go in keep little way behind must startle be to go in suddenly walked into tomb sheik said here be friend come to see friend sheik repeated in surprise who be have ridden way from oasis sheik be sure must come be wife ayala ran forward threw upon knee by side of sheik edgar went out with hassan left sidi together ayala now took entire charge of sheik edgar went down frequently to one other of village on river bank partly for change exercise partly to learn what be doing at cairo heard that under direction of french engineer greater portion of population of cairo be employed in building fort on elevated position round town where gun must completely dominate city that be said that sultan have declared war with france that army from syria have advanced have established at fort in desert half way between frontier of syria egypt made sure said after talking news over with shiek sidi that sultan must be driven to declare war against french must have be impossible for to have allowed french permanently to establish a master of province of egypt even if have be willing to suffer whole moslem population must have risen against doubt news of destruction of french fleet decided to take step now that more reinforcement can reach here may well consider that army be capable of annihilating turk be good soldier be to say have always shown capable of fighting desperately when well led unfortunately be not likely to be case pasha have experience in war while french have best general in europe turk be badly disciplined while french be veteran soldier with perfect confidence in in leader still in case will greatly increase napoleon difficulty will have to send greater portion of army to meet turk at same time will have to keep egypt in subjection british government will be blind if see that opportunity be grand one for striking blow at french must think that must ere long send army out here though may not do so unless see that turk alone can hing against later edgar heard that column of french cavalry have gone out into desert have driven away body of arab have assembled again few mile off nile have however be unable to gain advantage over a arab have always fallen back upon approach french finding pursuit useless have returned to city once twice few arab have be killed when cavalry have be so closely followed by battery of artillery that arab be unaware that french have gun with have therefore contented with keeping beyond carbine shot first intimation of presence having be when cavalry rode rapidly to right left leaving gun exposed even then loss have be slight for slight undulation of desert afforded shelter riding at full speed along hollow be almost out of range before artillery must limber up after first discharge of gun advance to position whence must see flying foe by end of three week sheik be strong enough to walk up down for time in front of tomb declared quite able to make journey edgar have doubt on subject knew that arab be so thoroughly at home on horse that scarcely felt slightest inconvenience after longest day journey zeila pace be so easy smooth that hoped chief might not suffer from at two o'clock on morning of day when band must be awaiting at pyramid party started save sheik be in peasant disguise be in arab dress disdaining however great occasion to put on dress of peasant wore however dark burnoose completely covered figure edgar sidi have day before carefully examined face of hill have found track by peasant drove up goat to pasture among hill at time when shrub be sufficiently fresh green for to browse chief mounted horse with exclamation of pleasure at finding again in saddle two lad led way pace two in front of horse ayala walked by side of husband hassan ali followed behind with second horse descent required great care although sidi carried torch took upwards of hour to get to foot of hill when on level ground ayala be assisted to mount ali horse went more briskly along there be however occasion for haste for ferry be four mile away boat must not cross until dawn ali however have gone down on previous day have bargained with ferryman to be ready a soon a be light to take over party who have long journey to make dawn be just breaking a reached bank of river few moment later ferryman arrived looked surprised at seeing arab with four peasant made remark be to be well paid for getting up two hour earlier than usual be business of whether arab crossed not sheik wife two lad first got on board then ali hassan led horse stood by side a boat pushed out from shore in ten minute be across a soon a landed sheik ayala mounted set off at amble pace between walk trot two leg on side moving together pace be in general use among horse in egypt turkey be a comfortable easy a walk sun have risen hour when neared pyramid a soon a be seen party of thirty horseman dashed out rode towards at full gallop brandishing spear gun over head a approached uttering shout of welcome sidi two arab have like ayala taken off peasant smock cap have wound turban round head a soon a have landed to disguise be very repugnant for arab looked down with supreme contempt upon fellah population of egypt edgar have followed example not from dislike to dress because thought that sheik must prefer rejoining follower with whole party dressed in arab costume there be doubting genuineness of welcome that beni ouafy gave chief until ali have arrived with news of escape like wife have deemed that son have fallen there be deep emotion in face a circled round round little party discharging gun tossing spear in air catching a fell shouting welcome sheik with fired off gun a party came up sheik in spite of effort to maintain impassive expression of face be evidently much moved a soon a demonstration ceased started again without word others followed example rode in body until reached pyramid when dismounted in instant be off horse gathered round brother said thank for welcome gladdens heart to be among again can not forget that many saddle have be emptied that many of woman be widow child fatherless rode away with fifty men hear that ten wounded returned to tent two ali hassan remained with horse rest met death with face to foe dying a moslem must do in defence of faith country loss to be grievous one half of fighting strength be gone have heard from ali have not be for brave young friend whom regard a one of yourselves since be son adopted brother son must have died later will tell how sought for carried senseless from among dead upon field of battle how ventured into council of frank by stratagem persuaded to free son who be one of arab prisoner will be tale to tell child how english lad wounded saved life of sheik of tribe son be time for telling to in full now see there be great dust rising by river be probably cavalry of frank with perhaps gun be far away yet will not be long before be here have resolved to journey quietly back to home feel that will be time ere will be fit to ride fast far wife will of course accompany will take ali hassan two others will travel quietly slowly will keep well out from river so a to run risk of falling in with fresh party rest of will ride back to fetch woman child with camel other animal to warn brother that body of french cavalry be moving about devastating oasis cutting down palm tree filling up well must advise for sake of tribe to hasten to make submission a did not take part in rising in cairo may well be able to do though will perhaps send into town hold a hostage for people now bring out horse zeila be first brought up delight be a great a of sheik at meeting there be time for prolonged endearment after few loving word to horse sheik mounted ayala who be to ride behind be lifted to seat ali hassan with two men sheik picked out sprang into saddle party started north then sidi edgar mounted own steed set out with rest towards south west by time french be within mile of must be made out that be body of fifteen hundred cavalry who be a far a must be seen unaccompanied by gun be probable that be going long distance edgar said that gun must much delay for be hard work indeed dragging over sand french have already experienced that have chance of overtaking arab cavalry accordingly paid attention to so small party continued journey at trot after riding for four five mile be left far behind by tribesman dust cloud showed position be coming exactly way that be sidi said looking back may be that be bound for uncle oasis must be a well to find out sidi do give two of best mounted men then ride straight on with others will remain here till approach then ride on for eight ten mile still keeping in sight will assuredly camp at well of orab if be making for oasis be about twenty mile from nile will go no further to day for be a much again before come to well when have with certainty made out that be making for well of orab will follow at full speed wait for save to give horse drink draw rein till reach people deliver father message suppose that will overtake before get there will not be long after report may decide what have best do sidi at once picked out two men who be knew among best mounted of tribe told to remain with edgar act under order then at much more rapid pace than before pursued journey edgar men dismounted sitting down on sand until french be again within mile of then cantered on ahead french have followed so exactly line along party have ridden that edgar felt quite convinced that be making for well however kept at same distance ahead of until arab told that be now within five mile of water then will go on said be certain now that be going there a say there be camping ground within many mile of well think be certain that be bound for oasis of beni ouafy now rode at full speed to well here for quarter of hour halted refilled water skin gave horse drink handful of dried date eat few then started on long ride have not edgar have perfect confidence in arab knowledge of country must have felt uneasy a hour after hour rode across waste of sand without so far a must see landmark to guide course remarked to smiled frank can make way over sea when there be nothing to guide one of men said must be strange if must not do same over land that have traversed many time before at sea have compass with needle point always to north so that know in what direction be going have sun one of arab answered even without that must find way do so even on darkest night horse know way a well a do when have once journeyed over track never forget even did swerve little must not matter for can smell water mile away must always if unguided make for at ten in evening edgar rode into bedouin encampment having passed over eighty mile since leaving pyramid sidi party have arrived there hour earlier found that friend be now in tent of sheik edgar went there at once sidi introduced to uncle who be year older than father be rejoiced to see sheik said gravely heard how have before befriended sidi messenger who arrived here told how have saved life of brother nephew wanted to see face truly be young indeed to have done such wonderful deed to have so much wisdom a well a courage sidi tell that fifteen hundred of frankish cavalry be riding think that there can be doubt of edgar replied certainly have gone to well of orab left short distance from will camp there to night may for aught know change direction to morrow in case will be three day before be here must not journey more than twenty mile day be too strong for to fight sheik said be at battle near cairo though a arrived late did not know at what point brother men be gathered did not join when be over rode off with mourad mamelukes can put six hundred horseman in field at short notice though have week time must call up four hundred who be encamped at well far away to west even be here must not venture to engage in open fight with fifteen hundred frank have given order at daybreak tent will be struck woman child with baggage a many bunch of date a camel can carry will start at once for well of azim seventy mile away be long journey there be water by way so there be fear of french following there be already hundred of tent there for although oasis be large one being nigh eight mile long two wide be not large enough for whole of people one at azim be smaller will support for time there be abundance of water for camel number twelve hundred sheep goat of there be about two thousand hundred of men will ride with a guard to drive animal with others will if frank do damage here harass on retreat by dashing among at night will do such harm that may regret day that came sidi will

have to evacuate egypt long time might elapse before took place finally came to resolution to attempt to escape be doing father good by remaining have already witnessed great battle by land one by sea

course leave navy if thought fit rejoin father what do say will give five minute to think over required le time than for edgar to take resolution have fancy whatever for work in london office prospect

start condor said suppose sir sidney know what be doing must imagine did edgar said quietly possibly if like to question will be good enough to explain matter to satisfaction look here youngster condor growled have come in here a midshipman let tell that whether fellow be interpreter not allow cheek here allow rudeness eh edgar said quietly be new to ship manner at school anyhow fellow be just a likely to get thrashed for rudeness a be for cheek come condor wilkinson said a master mate sprang to foot wo do good by quarrelling with fellow who have just come on board have certainly said nothing offensive to moreover be quite possible that captain may want to ask question about egypt if have mark on face may be pretty sure must get such wigging that must never want possibly might never have chance of getting one very well condor said sitting down again be safe for day two mind first time get opportunity will give soundest thrashing that ever have be sorry that must be postponed edgar said quietly daresay will keep come on deck blagrove wilkinson said putting arm into of edgar be ill tempered brute went on a soon a have left cockpit only passed examination week before sailed heartily wish that have failed be regular bully a none of be older than be have pretty well own way for be strong chap a heard from fellow who sailed with know how to use fist none of must have chance with be great nuisance for must all be very pleasant together if be not for however expect will dare touch for captain may at time want to put question to craft may overhaul condor must certainly get hot if found out that have be interfering with edgar smiled can assure want captain assistance in matter boxing be branch of education have not be neglected fancy that mr condor will not find that have own way well if must lick must regard a benefactor blagrove be afraid will find great deal too strong heavy for well will see a say on first opportunity think that be at quarrelsome chap be certainly not going to put up with being bullied by fellow like at moment boatswain came up mr blagrove said have first lieutenant order to take to tailor to be measured for uniform undress suit said tailor can manage will have to get rest of kit later on will find on deck blagrove wilkinson said a edgar followed boatswain who led way to lower deck where by light of couple of lantern two three tailor be at work first lieutenant order be that be to measure young gentleman for midshipman undress uniform be to put everything else by push forward very well man replied make odds to what doe first doubt whether first lieutenant will be pleased to morrow tore trouser yesterday sent down to to be mended well one of hand can finish that boatswain said anyhow have got to do suit will hear of edgar be measured for uniform by head tailor who be cockney who have be carried off by press gang be soon found that be of use a sailor a be by trade tailor be given rating below be not long before gave such satisfaction that be made chief of little party employed on work returning on deck edgar rejoined wilkinson be introduced by to several other midshipman who be predisposed to like a wilkinson have informed of little encounter with condor of readiness to fight bully of mess be considered however sign of pluck rather than wisdom one of expressed general sentiment when said see have be brought up among egyptian chap who have idea whatever of fighting may have licked of easily may have made think can fight will find difference when stand up against fellow like condor first lieutenant presently sent for edgar to come to quarter deck quite understand mr blagrove although be given midshipman rating be really a interpreter sir sidney smith have engaged must wish to perform midshipman duty also have asked be wish in matter left entirely with saying that very nominal pay of midshipman be really remuneration for service of gentleman capable of interpreting in three four language that a rule of service made provision for engagement of interpreter except under special circumstance a said that did not think likely must make sea profession might not care to undertake midshipman duty in addition to of interpreter thank sir must certainly wish to learn duty a midshipman to take share in work duty a interpreter must be generally very light must find time hang heavily on hand if have nothing else to do hope therefore sir that will put to work have taught duty just a if have joined in regular way very well mr blagrove think that be right will put in starboard watch be sure that mr bonnor third lieutenant will be glad to keep special eye on do understand anything about handling boat yes sir have be accustomed to sailing rowing steering a long a can remember be something gained at rate do know name of various rope sheet do in vessel of ordinary size sir be so often on board craft be in father hand for repair learned good deal about at rate can trust to go aloft well mr wilkinson be in watch a put in charge to start with will tell to act a instructor in matter please ask to step here mr wilkinson went on a midshipman came up will be obliged if will do what can to assist mr blagrove in learning duty have be knocking about among boat merchant craft since childhood already know good deal about naturally there be much to learn in ship like will of course keep watch a usual at night will request mr bonnor to release from other duty for present in order that may assist mr blagrove in learning name us of rope ordinary routine of duty will of course attend master class in navigation there will be occasion for to go through whole routine of freshly joined lad in other respect must learn cutlas musketry drill from master at arm to splice make ordinary knot from boatswain mate thank will do for present lieutenant bonnor came up to wilkinson few minute later told that be to consider relieved from general duty at present hope wo find nuisance wilkinson edgar said not at other laughed contrary get one off of sort of disagreeable routine work a know something about to begin with have doubt that will soon pick up work lot of thing one have to learn when one first join be not of much use afterwards may not have to be done once year however can lend book if really want to pick up word of command can study when have nothing else to do can tell there be plenty of time when one be rather glad to have something to amuse one when one be running with light wind aft like for instance may go on for day without having to touch sail well will begin at once wo go aloft till have got togs fellow going aloft in landsman clothes always look rather duffer now let see what know about thing a name of halliard sheet tack be same in square rigged vessel edgar answered question readily be only precise position assigned to on deck that have to learn so even on darkest night must at once lay hand on without hesitation in course of couple of day knew a well a instructor on third morning put on midshipman clothes for first time be great deal stronger fellow than must have taken for wilkinson said a watched dressing have tremendous lot of muscle on shoulder arm on back too took lot of exercise when be at school in england edgar replied have be accustomed to riding ever since be boy for last five month have almost lived in saddle have done good deal of rowing too for have have use of boat a long a can remember of course have done lot of bathing swimming see water be so warm that one can stay in for long time one can bathe year round can not even remember being taught to swim suppose came naturally to be sure that father must never have let go out in boat a used to do if have not known be a much at home in water a out of now will go aloft wilkinson said edgar ran up almost a quickly a companion have not only be accustomed to ship in port of alexandria on voyage to england back have spent much of time aloft captain being friend of father allowing to do a liked a soon a saw that be perfectly capable of taking care of be not first time that have be aloft sir one of top men said a followed wilkinson example instead of going up through lubber hole be first time have ever gone up mast of man of war edgar replied everything be so big solid here that seems easy after being accustomed to smaller craft be wonderful spread of sail wilkinson after having be on board nothing bigger than brig used to help reef sail on way back from england tremendous sail seem altogether too big to handle so must be without plenty of hand see have great many more men in proportion here than there be on board merchant craft will go up higher certainly went up until nothing bare pole with pennant floating from summit rose above feel giddy at blagrove not bit if be rolling heavily perhaps might be be going on so steadily that feel at then will begin by giving lesson a to what duty must be if order be given to send down upper spar yard be pleasure teaching fellow who be so anxious to learn a be who know enough to understand what say for two hour sat there explaining to edgar exactly where position must be during operation order that must have to give when get down below said when have finished will give order can jot down learn by heart great point see be to fire off exactly at right moment little too soon little too late make difference be generally race between top men of different mast there be nothing that men think more of than smartness in getting down upper gear when have got word of command by heart perfectly will come with first time order be given to send down spar yard so a to see exactly where order come in be thing that very often practise in fact a rule be done evening when be cruising in harbour at spithead sort of thing when be race between different ship of squadron be pretty bad for top men who be last to get spar down see a be on passage suppose will send down spar till get to constantinople what be going there for a far a can understand captain be going on sort of diplomatic mission brother be ambassador there be appointed to act with in sort of diplomatic way suppose to arrange what troop sultan be going to send against french what be to do to help what subvention be to be paid sort of thing expect will be pretty busy while be there do understand turkish yes be very like arabic official upper class in egypt be turk one hears more turkish than arabic except among bedouin tribe while be talking be leisurely descending shroud side by side a soon a gained deck captain steward came up to edgar said that sir sidney smith must be glad to see mr wilkinson to dinner that evening captain have abstained from inviting until must have got uniform thinking that must find uncomfortable sitting down in civilian dress fact that be going to dine late in way interfered with edgar enjoyment of mid day meal during two day have be on board have got on friendly term with messmate excepting condor who studiously abstained from noticing in way younger midshipman bullied unmercifully have general dictatorial way with others made frequently long for opportunity of giving lesson have doubt that condor have determined to postpone occasion until have left pireus at point be to call a service might be required there to interpret once away from island must not be likely to be called upon to translate until arrived at constantinople be pleasant dinner in sir sidney smith cabin there be present first third lieutenant captain of marine doctor wilkinson edgar sir sidney smith be delightful host possessed remarkable charm of manner be most thoughtful kind to subordinate though strict in matter of discipline treated officer a gentleman on term of equality in own cabin have already accomplished many dashing exploit in baltic elsewhere be beloved by sailor officer be time when life in navy be very rough when lash be unsparingly used for smallest offence when too many ship be made floating hell by tyranny of commander must have asked to dinner on day that came on board mr blagrove sir sidney said kindly a two midshipman entered thought that might prefer not doing so until got uniform have be privation for myself for be anxious to hear from detail a to what have be doing in egypt of of course know next to nothing at home during dinner question be asked after cloth have be removed decanter be placed upon table said now mr blagrove will be glad if will give detail of how came to be left behind of personal adventure what yourself witnessed opinion of situation in egypt be desirable not only a matter of general information because will be really useful to to understand situation fully for purpose of mission edgar began story be interrupted almost at outset by sir sidney asking how came to be so intimate with bedouin be therefore obliged to relate how have rescued sheik son from attack by two of lowest class of european in alexandria edgar told story modestly making a little a possible of share in be fellow armed mr blagrove have knife have not time to use fellow have idea of boxing straight hit be mystery to thing be over in le than minute then suppose can box sir sidney said with smile be taught in england sir father thought that must be useful for population of alexandria be rough one sir sidney said more edgar told story without further interruption then answered many question a to proceeding of french rising in cairo of sir sidney now heard for first time prospect of general insurrection think that there be much chance of sir defeat of mamelukes led to believe that french be invincible destruction of fleet showed that be not case led to rising at cairo easy defeat there terrible slaughter inflicted upon will certainly cow for long time a long a whole french army remains there think there will be much further trouble if portion be to march away doubt might muster up courage to attack remained mourad bey with considerable force of mamelukes still keep field arab tribe must certainly join if saw chance of defeating invader two men have that trouble with have ever come across again mr blagrove first lieutenant asked came across in cairo sir edgar replied reluctantly be with friend sheik son did not recognize being in arab dress knew at once pounced upon be dragging into house of course took part there be fight be result mr blagrove result be that be killed edgar said quietly attacked with knife have to use ours friend killed one of killed other be unfortunate be life ours if have done then thing must have happened again next time might have be stabbed before have chance of defending can quite understand mr blagrove sir sidney said kindly while others smiled at matter of fact way in edgar related what must have be very dangerous business see that else may have to teach will not be how to use weapon indeed seems to that be getting on very fast saw go up shroud to day can see that will very soon be a much at home there a of midshipman now gentleman have have rather long sitting for be nearly ten o'clock be sure that must have be a interested a have be in information mr blagrove have be good enough to give by jove blagrove wilkinson said when have left cabin if have told before must not have felt so doubtful about fight with condor so can really use fist well learnt for over two year from of best light weight in london edgar replied unless have have wonderfully good teacher ought to have trouble about matter two day later tigre left pireus to sir sidney smith disappointment have not found lord nelson there a have expected to do be more disappointed inasmuch a have missed lord st vincent who be commander in chief in mediterranean at gibraltar chapter x sea fight finding that last news from lord nelson be that be sailing to join fleet blockading toulon sir sidney smith remained couple of day at pireus then continued voyage to constantinople have have intercourse with of native edgar service have consequently not be called into requisition in afternoon condor came up to edgar who be talking with of other midshipman said now mr blagrove if really meant what said think be good opportunity to settle affair valuable service be not likely to be required for few day if wish to back out have better come with below with pleasure edgar said quietly have have difficulty in waiting have several time be on verge of stopping pleasant habit of bullying youngster well need not say more condor said savagely let see what can do wilkinson two three others who be off duty went down at once with edgar a news spread among others midshipman who must possibly get away unnoticed stole off also joined on lower deck dozen lantern be lighted hung up from beam few of sailor seeing so many midshipman going down there guessed that there be fight coming off descending hatchway forward stole noiselessly aft to watch have said nothing to others of what have heard in cabin general belief be that although edgar doubt must make plucky fight of have chance whatever with opponent nearly three year senior two three stone heavier with reputation for being able to use fist well opponent stripped to waist faced other wilkinson acted a edgar second none of older one must act for condor lad of fifteen who dared not refuse request did so combat be best described in language in one of tar who witnessed related to comrade never seed such thing in born day said did not look fair thing for be like man against boy condor be about three inch taller than young much more strongly built young stripped well looked wonderfully wiry young chap there be determined look about face guessed that be game to backbone chance did not seem worth speaking of well stood up young one moved about quick on pin for moment then be so quick that must scarce see how be done gave sort of bound hit out with right next moment condor be on back never saw such clean knock down blow in life mids cheered be plain enough to see way 'pinions went condor be not down moment up jumped again looking a savage a bull somewhat dazed meant mischief time went with rush at young lor latter just jumped out of way hit smack in eye that staggered altogether did not lose leg time made rush be same thing over over again young did just what liked with after five minute knocked silly eye be beginning to close be just bleeding like pig at nose be cut on mouth finished knocked out of time altogether young have never be a much a touched once must have heard how middy cheered a to young seemed to take a matter of course said 'there be nothing in condor fought pluckily enough know next to nothing of boxing while though say be first rate boxer ought to be having be taught by best master in london for couple of year illustration edgar hit out page have to chuck water on condor face to get round for force with struck deck stunned when be helped to foot young went up to held out hand ' hope there will be no more ill feeling between condor ' said 'you have made bad mistake have have to pay for only say a long a be on board there will be no more bullying in cockpit be gentleman hope a long a be on duty of course obey order of superior a senior officer must obey when off duty be equal if anyone attempt to bully anyone else have got to reckon with 'there be reason why must not have pleasant time when be below will do best to see that do have be senior of mess a such have to keep order beyond that have right to interfere now let shake hand say more about ' condor shook hand without saying word then slipped away have seen many fight since first took to sea never fight a before be just massacre of innercents think fellow be ever more thoroughly sucked in than master condor when undertook job condor have to go on sick list hour after fight be over eye be almost closed face be enormously swollen have lost three teeth effect of blow have brought conflict to close did know how be going to be wilkinson one of other senior said a went up on deck again guessed pretty well from what blagrove be telling sir sidney when dined with that condor must meet match did not think that be going to be hollow thing like what do mean sir by skulking below second lieutenant angrily asked one of midshipman of watch a returned on deck just slipped below for few minute sir lad said well have better be careful will find at mast head lieutenant said sharply fancy there have be fight first lieutenant said a mr knight passed grumbling to noticed just now that there be only two midshipman on deck do see be coming up hatchway one by one looking a innocent a cat have be at cream jug seem to be pretty nearly here now see sign in of face that have be in trouble well well midshipman be only boy boy will quarrel expect have share of before got epaulette other laughed suppose so said after doe harm be much better if two boy do quarrel that must fight out have done with instead of always wrangling thought might have be blagrove first lieutenant said new hand generally have fight before have be on board fortnight after that find level however be not for there be looking a cool a cucumber must have be sort of meeting to discus fancied grievance daresay will hear something about sooner later hour afterwards doctor came on deck there be smile on face a went up to first lieutenant one of officer be on sick list mr cane what be matter with must say that must come under head of contusion lieutenant laughed bad contusion rather more serious than be usual in case face greatly swelled eye closed very great enlargement of nose lip puffed badly cut three front teeth missing by jove be severe punishment who be master mate condor why who have be fighting with doctor laughed must hardly believe when heard waylaid young jocelyn who be executing war dance of delight questioned be last acquisition blagrove impossible doctor there be lad without slightest sign of having be engaged in fight have be looking at rather closely for nearly disappeared about hour ago one know what that generally mean mr knight be very angry about so when came back again glanced at a none of be marked in way showed sign of having be engaged in bout of fisticuffs came to conclusion that there have be no fight mean to say that blagrove punished condor in fashion without receiving mark condor be powerful fellow must be nearly three year older than lad seems well nigh impossible be astonished if remember told other evening at captain table that have earned good will of arab by rescuing sheik son from attack by two european ruffian certainly told in very modest tone that lad must thrash two men armed with knife seemed to to border on romancing young jocelyn said that fight did not last more than five minute blagrove did not receive scratch delight be excessive fancy condor be rather bully see there be nobody else in mess anywhere near weight age took advantage of accordingly boy said that after be over shook hand blagrove told condor that there must be bullying in mess in future asked what affair be about jocelyn did not know said that heard that something have happened when blagrove first came on board that knew that there be going to be fight think that be put off until left pireus for reason other that young fellow must be marvellously good boxer to be able to punish fellow so superior in age weight without showing mark lesson be certainly likely to do condor good have heard from mr bonnor who be in same ship with on last commission that fellow have bad name a bully that unlike most fellow of sort have pluck must fight make blagrove victory more surprising however of course will take notice of have merely official report mr condor be on sick list suffering from severe contusion suppose will be day before can show up must say that will be week before be fit to come on deck a to loss of teeth will be serious disfigurement until get home again can be fitted with fresh one well at rate will give blagrove good standing among others be always awkward for lad who join good bit later than usual be not only among midshipman that defeat of condor established edgar a most popular member of mess during voyage out condor have already rendered obnoxious to men by roughness of tone when speaking to by domineering manner whenever officer of watch be engaged elsewhere report of manner in have be punished excited great delight among rendered edgar most popular personage have noticed behaviour first time that have gone aloft have agreed that new middy be good sort greenhorn will make first rate officer one old tar said mark word if new hand a be will see that will show up well on first opportunity fight too raised rather than lowered condor in opinion men who have seen agreed that although have not shadow of chance from first have fought with unflinching pluck struggled on most gamely until knocked out of time consequently when returned to duty be treated with same respect a before with none of covert grin that have expected to notice among young fellow be not fool while in sickbay have thought matter over good deal be of course mortifying to have be thrashed by antagonist despised be conscious that have brought punishment upon hitherto have not since first joined service met with match among of own age standing have come to think exceptional sort of fellow discovery that be child in hand of really good boxer while humiliated be extremely useful lesson of kind be sure to have effect good bad among sour temper produce active hatred of person who gave render lad savage morose on other hand among more generous nature have opposite effect thinking matter over lad will feel that have be going in wrong direction that have be puffed up with exaggerated idea of own power will determine to get into better groove to break of fault condor belonged to latter class a lay in bed saw clearly that have made great mistake that success have be won simply because licked be le skilled strong than that in point of fact instead of being a believed good boxer knew next to nothing about edgar have after first day gone in regularly to have chat with have be somewhat doubtful a to how advance must be received have determined to do best to become friend with condor whom felt rather remorsefully have punished terribly severely hope condor said first time entered that will believe have come in because be really sorry that have be hurt so much not from idea of triumphing over be only natural must have got best of knew beforehand be sure to do so learned boxing for over two year from of best light weight fighter in london worked very hard at end of time except be of course inferior in strength must hold own very fairly with be more than year ago since then have gained lot in height in length of reach in strength so really need not feel mortified that be so easily beaten because consider that if have be twice a strong a be four five year older must have come to same thing man who can box only in what may call rough ready way have practically chance whatever with really scientific pugilist may say be hope bear malice that will be friend in future hope so too blagrove feel that deserve have got will be lesson will not forget have taken down great many peg in own estimation will try make fresh start when be about again be very glad to hear edgar said warmly be sure must be very much more pleasant to be liked by everyone than to be disliked one be just a easy a other know that ever thought of before condor said suppose must be will try experiment when get up will feel very small among others see why must did that must one must have done better who have not be taught a have be sure that one will think least degree worse of because have chance with why thrashed couple of ruffian in alexandria armed with knife in quarter of time that took to beat at rate will know better in future condor said with poor attempt to smile with swollen lip have learned not to judge from appearance who must have thought that fellow brought up in egypt

chat during voyage up to dardanelles tigre encountered changeable weather sail have often to be shifted when be on watch edgar always went aloft with friend wilkinson took place beside listened to order that gave watched at work in few day be able to act independently to do duty regularly to aid in tying down reef when sudden squall came on caught sight of many island a passed through aegean edgar be disappointed with dardanelles delighted with first view of constantinople be on day that cast anchor that condor for first time put in appearance at mess face have resumed normal appearance save that there be greenish yellow patch under eye wilkinson who be by week two senior midshipman have occupied president chair with reluctance at once left have not expected until next day must not have taken edgar have that morning particularly asked others a personal favour to give condor hearty welcome on return think will find much more pleasant fellow than be before said at rate have be punished heavily think that ought to welcome heartily wilkinson two three of older midshipman have gone in several time to see condor have be pleased at friendly way in have spoken of blagrove there have however be little talk between for condor have not seemed disposed for conversation condor walked to accustomed seat at head of table hope thing will go on better than have done said gruffly can say be sha' be fault if without more word proceeded to cut up salt meat placed in front of for short time conversation be constrained be evident that who spoke be talking for sake of talking soon wore off by end of meal even youngest mids be talking laughing with feeling somehow change have come over place quarter of hour after meal have ended boat be lowered mr wilkinson will take charge first officer said mr blagrove will accompany captain on shore few minute later reached landing place number of men at once crowded round to proffer service captain said choose one of for guide mr blagrove ask to take to embassy edgar at once chose quiet looking turk to latter surprise addressed in own language others fell back disappointed guide soon conducted to embassy will not want here blagrove will be engaged for at least couple of hour can either stroll about have look round go back to boat a please be now two o'clock call again here for at four cairo have prepared edgar for constantinople indeed thought former city more picturesque in variety of costume than latter view from hill of pera whether looking up golden horn across at stamboul over to scutari shore of sea of marmora up bosphorus be beautiful beyond anything that have ever seen leaving exploration of city for day sat down under shade of cypress tree close to turkish cemetery entered into conversation with guardian of tomb who pointed out various mosque place of interest to at end of two hour repaired to embassy presently dragoman came down asked if name be blagrove on replying in affirmative said that sir sidney smith have ordered to say that must return in boat to ship for that must dine ashore boat be to be at wharf at ten o'clock sir sidney smith remained two month at constantinople duty in conjunction with brother mr seymour smith be to engage sultan in active alliance with england to concert a naval officer best plan to be pursued to render alliance effective former portion of commission have already be carried almost to successful termination by brother treaty be signed on first week of january detail of latter be arrived at in course of several meeting between sir sidney smith turkish pasha admiral to latter meeting edgar always accompanied chief a interpreter sir sidney preferring service to of dragoman of embassy a be better able to understand explain naval point discussed porte indeed be able to do little towards aiding in naval operation two bomb ship seventeen gun boat be vessel that be able to produce be time before must agree to place entirely under sir sidney smith command ahmed pasha a be generally called djezzar pasha djezzar meaning butcher from cruel brutal nature of man governor of syria be in constantinople at time be present at meeting be aware that napoleon be marching against although usually paid little attention to porte recognized order received from have now hurried there to represent situation ask for assistance bonaparte lost time after hearing that djezzar have sent forward force to occupy fort of el a'rich in desert between syria egypt on th of february set out with men for conquest of syria djezzar who have returned to pachalik having early news of movement despatched force consisting principally of cavalry to support garrison of el a'rich be joined there by ibrahim bey with force of mamelukes march of french be painful suffered greatly from thirst however defeated turk mameluke cavalry with heavy loss el a'rich at once surrendered garrison be allowed to depart on undertaking not to serve again four day later army entered palestine believed that fatigue suffering be at end two day later however cold rain set in troop who have be suffering greatly from heat felt change painfully on rd of march arrived in front of jaffa turk be sent in to summon garrison to surrender commandant simply ordered head to be struck off sent reply fire of field artillery in few hour effected breach at several point french in spite of opposition burst into town be given up to sack large number of inhabitant a well a soldier be massacred between prisoner be taken among doubtless be of who have be allowed to march away from el a'rich difficulty in way of provisioning army be great many be ill from effect of change of climate position be becoming serious to feed prisoner added greatly to difficulty napoleon took step have be foul blot on reputation be marched into vast square formed of french troop a soon a have entered fatal square troop opened fire upon whole be massacred terrible slaughter occupied considerable time when cartridge box be emptied french soldier have to complete massacre with bayonet of whole of victim one only mere youth asked for mercy rest met fate with heroic calmness resolution napoleon excuse for hideous massacre be that soldier have broken engagement took at el a'rich applied to only very small proportion of garrison massacre be wholly indefensible for if unable to feed prisoner must have be allowed to depart unarmed to seek subsistence for effect of horrible massacre recoiled upon who perpetrated great number of dead body speedily tainted air malady from troop suffered became vastly more serious plague broke out among carried off considerable number kleber division made reconnaissance towards jerusalem people of nablous mountaineer assailed with so terrible fire a endeavoured to make way up narrow valley that be forced to retire join main body of army when french marched from jaffa there be still many of men stricken with plague in hospital napoleon have be accused of having have poisoned statement have be repeated over over again have be a often vehemently denied among others by bonaparte still remains always will remain doubtful there can be doubt that transport of plague stricken men must have be source of danger to whole army a very few of once attacked by plague ever recovered few must have benefited by operation while condition of great majority must have be rendered still more hopeless painful by journey upon other hand have be left behind must assuredly have be massacred by inhabitant who have suffered so terribly at hand of french rather than be so left unfortunate men must assuredly have vastly preferred painless form of death at hand of friend probability be that sick whose final recovery be considered by surgeon a within limit of probability be taken on that whose case be absolutely hopeless be not allowed to fall alive into hand of foe position be extremely difficult one have shown much solicitude for wounded when whole army be panic stricken at outbreak have visited hospital be present at operation talked encouragingly to sick have done in power to relieve condition must keep army no longer in tainted air of jaffa must not take men at point of death away with to communicate malady to who have so far escaped must leave to be murdered in bed by infuriated population be uncertain really what course be taken must be assumed that napoleon who be always anxious to win affection regard of troop must putting other matter aside not have perpetrated act must have be condemned by soldier of army chapter xi acre at last be satisfactorily arranged by term of convention sir sidney smith be appointed to command not only of turkish fleet of turkish army in syria most important point a porte have confidence whatever in djezzar who like many others of pasha of outlying possession of turkey almost openly defied authority of sovereign djezzar be already at acre turkish gun boat under hassan bey have also be despatched thither towards end of february welcome order be issued for tigre to sail on st of march destination be alexandria a forming part of sultan possession came under term of convention under term of have be agreed that two british men of war three frigate must be stationed in eastern water to give such aid a be possible to djezzar in active operation by capturing store ship destined for use of french army theseus of gun commanded by captain miller be already at acre captain colonel phelypeaux be giving great assistance to pasha in putting place into better state of defence while presence there animated pasha troop to determine upon stout defence be with deep satisfaction that officer men of tigre received order to prepare for sailing at once have now be nearly two month in constantinople novelty of scene have worn off be impatient for active service thing have be going on pleasantly among midshipman condor have shown by behaviour that sincerely regretted conduct have made so unpopular that lesson that have received have be so severe that must not risk repetition of at rate there be peace comfort in cockpit just at first two three of younger middy be disposed to take advantage of altered state of thing wilkinson edgar other two senior supported condor told that if latter did not keep in order must do so after threat matter went on quietly change from salt provision to fresh meat with abundance of fruit vegetable have be very pleasant added to good temper harmony prevailed edgar have not felt time hang heavily on hand for be constantly on shore with sir sidney smith who found service a interpreter of great value have be ordinary case other midshipman of older standing must have felt somewhat jealous knew that went a interpreter rather than a midshipman a of have leave to go ashore day must amuse according to liking while be kept hard at work translating document examining state of store attending prolonged meeting between commander turkish naval official have therefore reason for envying post be glad of occasional holiday at rare interval when sir sidney have business on land made excursion to brother up bosphorus to town on sea of marmora when edgar be able to join party who hiring horse at landing place took long ride over country starting sometimes from pera sometimes from scutari on other side of water be certainly not le glad than comrade when order came to prepare for sailing wind be favourable voyage be speedy one tigre arrived off alexandria on th of march here remained for day news have already be received by sea from jaffa of capture of el a'rich of approach of french army to jaffa have caused no uneasiness a town having garrison of men be believed to be able to resist assault when however on fifth day after arrival of tigre off alexandria small turkish vessel brought news that jaffa have be captured of garrison killed in cold blood besides large number of inhabitant sir sidney decided to start instantly in order to aid in defence of important stronghold of acre must certainly be next object of assault by french committing to captain of lion charge of continuing blockade with gun boat under command sail be at once hoisted tigre started for acre on way picked up theseus be out cruising two men of war arrived off acre on th of march to satisfaction of found that napoleon have not yet appeared before town sir sidney smith owing to term of convention at once assumed command of operation arrival of men of war excited great enthusiasm among garrison inhabitant who now for first time believed in possibility of beating off french of being spared horror have befallen jaffa on following morning french be seen marching along between lower slope of mount carmel sea men of war boat running in close to shore opened fire upon compelled hastily to change course to ascend hill until beyond range of gun a attempt have be made to return fire by artillery sir sidney smith be convinced french must be unprovided with siege train having learned from people who have escaped by boat from jaffa that only field piece have there be employed to batter wall ordered constant watch to be kept for ship seen approaching a bonaparte must hardly have hoped to take so strong place a acre without heavy gun have doubtless arranged for battering train to be sent from alexandria by sea must probably be ordered to make for jaffa for caiffa small port few mile south of acre theseus be at once sent down to jaffa to prevent landing of gun store being effected there while tigre boat be placed at interval between caiffa acre next day corvette nine gun boat be seen rounding promontory of mount carmel signal be made for recall of boat tigre at once got under sail started in pursuit picking up boat a came alongside bonaparte have be ignorant that there be british vessel on coast must hardly have sent boat from alexandria without stronger escort corvette gun boat sooner caught sight of tigre than made out to sea chase lasted for hour one by one seven of gun boat be picked up surrendering in case a soon a tigre gun opened upon corvette other two gun boat succeeded in making escape commander believing hopeless to attempt to carry out mission in face of british man of war sailed direct to france capture be most valuable one for possession of gun boat enabled blockade of coast to be carried on much more effectually than must otherwise have be done on board be found a expected gun battering train intended for siege of acre tigre returned with prize to port crew be at once employed in transporting captured gun ammunition on shore when be conveyed by turkish troop to battery be before very deficient in gun capture added therefore much to strength of defence edgar service a interpreter be again called into requisition mr cane be sent on shore with party of sailor to assist turk in moving gun to new position hour before landing sent for edgar told that have arranged with sir sidney smith that be to accompany good deal of hard work will have to be done by turk will save much trouble if be with to translate order to rather to officer sir sidney be of opinion that there will be great deal more for to do on shore than on board will of course be much on shore be carrying note to pasha requesting to assign suitable house for to take up abode there will make headquarters lieutenant beatty will be posted there with twenty marine furnishing guard for other purpose room be to be assigned to will then be handy whenever captain be on shore at other time will assist other officer with working party of course two three native will be engaged a servant one of will be cook lieutenant beatty will establish small mess together will of course have shore allowance think that may consider fortunate for will have opportunity for seeing go on while others will of course only come ashore by turn thank sir edgar said much pleased will like very much turkish soldier worked well tugging at rope while sailor used lever to get gun up steep place edgar be kept busy translating first lieutenant order to turkish officer for first three day have hardly time to snatch meal until sailor returned at nightfall to ship got on very well with lieutenant of marine who be pleasant young fellow on day after landed heard heavy firing going up to highest point of rocky promontory on acre stood must make out that number of gun boat be cannonading caiffa place appeared to make reply to fire at last two gun boat believing that there must be few french troop there sailed up harbour lambert french officer in command have however howitzer small gun eighty french troop gave order that must not reply to fire of gun boat that not musket must be discharged until gave word two small gun boat came on confidently until when at distance of only hundred yard from shore where intended to land set fire to french storehouse to do a much damage a possible heavy fire be suddenly poured in two gun loaded to muzzle with grape swept deck heavy volley of musketry did much damage lieutenant beatty who have brought telescope on shore with exclaimed by jove two little gun boat have caught hot see there be one of putting about other seems to be drifting towards shore be indeed fact be slightly in advance of other be principal target of fire midshipman who commanded most of crew be killed before few survivor must recover from surprise into have be thrown by unexpected attack vessel have grounded heavy fire of musketry continued gun again poured in fire a escape be impossible few men who remained alive at once hauled down flag surrendered capture be valuable one to french gun boat carried pounder a napoleon heaviest gun be pounder cannon be invaluable a soon a capture be known artillery horse be sent to port transported to battery at french be already hard at work for first day two be almost useless for with exception of few shot taken with have none must fit a soon a besieged began to fire obtained ample supply of cannon ball be eagerly collected by soldier small reward being paid for shot be brought in in short time however french be in better position for carrying on siege with vigour for a became necessary to retain tigre theseus to assist in defence of town french vessel be able to land artillery at jaffa other point have ere long ample supply for battery there be doubt lieutenant beatty said that gun boat have be captured from not attempting to go round sail out a companion did be afraid that crew must have be almost annihilated by enemy fire be very risky thing to send two small craft in alone even though place have not replied to fire for even if french have gun might have have many hundred of men in town against whom crew of two boat must have done nothing however loss be not serious except in matter of crew suppose carried more than one gun even be important edgar said for know have pretty heavy gun on board boat in hand of french must give trouble will have hot work of presently blagrove wall be absolutely rotten must be absurd to call fortification if french open fire at close quarter will make breach in time if phelypeaux plan have be carried out place must have be in position to make serious defence hear that captain miller of theseus have be trying in vain to get turk to carry out plan djezzar be always saying that what wanted must be done went further than what little have be accomplished have be done by men of theseus believe that dragging of gun captured to place be first job on turkish soldier really worked of course sir sidney have good deal more influence than miller have a be commander in chief of turkish army if djezzar did not give help asked for must have power to take matter altogether out of hand troop have love for for a nickname show be a cruel a be ambitious there can be doubt that intended to throw off authority of sultan altogether position of gun show that hear that when theseus arrived there be not single gun mounted on face of town on land side one being planted on wall to seaward however believe be personally plucky a place be nothing like so strong a jaffa be must see that a garrison of there must not resist enemy men under must not have shadow of chance be not for help even must hing if be not that position of town enables to cover land approach position of acre ancient ptolemais be indeed very favourable for protection by fleet stood on projecting promontory almost square in shape three side be entirely washed by sea north eastern side have natural protection at angle of wall tower be strongest point of defence covered to extent near tower with garden abutting against wall stood pasha palace masonry of greater part of wall be old crumbling from sea to north of town vessel anchored there must cover approach to northern side by fire while must similarly be swept by ship anchored in bay of acre on south side of fortress water here however be too willow for men of war to anchor in tigre therefore be moored more than mile from shore next to be alliance sloop three of gun boat captured from french two turkish gun boat lay nearer to shore fire of vessel swept ground across be already evident that french main attack must be directed be also covered by fire of theseus three of captured french gun boat french have on arrival promptly seized village within mile of wall pushed forward trench with vigour establishing four five battery at once opened fire napoleon calculated that must be master of town in three day at utmost doubt must have be case have only turkish resistance to overcome a soon a tigre returned from short cruise sir sidney smith took up residence on shore brought with condor wilkinson to act a aide de camp fifty sailor be established in adjoining house in readiness for emergency here mess be now established although lieutenant beatty edgar continued to sleep in sir sidney smith house one to be near men other in readiness to attend upon commander at moment night day a far a possible midshipman mess adhered to regular hour for meal sir sidney smith took at time when must snatch one other of midshipman came ashore day with boat crew so that at moment order must be sent to tigre theseus except at evening meal when fire generally slackened be seldom that more than two of midshipman mess sat down together being constantly employed in carrying message order in keeping watch at threatened point in order that sir sidney must at once be made acquainted with movement of enemy illustration map of siege of st jean d'acre by french army of egypt from march to may french have lost time for on th battery opened fire against tower after four hour firing breach considered by french to be practicable have be effected turkish gun have returned fire aided by two mortar worked by british sailor turk believed that wall be strong enough to stand prolonged siege a french fire be heavy against tower near have betaken to safer position sir sidney smith be on board tigre djezzar seldom stirred from palace have capable officer under one be in slightest degree aware of serious damage french battery be inflicting upon tower there be thought that attack must be made upon town for considerable time edgar have be engaged morning with sir sidney when latter went on board ship went into next house where found others at dinner after be over proposed stroll down to corner against french fire be directed wilkinson beatty agreed to accompany condor who have be day at work seeing gun placed in position said that did not care about going out again on reaching wall facing french position found that there be little doing few of gun be being worked throwing shot into garden between french battery town along rest of line turk be squatting under parapet smoking talking be french firing at edgar asked turkish officer be firing at tower will do harm of shot came in at loophole so a soldier there must do good by staying have come out that seems rather careless way of doing business edgar remarked a translated what officer said to companion well at rate may a well go see what effect of fire be battery be not heavy one a be not more than four five hundred yard from tower may really be doing damage a neared tower at angle of wall found that rampart there have be entirely deserted by turk be rum way of defending town wilkinson remarked if be way turk be going to behave sooner be on board ship better french fire be brisk thud of ball a struck tower occurring five six time minute three officer entered tower two three hole appeared in wall of floor by entered masonry must be very rotten beatty said must not have knocked hole in a soon a descended stair into story below uttered simultaneous exclamation of alarm yawning hole eight foot wide appeared be serious wilkinson let take look down below look out wilkinson shouted a ball passed just over head struck wall behind stand back here moment ran forward looked down by jove exclaimed there be breach down to bottom of tower level with lower storey ground heap of rubbish at foot outside think be high enough yet for anyone to get up to opening will soon be practicable if be not now look look can see large body of french among tree there be about to advance to storm breach run blagrove wake up turk will go back fetch up marine blue jacket enemy may be in place in five minute leaving tower edgar ran along wall take men to tower at once shouted to first turkish officer saw french be crossing ditch instead however of obeying officer men ran to one of step leading up to wall commenced shouting french be in town edgar saw that have told news too suddenly that be hopeless for to try to stop flood therefore ran along wall until reached stair leading down to open space in front of djezzar palace a have be frequently there before made way straight to apartment where djezzar transacted business french have breached tower pasha said storming party be about to cross ditch when came away there be troop there to defend breach on wall be flying unless go out rally men to defence town be lost djezzar be thunderstruck at news have showed brave in battle with fate of jaffa in mind now lost heart altogether be too late said catching up sword ran out of palace directed flight towards landing place edgar ran towards breach again on way came upon two companion running along with marine blue jacket after fortune however have done more for town than defender led by officer with sixteen sapper followed by twenty five grenadier french party prepared to mount to assault order be to mount breach hold moment be done main body of storming party be at once to follow met with unexpected obstacle instead of finding a have expected merely willow ditch found at edge of counterscarp wall being fifteen foot in depth with regular moat filled with water between foot of breach have brought with only two three short ladder be intended to be used if necessary to aid in clambering up heap of rubbish to breach french have idea of existence of counterscarp ladder that have brought be too short to enable to descend officer in command hesitated a to what course to adopt mysterious silence maintained by enemy be disquieting that turk have fled tower be undefended did not occur to officer in command feared that must have placed mine in breach be for present abstaining from showing firing shot in hope of tempting to make assault before must decide what be best to be done there be loud tramp of foot inside tower then british sailor marine showed suddenly at opening on floor at once opened heavy fire many of french fell at once seeing that there be nothing to be done officer gave order for rest to retreat did hastily djezzar be furious when heard what have happened questioned edgar on hearing that tower have be altogether deserted a well a adjacent portion of wall ordered instant execution of six of officer number of men for gross neglect of duty be exasperated that must have shared in panic have seized when informed that french be assaulting breach that resistance have be offered by men edgar congratulated that be not one of officer when old pasha however recovered from state of fury into have fallen complimented three british officer highly on quickness that have shown have a rightly said saved town for have french found still unobserved must assuredly have managed to get down counterscarp to establish in tower in force before suspicion of what be going on took place french whose operation be hidden by garden at once proceeded to drive gallery in order to blow up counterscarp upon gun must not be brought to bear on th mine be sprung did damage have not be driven quite far enough led by officer of staff named mailly french rushed forward a soon a mine exploded clambered down over breach have be made on counterscarp crossed fosse by three ladder have brought with reached foot of breach there be however too great distance between pile of rubbish at foot of wall great hole above for to enter without fixing ladder a be in act of doing turk who have at first appearance again be seized with panic have be brought back by number of officer who adjured to stand saying that be better to die fighting infidel than to be shot by djezzar opened heavy fire mailly be killed several of grenadier sapper fell round rest retired meeting a climbed counterscarp two battalion who have joined a soon a breach be reported practicable upon hearing from grenadier that be not case fell back again after losing commanding officer many men from turkish fire success greatly encouraged turk who have heard from who have escaped from jaffa that obstacle be sufficient to daunt french from time sir sidney smith began to entertain hope that town must be held of owing to supineness of djezzar troop have hitherto be very doubtful french at once recommenced mining in eight day completely blew up counterscarp on twelfth carried gallery under ditch with intention of blowing up whole tower by time besieged be aware that french be at work mining colonel phelypeaux have during interval since last attempt worked indefatigably breach have be filled up with combustible material number of shell have be placed on platform of tower with fuse attached in readiness to hurl down into midst of storming party heap of great stone have be piled there for same purpose turkish soldier seeing readiness alacrity with british worked have gained confidence faint sound of mining under tower brought about consultation between sir sidney smith captain wilmot colonel phelypeaux pasha engineer officer pointed out to pasha that be impossible to say what result of firing of mine might be a must depend upon quantity of powder employed if large quantity be used said may entirely blow down tower considerable quantity of wall adjoining leave so large breach that french must be able to pour in in such force that troop who might well be panic stricken at explosion must not be able to make effective opposition what can do to prevent pasha asked nothing can be directly done sir sidney said if make sally in force might drive french back discover mine carry out greater part of powder place small portion under ditch exploding allow water to run in if men carry with number of fascines might establish work fifty yard from foot of wall must put stop to mining enemy attacking must a advanced be swept by gun of two men of war gun boat garrison must further be covered by fire from tower wall propose that must sally out in three column central column will be composed of marine sailor of ship will make straight for mouth of mine force way in other two column will attack enemy trench on right left plan seems to to be good one pasha said will be done a propose on night of th of april two column of men be gathered at midnight in street leading to water gate short distance to right of tower third column close to gate little distance to left lieutenant beatty be with party of marine to join landing force to disappointment condor midshipman be to take part in sortie a little party of seaman be to be held in reserve sir sidney smith intended to take place on tower whence must watch operation wilkinson edgar be to act a aide de camp latter to carry message to turkish officer commanding two column while wilkinson be to perform same office to central column mr condor may probably have opportunity of distinguishing yourselves later on said other midshipman may have turn to night chapter xii desperate siege just a day began to break gate be opened column moved out one after other order that strictest silence be to be observed be obeyed by sailor marine turk who be wrought up to pitch of enthusiasm made so great noise that moment issued from gate shot be fired by advanced picket few second later roll of drum in french line broke out be clear that whole camp be alarmed sir sidney smith uttered exclamation of anger a concealment be useless then sent two midshipman to order battery to open fire upon french trench a first gun boomed out ship gun boat on flank also opened fire trench by french must advance from village be swept by storm of shot french battery joined in din while infantry in advanced trench opened heavy musketry fire by jove turk mean fighting time wilkinson said when edgar have returned from carrying order look at be going at french trench in gallant style dark mass must be plainly made out in gray light be now stealing over sky undaunted by heavy fire of french turk rushed at earthwork scaled engaged in desperate hand to hand fight with defender chief attention of little group on tower where captain wilmot colonel phelypeaux have also stationed be riveted upon fight going on in front of already french be thronging down from trench blue jacket marine be engaged in fierce fight knight second of tigre received two ball in left arm a advanced upon arriving at top of shaft of mine pioneer at once leapt down into one ran forward to see if be charged brought back news that be not lieutenant knight little party of sailor worked desperately to pull down prop supported roof of gallery have little time allowed for doing so have not be that noise made by turk have given alarm so long before reached spot work might have be completed a be have performed small portion of when officer ran in to say that must at once come up a party must no longer keep back swarming throng of enemy colonel douglas who be in command cheered on hardly pressed men who have found resistance of french so desperate that have be unable to drive out from advanced trench lieutenant knight exhausted by loss of blood effort to aid pioneer have to be assisted from gallery carried off by seaman major oldfield who commanded marine of theseus be killed with two of men mr janverin midshipman of tigre eleven men be wounded beatty forbes midshipman of theseus be slightly wounded a be five marine of ship seaman two marine of alliance a soon a party began to draw off heavy fire be opened on french by turkish troop on wall battery opened with renewed vigour while bugle sounded to order retreat of two turkish corp gained gate unmolested turk be in high spirit according to custom at time have cut off head of fallen foe brought in sixty of trophy french loss have be considerably greater for from desperate nature of fighting turk have be unable to decapitate greater part of fallen foe in addition to head also brought in great number of musket intrenching tool last be extremely valuable prize a garrison have be much hampered in work by small number of available pick shovel although so far a main object of sortie have be failure result be upon whole satisfactory one turk have met french in fair fight have held own against be so pleased that during rest of siege never once wavered attack too showed french that enemy be not to be despised compelled to take much greater precaution than before to maintain at time strong force in advanced trench on th tremendous explosion be heard troop from quarter rushed towards tower to repel expected assault have mine be carried few foot farther whole tower must have be destroyed french miner have come across vault projected little distance beyond tower above believing that wall be that of tower have placed charge against although therefore partial failure effect be tremendous portion of outer wall of tower be blown down two hundred turk who formed garrison piece of cannon be buried in ruin small party of french rushed forward before smoke have cleared away established in lower story turk however rallied very quickly from shock opened so tremendous fire from wall aided by cross fire from ship that reinforcement must reach party in tower next morning early evacuated place be rendered untenable by fire of turk in story above so soon a have left building enemy concentrated battery upon at sound of explosion sir sidney smith with sailor marine of guard at once rushed through street to tower bravo turk wilkinson exclaimed a edgar ran along by side of sailor listen to musketry fire be clear that be standing ground anyhow that there be panic time sir sidney be greatly relieved when on arrival at tower found that although shaken shattered still stood obstacle to entry into town went along wall warmly praising turkish officer men for courage be weight off mind colonel said to phelypeaux have be scarcely able to close eye for last week mine have be perfect nightmare to there be saying when be going to explode although turk have worked hard at countermine set to dig have little hope that must be in time a have to take right under foundation of tower think that must congratulate heartily that have be worse think so indeed sir sidney turk have certainly behaved admirably to day thought must when once got over idea that french be invincible have always proved splendid soldier when well led have doubt example of men carelessness of danger have animated with determination to show that too can fight from time of entering palestine french have be amply supplied with provision of sort by native a soon a crossed frontier from egypt bonaparte have sent proclamation broadcast among people large proportion of inhabitant of hill country be christian assurance that came to free from domination of turk just a have freed egypt be received with enthusiasm by simple ignorant people who knew very little of what be passing in world around consequence be that a marched north from jaffa deputation met comprising most of leading men received present promise that must never again fall under dominion of turk while on part promised to supply cattle corn wine wood to utmost extent of resource promise faithfully kept also did good service in aiding transport of store landed at jaffa sir sidney now endeavoured to counteract effect of napoleon proclamation by mean of native emissary landed by ship boat at various point along coast sent out large quantity of address of own telling that napoleon be be true at war with sultan that be question of religion that be endeavouring to pas through syria in order to make way to europe retreat by sea having be cut off that must be perfectly ready at time to make term with sultan must leave without moment thought to vengeance of turk against whom be now helping added that djezzar pasha being convinced that have be deceived by bonaparte be acting in ignorance of true state of thing promised solemnly that who now that truth be told to withdrew aid from french must be pardoned for course that have hitherto taken paper soon bore fruit english be known to be favourable to syrian christian assurance of sir sidney smith have great weight there be soon sensible decrease in amount of provision supply brought into french camp breach widened under heavy fire kept up continuously upon by french battery a be evident that other assault must be made at spot engineer began to throw out ravelin advanced work from foot of wall on side of breach so a to take assaulting party in flank on st of may french thinking that breach must now be practicable advanced for fourth time heavy gale have blown day ship of war gun boat be rolling heavily at anchorage be doubtless thought that must be unable to use gun in afternoon therefore body of men ran forward with six scaling ladder crossing moat a before planted ladder attempted to mount breach be however assailed by so heavy fire of musketry from turk that leading party be literally swept away in spite of heavy weather ship joined fire to of battery storm of shot shell be rained upon trench men who have be seen to advance in readiness for assault finding impossible to issue from shelter retired to camp marine of two men of war have manned new work fire contributed much to repulse of french sir sidney smith in despatch home expressed regret at heavy loss of life encountered by french in desperate attempt to perform impossible feat of entering by breach must only be reached by scaling ladder point of attack have certainly be badly chosen for while masonry of upper chamber tower be very rotten that of lower part be excellent whereas wall be in most place badly built must have be demolished in very short time by heavy gun french now have in battery thirty of have be landed at jaffa brought up to front in addition to sortie of th april sir sidney smith kept besieger constantly on alert by landing party from ship boat on flank of line of trench attack be sometimes pushed home earthwork be overthrown fascines carried off for use in redoubt gun spiked intrenching tool captured attack greatly added to labour imposed upon besieger who be compelled not only to keep strong body in advanced trench to defend whole line of attack against flank surprise by enterprising foe turk vied with british in activity making frequent night attack on trench generally succeeding in carrying off number of fascines be greatly needed be of special utility in construction of ravelin day after repulse of fourth attack

day fighting increased in fury between st th french made le than five attack upon breach be beaten off with very heavy loss while defender on part made frequent sortie to compel assailant to stand on defensive to interfere with attempt to carry approach up to foot of wall fire of vessel be still maintained besieger have so raised strengthened earthwork protecting traverse trench that be now able to go backwards forward to front with little danger from ship fire edgar have now lost companionship of condor wilkinson have gone back to ship for death of morris wounding of forbes lieutenant knight have left ship short of officer condor acted a junior lieutenant until latter be fit for service again wilkinson took part in boat attack sortie from town edgar be therefore now in command of blue jacket on shore who be held always in readiness to run to aid of garrison at spot where there might be sudden danger be believed that french be again mining in several place although colonel douglas who have succeeded phelypeaux in command of engineering operation set party at work to drive countermine work progressed slowly be difficult to ascertain precise direction in enemy be driving gallery edgar still acted a interpreter to sir sidney smith be bearer of order to turkish officer be very glad that be seldom that be called upon to accompany chief in visit to tower for stench here from unburied body of french of turk overwhelmed by explosion be overpowering number of turk stationed here be attacked by mortal illness others became delirious be necessary to change force holding at very frequent interval on evening of th of may there be immense satisfaction in town a number of sail be seen on horizon be certain that be force under hassan bey have be originally intended for egypt have be diverted from course by sir sidney smith order arrival have be anxiously looked for during last month have be detained by calm other cause at rhodes be only portion of force now on fifty first day of siege made appearance from enemy camp on hill fleet be made out a soon a from town effect be in very short time apparent by fire of enemy battery being redoubled be apparent that bonaparte have determined to make great effort to capture town before arrival of reinforcement in short time great column be seen advancing to attack two of tigre pounder mounted on native craft lying in little port near water gate opened upon with shell while two gun manned by british sailor one on castle of lighthouse other on one of ravelins poured grape into column moved on tremendous cannonade from battery overpowered that from gun on wall suffered little from fire from ravelins a have night before constructed two breastwork from end of trench to breach material used being sandbag body of own slain in spite of effort of defender french effected lodgment in tower upper story have now be entirely destroyed by enemy fire fragment have so increased heap at foot of breach that assailant be able to mount without use of ladder be most critical moment in siege hassan troop be already in boat be rowing to shore run down to landing place mr blagrove sir sidney said take gig row out to meet boat order to come round to port here instead of landing at other end of town there be not moment to be lost turk be losing heart edgar have just brought up little party of sailor leaving to leading of petty officer with ran down at top of speed to landing place gig crew be standing near boat listening anxiously to terrible din of conflict jump in men row for life edgar exclaimed minute be of consequence french will be in town in five minute want to meet boat coxswain sailor who have already guessed that errand be urgent by speed at edgar dashed down to boat stretched to oar rowed a if racing met turkish boat quarter of mile from shore be sent by commander in chief sir sidney smith to order to row round to mole land there order men to row hardest moment be of consequence french be on point of entering town at once flotilla of boat changed course soldier cheered filled with excitement of moment sailor tugged at oar headed by gig in ten minute boat reached landing place by mole a troop leaped out edgar burning with impatience anxiety led to breach be still held of turk a french entered tower have be seized with panic fled few remained at post while hurled down stone from above on to column ascending breach others met hand to hand at top of heap here sir sidney smith took place with three four of officer handful of blue jacket combat be desperate one sword of officer cutlass of sailor pike of turk clashed against bayonet of french soon important ally arrived news have speedily reached djezzar sir sidney officer be defending breach old pasha have hitherto taken personal part in conflict have a be turkish custom remained seated on divan day receiving report from officer giving audience to soldier who brought in head of enemy rewarding for valour now however leapt to foot seized sabre ran to breach shouting to soldier to follow on arrival at scene of conflict rushed forward pulled sir sidney officer forcibly back from front line must not throw away life said if english friend be killed be lost fortunately shout of pasha a ran caused number of soldier to follow now threw into fray maintained defence until edgar ran up with soldier who have just landed reinforcement a arrived be greeted with enthusiastic shout from inhabitant number of whom men woman have assembled at landing place on hearing of approach of boat garrison reanimated by succour ran also to breach combat be now so stoutly maintained that sir sidney be able to retire with pasha to whom proposed that one of newly arrived regiment thousand strong armed with bayonet disciplined in european method must make sally take enemy in flank compel to draw off pasha at once assented gate be opened turk rushed out order be to carry enemy nearest trench to shift gabions fascines to outward side to maintain there new arrival however be not yet inured to fighting a french battery opened upon soldier leaping on to parapet poured volley after volley into midst faltered presently turned fled back to gate retreat being protected by heavy discharge of grape from pounder in port sortie however have effect french have suffered heavily from flanking fire a soon a have shown on parapet assaulting column knowing from din of battle that serious sortie have be made fell back from breach retreat being hastened by discharge of number of hand grenade by midshipman of theseus on top of tower assault be not yet over napoleon with several of general group of aide de camp have be watching fight from eminence known a richard coeur de lion mount have be compelled to shift position several time by shell thrown among from ship movement be clearly visible with field glass bonaparte be seen to wave hand violently aide de camp galloped off at top of speed edgar who be standing near sir sidney smith be watching through telescope have informed sir sidney of what have seen doubtless be ordering up reinforcement will have more fighting yet then held consultation with pasha who proposed that time must carry out favourite turkish method of defence allow enemy to enter town then fall upon step be removed from wall near tower so that french when issued from top of ruined building must be obliged to follow along wall to descend by leading into pasha garden here two hundred albanian survivor of corp thousand strong who have greatly distinguished in sortie be stationed while garrison must be spared from other point together with newly arrived troop be close at hand turk be withdrawn from breach tower attack be confidently awaited came just before sunset when massive column advanced to breach resistance be offered soon appeared at top of ruin be now no higher than wall moved along rampart when came to step leading into pasha garden portion of descended while main body moved farther on made way by other step down into town then suddenly silence have reigned be broken by outburst of wild shout volley of musketry while from head of street leading into open space into french have descended turkish troop burst out in pasha garden albanian threw sabre in one hand dagger in other upon party there scarce one of whom succeeded in escaping general rombaud who commanded being among slain general lazeley being carried off wounded din of battle at main scene of conflict be heightened by babel of shout scream rose throughout town word whatever of intention to allow french to enter place have be spoken for be known that french have emissary in place who must in way contrive to inform of what be going on there success of plan must have be imperilled have intention of defender be made known to french latter fought with usual determination valour be unable to withstand fury with be attacked from side step by step be driven back to breach thus after twenty four hour of fighting position of party remained unaltered bonaparte in person have taken part in assault when troop entered town have taken up place at top of tower kleber who commanded assault have fought with accustomed bravery at head of troop for time animated by voice example soldier have resisted fiercest effort of turk even effort must not for long maintain unequal conflict a troop fell back along wall towards breach gun from elevated position mowed down many of shot striking group round bonaparte remained still immovable until almost dragged away seeming to be petrified by terrible disaster when deemed that after sacrifice loss success be at last within grasp during siege have lost five thousand men hospital be crowded with sick tribesman have ceased to send in provision even must succeed in taking town after assault force must be so far reduced a to be incapable of further action strength have already fallen from sixteen thousand to eight thousand men ten of general have be killed of eight aide de camp four have be killed two severely wounded next evening turkish regiment have made sortie on night of landing have be unable to face tremendous fire poured upon begged that might be allowed to go out again in order to retrieve permission be given colonel be told to make master of nearest line of enemy trench to hold a directed on occasion of previous work be gallantly done unheeding enemy fire turk dashed forward with loud shout leapt into trench bayonetted defender instead of setting to work to move material of parapet across to other side carried away by enthusiasm rushed forward burst way into second parallel so furiously did fight that kleber division be again advancing to make final attempt to carry breach have to be diverted from object to resist impetuous turk for three hour conflict raged although assailant be greatly outnumbered held ground nobly large number fell upon side at last turk be forced to fall back again into town desperate valour with have just fought hand to hand without advantage of position showed french troop how hopeless be task before kleber grenadier who have be victor in unnumbered battle now positively refused to attempt ascent of fatal breach again receiving news next day three french frigate have just arrived off caesarea sir sidney determined to go in pursuit of pasha be so unwilling that whole force of british must depart that sent off theseus with two turkish frigate have accompanied vessel bringing troop voyage be unfortunate one captain miller a supply of shot shell on board men of war be almost exhausted have for time kept men when not otherwise engaged at work collecting french shell have fallen without bursting in town number of have fitted with fresh fuse party of sailor be engaged in preparing others for service when from unknown cause one of exploded be instantly followed by bursting of seventy others men have be at work on fore part of poop near captain miller cabin twenty five men be at once killed vessel set on fire in five place mr england first lieutenant at once set crew to work by great exertion succeeded in extinguishing flame then continued voyage drove three french frigate to sea loss of captain miller who have be indefatigable in exertion during siege be great blow to sir sidney smith appointed lieutenant cane who have be in charge of tigre during absence on shore to command of theseus transferred lieutenant england to place of first lieutenant of tigre be generally felt that after tremendous loss suffered in last of eleven assault made by french that napoleon must no longer continue siege not only have numerical loss be enormous in proportion to strength of army have fallen upon best troop artillery have suffered terribly grenadier have be almost annihilated a assault have always be headed by picked regiment backbone of army be gone be soon ascertained indeed that napoleon be sending great convoy of sick wounded store down coast on th siege be raised french marched away chapter xiii independent command departure of french have be hastened by rapidly increasing discontent insubordination among troop during later day of siege sir sidney smith have issued great number of printed copy of letter from sultan authorizing to offer safe passage to france to french army if must surrender offer be tempting one indeed to soldier have suffered hardship of kind since have disembarked at alexandria have be parched with thirst half choked with blinding dust have seen comrade fall in number smitten by sunstroke counted little loss have suffered in battle in egypt be in ordinary way of business of soldier dread of assassination whenever ventured out from line whether in camp on march have weighed heavily upon then have come plague have more than decimated at jaffa now be reduced to well nigh strength by manner in have be sent time after time against breach in wall of insignificant town must have be of use to if taken a must have be shelled out of by british men of war gun boat sir sidney smith have passed through terrible siege without scratch although freely exposing two attempt at assassination by french emissary in town have also failed tigre sailed at once to place between jaffa damietta so cut off retreat of french army by sea not anticipating that must be case napoleon on arrival at jaffa embarked twenty three gun have brought with on board ship together with sick wounded who be unequal to desert march so great be haste that vessel be despatched short of hand without provision water a soon a tigre be made out vessel steered for confiding in well known humanity of british to prisoner be not mistaken sir sidney have abundance of supply water put on board convoyed to damietta where received from countryman surgical medical aid be beyond power to afford be not on board tigre when fell in with convoy of wounded sir sidney have early on morning after departure of french informed that must in despatch report most favourably of assistance that have rendered a interpreter aide de camp during siege for present went on will have great need for interpreter a will probably have little to do for time beyond cruising backwards forward on coast of egypt to prevent ship from france entering port with store ammunition therefore will be able to give employment think that will like one of gun boat captured from french be fast sailer hassan bey tell that when be at rhodes heard great complaint of piracy be being carried on among island turkish troop in most of be withdrawn by to swell force a sailed south there be now vessel of war in water french flag have be driven from sea while work have be too serious to admit of paying attention to aegean although a knew before left london complaint of merchant ship owner of capture of merchantman trading with constantinople other eastern port be numerous at present moment can well spare one of gun boat others will go down to watch egyptian coast will therefore commission foudre re

with two petty officer to inspect store of gun boat be very pretty craft blagrove wilkinson said with delight a regarded with pride new command yes doubt whether must have ever taken if have not be so deep in water with gun store have on board french certainly know how to build ship there be question about doubt whether have such good looking gun boat in service anyhow have not seen one petty officer who commanded gun boat saluted a wilkinson came up to side announced that have come to take command of boat be to remain on board mr wilkinson yes mr philpot be to have two petty officer sir sidney said that a knew about brig must be very useful to men be to remain here now must overhaul store what have got on board have very short supply of powder ball not above ten round for gun there

lieutenant what be required signal be made to gun boat to send one of boat ashore at once with water cask to fill up tank party be set to work to hoist up barrel of store according to list handed in by wilkinson while edgar be sent on shore with forty men with order to turkish commander of artillery to hand over to two pounder a much ammunition for pounder gun a must be provided gunner mate who be to sail in tigress accompanied to aid to get gun down to boat turkish officer at once handed over gun be able to supply little ammunition for now that french have retreated there be longer use at acre however told off twenty men to aid sailor in getting gun ammunition down in two hour whole have be placed on board boat bringing down very low in water when last party be on way down edgar hurried to old quarter have consultation with two turk who be ordered to purchase supply of wine meat such other store a must find for cabin use be told to have everything at landing place to be in readiness to go on board by four o'clock in afternoon have order be given two day before there must have be little for turk to have purchased town be already full of native from hill many chief having come down to assure pasha of fidelity to inform band of horseman be hanging on rear of retreating french great number of villager have come in to inspect scene of desperate struggle have for upwards of two month gone on unceasingly many be anxious to obtain employment in work of burying dead clearing away ruin almost brought in something to sell sheep goat chicken egg vegetable of latter edgar have ordered that large supply must be brought for use of crew for although native boat from north have while siege went on often arrived with fresh provision supply have be insufficient for demand many of sailor be suffering alike from want of fresh food from hard work most of from horrible effluvium from unburied body bestrewed ground over fighting have taken place a heavily laden boat rowed out to brig be overtaken by water boat be now making third trip reported to edgar what now carried must completely fill up tank be on board having come off with boat with store from tigre have be hard morning work be well satisfied with a sat down to lunch composed of loaf of bread bottle of wine edgar have brought off with chatted over future prospect in high glee be not so spacious a room have be occupying for last two month wilkinson said beat cockpit hollow yes be very snug little cabin french skipper evidently knew how to make comfortable be lucky that everyone have be so busy since took that one have thought of stripping there be telescope big roll of chart two brace of pistol in place know french officer be all permitted to take clothes away with so no doubt locker be empty however on examination proved not to be case for in be found three four dozen of wine two dozen of brandy good supply of chocolate coffee other cabin store see mr philpot wilkinson said when went on deck have husbanded captain store most carefully yes sir order be given to about knew that might be relieved day think have have three bottle of brandy used to take tot night thinking that there must be harm in harm at wilkinson said suppose properly under ordinary circumstance store must have be handed over at once to tigre a order be given about think be perfectly right in taking toll though know that must have be justified by regulation however certainly will risk of course sir a commander of ship be different thing altogether be only put here to look after men working gun for hour crew be hard at work lowering down store into hold packing ammunition in magazine hoisting up two eighteen pounder carriage getting into position at half past three boat be sent ashore returned with two turk quantity of provision carcase of three sheep be handed over to crew with greater portion of vegetable one sheep being kept for use of cabin petty officer together with supply of vegetable sufficient for day good supply of fruit have be brought be also divided a soon a deck be cleared hand be set to wash down need not scrub until to morrow morning mr philpot wilkinson said men have have hard day work can clean properly first thing to morrow have taken look at rigging yes sir everything be in first rate condition doubt be thoroughly fitted out before sailed certainly look like wilkinson replied a glanced at coil of rope will get up anchor at daybreak want to be under sail before tigre must not look smart for line of battle ship to be under weigh before brig at half past six wilkinson edgar in full uniform for latter have provided with full kit having bought outfit of one of midshipman of theseus who have be killed who happened to be about own height size took place in boat rowed ashore in few minute sir sidney smith arrived nearly ready for sea mr wilkinson yes sir will be ready to sail to morrow morning everything may not be quite ship shape yet few hour work on way will get everything in order very good work sir sidney said approvingly hardly thought that must have got gun on board to day commandant gave complement of turk to help to carry down sir made short work of expect that will be having more lively time of than will may pick up few store ship blockading be always dull work however hope before very long will be sending force out from england to finish with french in egypt must remember that ca be too careful with greek moslem pirate one be a bad a other from what hear generally work two three together though craft may be small carry number of men therefore boat expedition against must always be strong handed must bear in mind that although command like be fine opportunity for young officer to distinguish upon other hand if meet with misfortune tell against if have not seen mr blagrove frequently under heavy fire must scarcely have ventured to appoint to such charge know that be cool steady being so short of officer a be feeling that be of urgent importance to do something to put stop to alarming increase of piracy consider justified in making appointment by time have reached pasha palace latter evidently considered visit to be ceremonious one guard of honour be drawn up in court yard who saluted a passed in for time pasha sir sidney exchanged compliment in usual oriental style edgar translating speech without brave sailor town must have fallen on first day french opened fire pasha said men be thoroughly dispirited by event of jaffa to tell truth absolutely despaired of resistance must have left before french arrived have not ship come into bay if jaffa be very much stronger than place with garrison of men in good heart fell at first assault what must be done here where defence needed few shot to fall in ruin garrison be panic stricken believed enemy to be absolutely invincible troop must have fought better than yours towards end of siege pasha way in threw sabre in hand upon french bayonet be splendid own sailor must have fought better than did when french entered town yes yes did well then at beginning heart be water hundred french grenadier must have taken place hope will return here soon fancy that there be little chance of pasha unless be that hear that three french frigate theseus chased few day ago be on coast again in case may run across try to catch certainly there be fear of french coming here again news of what have taken place here will cause such excitement among egyptian bonaparte will have a much a can do to maintain hold on province will take care to do justice to soldier in sending report of siege to sultan sovereign ally in whose service hold rank old pasha smiled at rate sir sidney smith will take care that sultan will not send hither to capture acre instead of defending have have lesson troop be not so formidable a have deemed will have further reason for complaint against now young gentleman went on turning to midshipman hear that be going to sail in one of gun boat captured by commander to endeavour to punish of pirate be doing so much mischief not only to trade among island to vessel trading from port others with stamboul young sir have rendered a well a sir sidney smith great service throughout siege by interpreting between thus enabling to understand wish instead of being obliged to learn through who might have reported substance to french likewise have daily carried order to officer often through heavy fire have be officer of mine must have known how to recognize service must have given much promotion for such be custom in army have presented with so many purse a be not have power to give promotion sir sidney smith tell that a british officer must not receive gift in money even from foreign monarch have said however that a personal present a token of regard for service that have rendered considers that must accept present in form of jewel a might think right to offer took box of turkish make stood on table beside said be aigrette have worn in battle more appropriate present must be made to one whom have seen standing unflinchingly in fire might well have appalled veteran then turned to wilkinson sir have throughout siege be on service on shore here during first part of siege commanded little body of sailor who checked first attempt of enemy to capture tower saw fighting bravely during terrible struggle in breach when so nearly fell into hand of french therefore present with ring of honour similar to have requested sir sidney smith to have kindness to give in name to officer who distinguished most greatly in defence of town edgar translated pasha speech then opened box presented to contained superb aigrette mounted upon brooch like ornament by be fastened to turban ornament be four inch in diameter be composed entirely of precious stone with emerald of great size in centre looked at sir sidney smith be too valuable altogether said can take commander said with smile showed to morning edgar then expressed thanks in suitable term to pasha also of wilkinson whose ring contained diamond of great beauty then at sign from sir sidney left room leaving to conclude interview with pasha alone in quarter of hour joined outside palace congratulate on present said yours blagrove be undoubtedly very valuable have intended to remain permanently in service know must have allowed to accept a be see harm in may tell that pasha asked if thought that must remain in service say knowledge of several language must be of much value to that must like to have one about on whose courage a well a fidelity must rely told that knew that have other plan that must probably leave navy a soon a french evacuated egypt be knew anxious to return to parent in england have doubt mr blagrove that must have be willing to give term must hardly have hoped for elsewhere pasha be old man must have be object of jealousy to officer official be at time guilty of cruelty at know must revolt position therefore must have be precarious one enemy might not improbably endeavour to remove so formidable rival in master favour by assassination so thought that for own interest be better must take upon to decline offer thank sir must not have liked to enter service at must be idle life a well a unpleasant one besides know that father wish to take place in alexandria djezzar have behaved very handsomely sir sidney said obtained from list of officer of three ship of petty officer who have specially distinguished have given jewel to hand to officer in name also purse of money for petty officer be know immensely rich old fellow be really grieved that must not offer anything to said a much at once pointed out that putting everything else aside must be unheard of thing for commander in chief of sultan army to receive present from one however high in rank who be under order just now insisted however that must exchange ring a have absolutely tear in eye when spoke must not refuse though mine be signet ring with crest diamond worth must say thousand pound if be worth penny have by time reached landing place now lad part here for present hope that will have prosperous cruise do credit to choice understand mr wilkinson that will remain on station among island until receive other order from after seeing sir sidney off two midshipman took place in boat be rowed off to tigress be unexpected piece of luck blagrove wilkinson said when have started thought perhaps that might make present for have seen day besides interpreting have carried order to officer under heavy fire done sort of thing except landed several time to take part in sortie be lucky enough to be on shore at fight at breach when french got in did active work have hope of getting anything beyond perhaps mention in chief despatch feel quite ashamed at having so much more valuable present wilkinson oh be sure that one must begrudge to wilkinson replied get special pay for being interpreter give tremendous lot of work besides going about a do with sir sidney be constantly under fire besides pasha saw great deal more of than did of anyone else except chief congratulate upon heartily if ever want to turn into money will be quite small fortune luckily father be in position to make good allowance so have intention of ever parting with ring will be remembrance of siege sort of thing to wear on grand occasion found that during absence men have worked hard except for final scrub brig be now ship shape in good order at four o'clock in morning crew be again on deck be still dark men set to with will to scrub deck for a said if passed near tigre must not like deck to look like of trader in ballast hour hard work have finished just a look out reported that tigre men be going aloft to loosen sail be light now in very few minute canvas be spread anchor catted tigre with great sail spread be not yet under way brig a laid course west passed hundred yard under stern tigress ran up ensign for sun be just showing dipped in salute midshipman waved hand to comrade on board saluted more formally sir sidney who stood at bulwark watching craft a passed who returned salute with cheery shout of well done tigress then went on course after exchange of cheer between crew clustered by bulwark of tigress in top of man of war now be fairly off edgar said what do written instruction say be to go to rhodes there to make inquiry of port authority a to outrage have be lately reported to be guided by what hear in fact matter be left entirely in hand after once get there know how have better divide watch must hardly be thing for a skipper to take watch yet must be most satisfactory way of arranging must take gunner boatswain in fact think must be ridiculous to work in other way just a like wilkinson have doubt that boatswain must do just a well better than must will take watch at rate until see how petty officer get on be ticklish navigation among island certainly must not feel comfortable if be on deck there be tigre fairly under way steering south by west be walking along ai breeze just suit be very different craft now to what be when overhauled laden down pretty nearly to covering board think in breeze like that tigre must be able to catch although of course if wind strengthened much weight must tell however there be doubt at that craft be fast hope ere long will try speed against one of pirate expect that off wind with big lateen sail of theirs be very fast on wind must have chance with when get away from rhodes will disguise bit put yellow streak to give look of trader be much more likely to find than be to find where be to send prize be if take if be small craft be to burn if take must be likely to be of use to chief in blockade be to sell prisoner take be to hand over to pasha at smyrna if be moslem if be greek fewer prisoner take better must be infinitely more merciful to shoot down in fair fight than to hand over to tender mercy of turk sir sidney said that must largely leave matter to discretion must rather that have given positive order in writing on subject for be awkward thing for midshipman to have thing like left to discretion especially a at other time superior officer seem to think that midshipman posse discretion chapter xiv pirate hold on arriving at rhodes wilkinson edgar rowed ashore a soon a anchor be dropped called upon turkish governor be received with much honour governor be delighted to hear news be first to bring that french have abandoned siege of acre be retreating in haste to egypt gave order for salute to be fired at once in honour of great success then asked wilkinson what must do for assuring that must put resource of island at disposal edgar a interpreter assured governor that have occasion to avail largely of offer that in consequence of amount of ammunition expended in siege be short of powder ball musketry ammunition must be very much obliged for a large supply a must spare gave order at once for issue to of a much a required edgar then went on object of coming here sir be to endeavour to check piracy be now being carried on among island numerous complaint have reached sir sidney smith from turkish british greek merchant ship be constantly missing there be doubt that have be captured scuttled crew massacred ship be small one for purpose governor said for from divan on be sitting commanded view of port hope that be large enough edgar replied be heavily armed for size be fast sailer sir sidney smith have larger vessel at disposal a need two men of war small frigate for watching egyptian coast indeed have be able to send larger craft must not have be so well suited for purpose for pirate must hardly have ventured to attack will after have put out to sea disguise brig rig a merchantman in order to tempt out will not do until be well away for pirate may have friend here who might send information will head for south will give out that be to rejoin commander off alexandria a have only come round here to give news of retreat of french will be glad if will furnish with two men having thorough knowledge of island of spot where piratical craft be most likely to harbour must be trusty men who will not open lip here a to design can find two such men governor said used to be captain of craft traded among island now own several vessel of have disappeared be continually coming up here pestering with complaint though have told again again that can hing in matter know that must very gladly go with in order to aid in punishment of pirate such indeed turned out to be case edgar have long talk with learned from spot where be supposed that pirate have rendezvous a many vessel whose course have lain near have disappeared asked to go into town gather what further information must from men whose craft have be chased have succeeded in getting away told to be at landing place after dark so that passage to ship must be unnoticed for agreed with undoubtedly many of pirate have agent at rhodes other important port intelligence be carried by small quick sailing craft to pirate of vessel likely to be valuable prize abundant supply of ammunition be taken off to brig in course of afternoon supply of fresh provision replenished two young officer dined with governor who have large party in honour including many of military authority next morning started at six held course south until be sure that brig must no longer be seen even from highest point on island at four bell in afternoon changed course sailing between scarpanto carso headed north passed before nightfall between slazida placa crew have be busy painting broad yellow line round brig in slackening rigging giving vessel appearance of slovenly merchant brig have learned from turk although undoubtedly act of piracy took place in western archipelago be comparatively isolated act committed upon small vessel becalmed near one other of island attack being made in boat that be among numerous island lying off coast of asia minor between nicaria samos on north serrest piscopia on south that piracy be most frequent a rule said vessel coming down from dardanelles kept well west of mitylene chios rounded naxos syra bore south to santorin before shaping course east if bound for syria so a to avoid dangerous neighbourhood to begin with advised that course must be laid so a to pas short distance east of astropalaia said have long be one of headquarters of piracy have before war began be several time attacked by turkish european ship of war craft found there burnt coast village destroyed since then be believed that have again become headquarters of pirate from of other island a position be favourable one for attack lying in direct line of traffic between constantinople greece eastern trade with rhodes cyprus syria egypt night be fine with gentle breeze sharp look out be kept for two group of tiny island be scarce more than rock have to be passed before nearing breeze died away at daybreak left vessel becalmed at distance of six mile from island must not be better placed one of turk said see group of island at mouth of bay be called pirate rock in old day one of rock be stronghold of pirate ship thirty year ago four turkish frigate caught eighteen piratical craft lying at anchor behind shelter destroyed one of be not long before others took place if there be good wind blowing edgar must like nothing better than to sail right in there wilkinson said in light breeze fellow must run away from with big sail sweep if there be of in there now one of turk remarked a wilkinson closely surveyed islet through glass most likely have made out before only hope there will not be too many of more merrier wilkinson laughed a edgar translated with ten gun sixty blue jacket ought to be able to beat off number of scoundrel ask how many gun fellow generally mount turk shook head be of size be only row boat without gun at carrying perhaps not more than dozen men two will row rest lie down in bottom will have fruit perhaps piled up in stern a row up to small craft at anchor becalmed there be suspicion of real character until get close alongside then leap up carry vessel before crew have time to arm if be very small useless to will take out everything of value fasten prisoner down below scuttle if be larger will tow into little bay take out cargo in boat at leisure cut throat of prisoner alter appearance of ship so that can not be recognized engage dozen more hand set up on larger scale of craft be used a fishing boat when time be quiet there be ship of war about while larger one may go into trade of smaller craft will carry couple of gun larger one eight ten be generally much smaller than yours though sometimes be armed with cannon taken from prize a rule trust at to gun wish to draw attention by sound to what be going on attack at night carry prey by boarding if be in day crew be sent below gun hidden have so peaceful aspect that be only when change course suddenly when within few hundred yard that alarm be excited be alongside before trader can load gun a be crowded with men carry before serious resistance can be offered illustration with tremendous cheer flung upon pirate page at rhodes have taken on board dozen bucket load of earth night before of have be emptied into large tub be then filled up with water stirred briskly after sailor have gone aloft wetted sail with muddy water rendering appearance dingy in extreme here there white patch have be left gave sail appearance of being old recently mended with yard set at different angle slackened rigging tigress must not have be recognized a smart craft have twenty four hour before sailed from rhodes sailor be in high glee after hard work have have at acre looked upon a holiday entered with greatest zest into work of disguising ship now lad must sit down wilkinson said only five six head must be shown above bulwark doubtless have good glass taken from ship have captured if saw that have unusually strong crew might smell rat be now dead calm sail hung idly down brig lay almost motionless on waveless sea be pretty sure that can make out upper spar of two three craft behind long low islet wilkinson edgar said after for twentieth time gazing long earnestly through telescope fancied so two three time edgar be by mean sure that be not fancy felt more sure of at first than do now for there be slight mist rising from water if come out to by afternoon will go in have look at have got dozen sweep on board with boat must work in in couple of hour hope sha' have to do edgar replied must guess what be at once must be scattering in direction might pick up one two rest must get off carry news of to island round perhaps be right wilkinson agreed must certainly be unfortunate to begin by giving scare besides edgar went on if calm hold till night may come out try to take by surprise day passed very slowly heat be great men picked out spot on deck where sail threw shade dosed off to sleep have long before made preparation cutlass have be ground boarding pike sharpened pistol loaded primed pile of shot lay by side of gun needed only to fetch up powder cartridge from magazine to be ready for action marine have cleaned loaded musket placed in rack at two o'clock after dinner have be eaten wilkinson said to boatswain starboard watch can sling hammock turn in if like if fellow mean to come out attack will hardly do before becomes dark perhaps not until two three o'clock in morning a will have to be watchful there be occasion for watch to stay on deck now port watch will go off from two bell till eight a take first watch will be brighter for snooze beforehand wish beggar must come out have done with went on to edgar a boatswain turned away blew whistle think may a well go down a be watch on deck have roused when change at two bell if wake of own accord contrary to usual custom in calm earnest desire of on board be that must continue for must breeze spring up must be forced to sail away pirate might not pursue a soon a got dark wilkinson told boatswain that must be a well that song must be started occasionally that not more than five six men be to join in chorus if a came out heard dead silence might think unnatural be quite possible that boat must come on ahead of to try make out what really be in interval between song silence reigned on deck listened intently about nine o'clock edgar exclaimed can hear oar so can wilkinson replied after listening for minute think that be sweep be boat rowed by two four men four think in minute two be satisfied that be boat order be given for song after three four men be to talk rest to sit down below bulwark to keep silence two turk took place near officer from speed at boat be approaching be certain that be not deeply laden there be fear therefore of surprise being attempted passed within twenty yard of tafrail must make out that be ordinary fisherman boat there be pile of net in stern four men be standing up rowing wish must get little wind one of called out wish so too one of turk answered have be lying becalmed day bound for constantinople suppose came from boat for smyrna be bringing cargo from ancona will load up at smyrna with fruit with turkish good night men rowed on singer forward at once began song for quarter of hour must hear sound of oar growing fainter fainter then ceased have rowed straight on till think be out of hearing wilkinson said now will make circuit go back to friend with news there be doubt be in luck if get brush with first night after arrival on cruising ground about three o'clock in morning confused sound must be heard in two three minute man be at post there be only two at most three of edgar said in tone of disappointment doubt whether be not big rowing boat stroke be too quick for sweep for boat towing what beastly nuisance suppose when fellow took back report that though be good sized brig did not seem to have many hand thought that be not worth while to tow out big craft when row boat must do think that with twelve fifteen hand in boat advantage of surprise must be able to overpower at once surprise will be other way wilkinson said angrily will send three to bottom at first broadside think must do wilkinson for if do there be end of chance of capturing of larger craft of course see that be annoying part of business what do propose then must say that best plan must be not to hail until get close on board then for man forward to give sudden shout a if have be asleep on watch have only just heard then will come tumbling on board thinking that ship be already theirs might divide men keep forward half aft moment get on board rush down upon tell off six men with order to jump down into boat a soon a can to push off so a to cut off retreat boat will be very useful to for can tow brig in with people in there will think that have be captured will get right in middle of before find out that have caught tartar by jove be first rate idea to surprise men be at once called away from gun divided into two party edgar boatswain commanded that gathered forward wilkinson gunner that aft nine men be told off for capture of boat for a edgar pointed out when pirate found that be caught in trap good many of might leap overboard try to get into boat might need fully three men to keep off now lad understand wilkinson said a party be about to take up place must crouch down keep yourselves perfectly quiet until word be given be important to get on board when see one on deck will think that one two men who might be on watch have run below can use pistol freely when fighting once begin when fellow find that be trapped be likely enough to fight hard want to lose men keep cutlass in readiness trust principally to boarding pike boat be four five hundred yard away when crew of tigress took up position minute later one of men in bow shouted suddenly there be boat coming quick on deck pirate pirate then four five men down in forecastle also shouted ran up on deck then with cry of alarm ran below again then quietly time joined comrade who be crouching a closely together a possible forward of bitt there be roar of voice from boat must hear oar plied desperately then closely following came three bump against side of brig clambering up chain pirate poured tumultuously upon deck breaking into shout of triumph a met with resistance there be pause of astonishment a gun be seen then leader shouted that must be dummy intended to run out frighten people in daytime down below men one shouted finish with first will be time to talk afterwards one of turk who spoke little french crouching by side of wilkinson translated word of pirate rushed towards forecastle others aft to cabin where must find officer then figure crawled out from below tarpaulin be loosely thrown over gun looked over rail then sprang down into boat be entirely deserted a did so there be shout from wilkinson be answered by edgar then five twenty seaman sprang up from end of vessel with tremendous cheer flung upon pirate taken completely by surprise somewhat outnumbered many of be cut down run through by pike before anything like serious resistance must be offered then headed by leader fought with desperation of cornered animal of carried pistol a well a yataghan few of ran to side with yell of fury leaped overboard to recapture boat pistol cracked on side cutlas yataghan clashed together british shout rose high over yell of pirate in three minute fighting be virtually over greater portion of pirate lay dead on deck few have jumped overboard rest throwing down arm fell on knee cried for mercy will do men will do wilkinson shouted scoundrel a be can not kill in cold blood get length of rope boatswain tie hand foot men who have leapt into water swam towards boat did not attempt to climb in when saw three sailor in standing with cutlas pistol ready to oppose swam back towards brig rope be thrown to be permitted to climb up one by one being bound laid by comrade a gained deck none of sailor have be killed though several have received ugly gash now boatswain put starboard watch into boat lower two ship boat also will get a many oar to work a possible till daylight of captured boat rowed six oar thirty men be soon at work towing vessel towards bay port watch then set to work to clear deck dead be thrown overboard others be unbound made to strip off jacket then bound again carried down to hold hatchway being closed on found that most of survivor be greek turk having to man fallen fighting mixed crew be worst of one of turk said turkish pirate be bad enough so be greek there be little to choose between be only worst desperado who will consort together did wrong to spare man must not kill when threw down arm wilkinson said will hand over to authority at smyrna at rhodes will make short work of fancy a soon a first gleam of dawn appeared in sky boat be called alongside of tigress be hoisted up men in others be given jacket of prisoner having turban greek headgear garment have also be stripped from dead before body be thrown overboard be laid in heap in readiness for on deck to put on when approached bay when became daylight be not more than mile half from island men in boat have be warned not to row too regularly on board have already put on disguise a passed between two of islet exclamation of satisfaction burst from wilkinson edgar for six vessel be anchored behind largest of brig head be turned towards a approached shout of welcome exultation must be heard from crew craft be of various size two of be not above thirty ton burden carried two light gun others be from fifty to hundred fifty ton carried from six to twelve gun tigress be within about four hundred yard of line when helm be put down a if to take in between two of largest craft then wilkinson who with edgar be in turkish disguise waved hand for men in boat to come alongside a did so there be shout of surprise from crew of nearest vessel for there be mistaking sailor white trouser for baggy integument of turk at same moment port hole opened gun be run out before last man have gained deck ten gun poured in broadside by wilkinson order three on side be trained on craft nearest to remaining two on broadside being aimed at vessel next to gun have be double shotted at same moment broadside be fired ensign be run up to peak wild hubbub of shout of astonishment fury alarm rose from pirate ship be re echoed by number of men belonging to crew clustered on shore to see prize brought in ran to gun began to load others jumped into boat sprang overboard swam towards shore a fast a gun on board tigress must be loaded fire be kept up forward one sweeping deck of craft nearest to with grape while others sent round shot into farther away be for short time that pirate thought of fighting light gun be match for heavy metal of on board brig in quarter of hour after first shot be fired largest of craft have be sunk other five be entirely deserted boat be manned brig head be first pulled round until broadside bore on shore then anchor be dropped gun on port side opened with grape upon pirate on shore at five six house be perched high on rock leaving boatswain in charge wilkinson edgar took place in boat rowed from ship to ship be found empty a agreed that only two of largest be worth taking away other three be burned when be fairly on fire boat returned to brig not pirate be to be seen on island though be sure that although number of have be killed there must still be fully two hundred of there must either have hidden among rock made way down to seaward face a several boatload might have rowed away to other islet be decided to take landing party of five thirty men on shore for a operation must be covered by gun of brig there be little probability of pirate attempting to attack a soon a landed sailor led by two midshipman climbed rapidly up hill without shot being fired approached house on top from heavy musketry fire suddenly broke out men must have rushed forward at once wilkinson called out to to throw down behind shelter a did so shell flew overhead struck largest of house exploded shot followed shot rapidly fire of pirate ceased then wilkinson gave word sailor leapt up with cheer rushed forward save for few woman house be entirely deserted fifty men be seen running down seaward face couple of volley be poured into then placing dozen of men on guard midshipman entered house shell have worked great damage over score of men lay dead within a many others wounded woman have be in cellar be glad to find that none of have be hurt cellar be very extensive house having one several of be crammed with good of sort evidently proceeds of prize of such varied description that judged that house formed storehouse to one vessel a otherwise more valuable good must have be collected together instead of sail ship gear bale of valuable silk embroidery from constantinople broussa smyrna chios alexandria syria being mixed promiscuously together here too be quantity of european manufacture showing that be not only native craft have suffered from depredation there be number of barrel of greek wine puncheons of rum case of bottled wine of different kind evidently taken from english ship great quantity of smyrna fig of currant egyptian date sack of flour will bring in nice lot of prize money blagrove wilkinson said after have roughly examined content of great subterranean storehouse presently still larger find be made there be close to house what appeared to be well one of sailor let down bucket hauling up found to surprise that be salt water well be deep certainly not deep enough to reach down to sea level carried bucket to wilkinson pointed out where have got water from there be something curious about latter said lower down in bucket lad a descended saw that well be ancient one probably at one time have be carried very much lower than at present in place masonry have fallen in at one of point there be opening cut into rock called to above to hoist up again procuring lamp at one of house edgar descended together entering passage found that widened into great chamber forty foot square thirty high be literally crammed with good must never have given fellow credit for having taken trouble to cut out place a wilkinson said have doubt that be ancient work edgar remarked must say that at time perhaps when genoese be master here castle may have stood above be cut either a storehouse a place of confinement for prisoner one where garrison might hide with provision enough to last for long time in case place be captured pirate may have discovered in going down to see if well must be cleared out saw that must make splendid place of concealment how about salt water edgar must say that cemented bottom rammed with clay to make water tight that a fresh water be scarce brought up sea water so that anyone who happened to look down must see that there be water in if a be probable must be turk who captured place must when found that be salt not trouble head further about matter possibly even pirate may know nothing of existence of store may have lain here since last time turk broke up nest of pirate who may be sure left none of alive to tell tale well be find thorough search be now made of island be found that whole of pirate have made escape in boat have rowed away from seaward face of island so that be unseen by on board brig before taking step to carry away good other islet be visited found to be deserted five six more magazine of spoil be discovered be emptied of most valuable content house burned to ground operation took two day required six more to transfer content of cellar great store cavern to brig boat have come off on first day of arrival from various village in bay conveying one more of principal inhabitant who assured wilkinson that have connection with pirate that be extremely glad that nest have be destroyed wilkinson have little doubt that although might not have be concerned in deed committed by men must have be in constant communication with have supplied with fruit fresh meat vegetable however told that must report assurance to turkish authority who must when have ship of war available doubtless send down inquire into whole circumstance intimation caused considerable alarm a have doubt that if worse befell must be made to pay heavy fine only way that have to show earnestness in matter wilkinson said be to organize yourselves have doubt plenty of boat first time that pirate come in here row out from village attack burn leave man alive to tell tale in way pirate will very soon learn that 'd better choose other spot for rendezvous authority will be well content with conduct amount of spoil taken be so great that tigress when set sail again be nearly foot deeper in water than when entered bay prisoner have be subject of much discussion be agreed that be probably worse than comrade who have escaped did not like thought of handing over to be executed be therefore on third day after arrival of brig brought up on deck three dozen lash be administered to then be given one of boat in have attacked ship told to go chapter xv cruising before sailing yellow band be painted out for pirate who escaped must probably carry news of what have happened over whole archipelago ten men be put on board of prize tigress sailed up through island escorted to smyrna where pasha after hearing account of capture at once gave permission for to be sold a prize a news of retreat of french have given considerable impetus to trade fetched good price a soon a be arranged tigress sailed away again for month cruised among island putting into little bay inlet boarding craft found there searching thoroughly to see if there be property belonging to plundered vessel on board once twice came upon two three large craft together have hard fighting before captured sank a rule crew rowed ashore a soon a saw real nature of new comer thirty craft be sent a prize into smyrna rhodes there sold a many more be sunk burned have in case found spoil at equal to have be captured at astropalaia total be nevertheless considerable once twice be attacked by boat when anchored in quiet bay a vigilant watch be always kept beat off assailant with heavy loss rig of brig be frequently altered sometimes be turned into schooner with yard on foremast sometimes into fore aft craft a time went on capture became fewer fewer be evident that have established thorough scare throughout archipelago that for time pirate have taken to peaceful avocation be indeed completely crippled by loss of so large number of craft tigress have one awkward incident during voyage day be bright clear two turk have be a be custom squatting together on deck smoking pipe wilkinson edgar be pacing together up down when latter said look at two native craft have let lateen sail run down be sure know why there be not cloud in sky except little white one over there be passing turk at moment edgar said to one of two craft over there have just let sail run down what can mean turk leapt to foot with quickness very unusual to be white squall shouted down with stitch of canvas sir quick for life squall will be upon in five minute be wilkinson first experience of terribly sudden squall of levant have heard of knew danger shouted at top of voice hand take in sail quick lad for life boatswain whistle rang loudly in air repeated order at top of voice men on deck who have be engaged on various small job since came up from dinner looked astounded at order without hesitation ran up ratline at top of speed while watch below looked equally surprised a glanced upwards around at deep blue of sky quick quick turk exclaimed let go sheet halliard wilkinson shouted do sail up anyhow men although sky be unchanged must see light cloud edgar have noticed advancing towards at extraordinary rate of speed while white line on sea kept pace with hard up with helm hard up wilkinson shouted hold on moment with head sail will do will do let go halliard down staysail jib sailor now conscious of coming danger worked desperately light upper sail be secured course have be clewed up topsail be still half lashed when wilkinson shouted again down for life down on weather side slip down by back stay men to leeward hold on hold on shouted few second later there be dull roaring sound rising to shriek a squall struck vessel most of men have gained deck in safety many of coming down by ratline be still distance from deck be well for that be on weather side have be to leeward must have be torn from grasp whereas be now pinned to rigging two sound like explosion of cannon be heard main foretopsails blew out of gasket bellied for instant then burst from bolt rope flew away be speedily lost to sight so great be pressure that brig be driven bodily down until water be almost level with rail at bow looked for moment a if must go down by head one of jib be run up only to be blown away before be sheeted home be tried sheet being kept very slack held head lifted in minute tigress be flying along dead before wind storm jib be brought up hooked on hoisted being of very heavy canvas must be trusted a soon a be set other be hauled down thank god be over wilkinson said have not lost hand by time men have gained deck how long will last edgar shouted in one of turk ear perhaps one hour perhaps four let have look at chart wilkinson said when last looked there be group of rock ten mile ahead at rate be going tigress will be smashed into matchwood if keep on course for long edgar nodded must get trysails on main foremast wilkinson went on manage to lay course couple of point to west wish have upper spar down on deck be of use talking of now wilkinson went down to sail room with boatswain four seaman to bring up two heaviest strongest of triangular sail must sheet home before hoist said a returned on deck must never be able to haul sheet in when sail once fill twenty men went aft with commenced task fore trysail be bent to of mast hoop sheet fastened to cavel on port side port helm little man wilkinson said will do just enough to keep wind on starboard quarter keep at keep at edgar have sail ready to hoist tack little now half dozen of tail on here get ready to haul down a soon a sail be up to full height halliard secured now lad tail on to halliard away with sailor ran forward with rope a sail rose strain be so great that once twice be brought to standstill at last boatswain shouted be enough come back little keep firm grip of be right shouted a twisted slack of rope over cleet now lad down with tack down with belay main trysail be hoisted a successfully small a be sail slight angle with wind pressure brought ship down nearly to covering board wilkinson boatswain took place by wheel keep full lad not bit more will do at by jove blagrove said a edgar came aft glanced at compass be narrow squeak if have noticed native craft lower sail called attention to must have turned turtle a sure a fate have got snug now if be right a to position at noon will clear rock nicely think can have be far wrong by position of island at same time will go up to foretop edgar said will be able to make out distance away for if remember two of be thirty forty foot above water mind how go wilkinson said have better take one of men up with can hold other on then edgar went forward told one of best of hand to go aloft with right honour will be tight job daresay can do get couple of line seven eight foot long will fasten under arm if puff come harder than usual can twist end round shroud ratline in couple of minute be roped ready to mount be hard work several time have to use rope to prevent being torn from hold at last reached top fastened securely there scene be singular one overhead be cloudless sky somewhat paler in tint than have be before squall burst below be white mass of foam from height on stood seemed almost pressed level by force of wind on deck have be drenched with sheet of spray torn off head of wave a soon a began to lift here be above there be nothing to prevent looking round in direction there be rock sir top man said after have be twenty minute in position over lee bow about two point off course see now edgar said thought must have made out by white foam round be white everywhere shouted down to deck be time before must make voice heard above roar of squall pointed aft when at last one looked up sailor ran aft to helm called wilkinson attention to edgar latter pointed in direction of rock wilkinson waved hand edgar then leaving sailor on watch made way down to deck will go within mile of said when joined comrade be lucky that looked at chart a soon a did wilkinson shouted back for even with rag of sail must not have liked to bring nearer to wind than be now think be blowing quite a hard a be edgar said certainly got down more easily than went up be thinking so blagrove though there be not much difference care now that be clear of rock how long keep on directly pas can keep off wind again there be nothing in course then for over forty mile then be only small island with deep water round have just be taking look at chart by hour strength of wind have considerably abated fore staysail be reefed hoisted before sunset sail be on again hand be aloft preparing to get up fresh topsail at end of six month on going into rhodes found that small gun boat have arrived with order from sir sidney smith for to rejoin have done exceedingly well latter said in letter pasha of smyrna rhodes have written to expressing admiration at work that have accomplished indeed report of number of pirate vessel taken destroyed speaks for be not sorry at receipt of order during past month have only made two three capture be craft of small size be well content to give up independent life return to regular duty week later made out tigre lying off damietta mouth of nile man of war signalled to to anchor near a soon a did so wilkinson went on board be glad to see back mr wilkinson sir sidney said cordially have fully justified confidence in energy discretion pasha write to saying that piracy seems to be completely suppressed that be two month since of received complaint of vessel being chased missing therefore a wanted here where have not half enough ship for work thought a well to recall craft seems went on a surveyed tigress through glass good deal lower in water than be yes sir be down nearly two foot half reported to that gained considerable amount of booty at astropalaia of course have added gradually to never have anything like so good haul hold up to level of main deck be full full of what mr wilkinson miscellaneous cargo sir dried fruit manchester good eastern good of sort have not taken exact inventory of sir for be generally pressed for time thought that thing be le likely to be damaged if did not open bale really know exactly what have got there be certainly good deal of silk quantity of embroidered thing sound well anyhow sir sidney said smiling be afraid that will not turn out so well for personally a ought to do see craft herself be prize of tigre officer crew be still borne on book therefore although be detached on altogether independent work still rank a tender of tigre share with indeed name have be sent in on list of entitled to share in prize that have made here a have be generally laden partly with ammunition partly with luxury for use of army be for most part valuable up to time calculate that sum of fifty sixty thousand pound will be shared quite understood sir that must share with tigre in that captured must have be too bad if in addition to luck in having independent cruise on board tigress be to get advantage over comrade in way of prize money have a told in last report received twelve thousand five hundred pound result of sale of thirty two craft sent into smyrna rhodes be in gold thought that must be better for to send off boat for than for to bring now what be to do with cargo sir must think that over mr wilkinson have not lost many hand hope while be away sir have not done very hard fighting have two men shot in attack of pirate hold at astropalaia more than crew have be wounded more le seriously fortunately got over be very satisfactory mr wilkinson in giving full report of work give list of casualty in case of people at admiralty seem to have idea that credit of affair depends largely on size of butcher bill whereas in point of fact must be exactly other way for not unfrequently heavy loss mean that measure be badly taken by officer in command whereas light one show that arrangement be excellent work carried out without hitch will be glad if mr blagrove will dine with be not very regular for to leave ship together there be sign of change of wind one can reckon with certainty here upon weather for at rate twenty four hour in advance if must see change before come off fall in glass mr blagrove must stay on board wilkinson now joined comrade who be gathered short distance away waiting until have finished talk with sir sidney come down below wilkinson give news heard that have taken prize from pirate want to hear about be blagrove right be soon gathered in cockpit have not much time to stay wilkinson said before tell story want to hear news for beyond few rumour current at smyrna rhodes really know hardly anything of what have taken place since left at acre have have rather dull time one of said only excitement be fight between turk aided by boat french when returned here found that instead of being fifteen thousand strong a promised turk on board transport under mustapha pasha be five thousand strong be raised to seven thousand by two thousand brought with from acre on th of july landed attacked redoubt castle of aboukir with great pluck carried by assault week later heard that bonaparte be at ramanieh have doubt that turk must soon have on sir sidney tried hard to get to erect strong line of work across spit of ground on fort stand have done so must with assistance of boat own gun boat have maintained ground chief set to work at once to endeavour to get thing into shape chiflick regiment that have brought with from acre be posted in village at end of spit turkish gun boat be ordered to take place directly assault began on side of isthmus so a to sweep with fire when time came beggar must not move did not arrive until be over turk in village be attacked several time made magnificent defence helped with gun a much a must must render very little assistance at last saw that attack be to be made in earnest peremptory order be sent to turkish gun boat to go in take up station boat went in to west side of spit nothing must be worse than arrangement of turk have sent very little provision next to water on shore troop be nearly half mad with thirst more than half mutinous however moved forward to village there repulsed three attack made by french column probably more attack must have be made if have not be for beastly custom of cutting off head of fallen lot of ran out of village to do so infuriated french that came on again with rush that entered village with flying turk confusion be terrible turk be driven out spit of sand be covered with fugitive hundred threw into water swam out to castle a know be little bit of place be crowded almost to suffocation thousand must not get in fire of boat gun kept french back for time when at last turkish gun boat got into position have to fall back make advance against castle in regular way unfortunately mustapha pasha have be taken in village garrison have one to command still resisted for two day then surrendered being almost mad with thirst for although spared a much water a must be impossible for to find sufficient for six seven thousand extra men marine saved castle first day colonel douglas landing taking command restoring order for turk be fighting fiercely among when got in during night managed to send off about thousand of to ship whole business be brought about owing to mustapha pasha not acting in accordance with advice sir sidney have sent to act against damietta rosetta a ship must station in bay of aboukir so threaten alexandria that french must not care to weaken force there by sending considerable number of men to act against turk there be have happened now let hear yarn wilkinson gave brief account of trip of tigress see said have not done much fighting indeed with exception of first scrimmage at astropalaia can scarcely have said to have have anything worth calling fighting at picked up lot of small piratical craft destroyed majority of sold others at smyrna rhodes got altogether twelve thousand five hundred for a of course will be shared by tigre have done pretty well share in way of earning prize money for ship more indeed for tigre share of prize that have taken here wo come to more than fifteen twenty thousand at outside besides that have got booty on board tigress what be worth have idea for simply bundled thing down below without opening anything still doubt will be enough to give few pound head a soon a must get away wilkinson returned to brig that evening at admiral table gave much more detailed account of doings than have done in report when have finished sir sidney smith said that attack upon pirate hold be extremely well managed mr wilkinson doe mr blagrove great credit be very brief in account of only said that considerable amount of booty have evidently be taken from plundered ship be found concealed that more valuable portion be shipped on tigress will come on board in morning can have few of bale brought up on to main deck can see what be in dozen bale be opened next day two contained european good rest eastern manufacture silk embroidery turkish syrian persian carpet rug be enough sir sidney said now can roughly give idea what proportion of european good dried fruit what may call generally eastern good have there be about twenty ton of fruit sir thirty ton of european bale fifty sixty ton of eastern good of must say that two third be carpet rug must pretty well tell from others by size feel of bale rest be judging from few opened cloth for female garment muslin silk scarf sash embroidered good be extraordinary how so great collection must have be made there have be great many vessel employed in making of sir may say that have here pick from at least hundred perhaps several time that number of captured craft of several size doubt pirate must in case put aside good of kind for although of use to doubt very difficult to sell must store away under idea that time other opportunity must occur of turning into money well there be doubt that have extremely rich prize must be afraid to give even approximate calculation of what be worth of east indiaman bring very valuable cargo home must doubt whether one ship ever carried a much costly merchandise a have stored here will think over how have best be got to england thing will require careful handling for if be consigned to ordinary prize agent might be sold anyhow for value on following day two midshipman be signalled to come on board tigre have be thinking matter over gentleman sir sidney said when have entered cabin have power to appoint prize agent in england a matter of fact have not done so coming out here a did on diplomatic mission have thought of taking prize have picked up here simply sent to agent at gibraltar by way be one of very worst place one can send to a vessel be sold at ridiculous price ordinarily must be port must have sent to from here a be still in possession of french gibraltar be only port in mediterranean of course might be sent to england there be difficulty of detaching men officer risk of being captured by french privateer so practically be driven to gibraltar of course prize court will have disposal of cargo will write to head of court who be personal friend of mine asking to intrust sale of eastern good to father mr blagrove saying that a have be for year engaged in trade in east must therefore be acquainted with value of thing be in habit of sending egyptian silk so on to london for sale must know channel in must be best disposed of of course dried fruit english good must be sold by court must never do to throw quantity of eastern good on market at once among prize have be taken be smart brig of about same size a tigress be caught making for alexandria with powder ball for french army fortunately for captain be not first class navigator so missed mark by about ten mile found to consternation satisfaction close under gun be going to send to gibraltar to be sold think that can do better than buy to carry home cargo will call court of four officer to put on price consider probable that will fetch must say if be sold at gibraltar must not be over eight nine hundred pound mr blagrove can buy in name of father will take bill at three month upon then there be question of crew a to officer can send home mr wilkinson with despatch have not have opportunity of forwarding for week now to mr blagrove can give three month leave on urgent private business a to men have small craft coming over here constantly from sicily with fruit fresh provision have doubt that with offer of good wage must be able to pick up ten twelve men without much difficulty on board ship there be must say at least twenty men who have be invalided by board of doctor a being unfit for service from effect of wound climate must be good opportunity for sending home many of be still fit for easy work must at rate counterbalance italian crew of course must formally take passage for in mr blagrove ship prize mount six gun must advise to keep well out of way of french privateer of course final result of sale of merchandise must have to be paid by father mr blagrove into prize court for division among entitled to with ship a father property case be different be private venture will of course charge freight on merchandise will get two three pound head for taking invalid home a will certainly get double price brig must fetch at gibraltar freight must good deal more than clear expense will of course have usual prize agent commission on sale effect what do think of plan midshipman be highly pleased with proposal thanked commander very heartily for kindness board of officer assembled on following day assessed value of french brig at l edgar formally bought in father name for sum drew bill upon for payment in three month have several time heard from since have entered on board tigre in first letter mr blagrove gave hearty approval of course that have adopted said that year two at sea must give thorough knowledge of ship be considerable advantage to in business receipt of edgar first letter of heavy budget containing account of doings in egypt from day on be left behind to on sailed have be immense relief to for hitherto have be in absolute ignorance of what have taken place father however thought that have even according to own account run very needle risk in taking part in rising at cairo although saw that having for time become so thoroughly associated with arab must have be difficult for to avoid acting with when there be danger in so doing chapter xvi visit home new purchase be named suzanne be towed alongside tigress crew began at once to get up cargo transfer to hold more method be observed in restowing cargo than have before be possible dried fruit a heaviest of good be placed in middle of brig european good whose brand packing enabled to be easily distinguished from rest be placed forward eastern bale packed aft be done under direction of petty officer during four day that took to complete work edgar boarded several of italian craft succeeded in inducing ten active young sailor to join by offer of rate of pay several time higher than that earned in native craft of free passage back on first opportunity condor be appointed to command of tigress a two supernumerary lieutenant four midshipman have be sent out from home to tigre two midshipman received acting order a lieutenant there be much satisfaction among junior officer of tigre when heard from wilkinson nature of spoil have gathered sort of guess be hazarded a to value can not help there in least said know that turkish eastern carpet fetch big price at home of course silk gold silver embroidery be valuable a only know content of about hundred bale have more idea of what total be likely to come to than have did not get money wilkinson jewel one other suppose that money be divided when captured jewel given to woman sold be thing might be disposed of anywhere at rate found none of only cash be a told twelve thousand five hundred pound that prize fetched out of share be not likely to be more than twenty thirty pound still be not to be despised will come to more than one of party said have calculated up though have not exact rule well if have got exact rule macleod calculation be not worth more than guess wo be much more than forty pound anyhow suppose bit more than for share of prize captured here of course be worth good deal more then there be ship of war to share if prize turn out a well a hope will come to good bit more a be only to be divided among tigre crew blagrove be going home in prize be not yes carry sir sidney despatch blagrove get three month leave who be going to command craft that have bought for father blagrove have persuaded captain of store ship came in yesterday to let have second officer for two three month be likely to be here time if have luck mate get return passage soon after arrives in england may be back again in six week from ship of same sort got young fellow for mate ship be chartered by government will likely enough be here for month a will furnish store not only to ship on coast to may come down here from fleet blockading toulon in fact will act a general shore ship until have cleared out cargo then will be captain will be entered on ship book a captain edgar replied with laugh fancy that wilkinson will not care to be idle on voyage three day after cargo be transferred twenty invalid be placed on board two three have lost limb rest be men who have be pulled down by fever must not shake off so long a be on coast on following morning anchor be got up suzanne sailed for england nominal captain be smart young sailor who be glad indeed of opportunity for three four month of enforced idleness on egyptian coast be not at to taste extra pay that must receive be consideration fact that be to be nominally for edgar have explained situation to in command be great inducement have fortunately passed examination obtained certificate a captain before sailing on present voyage have not be for must not have accepted edgar offer voyage be rapid one stopped for two day at gibraltar to take in water have little trouble with prize agent there for of course ship paper showed that have be prize must have be sent there to be condemned sold sir sidney smith however have written saying that a ship on station be already short handed must not spare prize crew that have therefore only choice of burning prize of selling there that court of officer from various ship of war have fixed value at l purchaser having be found at price have deemed expedient to sell now forwarded bill for amount to be divided in usual course by prize official at gibraltar a if have sold stated that a have be loaded with munition of war for french army question must arise a to lawfulness of capture official shook head over irregularity a defence of acre have made great sensation in england vote of thanks have be passed by house of parliament by many of corporate body in england to sir sidney serving under agreed to set matter right thereupon on evidence given by wilkinson edgar a to circumstance of capture formally condemned ship authorized sale have be effected that point satisfactorily settled sailed at once shaped course after issuing from strait hundred mile west of usual ship track met with suspicious sail until entered chop of channel then one two craft looked like french privateer be observed suzanne be fast vessel kept distance from holding course up channel one morning soon after daybreak dropped anchor among number of other merchantman on mother bank off ryde directly anchor be down gig be lowered wilkinson edgar captain be rowed into portsmouth brig being left in charge of mate former went to dockyard reported to admiral that have brought home despatch from sir sidney smith for admiralty in what ship have brought a there be ship of war likely to be sailing passage be taken for in trader prize have be sold be being brought home very well sir will of course post with at once for london have particular event happened there sir beyond fact that few prize have be picked up there be nothing doing understood from sir sidney that there have be opportunity of sending home report for month that therefore thought best to take opportunity of forwarding despatch by private ship be also bringing home good captured from pirate in levant by tigre tender tigress have honour to command there be also twenty men on board invalided home very well mr wilkinson have nothing further to say to will doubtless wish to start without delay will send off for sick men at once captain returned on board to take brig round to london two friend reached town late that night wilkinson went straight to admiralty with despatch be at once taken to room where one of junior official be on duty despatch from sir sidney smith sir wilkinson said anything important believe not there be opportunity for sending sir sidney availed of then will not be worth while to wake up admiral at time of night must say certainly not thought duty to bring here at once other nodded where do put up mr wilkinson at golden cross very well if be wanted can be sent for in morning have best call here about eleven so that can answer question that admiral may ask in morning midshipman went across hour later name be called out be at once shown into room in two of naval lord be sitting be bearer of despatch from sir sidney smith mr wilkinson yes sir have sent report gave of cruise in brig tigress among greek turkish island there can be doubt that did work exceedingly well a be shown by long list of prize captured destroyed mention that have received also report from pasha of smyrna governor of rhodes speaking in high term of service that have rendered saying that for time piracy appears to have entirely ceased sea to be open to peaceful trader what time have to serve have six month sir well think if feel prepared must be a well for to take advantage of being at home to pas will take care that will get promotion a soon a have served full time must like couple of month leave doubt before return must rather wait before going in to be examined must prefer going in at once must rather go in at once sir must enjoy holiday much better if be over think will take very long admiral said with smile after having be in command of ten gun brig for six month must be able to satisfy requirement of examiner without difficulty will be good enough to wait in ante room delay be not long in ten minute official messenger requested to follow took to room where three naval captain be sitting one in centre looked up from paper that be examining good morning mr wilkinson see by paper that have for six month be in command of ten gun brig tigress cruising for pirate among turkish greek island yes sir suppose during time met once twice with bad weather have one tremendous squall sir came suddenly upon yes sir first intimation of be that saw two native craft suddenly lower sail let know exactly measure that took order gave wilkinson described what have passed from time that first order be given until violence of squall abated will do a far a seamanship be concerned officer said now asked few question a to navigation being answered correctly president after word with others said that will do mr wilkinson have answered creditably indeed mere fact that sir sidney smith must have considered fit to command tigress in so difficult dangerous work a cruising among island be in better guarantee of fitness for promotion than most rigid examination must be few further question be asked then wilkinson be congratulated upon having passed successfully then went to prize court saw president presented sir sidney smith note to read through then glanced at copy of bill of lading have be taken when cargo be transferred know content of bale cask mr wilkinson sir greater portion of have never be opened of course one must recognize from nature of packing put down a nearly a must guess manchester good woollen hardware so on a wanted to be off be better that thing must remain in original packing did not trouble to open be received a cargo consigned to eastern good know nothing about suppose nothing well when brig arrives in river captain will of course call here will give instruction where to land understand went on looking again at letter mr blagrove to whom sir sidney asks to intrust sale of good be expert in special line yes sir have be for many year established a merchant in alexandria sir sidney thought that must not only be able to estimate accurately value of good must know exactly where to place must by bringing gradually forward get far larger sum for than if be thrown at once upon market see vessel be property mr wilkinson be so sir son purchased in name be fellow midshipman of mine in tigre be with in craft with captured good vessel have be sold for twelve thousand five hundred have brought up with in gold will pay into hand of anybody may appoint to be added to proceeds of sale for division by court have idea of value of eastern good not in slightest sir only few of bale be opened in presence of sir sidney smith said that must be better not to open more a there be facility for repacking think that be very good idea of sir sidney to suggest that must be for advantage of concerned to vary usual course to place good in hand of expert instead of selling by auction must like to see mr blagrove suppose know address be in town be living in dulwich sir well will let know that if call upon to morrow morning will give full authority to act in matter then can settle whether to stow portion of cargo in warehouse whether to make other arrangement will myself write to sir sidney smith to thank for suggestion with respect to sale of good to say have so arranged question of freight be of course matter altogether separate will give mr blagrove cheque for amount arranged between representative sir sidney smith at rate of three pound per ton when brings receipt of officer in charge of warehouse of having received store in good order from ship edgar have on reaching london stopped at golden cross for night first thing in morning taken hackney coach driven at once to dulwich where father have taken house close to of brother be now first week in december edgar drove up to entrance to garden in house stood paid coachman then rang bell servant opened looked somewhat surprised at seeing young naval officer standing there be mr mr blagrove in asked yes sir be in right said show to room where be need not announce be son girl at once led way into house edgar walked into room where party be seated at breakfast mr blagrove be sitting with back to door did not see come in mother sister looked up in surprise a entered unannounced be two year since have seen scarcely recognized in tall young officer lad whom have last seen at alexandria on departure for england mr blagrove on seeing eye fixed on door turned round leapt to foot dear edgar exclaimed a warmly embraced where have sprung from last letter be from smyrna three month ago mother went on turning round let introduce boy to for minute there be little coherent conversation now sit down edgar mr blagrove said at last let hear what unexpected chance have brought home suppose a be in uniform that have not left service not at sir be home on three month leave having come home in suzanne brig belonging to yourself belonging to mr blagrove said in astonishment what on earth do mean bought in name father will have bill presented in course of couple of month so for eight hundred fifty pound at rate will not be loser by there will be from six to seven hundred pound can not say how much exactly for cargo be not weighed be somewhat over two hundred ton at three pound ton there be besides hundred pound for passage money of twenty invalid sailor so see get ship for practically about hundred pound to there will have to be added payment of captain mate ten italian sailor be valued by court of naval officer at eight hundred fifty pound that being price considered that might fetch if sold there must say that be worth quite double that be about three hundred ton carried six gun so at rate be likely to make thousand by transaction then have to inform that at sir sidney smith request have doubt will be complied with will be appointed by president of prize court agent for sale of what eastern good there be on board cargo be made up of european good dried fruit eastern good be what captured from pirate sir sidney smith suggested that must be a well to intrust to one who knew value of eastern good work of selling privately instead of putting up to auction requested that agency must be given to wilkinson who have come home with be going to see president of prize court morning be to come up here afterwards of course sir sidney did chiefly to oblige thought that good must really fetch more if sold in way said of course that must get commission on sale a said in last letter received that be getting very sick of having nothing to do thought might like job certainly must like edgar purchase of ship seems very satisfactory one though of course profit will be yours not mine a have nothing to do with oh yes be business father be bought with money be glad have be able to do something for firm will soon be getting prize money will keep in cash for very long time wo argue about now edgar at rate will be glad to see to sale of eastern good though of course will be small thing know father think that will be rather large thing at rate there be something between eighty hundred ton of between eighty hundred ton father replied mean with dried fruit of course not at father fruit will be sold in ordinary way in prize court then what can thing be must say great proportion of be carpet turkish persian syrian hundred ton of such carpet a edgar must be worth very large sum indeed surely must be mistaken be accumulation of year of piracy father perhaps from hundred of ship captured by scoundrel of course be not carpet there be silk muslin embroidered robe egyptian scarf manufacture other sort of thing have not opened above dozen bale out of twelve hundred have therefore idea of relative value of others be tender of tigre craft being prize taken by of officer men being borne on book whole ship divide still if thing be worth a much a think will bring in handsome sum there be besides twelve thousand five hundred in cash proceeds of sale of vessel captured also share with other ship under sir sidney smith command in value of vessel cargo have captured a tried to reach egyptian port say be worth something like forty thousand of tigre share will be about well edgar if there be hundred ton of such good a describe cargo must be valuable one indeed of course can tell nothing about until see opened at rate will give occupation must say good paying occupation for time suppose got that letter father sent from constantinople from mr muller yes very satisfactory one be reconciled to extent to staying here be not pleasant to think that one be living upon one capital found from statement that share of business be doing must fully cover expense here now let hear something more about doings letter from constantinople told about adventure in egypt then have one written day after french have retreated from before acre one received from smyrna two month since be short one beyond saying that have be very lucky in capturing destroying number of pirate that be enjoying cruise very much did not give detail may a well tell that part first early in afternoon wilkinson arrived a edgar have spoken warmly of kindness to when have first joined tigre of friendship have sprung up between be very cordially received by mr mr blagrove former be well pleased when heard detail of interview with president of prize court said that must go up see in morning will hire warehouse for month two said will be much more satisfactory than working in place where lot of other business be being transacted bale will have to be opened examined good classed assorted will have to bring people down there to examine expense will be nothing in comparison to advantage of having quiet place to one self on following morning mr blagrove went up have very satisfactory talk with president of prize court suzanne arrived four day later having made fast run from portsmouth by time mr blagrove have engaged warehouse where in short time whole of good of be to dispose be safely stored wilkinson went down on day after arrival to people in devonshire edgar established a assistant to father a bale after bale be opened latter be astonished at beauty value of of content few only of bale contained common country cloth be evident that such good of sort a have fallen into hand of pirate have be sold at once a there be ready market for at town village of island mainland many of carpet be of great size of very large one mr blagrove valued at fully l there be score worth from l to l of silk embroidery pronounced to be almost priceless must said have be specially woven worked for lady of sultan harem when after month stay edgar prepared to rejoin with friend wilkinson not more than one third of content of warehouse have be sold have fetched over l father have doubt that must obtain proportionate sum for remainder italian sailor who have aided to bring suzanne home have be sent off week after arrival by vessel bound for naples brig have a soon a cargo be cleared out fetched l by auction being almost new vessel have doubt mr blagrove said that ere long british army will be sent out french compelled to leave egypt if thought that war be likely to go on for time a at present must say that have better leave service a be must not be doing much good if stayed here so may a well hold on be first day of march when vessel with supply for troop in wilkinson edgar have taken passage joined fleet off alexandria until beginning of december took part in somewhat tedious work of blockading egyptian coast in spite of effort fleet be not always successful for from time to time one other of ship be forced to sail to cyprus to obtain fresh supply although quite fleet of small vessel be employed in bringing water fresh meat vegetable for use of fleet a health of seaman must have suffered much from living for so long period upon salt meat in november news be received that army under sir ralph abercrombie have for so long be engaged in watching cadiz be to sail upon expedition for reconquest of egypt be stated that expedition must in first place sail for syria there to join army that sultan assured english government be in readiness to advance sir sidney smith be ordered to sail at once for coast to ascertain real state of thing to decide upon spot where fleet have best assemble for from long absence from england there be many repair needed be desirable that situation must be such that ship must be careened portion at least of weed have accumulated be scraped off absence be in one respect unfortunate for of other blockading ship be after very heavy gale obliged to go to cyprus to repair damage two french men of war heavily laden with troop ammunition managed to run safely in to alexandria thereby increasing strength of french army by four thousand seasoned soldier by ample supply of ammunition be great disappointment to crew when on return to station off coast found that french have taken advantage of absence that result of eighteen month of incessant vigil have be wasted wilkinson have by time served full time condor having be appointed to theseus sir sidney smith again gave command of tigress to with rank of acting lieutenant must be sure be confirmed suppose must like to have mr blagrove with certainly sir there be one must rather have be pity that have not served time yet sir sidney said be most active young officer knowledge of so many language be of immense advantage must gladly give independent command a there be so many midshipman senior to must not do so know coast of anatolia probably better than anyone else here harbour must recommend a most suitable for entry of large fleet must be well sheltered shore must offer facility for heeling vessel over a far a possible in order to clean know at rhodes there be not enough water for first class men of war by far best place know sir be bay of marmorice be on mainland almost opposite rhodes within day easy sail went into quite by accident for entrance might be passed without notice have be chasing suspicious craft saw disappear following found ourselves in great landlocked harbour big enough to hold hundred ship of war absolutely sheltered be by far finest harbour have ever seen be sailing for rhodes in first place lord keith who command fleet have written to request to meet there if report be correct will save trouble of examining whole line of coast between rhodes acre edgar be glad to be again on board tigress account of sale of good have captured have now be received total amounted to l of l have be paid in to prize court by mr blagrove other l have be proceeds of fruit other good there be in addition sum received for vessel sold astonishment of officer of tigre be great indeed when heard result for very little have be said about value of cargo sum realized be at least three time a great a most sanguine have hoped be excellent plan getting father to undertake business sir sidney smith said to edgar when latter informed that have received communication from father saying how much good have sold have realized suppose must have fetched third of amount have be sold in ordinary way by auction by prize court be sure that must feel greatly obliged to must feel greatly obliged to sir sidney for a told commission have be fixed at three per cent so have after paying expense done fine stroke of business for have managed extremely well mr blagrove have be fortunate affair for chapter xvii abercrombie expedition on arriving at rhodes sir sidney smith left tigre in tigress sailed across to bay of marmorice preferring to explore in first place in craft drawing little water be delighted with harbour after day spent in sounding in various part of found that there be ample depth of water for larger ship that there be spot where must lie alongside run upper deck gun directly ashore careen ship over to point must enable to be freed of considerable proportion of weed barnacle returning to rhodes then started in tigre for syria took edgar with a interpreter replacing temporarily by midshipman leaving wilkinson with report from to lord keith strongly recommending marmorice a being suitable in respect for rendezvous for fleet transport on th of december first division of fleet arrived be at once ordered to proceed to marmorice tigress sailing ahead to show way second division arrived four day later tent be at once erected ashore sick be landed encamped whole regiment be also put under canvas while ship carried be careened cleaned sir sidney smith have already returned with news that there be practically nothing must be called army in syria report be so discouraging that general abercrombie lord keith resolved that must be far better to land army in egypt than to disembark at jaffa take long fatiguing march across desert merely in order to gain aid of few thousand useless turkish troop great disappointment be occasioned by remount for cavalry have be purchased at constantinople for when arrived be such wretched animal that be for most part found to be absolutely useless greater portion be either shot sold for dollar on th of february one of most terrible hail storm that ever be experienced took place lasted for forty eight hour thunder rolled without intermission hailstone be a big a large walnut lay two foot deep in camp scene of confusion there be terrible horse broke loose rushed wildly about seeking shelter from hail men dared not venture out so terrible be force with lump of ice came down ship drove at anchor many lost upper spar swiftsure be struck by lightning weather continued violent for time be not until rd of february that ship weighed anchor numbering hundred seventy five set sail made way out of harbour expedition on troop be about to embark be most adventurous one have by time learned that french have received very considerable reinforcement that force be much larger one than have be reported turkish army with be to operate be non existent only gleam of satisfaction be that bonaparte have managed to get through blockading force in small craft have arrived in france that therefore french army must not have benefit of leading be animated by presence among edgar found brought unexpectedly into notice fleet be entirely unprovided with reliable map of egypt none of officer have previous knowledge of beyond port of alexandria sir sidney smith be able to give information regarding coast have never set foot on shore be most unfortunate general abercrombie said when lord keith sir sidney smith be discussing matter here be about to land in country of know absolutely nothing if have a originally intended landed at jaffa marched through el a'rich with turk must have have benefit of knowledge that of arab of country a be be totally ignorant of feature while enemy be thoroughly acquainted with be like blind man fighting in dark against one who can see perfectly by way sir sidney exclaimed suddenly have young officer who know country well have be resident at alexandria for year riding about know foot of country within many mile of have be up to cairo be with arab who harassed french march be present at battle of pyramid at fighting in cairo know position of french fort round that city be on way to england when overhauled craft be in on way out a speaks arabic perfectly to say nothing of french italian offered berth a midshipman to act a interpreter in latter capacity be invaluable in constantinople at siege of jaffa be moreover most gallant young officer be second in command of tigress when did such good service in eradicating piracy among island capturing destroying over hundred piratical craft be good news indeed general said will send for now knowledge must be invaluable to boat be sent off at once to tigre with order for edgar to come on board flagship immediately much surprised supposing that be wanted to act a interpreter between sir sidney turkish official who have come on board at once took place in gig be rowed to flagship a soon a reached deck officer told that be wanted in admiral cabin there be again surprised at seeing not only admiral general abercrombie sir sidney smith be mr blagrove lord keith sir sidney said can speak most highly of a most gallant able young officer a master of four five language in capacity of interpreter have rendered signal service take seat sir admiral said how long have served sir sidney about two year two month sir therefore have be unable to recognize service that have rendered in double capacity beyond mentioning in report hear mr blagrove lord keith went on that be intimately acquainted with country round alexandria have visited cairo know city defence how did go to cairo rode sir in company with party of arab with whom be living after sudden unexpected departure of father when french fleet first appeared in sight may say went up down twice for went back to fetch woman of tribe sir ralph abercrombie will be glad to learn from information that can give respecting country round alexandria also what can tell of route between place cairo a be in mediterranean when received order to undertake invasion of egypt have map of country practically know nothing about however of course in first place most important part of affair be to learn position round alexandria will be very glad to answer question sir general then began to examine can draw sir have knowledge of military drawing edgar replied must point out position of village general pushed large sheet of paper towards position of village will of course be useful said a be point must be naturally defended what be of most importance be position of sand hill other eminence point at artillery must command surrounding country prepare way for force advancing to attack french to check column advancing against line enemy must be most likely to occupy by might best attack in front turn position edgar looked at paper in doubt be afraid sir be beyond altogether if will tell where landing must probably be effected must go on from spot indicate various rising fall of ground of course know castle of aboukir certainly sir be on sand hill for two day within mile of watching approach of lord nelson fleet battle of aboukir good general said will probably land near there sand hill rise sharply from water edge short distance behind there be several point on french must probably place battery to oppose landing sketched line of coast drew few line indicating trend of sand hill marked special eminence then step by step showed line where french must probably post be successful landing effected between height of ramleh sea described country a far a must lay of land how about water general asked after have questioned edgar for more than hour there be well at several point said for most part be too near french position for to be useful to until have driven into town there be however well here marked spot about mile from landing place can not tell exact position there be peasant hut there be speaking to while be watching battle told that so hated french that have filled up well so that must not fetch water from for garrison of castle have doubt must find hut man will be sure show where well have be will probably take little trouble to clear out arab however told that wherever find clump of tree will be sure to find water at great depth be very valuable information general said be bad enough to have to depend upon fleet for provision difficulty of transporting water sufficient for men with cavalry artillery horse must be enormous thank mr blagrove must have more conversation with edgar bowed retired must let have young fellow general said to sir sidney smith be evidently thoroughly acquainted with country a know nothing of military drawing one can not get full advantage of information here if have on shore with knowledge must be invaluable for must then point out to nature of country beyond point can see must be very happy to lend to sir ralph be sure will be glad to go for really midshipman pay be absurd a consideration for service that have rendered a interpreter fortunately father be merchant at alexandria money be of great importance to really entered navy only for pleasure of seeing service to pas time until departure of french must enable father to return to business of course if have served time passed must most strongly recommend for promotion to lieutenant at once a be be powerless there be exception to rule lord keith said a commander in chief in mediterranean think that might overstep line must pas have doubt that must do so sir sidney said certainly must in practical knowledge of seamanship after being second in command of ten gun brig for six month among island commander being midshipman only few month older than owing to loss of so many officer at acre be unable to spare one of higher rank complaint of piracy be so urgent frequent that felt absolutely necessary to send ship up to try put stop to have misgiving at time choice be more than justified a be shown by number of craft captured when say that plunder taken sold for over one hundred thirty thousand pound speaks well for skill activity for navigation among island be very ticklish business will call board to morrow to examine admiral said will at once if pass appoint a acting lieutenant send home report if will get one drawn up sir sidney a to exceptional service saying be partly influenced in taking so exceptional step by consideration that sir ralph abercrombie have asked that must be appointed to staff from knowledge of country of arab turkish language next morning flagship signalled to tigre flag midshipman after spelling out message reporting to sir sidney ran forward to edgar be to go on board admiral ship at once signal have be made for on reaching ship be conducted down to wardroom where to surprise three naval captain be seated at table please to sit down mr blagrove one in centre said want to ask few question supposing that be about to be asked more about egypt perhaps depth of water in port of alexandria edgar prepared to answer first question justified anticipation for be questioned minutely a to point for ship must head to round dangerous reef extending from outer point of western port then be asked a to depth of water between shore gun must be brought to bear upon depth at various point in harbour be able to answer at once then be asked various question a to harbour in turkish greek island a have constantly consulted chart during cruise in tigress be able to reply readily on point next question surprised now mr blagrove if caught by sudden heavy squall when under full sail among island having three four minute to strip ship what order must give a have in mind order that wilkinson have given on approach of squall be

be done at once with greatest possible speed a be men be not out of rigging when squall struck supposing have have ten minute notice how must have proceeded edgar gave order a laid down in text book for after narrow escape have have wilkinson have especially learnt by heart very good indeed mr blagrove two three question in navigation be then asked be also answered well a have found absolutely necessary to be able to find exact position when cruising in such dangerous water thank sir officer said when last question have be answered will have much pleasure in certifying that have passed examination in most creditable manner edgar looked little bewildered sir sidney smith perhaps did not inform mr blagrove by lord keith order be to be examined to day that have sat a board for purpose indeed sir have thought of such thing will not have served time for nearly three year suppose lord keith have special reason for having examined now be good opportunity see will please remain on deck

off to staff where knowledge of country will be of great service to under very exceptional circumstance have taken exceptional step of having examined at once a have passed with flying colour now hand appointment a acting lieutenant appointment be of course temporary one when explain to admiralty reason for making inclose report of service that sir sidney smith have handed to have doubt that step will be confirmed may say that one reason for doing at present moment be that a will be on sir ralph abercrombie staff think that a navy be to be represented must be represented by officer with at least rank of lieutenant so a to give proper status congratulate lieutenant blagrove on promotion that have in opinion in of immediate superior most worthily won thereupon shook edgar warmly by hand

speechless with joy emotion with tear standing in eye edgar be much moved be well with sidi asked chief mother be well with sidi answered talk of always have not hoped to see so soon little did dream must not know when met though when heard that people have landed have beaten french thought that time might not be very far off when frank must go might return so be officer one of ship officer yes sidi met ship of war a sailed from here since must speak arabic turkish be made officer be at siege of acre where beat off french will talk of afterwards general saw coming thinking that might have news for requested to bring to have news sidi said tell now be best that must tell first walking side by side sidi leading horse went round to entrance to battery a entered edgar told one of general

soon a obtained news returned to village changed dress mounted rode off at full speed party have be seen chasing be cavalry squadron whom have come upon suddenly while be dismounted sitting down in shade of grove who judging that be making for british camp have started in pursuit knowing well enough that must not catch have amused by keeping short distance in advance have not put horse to full speed until saw mounted party coming out from french line to cut off general listened attentively to edgar a translated story please to question again lieutenant blagrove a to report menou intends to attack a soon a get here be a see of greatest importance late a be afternoon formidable a be french line must endeavour to carry a soon a troop can form up for must be hopeless to try to do so to morrow when menou arrives if on other hand really mean to take offensive must prefer remaining in present position for think that must maintain against whole of french army that more easily than must carry line of defence held by only troop at present in front of edgar questioned sidi again latter said that have heard same story from three different person french have arrived late evening before when left bugle be sounding be beginning to fall in for march must probably reach alexandria by ten at night men have said that be talk among soldier that must take english by surprise at daybreak drive into sea that certainly seems to decide general said have made mistake indeed if think that will catch napping order be at once issued for number of troop to set to work to complete defence battery be during night erected in front of roman ruin redoubt in front of position of guard be strengthened other point seen to at three o'clock in morning army be a usual under arm hour later there be sudden outburst of firing on extreme left firing continued did not increase in strength a must have be case have serious attack be made general moore who be general officer of night remained on right against portion of line believed real attack must be delivered be still dark waited anxiously for sign of spot against storm be to burst suddenly loud shout be heard in advance of right roar of musketry immediately broke out covered by inequality of ground french have crept up unobserved by sentry until close at hand moment alarm be given sprang forward in great force advanced picket fell back on main position at once heavy column of french advanced against ruined wall behind th be lying wall be of considerable length in many place have fallen left wide opening here th be posted colonel made men hold fire until enemy be close to when volley after volley be poured into so well aimed deadly that enemy retired quickly into hollow in rear then wheeled round to right while one column marched straight at newly formed battery endeavoured to force way round left take in rear th regiment stationed there opened heavy fire on force attacking in front flanking column now joined by third forced way in behind battery while attacked in rear rest penetrated into ruin held by th colonel wheeled back left wing of regiment after two three volley fell on french with bayonet at moment

th have hitherto be supporting simultaneously attack in front flank rear arrival of nd for time relieved a latter regiment approached right of redoubt enemy cavalry have passed round by left charged furiously broke highlander however gathered in group fought desperately until relieved by fire of flank company of th cavalry passing on be about to charge small force when foreign brigade came up from second line poured heavy fire into french cavalry that fled illustration giving yell of derision defiance page a soon a fire broke out general abercrombie with staff mounted proceeded towards point where battle be raging on way detached aide de camp with order to different brigade while thus alone with escort of dragoon of french cavalry dashed at be thrown from horse french officer rode up to cut down sprang at seized sword wrested from hand at instant officer be bayoneted by one of nd illustration battle of alexandria arst march while incident be proceeding sir ralph received musket ball in thigh also severe contusion on breast probably by splinter of stone struck by cannon ball in heat of action be unconscious of first wound felt much pain from contusion at moment sir sidney smith rode up have accidentally broken sword general discerning at once presented with one that have wrested from french officer then took up station in battery from must obtain view of whole scene of battle for by time be daylight contest still raged body of cavalry charged foreign brigade be received with so heavy fire that did not press charge home french infantry be now no longer in column spread out everywhere in skirmishing order ammunition of english on right be by time totally exhausted one cartridge remained for of gun in battery chief point of attack be now centre here column of grenadier supported by heavy line of infantry advanced to assault guard stoutly maintained until general coote with brigade came up french be then driven back time french gun kept up incessant cannonade on british position attack on british left have be feint be never seriously pursued be confined to scattered fire of musketry distant cannonade general hutchinson who commanded here kept force in hand for have moved to assistance of centre right serious attack might have be made on flank being thus turned position must have be taken in rear on right french a well a british have exhausted ammunition singular spectacle be presented of two hostile force pelting other with stone by many heavy blow be given on side killed among sergeant of th grenadier company of th presently moved out against assailant french then fell back general menou finding that attack have failed now called off troop fortunately for artillery ammunition be now exhausted lost good many men by fire of british cutter have during whole action maintained position short distance in advance of british right greatly aided defender of redoubt by fire by ten o'clock action be over until firing ceased altogether sir ralph abercrombie remained in battery paying attention to wound indeed officer who came went with order be ignorant that have be hit now however faint with loss of blood must maintain position no longer be placed in hammock carried down to shore rowed off to flagship a soon a french have withdrawn attention be paid to wounded total loss be officer men killed officer men wounded french loss be heavier french killed wounded be found on battlefield of be buried on field taking general proportion of wounded killed french loss including prisoner amounted to men one french standard two gun be captured total british force be under men of whom half be seriously engaged french be about strong of whom save who made feint on british left took part in fighting on th capitan pasha with men arrived in bay landed encamped three day later army be saddened by news of death of sir ralph abercrombie be succeeded in command by general hutchinson for time edgar have idle time of french have failed in attack have not be defeated position be too strong to be attacked capitan pasha have with excellent interpreter therefore service be not required in capacity night before battle stopped up night talking with sidi relating have happened since have left hearing from what have taken place on land be little enough great number of arab have gathered in readiness to sweep down upon french when attacked turkish army at aboukir when latter have with terrible slaughter be driven into castle have scattered to home next day young arab witnessed with delight repulse of french attack at conclusion of fight rode away to tell father of edgar return of event that have witnessed sheik have come back with on following day accompanied by of follower tent be pitched on sand hill short distance in rear of british line until april th nothing be done army be too small to undertake operation be forced to remain in position a might at moment be again attacked in pocket of general roiz who have be killed in battle be found letter from general menou expressing fear that english must cut canal of alexandria let water of lake aboukir into old bed of lake mareotis be evident that immense advantage must be gained by own left must be secure against attack french must be nearly cut off from interior british army be enabled to undertake fresh operation general hutchinson however hesitated for long time before taking step tract of rich country must be overwhelmed none of arab must say how far inundation must reach however step be evidently so much to advantage of army at last gave order on th of work began that evening water rushed out from lake aboukir through two cut others be opened next day rush of water quickly widened soon inundation spread over large tract of country behind alexandria considerable force be at once detached to support colonel spencer who be menacing rosetta marched to el hamed sir sidney smith ascended nile with armed flotilla a far a el aft on th aided turk in capturing fort st julian strong place between rosetta mouth of nile after fall of st julian rosetta be taken possession of with little difficulty soon after to deep regret of navy sir sidney smith be recalled to ship grand vizier have serious grudge against arose from capitulation have shortly after retreat of french from acre be agreed upon between turkish authority french by latter be to be permitted to evacuate egypt sir sidney smith have not be consulted considering justly that advantage be great have signed lord keith a commander in chief have refused to ratify treaty english government who be in high spirit at blow struck at french at acre agreed with action sir sidney smith a soon a received lord keith despatch sent mounted messenger to cairo to inform general kleber that term of convention be rejected despatch reached french just a be preparing to evacuate cairo unfortunately grand vizier who with army be short distance away from town did not receive similar intimation approaching city with troop without gun be attacked by french suffered disastrous defeat turk have not forgiven sir sidney smith for misfortune latter have not supposed for moment that turk must have neglected to apprise grand vizier of news only thought of warning french grand vizier now demanded that sir sidney smith must not take part in operation in turkish army be concerned retain command of naval flotilla that have created with have performed such excellent service in opening nile for ascent of gun boat native craft laden with store for supply of troop be to advance against cairo general hutchinson very weakly unworthily to indignation regret of army fleet at once gave way admiral keith instead of supporting subordinate who have gained such renown credit have shown such brilliant talent acquiesced appointed captain stevenson of europa to succeed sir sidney in command of flotilla be to ascend nile to cairo surrender of one of most distinguished officer to prejudice of turkish commander be in respect disgraceful one from sir sidney smith first appointment admiral keith have exhibited great jealousy of obtaining command rendered to extent independent have lost opportunity of showing feeling indeed there can be little doubt that discourteous manner in repudiated without authority from english government convention must have saved effusion of blood cost of british expedition be result of jealousy of fame acquired by sir sidney smith latter greatly hurt at unjust humiliating manner in have be treated at once returned to tigre where delight of crew at being again under command be at least alleviation to pain felt edgar who have obtained leave of absence for week who have ridden with sheik for stay of few day at camp have not heard of slight inflicted upon kind friend until return at once went on board tigre sent in name to commander have come sir sidney said when be shown into latter cabin to say that desire to be recalled from service on shore after manner in have be deprived of command feel must not remain for day upon staff of general hutchinson sir sidney smiled be too impetuous blagrove have received too many assurance from officer of fleet to doubt what feeling be at course have be taken that can make difference in duty be to do best in various position occupy without allowing question whether consider that individual have be unjustly treated to influence in way service come before everything be distinctly for benefit of service that general hutchinson must have advantage of knowledge of country of language moreover really received promotion in small degree owing to fact that be going to act a sort of interpreter guide to general commanding expedition although unhappily sir ralph abercrombie death have caused change in command that in way alters arrangement in next place think that must be foolish to resign because there can be doubt that there will very shortly be advance against cairo inundation strong defence that troop have be throwing up will enable comparatively small number to hold garrison here in check capitan pasha men have fought bravely at rosetta grand vizier army be making way down to join from what say be mere rabble with five thousand six thousand of troop capitan pasha force ought to be able to make good fight even without vizier people at rate must like afterwards to have gone to cairo with troop there be doubt that knowledge of country will be very valuable must be pity not to see thing through when have be in from very beginning lastly mr blagrove must be sorry indeed that naval officer must evince feeling with regard to matter purely personal to myself must therefore take a particular favour to that must continue to hold appointment to have be posted thank sir sidney edgar said of course will in case retain appointment now that think of indeed feel that be impertinence to manifest in way feeling at general hutchinson conduct excuse must be that only returned from trip with sheik hour since on hearing news be so stirred that ran down to landing place came off on impulse of moment have shown such extreme kindness sir at time seemed to matter almost personal to myself apologize sir sidney smith said kindly feeling did credit a man though a officer personal feeling can not be permitted to sway action now go ashore again report a returned from leave advance up nile did not take place for little time a great preparation be necessary fortunately large number of native craft have be captured from french store be landed placed on board for use of troop colonel stewart be in command of british advanced force accompanied capitan pasha division large force of gun boat rowing boat be furnished by fleet following river bank expedition proceeded up river french resistance be very feeble detached party be taken driven off there be fighting of serious character for time edgar remained with general hutchinson before alexandria then accompanied to rosetta joining main british division came up with turkish army have now be joined by of vizier whole advanced towards cairo met with real resistance on march there can be little doubt that french general be hampered by intense longing among troop to return to france disaster in syria have to extent be retrieved by defeat of turk at aboukir appearance of great fleet of men of war transport on coast followed by failure of menou to drive a be confidently expected assailant back to ship produced profound effect report that alexandria have be almost cut off from rest of egypt by inundation of lake mareotis to regain city army must have to force way along narrow neck of land between lake mareotis aboukir seemed to diminish still further hope of ever getting away news therefore that great force of british turk supported by gun boat accompanied by immense flotilla carrying store be ascending nile reduced almost to despair so unwilling be to fight when on approach of vizier army to cairo be met by four thousand french suffered to be repulsed by rabble fell back to cairo be well aware that if surrendered must be guaranteed passage back to france better term than must not hope to obtain after most vigorous resistance involving great useless loss of life therefore a soon a whole allied force approached cairo negotiation be begun on th of june be concluded one of gate of town occupied by capitan pasha body guard fort by th regiment on th french evacuated city next day turkish troop took possession of in meantime fighting have be going on almost incessantly in front of alexandria general coote who be in command of besieging force gradually gained ground french line be forced backward on september nd finding contest altogether hopeless most of british troop from cairo having returned reinforced by british native indian army garrison capitulated number of troop including sick who surrendered in alexandria be while force surrendered at cairo like other be embarked in british ship taken to france be included among be sailor who have for most part be landed after battle of aboukir while have be drawn from french war ship have succeeded in running blockade indian force arrived in time to witness surrender of alexandria fact that work be practically accomplished by men who landed under general abercrombie aided after work be half done by turkish force of great value render operation one of most brilliant in military history redounds equal credit upon gallant soldier who died in hour of victory on successor whose operation be most skilfully conducted on british officer soldier who endured ordinary amount of privation labour under burning sun upon advance to cairo edgar have be accompanied by sheik son with score of follower information that be enabled to give general be of greatest importance value sheik be intimately acquainted with foot of ground on force halting in afternoon be able to inform quartermaster general of most likely spot for next camping ground of distance nature of country to be traversed at daybreak must start ahead with party ascertain from inhabitant of village whether body of enemy be in neighbourhood arrange with to forward such supply of food vegetable a remained at disposal for sale to spot selected for camping ground afternoon supply be small for french have well nigh made whole country below cairo desert nevertheless such a must be produced be gladly purchased by commissariat for use of troop owing to custom prevalent throughout east of storing grain in covered pit supply obtained a forage for horse largely exceeded expectation for peasant regarded british a deliverer from oppressor upon being assured by sheik that paid well for everything that required pit have escaped french searcher be thrown open at once general hutchinson on return to carry out siege of alexandria to conclusion reported to admiral keith very warm appreciation of service lieutenant blagrove have rendered long before time admiral have received from england confirmation of acting rank have given edgar a soon a capitulation be signed although have be stipulated that british troop be not to go into town until french took departure many officer did so a general menou freely gave permission to enter to anyone who applied for be one of first of riding in alighted at father house chapter xix quiet rest mr muller came forward to meet visitor a entered thinking probable that naval officer have come in reference to arrangement to be made with regard to transport must carry french army away be three year since have last seen edgar latter have grown from boy into young man uniform have altered beyond recognition for news have be received from england since have left mr muller have supposed that be time there with father edgar smiled a saw absence of recognition in face know mr muller asked have doubt changed good deal since saw last in dress of arab mr edgar blagrove latter exclaimed in astonishment disguise be endless sir think that be best of though why must have adopted know happens that be not disguise at time be what seem to be naval lieutenant have be serving in navy ever since joined ten day after sailed from here be through siege of acre with sir sidney smith a see have have good fortune to be promoted have be serving ashore since first landed here have be up to cairo with force marched there a sort of guide interpreter be sure congratulate heartily intend to stop in navy do think not of course like life have be so fortunate in getting early promotion in being mentioned in despatch ought to rise very rapidly if stayed in be sure that sir sidney smith must interest for think that must be fair to father have reckoned on taking management of business at home must be established here with probably must be best thing for in long run war with france can not last many year when peace come there will of course be great reduction of navy immense number of officer put upon half pay without much chance of again obtaining employment time during last three year will not have be misspent a lieutenant in service who have obtained exceptionally rapid promotion must be able to secure order for store repair to men of war who might put in knowledge have gained of ship fitting rigging so on must render far more useful to in superintending harbour work than must have be have not have that experience certainly mr blagrove have a know always be in charge of office here a far a book account go think know work thoroughly in last three year have felt that want of knowledge of practical side of business have be serious drawback have be able to have repair necessary to french transport so on carried out for two shipwright be good workman after be done must of course calculate what have be cost charge with percentage for profit a rule captain want estimate before begin be unable to give one on few occasion did so after consulting shipwright burnt finger badly in case for turned out that defect be much more serious than met eye so after refused to give estimate at lost business in consequence for french firm here snapped up work must get be always ready to give estimate though believe in nine case out of ten either did not carry out work thoroughly else when half way through be obliged to ask for considerable increase on ground that amount to be done far exceeded what supposed have be so notorious that for past year have have hand full believe that intended to leave even if french occupation have continued indeed came to three month ago asked if must be inclined to buy yard appliance stock refused at time be of opinion that matter be well worth thinking over since trade increased again have be very cramped for room of course formed small portion of father business think that in future must be made at least a important part a inland trade certainly with at head must be largely extended must quite suit a know have always be fond of ship now after being three year at sea be naturally more fond of than before although must make very happy in looking after work of ship yard superintending business afloat must feel altogether like fish out of water if be to be kept to book keeping inside know that there be ship sailing for england to night with despatch will sit down at once write to father say that be ready to leave navy at once fall to work here be certain to come out a soon a hears news that place have surrendered that french be going will tell what say about other ship yard ask to go to admiralty have doubt that president of prize court who have business with father have since be on very friendly term with will give good introduction may possibly go with to urge that a be going to undertake superintendence of ship yard here that hope to be of service to ship of war putting in for repair will consent to going on half pay instead of retiring altogether must certainly strengthen position here so far a ship of war be concerned daresay that will be sending off too yes have kept everything written up copy made so that must send off must opportunity offer couple of hour work will
