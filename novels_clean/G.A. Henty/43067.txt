what have always considered ill advised step of expelling spanish resident about six year ago not that in province took very active part in civil war for ten year raged in central mexico although spanish authority be bad master must be granted that while be here there be more trade commerce than there have since be that advantage expected to secure from revolution have by mean be obtained be

round to loreto thence up to mouth of colorado how far be place from here about two hundred mile must have thought must have be better to have here there be range of hill about way between place coast across must be difficult to get thing be that there be scarce food by way rain seldom fall here although land be very rich when irrigated affords scanty growth in wild state herd of twenty thousand bullock must scarcely exist on road even if got here must have lost so much fat that must scarce pay for boiling down sat smoking in veranda until nearly midnight don guzman then conducted young sailor to chamber have be prepared for chapter ii hearty welcome early a mexican household be awake in order to enjoy comparatively cool hour of morning william harland be first up dressing hastily started out to fetch kit bag at bottom of have stowed away before went on board clothes that have worn when left home also content of small trunk that have taken with buying outfit for use on board

don juan drop don please be always called simply juan by english friend at valparaiso be much more pleasant than ceremonious way of addressing other so call juan please will call will now juan harland said a sipped chocolate who do believe set ruffian on to must see plainly enough that senorita have suspicion though did not choose to mention to father be sharp observer juan laughed well yes will tell frankly upon whom suspicion fell must tell first that don guzman be connection of mine father having married first cousin of when father went out to new ranch of twelve year ago left behind under cousin charge lived here for five year going to mission to be educated by father since then have generally spent month two here not unnaturally a who have seen will doubtless admit have grown to be very fond of christina of course till lately have simply looked upon a big cousin when be last here before going down to valparaiso be little changed have grown to be shy with have never be before hoped that have begun to return affection naturally enough when returned other day spoke out to learned to delight that be so of course must say nothing until parent have be consulted indispensable step a of course know for in mexico although young people may have voice in matter parent consent have to be obtained preliminary be in fact settled by in case happily there be fear of difficulty arising on score don guzman father be firm friend alliance must be suitable one in respect a although father may be more wealthy than don guzman christina be only child while have sister who be about age still see juan how explains anyone having enmity with be just coming to that must know that military commandant of san diego colonel pedros melos have son enriques who be captain in regiment stationed here christina told before went down to chile captain melos be frequent visitor that be very attentive to father frequently brought bouquet of choice flower added that although be very civil to a far a custom of country permit caballero to be civil to young lady not related to did not like well happened other day just a christina be coming to understanding exactly where be sitting now captain melos stepped out from window of drawing room must imagine that have great difficulty in understanding situation young couple who have just declared love for other be apt to look little awkward when suddenly interrupted sound of foot a stepped out on veranda caused to look round sharply a eye fell on turned a pale a if have received blow if ever man face wore for moment expression of intense rage did then however checked murmured word two about believing that senor guzman be in veranda then turned on heel went back into room christina caught arm 'beware juan that man will be deadly enemy felt that spoke truly said that attention of late have be very marked have be in constant fear that father must call on hers to ask for hand for son agreed must without loss of time speak to father on subject of suit did so on same day be good enough to say that when request from father reached to effect must most willingly accede to colonel melos did in fact call day before yesterday formally proposed alliance to don guzman replied that daughter affection be already engaged with perfect consent approval colonel of course have nothing to do to bow out with a good grace a must muster fancy from what have heard that be good officer honest man have played part in civil war that have have here unlike most others always stuck to same side fortunately for turned out in end to be successful one son bear altogether different character here indeed there have be nothing much against fact of father being commandant have doubt acted a check upon possibly hope that may have entertained of winning christina hand may have helped to render discreet have heard that in other place where regiment have be in garrison bore worst of character thus see a bitterly disappointed man a unscrupulous one might well have be author of attack upon a noticed idea occurred to christina a well a remembering a did expression of face when saw together that affair be work however have shadow of proof must not think of whispering suspicion to anyone still will take precaution for three four day remain here will not be out in unfrequented street after now about tell frankly what be thinking of doing do intend to continue at sea be thinking of returning to home where doubt must be gladly received by father have not thought fully over yet certainly will not go back to father with tale found life unbearable deserted ship when go must be with better record than that may have objected most strongly to taking to sea think must be even greater annoyance to to find having in defiance of wish done so have so soon backed out of be man who carry through anything that undertakes matter if incurs loss in so doing say that if saw other opening made success of must mind when do go back must not be a returned prodigal a man who have done something who have in one line achieved certain amount of success a far a have thought over idea have be to take passage down to valparaiso seems to most go ahead place on coast there look round have money enough to last for little time for father on return from last voyage gave cheque for five hundred dollar beyond twenty thirty dollar expended on sea kit still have in belt what do think of doing in valparaiso must take anything turned up except clerkship then if in two three month must see nothing seemed likely to lead to good thing must ship again well will not embark on such wild goose chase for time for intend to take off with to father hacienda for long visit will receive heartiest of welcome when tell what have done for can promise think pleasant time there will see what will be quite new side of life to learn something of ranching business let tell be a good a though admit that considerable amount of capital be required for making fair start must like extremely harland said there be buts in will other broke in suppose that after what have happened be going way be going mine in course of few day a if be two passenger who have made short voyage together father must never forgive if did not bring up with expect to morrow next day will have three four of men down with horse blanket other necessity for travel sent messenger off on day arrived there be generally wagon two come down month for grocery wine other matter a find that be fully that time since last trip expect that cart men will arrive to morrow travelling comfortably will take best part of week to get there of course with relay of horse must be done in le than time wagon take ten day be good travelling especially a there be three day heavy work over first range of hill here mule will have few day rest then start again find mule better than horse for wagon beyond comparison better value of mule be six time that of horse except for exceptionally good fast animal feed mule well there be better beast in world of course mule be big animal being bred from finest donkey can be imported from spain can drag a much a ox go half a fast again acting under friend advice will purchased necessary for journey principal item being mexican poncho in appearance be like large blanket made of long soft wool be practically water proof hole edged with braid be cut in middle be slipped on over head long riding cloak reaching to stirrup be obtained while at night served purpose of ordinary blanket juan presented with rifle brace of handsomely mounted double barrelled pistol sword always ride armed across hill be on good term with indian near might fall in with wandering band possibly party of white cut throat fugitive from justice besides added significantly there may possibly be danger on side of first range of hill think will began yes think possible that organizer of first attempt on life may try again be not probable that like better for failure then made high riding boot couple of pair of fringed mexican trouser few other necessary completed equipment most of be to be sent up in wagon with kit bag will be in high spirit nothing must be more pleasant than trip promised to be looked eagerly forward to start wagon have arrived with four mounted men who have overtaken on day before reached san diego brought down with two riding horse intended for juan use father always sends two down juan said so that can have change day be beyond reach of such accident a horse straining casting shoe besides on more than one occasion have brought back friend with a be going to do now suppose breed good many up there breed enough for want of vaquero few high class animal for own riding care about having more than be necessary for good horse be temptation that indian can scarcely withstand cattle care so much for for up in mountain feed must be scarce for besides have difficulty in getting meat game be plentiful enough deer bear while at time go down into great plain on other side of rockies kill a many buffalo a please jerk meat bring up to village in point of fact never refuse dozen dozen cattle to party of indian who come down ask for keep on good term with practically cost nothing for often take hide preferring greatly deer skin for hunting shirt legging for bullock hide be too heavy while for lariat heel rope so on use buffalo hide be stronger tougher so practically see be only value of fat that lose three day later juan will said good bye to senor guzman daughter set out four mounted men riding behind with two led animal carrying provision water skin how far be before get beyond settled country country be cultivated a far a chocolate hill a there be several small river whose water be used for irrigating field beyond hill there be scattered village hacienda position being determined by existence of stream coming down from great mountain range for although rain seldom fall near coast there be heavy shower there occasionally except in rainy season bed of stream be dry well sunk in at time yield plentiful supply of water be drawn up by labour of bullock ground irrigated grow orange banana grape melon kind of fruit in fact in abundance of irrigated estate be of considerable size for last fifty mile will come across settlement until reach own hacienda for country be too much open to indian foray though suffer a much a do on other side of colorado still risk be great too great for men who embark capital to say nothing of risking life be fortunate in fact that tribe immediately in neighbourhood be small one far le warlike than many of neighbour good receive from cattle make comparatively rich have never shown sign of enmity against have promised that if be attacked by of savage neighbour will if come down to assist a hacienda be strongly built have supply of arm sufficient for men must resist attack think understanding have quite a much to do with friendly feeling towards a benefit receive from must be large valley to be capable of sustaining so vast herd a of father yes valley be not very wide at lower end near river hill open out form basin ten mile wide twenty mile long beyond that extends considerable distance narrow fast stream run down centre during rainy season at time of melting of snow there be innumerable rivulet coming down from hill in consequence grass be sweet long herd amount to about forty thousand head let exceed that number use upper part of valley by agreement with indian be to remain untouched a hunting ground for night slept at hacienda of acquaintance of senor sarasta where be most hospitably entertained next day halted for few hour at san felice rode on a soon a sun have lost full power be now beyond region of general cultivation plain be however fairly green a short time before unusual circumstance of heavy rain have occurred with result that in course of few day whole face of country be changed a soon a horse be unsaddled men scattered to collect dead brushwood in short time fire be blazing slice from hindquarter of venison have be presented to by host of night before be skewered on ramrod placed over have made sixty five mile in two day journey have not be following beaten track men have made journey so often that path be needed in morning must begin ascent of lower slope of mountain whose crest rose thirty mile ahead of although seen in clear air did not seem to will harland to be more than fifth of distance rather to surprise of men juan ordered that watch must be kept precaution have never taken before have idea said to will that will be attacked to night while mounting hill to morrow be just a well to take precaution to set guard to night really think that if party be out after will trouble to night must not know exactly road must take will be sure that will cross hill come down on north side of great dry lake probably stop at martinez from there country be better cultivated a go along chatenezonais valley in there be several village to morrow journey be therefore most lonely dangerous must have motive whatever in going farther so think that for to night can sleep tranquilly to morrow will have to be on guard chapter iii ambush night passed quietly soil be soft sandy rolled in poncho will slept a comfortably a if in hammock be in saddle early for day ride must be very long one juan intended to give horse day rest at martinez consider sixty mile to be long journey here juan said a started indeed if one start on fresh horse be mere nothing when one ride same day after day forty be a much a one have right to expect from after one be once fairly on way will meet with water to day be specially for part of journey that brought water skin with noticed that did not fill full at last stream crossed be not necessary horse will have good drink at stream will cross in couple of hour will fill skin there beyond enter mountain travel through extremely difficult pas rather must say pass till come down into valley cart come way strike colorado river many mile down follow bank be at least third longer if be three time a long must have to go way pass be difficult enough for horse must be impossible for wheeled carriage after riding for thirty mile halted for hour horse be watered men ate of meat have cooked overnight cold pancake have be fried in deer fat be now far up on hillside following regular track hour sharp climbing will be on top summit of pas see to priming of rifle pistol if be not attacked before reach top will admit have be wrong that attack upon be after work of street ruffian four vaquero be ordered to look to pistol before remounting did not carry gun do expect attack master one asked have not heard of there being band on road just lately of course there may be bit of road be favourite lurking place a traffic between san filepi chatenezonais valley come way know that expect to be attacked lopez have ground for suspecting that be possible if must be ambushed dismount at once take up position behind rock fight in own way if road be good enough must say gallop on be too steep too rough for will harland soon found that friend have not exaggerated difficulty of pas on side hill sloped very steeply be covered by boulder track in middle of ravine be just wide enough for cart at distance of two hundred three hundred yard apart rock have be cut away for twenty yard so two three cart must draw aside there to allow others coming other way to pas a be inconvenient for two to ride abreast juan said have better go in single file yes will ride first will replied if there must be fellow hiding among rock will be be after riding first must present easy mark for whereas if be first wo be able to aim at till be pretty nearly abreast of like juan began will pushed horse forward have unslung rifle from shoulder be carrying in readiness for instant use keep eye on rock juan said to men behind if one of see least movement give shout throw yourselves at once off horse must however have be easy matter to distinguish man head among mass of rock boulder through in many place brushwood small tree have sprung up although kept scanning hillside minutely nothing suspicious be heard until suddenly shot be fired from spot forty foot up rock on left hand side will instantly swung to ground gave sharp slap on horse quarter ensconced behind rock while animal relieved from weight of rider made way rapidly along path first shot have be followed by dozen others came from side of ravine ball striking rock close to will be head showed that position be more safe there than must have be on horseback therefore made rush upward took up position between two rock covered from side then took advantage of bush crawled yard farther along until came to spot where must lie in shelter yet obtain view through bush above below be right juan shouted answer came from rock on other side yes ball aimed at have killed horse be unhurt lopez be killed for time shot be fired at interval juan shouted to vaquero not to use pistol must have chance of hitting said must only pick off one by one lie quiet for present keep shot till come to close quarter now will said in english watch rock above will watch above mark if can where shot be fired lie with rifle pointed at until fellow stand up to fire again then let have four shot be fired almost together from will side assailant aiming in direction from voice have come will have doubt that juan have foreseen be in shelter when spoke presently saw puff of smoke shoot out from side of large rock brought rifle to bear upon watched intently three minute later head appeared cautiously round rock then shoulder appeared rifle be pointed towards spot behind have first sheltered fired there be sharp scream rifle went clattering down exploding a fell moment that have fired will drew back into shelter of stone two other shot rang out ball cut up scattered small pebble on have be lying be able to observe however position of one of assailant while be reloading heard crack of juan rifle followed by exclamation of satisfaction be two of will will soon get tired of game distance be so short in fact that be almost impossible for even indifferent shot to miss aim when once caught sight of head of enemy presently shot struck rock close to will be fired pace from stone that be watching showed that assailant be using same tactic that have done be shifting position after firing moved few yard away did not answer to next two three shot be fired be done for heard one of men on other side of ravine say be fifty foot away from be therefore easy to catch word a shouted from one to other well then go down attack man want voice said one englishman have rifle over there so be quite safe have better come show way did not bargain for sort of thing said must settle in one volley so must have done fool if must have shot straight who must have supposed that be going to miss at distance why child of ten year old must have fired straighter however be ready to lead way over there make rush when do will marked exact position of speaker be behind large boulder fifteen yard up hill a much ahead of saw that to join men who have be firing must have to pas open space between other large mass of rock laid sight on spot speaker who be evidently confident that be killed that therefore there be danger of shot being fired at while moved to join others appeared minute later be stooping held pistol in hand moment body appeared in line of fire will pressed trigger man rolled over like log cry of dismay burst from hillside above harland where men have evidently be watching also for leader to join comrade give signal for rush have shot melos juan will shouted at least if be a suppose leader well done indeed will have difficulty with rest of if paymaster be dead will think of nothing now saving own wretched life party on opposite side of ravine now shouted to other two three of urged companion to make general rush majority be altogether against why must throw away life one said have got pistol even if got better of four five of must be likely to go down before have finished with indeed must shoot down directly showed half of must never reach bottom there be silence showed that there be general feeling that be right then same speaker went on caballeros have be cruelly misled be poor men have be led into two of have be killed ask mercy a ceased there be general cry of mercy mercy dog juan shouted back if be not that of life be not worth a much a drop of honest blood of with must not move from here until have put end to last of however have have lesson now come down one at time into road when get there drop pistol knife to ground then go down hill when one man have started let next man come down how many be there of there be six of alive man answered be eight besides leader brother be killed by in san diego other night if have not be for must not have come look here juan said will see one of face plainly a come down when have thrown down arm will stand face rock so may have good look at warn to leave san diego a soon a get back for when return will have town searched for of found there will pay for with life now come down first one by one six men came down placed weapon upon ground turned to rock where juan be lying then went down pas without word being uttered when last have gone juan stepped down into road be at once joined by will who have kept rifle pointed on man a reached road in case must intend treachery against juan two of vaquero also stepped out where be pedro juan asked be dead sir be shot through body have just strength to throw in among rock heard groaning just at first be soon silent must see from where lay have not moved since see if be dead sancho be bad business man returned in minute be quite dead senor where be man shot will let see if suspicion be correct will led way to spot followed by others juan glanced at dead man be a thought said then turned to vaquero may a well search be likely have money upon have bag heavy one sir one of said a lifted canvas bag from dead man sash let see what valued life at juan replied two vaquero counted over gold piece there be eighty of ten apiece juan remarked put aside sixty for widow of pedro lopez take ten yourselves will do anything with body senor fetch big stone pile over there will be search for for may be sure have not mentioned to anyone in town what be going to do where be going probably asked for week leave of absence must likely enough say that be going up to los angeles santa barbara when doe not return will be supposed that have be murdered on way when have done with have better do same thing with body of two comrade ground be too rocky to dig graf will sleep a well there a elsewhere must be impossible for to carry home hour labour work be finished will assisted men in work juan did not offer to do so have bullet in shoulder said fellow fired instant shot comrade luckily hit shoulder instead of head will get to fetch pedro sash make sling for arm can hing for until go down to monterey have horse gone far do think juan will probably find few hundred yard up pas be trained not to go on without rider when first alarm at firing have ceased will halt when cairn be finished vaquero cut down two sapling made couple of rude cross fixed above fallen comrade then proceeded up pas soon came upon horse mounting continued way down into monterey where arrived just a sun be setting here juan wound be attended to injury be to left arm have be thrown forward in act of firing ball struck just above elbow have cut groove from point nearly up to shoulder be evidently unlucky arm at present will said with smile after having have three gash below elbow week ago now get ploughed with rifle bullet must call lucky limb juan considering that be nothing flesh wound have not arm received knife bullet might have given vastly more serious wound elsewhere yes be true enough there be one comfort in being wounded in country ca go into smallest village without finding dozen people capable of dressing injury more especially knife wound in fact knife fight be so common that very little be thought of unless really dangerous injury be inflicted will not prevent riding for day two juan not bit of have intended to stop here to morrow to give rest to horse next day will push on happily will not have to be on guard against danger for risk of falling in with marauding red skin be too slight to be thought of next day ride will be easy one across cultivated country then have long day half of mountain work pass have to traverse before arriving at senor sagasta ranch astonished harland who have previous experience of such scenery sometimes be travelling up ravine so deep rugged that be almost twilight below while at others wound along on natural ledge on face of precipice where stumble of horse must mean certain death to rider higher higher wound until crossing narrow shoulder of bare rock looked down into broad valley owned by juan father do see that white speck in front of dark patch of tree be hacienda a crow fly suppose be more than seven eight mile away by way have to go be five time distance if be there by time to morrow will have reason to be satisfied when started next morning juan sent one of vaquero on with news that must arrive two hour after messenger be just a well to give notice said to will told to mention have arm in sling have serious injury have be hurting good bit for past two day a have not got much sleep expect that be not looking what call very fit therefore be a well that must not think in very bad way when ride up besides dare say be getting anxious about see will have calculated upon having ridden good deal faster than have done for with two horse one can push on rapidly knowing when horse must have arrived at san diego have be sure be on look out for for past three four day of course wound be nothing in in such rough riding a have have one get sudden jerk improve condition have bathed for night morning there be doubt have become good deal inflamed will have to keep quiet for few day after get there will be by mean sorry that journey be approaching end wholly unaccustomed to riding have be so stiff at end of second day journey that must scarcely dismount unassisted from horse have to extent worn off still felt that bone in body ached last ten mile be performed at canter horse seemed a glad a rider at being on level ground again be doubtless well aware that be close to home once more be within three mile of hacienda when saw two mounted figure riding to meet be father sister juan said thought that must lose time in starting after antonio arrived with news be close at hand chapter iv great ranch antonio have indeed be charged to make light of fight in pas father be almost sure to mount ride out to meet juan said to before starting can

two men be sorry to say father that be killed juan replied killed haciendero repeated while girl uttered exclamation of horror why antonio only spoke of attack upon a trifle told to do so sir did not wish for mother to be alarmed might well have imagined that wound be much more serious than reported be serious affair be ambushed by party of nine men in upper part of pas in hill beyond monterey two men be killed by first fire took to rock friend here shot leader one of men shot must not have be much further use for one of fired almost at same instant did bullet cut arm from elbow to shoulder be not at serious wound disabled arm for time however fall of leader settled affair other six men finding that must not get away without certainty of being shot surrendered coming out one by one throwing down weapon in road then going down pas singly be obliged to let go for be still superior to in number must no more show ourselves out of shelter than must at least of might have fallen have fight gone on well let mount don said must tell about later on first thing to do be to have wound seen to padre hidalgo be famous hand at such matter well senor went on to will a cantered along can quite understand now that service that rendered to son be valuable one for have not shot leader of rascal to say nothing of of others fight might have terminated very differently be certainly so juan said

making more of matter than be worth will said earnestly be going quietly along when heard shout exclamation felt that someone be being attacked ran forward seeing four men attacking one have difficulty in deciding who be aggressor without hesitation joined in a took by surprise in fact disposed of two of before must attack while almost at same moment juan killed affair be over almost before began be not quarter of minute from time came up to in fourth man be running off at top of speed have already benefited very largely by affair having gained thereby friendship of son

first affair lasted quarter of minute quarter of hour result be same quickness courage in thus plunging into street fray on behalf of stranger saved son life a doubtless did shot killed leader of party attacking be strange indeed that must have met with two such adventure in course of week possibly juan one be sequel to other engaged in may have be comrade of men who attacked at san diego who thus assaulted to obtain revenge for mishap there be so father attack be work of one man who be happy to say will trouble no more a be leader of second attack man whom senor harland shot who be man what must have be motive for thus attacking only suspected first time father until looked at man harland have shot be not sure of happily none of men who acted for be likely to open lip on matter one else will have suspicion have be otherwise might have have good deal of trouble over for man be captain enriques melos sarasta looked grave a say must lead to serious trouble be known although clearly be not to blame in matter be reason of enmity against be suitor for donna christina guzman hand father ah ah explains well will think more of at present what did do with body piled rock over there be fear of being discovered a certainly must not have mentioned to anyone intention of murdering on way home search be likely to be made in direction be well of course received letter juan sent off messenger at once to senor guzman giving mother hearty consent to match indeed pleased much two three minute later arrived at hacienda in front of number of servant peon employed in garden stable have gathered to welcome young master back after nine month absence a dismounted donna sarasta appeared at door juan ran up step tenderly embraced senor sarasta then led will up first welcome dear must

with nothing kit bag ninety pound to rely upon now be in clover with good friend welcome assured a long a choose to stay here amount of gratitude seems to almost ridiculous considering that be result of interfering in street row just a might have done in other port at rate will have new experience to tell about when get home will certainly like senor have be so long out here that have shaken off indolent air formal constraint that almost spanish people have be much more like american than englishman mere fact of having settled in out of way valley be proof that have lot of go pluck of course ca tell much about wife yet be naturally upset at thought of juan danger a to sister be ever so much prettier than sweetheart though certainly christina guzman be pretty too hardly said word after first welcome to suppose be too upset to talk will brighten up when find that juan wound be really trifling well expect will have jolly time of here get shooting hunting will be great fun among herd of wild cattle first thing to do will be to learn to ride properly must not like to have mexican fellow laughing at at rate have learned something on way here will get juan to go out alone with for bit till can be sure of sticking on from what be saying of horse must be brute to sit especially who jump straight up into air keep on doing until get rid of rider having taken bath dressed very leisurely went downstairs again feeling pleased that juan clothes fitted so well that be not necessary for to get out own for although new must certainly not look so well after journey in kit bag a did spotless white garment have be provided for found clara alone in patio hacienda like most of kind be large square building with courtyard in centre in case patio have be transformed into shady little garden with orange tree banana other tropical production grape vine climbed round light pillar supported veranda surrounded covered roof with mass of foliage dotted with great purple bunch of grape two three little fountain be half hidden among tree air be heavy with scent of orange citron flower father mother will be down directly senor said bell will ring for mid day meal in few minute what lovely little garden be will said cheerfully for saw that girl be nervous embarrassed must not see anything like in east even under glass girl be silent for few moment then broke out hope think ungrateful senor have said nothing to thank for what did for brother be not that be because felt that if be to say word must break out cry love other dearly juan be so awful to think that might never have seen alive again stopped with eye full of tear quite understand senorita said indeed have be very much more than sufficiently thanked by father mother a for share in matter be really not worth talking about be sailor know be sorry to say that sailor when in port be often in habit of getting into row have half dozen time at least when in foreign port taken part in scrimmage when saw drunken sailor engaged in broil with others have have to fight very much harder than did at san diego where in point of fact so far a be concerned there be really fighting at say that brother might not have come off very badly if have not happened to come along there be really shadow of risk to myself couple of blow be over do hope that one will say more in way of thanking at moment senor sarasta wife juan came out together well juan how do feel now will asked well pleased at arrival feel different man altogether young mexican replied warm bath first then padre salve have done wonder for in week will have forgotten about rest of day be spent in sauntering sitting in garden round house be of spanish fashion containing few flower except borne by fruit tree resembling shrubbery orchard rather than garden shade being principal object aimed at during afternoon will told friend of desire to become good horseman will put in charge of antonio have better rider on ranch will put through course beginning with comparatively well broken broncho until can sit worst buckers on plain must not mind few heavy fall at first will not mind that bit juan sailor have knack of falling lightly ah well will choose spot where grass be long ground soft for lesson can tell make good deal of difference whether come off on ground like on spot where there be next to grass ground be a hard a brick have doubt that in course of two three week will if stick to be able to ride almost anything need not be afraid of not sticking to juan certainly must not like to look like fool to vaquero still le before mother sister accordingly next morning will lesson began in meadow close to stream mile away from house at first be thrown innumerable number of time for have told antonio to bring with fairly restive horse be of use spending time on quiet animal said have just have week riding on one of may a well begin with fairly bad one at once only mean few more throw have got to learn to hold on sooner begin that better with beginner sometimes put strap for to hold on by senor will shook head want anything of sort said want to be able to stick on by knee be more by properly balancing than by holding on man said if always keep balance will come straight down again into saddle matter how high throw there be doubt that tighter hold on by knee more heavy be throw that will get can understand antonio now be ready to begin will have expected to find difficult be fairly astounded by rapidity variety of trick by be again again thrown off after time antonio urged to give up for day insisted on continuing until be so absolutely exhausted that must do more well senor man said have done wonderfully well for beginner will guarantee in week will be able to ride ordinary horse in month will be able to mount fearlessly animal that may come across except of course few brute scarcely vaquero on ranch must care to back antonio opinion be justified be ten day before juan be able to ride again by time william harland be so far accustomed to saddle that be able to accompany father on excursion to visit herd see that be going on well did not however give up lesson with antonio devoting three four hour day to work at end of month be able to sit ordinary bucker without difficulty after that practised for hour day on vicious animal at end of three month antonio said now senor can do more for that brute that have be riding last week be terror of ranch after sitting a have done for last three day without being able to get rid of once can ride anything without fear chapter v indian raid time passed very pleasantly will have become great favourite with senor sarasta wife be treated a one of family donna clara often accompanied party on horseback when first shyness with will have worn off found that be lively high spirited accustomed to horse from infancy be admirable rider although juan will be mounted on of best horse on ranch must leave behind on favourite mare beautiful creature that have broken in at end of three month will felt that much a be enjoying must not outstay welcome upon broaching subject of leaving whole family protested so indignantly against such idea that felt really desired to stay with juan spoke to on subject a soon a started on horseback together that afternoon idea of leaving be altogether preposterous will do think that must for moment let go where indeed must go what idea have in mind be not one of completely be awfully good to be never so happy in life will replied there be reason in thing can not spend life here must be doing something for living a told want to return home until can say to father have be success require favour be in position to keep understand that juan said how do propose doing must do somehow can at least ride now have more way of making living open to than have before dear will be talking nonsense if suppose that be going to let go out into world in sort of way be altogether mistaken at rate leave matter alone for present may see way more clearly in time have will happened to glance at companion face must have be puzzled by slight smile glanced across two month later hand be busy on ranch be season at herd be weeded out old bull of young one slaughtered skinned boiled down will only once accompanied senor sarasta juan to scene of operation be interested in indian who with squaw young one have come down established camp of own be free to take a much meat a pleased not only for eating for drying for future consumption broad thin slice of flesh be cut up hung on rope between pole to dry in sun three day sufficed for operation meat now almost a hard a leather be pounded by woman between heavy stone then mixed with little salt packed tightly in bag made of skin in state must keep for indefinite time will harland often went there must not be induced to approach spot where animal be slaughtered be much rallied by senor sarasta juan on what called faint heartedness admit say replied mind going into fight can not stand seeing poor brute killed know that be necessary that vaquero do almost instantaneously at same time be not necessary for to see must very much rather stay away watch native with shrivelled old woman funny little papoose clara nodded approvingly be quite right don william for although others like juan called simply by christian name clara still continued more formal mode of address never go near yard when be going on ah be one thing for girl not to like juan said for will whom have seen a cool a possible when life be in danger who fired at man a steadily a if have be shooting at target seems odd however one doe not go to see animal killed one can take pleasure in interest lie in skill courage of vaquero who be constantly risking life indeed there be scarcely season pass in one two of be not killed work occupied nearly month then juan started with father for san diego where formal betrothal of former be to take place at father presence be necessary latter must make usual arrangement for chartering ship to go down to receive hide skin full of tallow at mouth of river will have again proposed that must accompany say good bye to there a before proposal be scoffed at will be time enough to think of when go down three month hence to be married juan said now must take place here look after mother sister will have to play part of younger brother keep thing straight when come back will have serious talk about future will be indeed now quite at home in work of ranch not infrequently rode in one direction to give order respecting herd while juan rode in other vaquero regarded a being invested with authority by master report of antonio sancho of what have taken place at san diego on road have greatly predisposed in favour manner in have succeeded in sitting horse that few of must venture to mount have greatly increased respect for don senor sarasta settled matter by saying if be to go with juan must not leave at same time will particularly wish to be present at betrothal must be strange contrary to custom if one of family be not there still must hardly be away together unless there be someone here to take place know question be constantly referred to one herd stray into ground allotted to dispute arise between vaquero in fact someone in authority must be here very well sir then if think that can be really useful will be only too glad to stay know that own inclination be way have already be here five month feel that delightful life must come to end before long however since be good enough to say that can really be of use in absence will gladly remain here until juan go down again to fetch bride two day later mexican son rode off accompanied by six well armed horseman will found plenty to do be out greater part of day two day after others have started saw one of indian talking to antonio a soon a latter saw left indian came up to indian who be one of chief of tribe senor tell that there be report that indian on other side of river be preparing for expedition be supposed that be against tribe farther east have not raided on side of river for many year thought that be a well to let know that be at present in unsettled state say that will have of warrior down near river that will let know a soon a have certain news be there anything to be done do think antonio senor war be frequently going on between indian to east have never have trouble with since came here if indian thought that there be danger must very soon be flocking down here for have always be promised that must be supplied with firearm be anything of sort to happen know that with aid of people must beat off number of red skin have doubt that must defend antonio however see that in don sarasta absence have very heavy responsibility think that must be a well to take precaution will ask chief to send down dozen of warrior will be paid in powder in blanket be usual sum want to establish round hacienda to keep guard at night mean that will stay close to house scout down towards river so that in case of alarm there must be time to get in from hut how many sleep there there be about thirty of who look after herd in lower part of valley eight ten peon who work in garden round house well that force with half dozen servant in house must be able to hold hacienda against almost number of indian must all be here in ten minute from alarm being given very well senor will tell chief talked for few minute with indian will send twelve of brave down to morrow said when rejoined will very well let do so will certainly feel more comfortable what tribe do indian on other side of river belong to be branch of tejunas who be branch of apache head quarter of tribe lie on east side of arizona between gila river little colorado tejunas lie between colorado be just a bad a apache of be scourge to northern district of mexico what be indian be branch of genigueh indian live among hill between iron bluff sixty mile below hill see a many mile up good many of hunt during season on other side a far east a aquarius mountain in what be known a mohave country never go farther south that side than river santemaria for tejunas must be down upon if caught in what consider country wish senor be back will said though dare say be right that a indian have made raid across here for many year will not do so now how must get across river must swim across senor indian think nothing of swimming wide river simply slip off horse put hand on back more generally hold on by tail have fellow gun great many of have capture from mexican in peaceable time trade skin blanket indian trumpery for be against law to sell gun to indian most mexican will make bargain if have chance without slightest regard to law how be that mexican government doe not try get rid of indian see by map that frontier line be long way north of gila yes senor may put line where like there be not white man for couple of hundred mile north of gila except on santa fe river even there be never safe from apache navajo why must want army of twenty thousand men to venture among mountain north of gila must die of starvation before ever caught sight of apache senor unless there be earthquake whole region be swallowed up see chance of getting better of red rascal after entering house will said nothing of news have heard seemed that there be real ground for alarm yet must not feel very uneasy next morning rode down to river where number of peon be engaged in loading raft with hide tallow have told donna sarasta that must be down there day a wanted to get work pushed on have be there two hour when antonio rode up at headlong gallop what be antonio will exclaimed for be evident from man appearance that errand be one of extreme importance hacienda have be attacked by indian senor be with herd two mile side of when heard shot fired galloped to see what be matter when got within quarter of mile saw that indian be swarming round dozen started in pursuit of did not follow far will stood a one thunderstruck how can have got there antonio must have come by what be called little gap know senor that valley run off from other nearly abreast of hacienda following crossing shoulder cross down on to river ten mile higher up must have crossed there by swimming in night chief said have scout there must hardly watch thirty mile of river senor besides red skin must have sent over two three swimmer to silence anyone found near place where be to cross by time dozen other vaquero who have be warned by antonio a came down joined must ride for hacienda at once will said leaping into saddle use senor use must say there must be four hundred five hundred of red skin may be sure that there be not soul alive now at hacienda at hut will be here in short time of there be doubt probably half will come down valley half will go up must ride for sir follow river down till be past hill there be not moment to be lost peon who have gathered round gave cry of despair can go if like antonio see can hing at present will not leave place what will do then senor will take raft pole across river there be sign of indian there be not likely there will be now then turned to peon have heard what said get to raft at once there be not moment to be lost look at herd galloping wildly may be sure that red skin be after senor advice be good antonio said there be not moment to be lost get on board of comrade tie bridle to raft hurried on to raft rope held to shore be cut peon putting out pole pushed into stream raft be already heavily laden by far greater portion of cargo having be placed on board most of vaquero have rifle slung across shoulder a have heard from antonio what indian have said have on starting out taken gun with one never can tell what will happen antonio said be always well to be on safe side although peon exerted to utmost raft moved slowly be seventy eighty yard from shore when large band of indian rode down to bank at once opened fire a approached will shouted to men to take place on other side of pile of hide using a breast work having gun at once returned indian fire five six of red skin fell plunging of many horse showed that be wounded chief who seemed to be in command waved hand shouted to follower who be evidently about to urge horse into river when will who have held fire took steady aim at chief latter fell dead from horse will take to water antonio asked vaquero who have taken place on raft with think so senor be not in indian nature to run risk a that must shoot down number of before reached must have tough job then for peon must fight desperately with long knife be easy matter to climb out of water on to raft with two three men with long knife waiting for band be apache senor have evidently joined tejunas in big raid indian for few minute continued fire a on raft only showed head when stood up to fire bullet told in crowded mass indian sullenly rode off peon then resumed pole in ten minute reached opposite shore will sat down a soon a have seen horse landed with feeling of despair in heart in hurried arrangement for safety of with have scarcely have time to think now that there be nothing to do full horror of situation be felt thought of donna sarasta of clara being murdered altogether overpowered cheek be moistened with tear must senor juan say on return have left in charge although must hardly be said to be to blame yet might have taken greater precaution must not have relied upon indian scout have kept at least enough of men up at house to offer serious defence antonio who be at head of one of party in charge of herd came up to presently well senor 't be use grieving assuredly if anyone be to blame be rather than for assured that there be danger will tell senor so when come have be here must feel sure have waited for further news before regarding matter a serious now senor what do propose to do next be leader first thing to do be to go to hacienda after dark to find out what have happened there how long do think that indian will remain in valley day must say senor will doubt kill number of cattle jerk meat then will drive off a many a think can take with probably slay rest out of pure wickedness principal point be to find out if at hacienda have be killed that may be sure of senor still be right that must know there may be one exception although can hardly hope how do mean antonio mean senor that senorita may have be spared for worse fate mean may have be carried off by indian while sparing one else old young always carry off young woman great heaven will exclaimed stepping back a if have be struck say so thousand time better have be murdered by mother side be maddening to sit here be able to hing not even to be able to find out if dreadful thing be true how many men have with gun thirteen besides senor who have rifle will be useless have better go down with raft a soon a becomes dark yes senor must be best indian be sure to swim across to night four raft must do well to push off a soon a can no longer be seen from other side four head men who will go down with be here call up four white men came to a soon a be dark said must push off make slightest noise when get out in middle of stream let current take down only using pole when be absolutely necessary to keep from approaching bank twelve vaquero who have not gun have better go with will give three to raft will pick out thirteen of best horse others must kill afternoon for food have fishing line yes senor always carry with have spear can fish by torch light good then will manage very well vaquero what peon require must be landed a soon a have passed mountain have better strike up to monterey wait there for order will give money to one of to buy horse there ride with news to don sarasta at san diego chapter vi hopeful news when arrangement have be made for departure of raft will harland said to antonio do think that will be absolutely impossible to approach hacienda by daylight must not be done senor indeed see that good must come of for even if must get in unobserved there must be one of whom must ask question find out anything a to what have taken place be just possible that in confusion of attack of peon employed in house stable hut may have escaped hidden indian be good searcher just at first must be anxious to make success a complete a possible doubtless large party rode up valley at once while others started down be important that must surprise men with various herd before must gather together for even if twenty thirty must have rallied must have made hard fight of before lost scalp therefore who escaped in attack on house may have hidden from first search may possibly come across at night must assuredly never leave hiding place until darkness have fallen have hope of sancho if anyone have got out safe have have good deal of experience in indian fighting fifteen year ago when be farther east be sure to have wit about be at hut when came along morning a know got hurt by young bull in yard ten day since be nearly well again padre said have better keep quiet for day two fancy that be only man there except peon for be busy time at first war whoop heard must make for shelter for must know that be use trying to fight whole tribe there be thick patch of brush twenty thirty yard from hut expect that must make for straight there be tank in middle be used at one time water be always muddy master have fresh one made handy to hut since then path to old tank have be overgrown one ever go there if francisco be alive be lying in pond under bush droop over round must not be able to give information a to what be done in house senor must be of great assistance to if follow red skin be up to way be good shot with rifle at rate if go down to house must like to try to find have be comrade good many year now certainly antonio will see if can find be good fellow a say must be of great assistance to do think that must make circuit come down on river again two three mile higher up cross there get anywhere near house might do senor a can not get near enough to do good think must be wrong to move from here may be sure that there be of red skin hiding on opposite bank keeping sharp watch on if of be to ride away one of must carry news at once must be on look out for if stay here till be dark must suppose that have gone down with raft will be good for raft too for indian must be unlikely to attack believing that there be fifteen twenty men with gun on in next place will think that be clear of be le cautious than might be if be to suppose that be still in neighbourhood be right antonio will try be patient a soon a be dark little party of fifteen men started moving a noiselessly a possible rode two mile up river to point where antonio said be opposite path by must keep along at foot of hill until in line with hacienda think that there be fear of there being red skin on farther side not slightest senor long before will have fire lighted be gorging with meat know how small force be will never dream of venturing back into midst a rode into river slipped off horse a latter began to swim holding on with one hand with other keeping gun pistol ammunition above water river at point be two hundred yard wide flowing with quiet current in few minute be across antonio soon discovered path following rode in single file for hour then reached spot where there be opening among tree antonio said that be abreast of hacienda be four mile away building be not visible number of fire blazed round be sufficient indication of position at various other point up down valley fire also blazed there be none much nearer side of valley than round hacienda do mean to go with senor certainly mean to go how have best be done must say that have better ride to within two mile must not be safe to go with so large party nearer than then will take one of others with to hold horse going at foot pace might get within mile of house without hearing there will be good deal of movement in valley cattle will be restless having be chased day herd broken up so think that can reckon on getting pretty close then will go forward on foot have better make for hut first see indian be thick round house think there be chance of anyone being saved there because must be first point of attack if find sancho possibly may come upon one two of peon who must be likely enough to make for same shelter if not can try round stable still be afraid there be chance of hearing have happened at house mean whether senorita be killed prisoner if there be other way must get hold of indian kill will then dress up in clothes see if can get into house a there be two tribe engaged one must have more chance of passing unsuspected than if knew other personally at rate must be risked know indian way pretty well might pas muster must have chance senor when dismounted antonio said have better leave jacket sombrero here outline must show on darkest night that be not indian before leaving raft will have obtained from one of head men pair of mexican fringed legging a own white trouser must betray at once now with dark blanket thrown over shoulder might at short distance be easily mistaken for indian have already left riding boot behind have obtained pair of moccasin from one of peon will lead way senor a know foot of ground antonio said moving along noiselessly came down upon hut of white employes of hacienda a there be fire burning here have slight fear of encountering of indian however carried long knife ready for instant action have left rifle pistol behind for if be necessary to fight combat must be silent one crossed to clump of bush of antonio have spoken stop outside senor be of use two of making way into tangle a parted bush before entering slight sound be heard good there be someone here muttered then making way few pace forward uttered sancho name there be reply repeated in louder tone at once there be low reply here be be tonio yes have come to look for thought must have made bee line here a soon a heard red skin be right there be two peon here be just going to start to make way down to river be alone have young senor with be good be afraid that have be wiped out in couple of minute four men emerged from bush be glad to see that be safe sancho will said warmly now can tell have happened know nothing senor be eating breakfast when heard sudden yell knew that be apache war whoop that there must be big force of there be evidently no fighting to be done so caught up rifle pistol made for bush two peon who be outside followed told to hide a best must went on into pool found good place under thick bush hid powder horn weapon handy for use close by lay down with head out of water listening already be down at hut heard cry of peon caught there luckily be only mexican above few shot be fired up at hacienda thought heard scream owing to yell of indian must not be sure presently died away fancy suspected that anyone have got away attack being so sudden at rate made search here made up mind to lie down most of must be asleep then to make for river told peon that must shift for ourselves a have more chance of getting away singly than if together be spoken in low voice principal thing wanted to ask be do know whether senorita be killed whether have kept to carry off of course know must not kill man said confidently so far a know have not even caught be at stable maybe hour before senorita came down have horse saddled have basket with told be going to ride up valley to wigwam remained when indian went away carrying a much meat a pony must take there be old indian wife left there have got fever something be too ill to travel senorita be going to take basket of food medicine that padre have made up for old man have be thinking of day must say be coming back when red skin rode up valley after cattle must hardly have helped seeing wondered whether must take to tree ride on way until after have passed whether have turned ridden on if did first be pretty sure to have be captured when got down near home if went other way gave mighty long chase for there be not horse on estate a fast a hers a for indian pony must leave behind a if be standing still thank god there be hope then will exclaimed now must move farther off chat over when have gone quarter of mile from house stopped antonio told two peon that raft have started fully two hour before current be only about mile half hour if cross river keep on ought to catch up before morning can then swim off to keep side of river there be red skin on bank if stay on side of valley among tree down to river will meet none of have come way peon at once started now senor will go on to where horse be sancho will go back to house understands apache language will crawl up near fire must think that be pretty certain to hear if have caught senorita not however may be time so be anxious move if hear sudden row for might miss in dark will make straight to tree for bit horse must carry double have better hand jacket to senor harland sancho take blanket how far be horse there be three of about two hundred yard farther on will go there first then man said be terrible business senor terrible indeed be afraid there be doubt that donna sarasta have lost life reckon man said that except ourselves may have with there ai dozen alive in valley be clean wipe out never knew worse surprise how about party by river antonio related what have taken place there well be something saved said with sixteen of well armed can manage to make decent fight of must get horse wo be very difficult most of others be sure to have lasso with there be score of horse running loose on plain can not have roped in yet when reached horse went on have better stop here tonio be not accustomed a be to injun a know much of lingo must not understand much of talk must much rather go alone all right old man other said now for toilet sancho went on going up to one of horse pricked with knife steady boy steady said a horse plunged be for good a well a mine for must not find life in indian village a pleasant a life have be used to dipped finger in blood drew broad line across forehead round eye placed patch on cheek then cut off two handful of long hair from animal tail tied together with string fastened in hair so that horse hair fell down on to shoulder on side partially hid face be rough said will pas in darkness be lucky have got 'pache blanket will help wonderfully yes bought from indian when traded here few week since man got of said that have traded good pony for when be hunting in spring on other side of river will take rifle tonio sancho said must either have bow arrow now good bye without word turned strolled away towards hacienda be nearly two hour before returned senorita have got away so far said red skin came across half way up valley turned rode straight up dozen well mounted men be sent after heard that sent so many because be afraid that might fall in with party of genigueh indian who must certainly attack at once thank god will exclaimed fervently there be chance of saving after for if overtake wo do for time can attack a come back again now let join others at once make up valley during time sancho have be away have be questioning antonio a to extent of valley go long way into heart of mountain senor none of know beyond what have learned from indian for be strictly forbidden to go beyond boundary for fear of disturbing game in indian country say that run three hour fast riding beyond bound after that becomes mere ravine can be followed up to top of hill from there across wild country until at last track come down on ford on colorado from there there be track leading west at foot of san francisco mountain coming down on little colorado close to moquis country how far must that be from here will asked have never be across there senor doubt whether white man have not on line must think that from what indian say must be fifty mile from end of part of valley to ford of colorado from there to little colorado must be one hundred fifty mile in straight line perhaps two hundred by way track go be to say if there be track that anyone can follow track mostly run pretty straight so must say that must be about a far to moquis country a must be to san diego from here however may be sure that be not going to make such journey a that apache be not likely to follow farther than end of valley at most to colorado ford a rode along will learned from sancho how have obtained news there be difficulty about that other said carelessly waited till fire be bit low then sauntered about near of party of tejunas heard talking about learned that have a believed wiped out people except who crossed river on raft senorita though allowed that few of men with herd might have got away be going to search valley thoroughly to morrow not soul in hacienda escaped red skin be exultant over amount of booty have taken be glad that cattle be amply sufficient for tribe so that there must be cause for dispute a to division be specially pleased with store of flour good of kind in magazine when joined main body sancho be heartily welcomed by comrade who be delighted to hear that there be at least chance of saving senorita of whom hand on estate be fond be arranged at once that sancho must ride by turn behind others then started at gallop up valley keeping close within edge of tree covered hillside chapter vii pursuit few word be spoken until party arrived at spot where valley began to narrow in near boundary of ranch be now considerably beyond indian fire there be fear of meeting with of red devil now sancho said know well enough that indian must not venture to attack that there be other enemy near quarter of mile will be at wigwam where senorita went morning will stop there for moment will said be not likely that will find anything will give useful information at rate horse may a well have short rest there a well a anywhere else have come fifteen mile now at smart pace men dismounted one of struck light with flint steel then lit end of short coil of cord have be soaked in saltpetre waved round head till burst into flame a expected found two indian lying dead have be tomahawked then scalped on ground lay broken medicine bottle portion of soft pudding doe not tell much will said sancho made answer looked round wigwam basket be not here said noticed that be pretty full suppose red skin took sancho must not bother about basket be last thing must think of taking idea be that senorita came back here expect came to warn indian must to begin with if rode at full speed have distanced 'paches who must not be able to get through herd must have be between when first saw if be half way down valley might have be here minute before of course two old indian knew that there be escape for made effort to avoid fate expect have only taken that pudding medicine out of basket when got back now seeing that basket be in be gone seems to possible enough that senorita may have caught up ridden off with knowing that have long ride before through country where there be posadas hope indeed that may be so sancho for have be wondering what must do if be lost in mountain what must be likely to put in basket handed up to senor when have mounted there be two bottle of milk bottle of wine pile of cake there be few other thing did not notice what be only hope that idea be correct sancho must be great comfort to know that have enough provision to last for two three day expect will find that be so senor senorita be quick witted cool saw once when dozen bull stampeded when be trying to drive into yard be sitting horse short distance from gate be just in line did try to dash aside across path a many must have done turned started keeping horse in at first then letting out gradually edging off out of line came cantering back laughing a joined father who be looking pale a death at danger have be in have very little doubt that have be a said galloped at first at full speed then when got near hut saw that be well ahead of red skin rode up here jumped off to warn indian when found must not go took basket knowing thing must be of use to might be worth hundred time weight in gold to maybe old indian may have suggested to at rate feel sure took well will ride steadily on be there place where must have left valley not beyond senor at least know of none a told know very little of valley beyond point certainly must have known path doubt went straight on well mounted a be must feel sure that red skin must not overtake expect did not press horse much contented with keeping out of rifle shot know whether knew of ford across river must naturally plunge in at point where track come down on must doubt be surprised at finding that horse be able to cross without swimming must not be able to turn after have crossed come down on opposite bank senor must not be possible there be high mountain there river at place run through deep gorge how far do think apache must follow think that must keep on for distance beyond river when found at last that have chance of catching might turn come back cross river camp on side by time horse must be done for see most likely have long ride yesterday maybe be travelling night of course gave senorita immense advantage that horse be fresh while have anyhow great deal taken out of before set out in pursuit must recommend that halt a soon a becomes light in clump of tree wait for a come back be pretty well matched in number with advantage of surprise ought to be able to wipe out altogether might go a far a can up valley to point where becomes mere ravine before daylight break horse will be better for rest of few hour will have gone over forty mile since left river may probably have very long journey to do again to morrow there be saying how far senorita may have gone must not know whether red skin might not follow night must think that must keep on till daybreak though of course must only go at walk be difficult to say what be most likely to do be indeed senor if be in place must be puzzled must reckon that in valley have be wiped out red skin must assuredly first make rush for hacienda because be most important that must carry that before men must rally round make defence must reckon that red skin must remain there for four five day before have jerked a much meat a must carry that when started party must like enough be placed in ambush to catch a came back must know that be next to hopeless to try find way down across such mountain a there be ahead through so far a know there be track be not sure must not push on in hope of reaching moquis who be peaceful indian a have heard with village perched on top of hill having flock herd being in way different from other tribe except zuni red skin say that people be here before that really belong to tribe of central mexico came from there long before white man ever set foot in america from there one must travel north strike santa fe trail possibly make one way through safely though navajo be pretty nearly a bad there a apache be here whether senorita have ever heard of moquis can not say if find that be on trail will follow thinking anything better than going back falling into hand of apache be there other tribe must have to pas through on way think not be great mountain track where even red skin must not pick up living a far a have heard track from ford lead through series of pass between lofty hill be not course of river therefore there be not likely to be village must say that there must be forest on lower slope be sure to meet with enough game to keep now proceeded at walk for tree in most place grew thickly ground here there be broken by boulder have rolled down from hillside at last came to point where valley be hundred yard wide here halted took off horse bridle to allow to pick what grass there be threw down most of be asleep in few minute be necessary to keep watch will said senor 'paches will assuredly not start to come back until morning country be a strange to a be to must say from what have heard be about ten mile from river in hour hour half after daylight be likely to be here will took seat by trunk of tree have inclination for sleep thought be busy with girl alone in mountain with unknown country before band of relentless savage who might for aught knew be still pressing after be difficult to conceive more terrible situation might lose trail be sure to be faintly marked one in place indistinguishable save to eye accustomed to tracking if so fate be sealed must wander about till died of hunger thirst be maddening to be waiting there even for hour two to know that be alone a soon a daylight broke sancho sent four of men back to hunt for game if did not come upon something in course of three quarter of hour be to return have be gone however time when crack of rifle be heard ten minute later rode back bringing with stag have shot already fire have be lighted one hundred yard behind camping ground antonio have collected perfectly dry wood for purpose there will be smoke to speak of said to will what little there be will make way out through leaf be unlikely in extreme that indian will notice if do will think that be fire made by one of indian couple of hunter at once set about skinning cutting up carcass be to go on cooking until signal be made to that indian be approaching horse have now be collected men disposed behind trunk of tree with horse few yard behind be well trained to stand still when rein be thrown over head in front of be clear space thirty yard across after hour anxious waiting sancho who be lying with ear to ground raised hand a signal that must hear indian coming men from fire ran up took place with rest rifle be thrown forward in readiness must now hear dull tread of horse with occasional sharper sound a hoof fell upon rock a apache rode out from wood leader suddenly checked horse with warning cry be too late sixteen rifle flashed out apache fell before others must recover from surprise at unexpected attack vaquero charged down upon hopelessly outnumbered a be apache fought desperately combat be short pistol of will sancho be used with deadly effect in couple of minute fight be over last indian have fallen now let waste time will said ten minute must do for breakfast then will be off none of party be seriously hurt wound be soon bandaged joint hanging above fire be soon taken down cut into slice grilled be being eaten when four indian stepped from among tree one of being evidently chief be breaking rule said to will whom recognized a leader of party will lay complaint before great master will did not answer antonio who spoke language fairly replied have not heard news have heard news chief said heard gun fire when be hunting two mile down valley came to see what be then heard many gun not knowing what must be hid horse came on then do not know that there be three four hundred apache tejunas in valley below hacienda have be attacked within killed that herd have be destroyed so far a know alone have escaped indian uttered deep exclamation of surprise be firing chief asked if go on hundred yard farther up will find dead body of twenty apache brave have be riding in pursuit of donna clara daughter of senor who be fortunately at end of valley having gone there with food medicine for old indian of tribe who be too ill to leave with rest fortnight since saw often then chief said young brave motioned to will be often in camp girl visited wigwam gave many little present to woman did escape did where be know not be going in search of if warrior will go with will be glad for eye be better than ours must follow footmark of horse where must see nothing teczuma with one of warrior will go chief said other two must go carry news to people though be not strong enough to fight so large force yet will not be idle many of apache tejunas will lose scalp before cross river again spoke few word to three men who at once left in ten minute one returned with two horse chief have already eaten two slice of deer flesh mounted rode on with others while follower waited for minute to eat flesh have already be cooked for sancho have chosen horse have be ridden by apache chief without stopping rode on until be few minute later joined by other indian now pushed on rapidly ascending ravine on reaching top will saw with satisfaction high hill on side bordered what be in fact pas between that clara must therefore have kept on chief with follower rode little ahead of others will with antonio sancho following closely behind once twice chief pointed down to mark on rock with remark shod horse be right antonio said indian shoe horse so may be sure be senorita path soon began to descend again in hour from time of starting emerged from pas within one hundred yard of river ground here being soft well marked track be visible made by people chief said turning round often cross ford to hunt on other side large forest there two hour ride away good hunting ground apache not come there hill too big to cross beyond river track be for time perfectly distinct presently became fainter however a indian rode on rapidly will have doubt that although must not see track on ground be plain enough to eye of indian be mighty good job have chief with said trail be plain enough at present be sure to get fainter when get into forest speak of probably go straight enough there once among tree will break up a indian must scatter to hunt must have lost lot of time following now have got two red skin fellow will pick up almost a fast a can ride road indeed after passing over rocky plateau dipped suddenly down into deep valley running up from river extending a far a one must see almost due east among hill track be following turned to right at foot of hill for mile be clearly defined then gradually became fainter a indian who have followed turned off in search of game footprint of shod horse continued straight up valley until ten mile from point at have entered turned to left have be going at walk for mile chief said white girl have be walking beside saw footprint many time will find that halted for night at little stream in middle of valley must have be getting dark when arrived here must be good horsewoman have good horse under for be nearly eighty mile from here to hacienda by stream indeed found place where clara have slept indian pointed to spot where horse have cropped grass by edge of stream where have at last lain down near mistress who have a few crumb showed of cake wonder see one of bottle will remarked antonio translated remark to chief who said girl wise fill bottle with water not know how far stream come halt here can not follow trail farther soon come dark be evident to men horse alike needed rest lit fire sat around for short time be encouraged by success so far even fact that be supperless did not affect teczuma wolf go out find game in morning chief said confidently plenty of game here long before others be awake indeed chief follower be moving just a daylight broke latter ran into camp come said bring gun grizzly coming down valley teczuma watch men be on foot instant antonio translated indian word followed indian on foot be bear too much for two indian will asked sancho if have be alone must have fought chief be right to send for be like enough might have got badly hurt must have be bad thing for presently indian stopped be still twilight under tree must make out great gray form advancing towards when within twenty yard scented danger stopped with angry growl almost at same moment rifle flashed out behind tree near flank with furious growl turned exposing flank to watcher antonio have warned five of not to fire other ten rifle be fired simultaneously bear rolled over over scrambled to foot again stood rocking evidently wounded to death other five men ran forward together when three yard distant poured in fire bear fell dead vaquero lost time in skinning portion of flesh be carried to fire cut up into strip at once cooked a soon a meal be finished rest of meat be cut off divided between party who then mounted rode on two indian again leading way chapter viii cave dweller three day later party stood on brow of steep bluff looking down upon colorado chiquita river have be weary journey be evident that girl have after second day riding allowed horse to go own way trusting perhaps to instinct to make for habitation must there be in region there have be no difficulty in following footstep until third day when be passing over stony plateau here even keen sight of indian sometimes failed hour be lost in taking up trail there be water to be met with here indian agreed that horse be going slowly weakly girl for most part walking beside a pointed out by crushed blade of grass flattened lichen by side of horse track later in day trail be straighter chief said confidently horse smell water river can not be many mile away be hour after starting on third morning that reached bluff opposite to for distance of couple of mile rose steep island of basalt hundred of foot above plain around on summit large village must be seen indian said pointing to then must have got there in safety will exclaimed in delight chief shook head horse not able to swim river must stop day to eat grass there horse pointed to animal seven hundred eight hundred foot below be colour sure enough antonio exclaimed see senorita may be asleep will suggested likely enough senor will soon see dismounting made way down steep descent then leaped into saddle galloped forward to edge of stream quarter of mile away mare evidently scented that new comer be not indian cantered to meet with whinny of pleasure there be sign of girl dismounted to search among low bush for will loudly calling name presently indian who with follower have moved along bank called slept here yesterday said level grass close to shrub testified to truth of exclamation two indian looked serious what be chief indian said white girl come down to river to drink then lay down here then indian come along see footprint on soft earth of bank catch when asleep carry off teczuma wolf have looked mark of little foot four foot deeper mark than when came along indian carry off perhaps have taken along river to ford carried up to village soon see wolf moved along bank others following at short distance having first taken off horse bridle allowing to take good drink turned loose to feed small men chief said when will with two chief vaquero came up to short step got spear bow how on earth doe know will said when word be translated to sancho pointed to round mark on ground there be butt end of spear dare say chief have noticed hole of different shape made by end of bow mile farther bluff approached river bordered with perpendicular cliff have doubtless be caused by face of hill being eaten away by river countless age before stream be here thirty yard from foot of cliff more more puzzled at direction in clara have be carried tracker followed have gone hundred yard along foot of cliff when great stone came bounding down from above striking ground few yard in front of indian who leaped back almost instantly shrill voice shouted from above looking up saw number of native on ledge hundred foot above with bow bent threateningly back of sancho shouted arrow may be poisoned seeing however that party retreated in haste indian did not shoot when short distance away council be held returned to horse mounted swam river then rode along to view cliff three four opening be seen on level of ledge on indian be posted will be astonished to see above cliff be here quite perpendicular be covered with strange sculpture of still retained colour with have in time long past be painted be old people cave dweller sancho said have heard of be here long before moquis be here be people dwelling in cave there be hundred of cave in place have always kept apart never made friend with moquis in early time with spaniard there be missionary among moquis must never do anything among cave people who be say idolater offer human sacrifice how do people live antonio asked fish steal animal from moquis when get chance dwell in such inaccessible cave once there be safe from pursuit if like senor will go up to moquis village try to find out something about know moquis language understand something of sign language be understood by indian dare say that will be able to learn something about people will dismounted a vaquero rode off bidding antonio do same told man to take horse quarter of mile away there to dismount cook meal now antonio said have to see how place can be climbed antonio shook head must say that be altogether impossible senor see there be zigzag path cut in face of cliff up to ledge in place rock be cut away altogether then have got ladder must doubt draw up at once if be attacked see lower one have already be pulled up like enough sentry be posted at of break when be threatened with attack besides chance be that if thought there be risk of getting up must kill senorita see antonio have thought of making way up by step question be must be climbed elsewhere other end of ledge must be best point to get up at for watch be kept must certainly be where step come up antonio shook head unless one must fly senor there must be way of getting up there know will said shortly wait till have have good look at lying on ground with chin resting on hand gazed intently at cliff observing even most trifling projection tiny ledge here there ran along face must be difficult job dangerous one said be not sure that can not be managed at rate will try be sailor know antonio be accustomed when have be sailing in gale to hold on with toe a well a finger now do go back to others will want two pole say fifteen foot long hook can make from ramrod do see just in middle of ledge where large square entrance be cliff bulge out must say ledge be twenty foot wide be lucky for if there be sentry on step must not be able to see beyond point if must do so must not have much chance of getting up for will be bright moonlight night when get to top be if do get there will lower down rope can fasten lariat together must hold weight of dozen men lightest most active of must come up first when two three be up can haul rest up easily enough now can go will be here half hour at least must see exactly best way to climb calculate number of foot along of little ledge to point where can reach one above with hook get whole thing well in mind antonio went away shaking head to feat seemed so impossible that thought that be nothing short of madness to attempt such be opinion of rest of vaquero two indian when on arriving at fire told what will proposed doing leader however when joined have look of confidence on face be more convinced than ever that can be done said when meal of bear flesh have be eaten lit pipe began to smoke quietly chief came up spoke to what doe say antonio say that be brave man senor that man must do what be talking of that will throw away life tell will bet horse against that will succeed will be witness to bet in case come back again chief nodded gravely when offer be made to indian of tribe be given to wagering a horse will be riding be far better one than own regarded matter rather a legacy than bet hour later sancho came down accompanied by several of moquis indian leading four sheep a present followed by woman carrying pan of milk basket of egg cake of various description sancho presented chief to will be quite friendly senor hate cave dweller who be constantly robbing who compel to keep guard over animal at night can understand pretty well bid tell that must gladly assist against cave dweller that be impossible to reach cave will shook hand with chief asked sancho to explain by sign that be much obliged for present tell sancho that be going to try to scale cliff to night be going to scale cliff vaquero asked incredulously did not say that be going to scale be going to try may add that hope that will succeed will ask if cave dweller poison arrow have already asked that senor said cattle have often be wounded by unless wound be mortal one recover be very satisfactory will said for own have more fear of being hit by poisoned arrow than have of scaling cliff chief say that if will go up to village will place house at disposal senor tell that be much obliged that to morrow may accept invitation horse will require three four day rest before starting back can hardly hope that senorita will be fit to travel for good deal longer than although have just eaten meal vaquero be perfectly ready to begin number of egg be roasted in ash washed down by long draught of milk chief then left number of villager came down watched proceeding of stranger with great interest will at once proceeded to carry out plan of bending ramrod hot spot in fire be selected two of vaquero increased intensity of heat by fanning with sombrero three others went down to river brought up large flat boulder two three smaller one using large one a anvil end of hook be hammered into sharp broad chisel shaped blade sancho have explained to chief two pole fifteen foot long be required when be brought down ramrod be securely bound to with strip of wetted hide other strip be by will direction bound round pole so a to form projection foot apart will greatly assist in climbing said say must not do without will make very much easier in order to lull cave dweller into security camp be shifted in afternoon to foot of moquis hill there will gave men instruction a to operation will cross river on horse mile above cave said must use must not keep rifle pistol dry must all remove boot a soon a dismount will now tear up two three blanket twist strip round barrel of gun so must strike against rock sound will be made have better do same with barrel of pistol then chose lightest of vaquero to follow light weight be to be third antonio be to follow then sancho order in others be to go be arranged lariat be securely knotted together knot tied with strip of hide to prevent possibility of slipping men carried out order be evident from manner that have not slightest hope that attempt must be successful hour after sunset started be two day after full moon have therefore a many hour to reach foot of cliff before rose hour be sufficient to traverse distance therefore rested for time after darkness set in before starting river after removing boot made way noiselessly along keeping distance from river bank until reached spot where cliff rose perpendicularly then keeping close to foot held on until arrived at spot will have fixed upon there lay down among boulder close to rock wall remained there until moon rose there have be several discussion a to best way to get lariat up a be agreed that whether carried in coil over shoulder wound round body must hamper climber movement question be finally solved by taking coil of thin hide while little thicker than string be amply strong enough to support weight of lariat four five bullet have be sewn up in piece of skin attached to one end strap be fastened to pole so that must be slung behind so permitting free use of hand where be not needful to use saint watch over senor antonio whispered a will prepared to start sancho gave silent grip of hand while indian chief laid hand on shoulder muttered ugh heap brave for short distance ascent be comparatively easy then arrived at first of ledge have noticed be ten inch wide keeping face to wall using hand to grip most trifling irregularity to get hold in small crevice made way along until arrived at projection barred farther progress slipping one of sling from shoulder reached up until hook caught next ledge obtained good hold there then climbed pole until finger got grip of ledge when hauled up to be fifteen inch wide here without difficulty obtained footing again slung pole on shoulder went on ledge narrowed rapidly be now at one of point appeared to most difficult for from where have be lying ledge seemed almost to cease while next ledge above be also so narrow that knew must not obtain standing room upon a approached narrow path took pole one in hand obtained grip of upper ledge now made way along on tiptoe having weight almost entirely on pole shifting alternately to landsman must have be extraordinary feat accustomed to hang to rope by one hand be not so difficult for especially a obtained slight support from foot without pole must have be impossible for to have passed a ledge in place be only three inch wide at end of thirty foot again widened next forty fifty foot upward be comparatively easy for rock sloped to extent inward there be many fissure in be enabled to get firm grip with finger then came several difficult place be confident now in hold hook have on rock always working with great caution using sometimes hand sometimes pole reached top in hour after starting chapter ix rescued threw down on platform be entirely deserted lay there for five minute then unwound coil of leather thong threw weighted end over knew that have allowed ample length drew in until felt slight strain then came three jerk party below have hold of thong two more jerk told that have fastened end of lariat to in couple of minute be in hand there be parapet eighteen inch high along edge of platform intended doubtless to prevent child from falling over seeing place to must fasten lariat tied round middle of two pole laid on ground close to parapet put foot upon then leaned over two pull on lariat told that next man be tied on began at once to haul upon found weight much le than have expected not only be vaquero short wiry be using hand foot with such effect that in five minute stood beside will work went on quickly now one after men be pulled up in le than hour be assembled on platform where save three engaged in pulling comrade up have laid down a soon a reached will have be glad to relinquish work to others for hand be cut bleeding have crawled along keeping by wall of rock until reached point where bulge bend in face of cliff enabled to see to other end of platform to surprise not soul be visible peering over parapet saw four figure standing a sentinel at point where there be break in path moonlight enabled to make out that ladder have be pulled up laid beside must hear confused hum of voice from principal cave though most anxious to know what be going on there dared not venture farther until men be up a anyone coming out of cave must at once see therefore rejoined others man a came up gave silent grip of hand indian chief muttered something sancho whispered meant heap great brave a soon a last man be up moved silently forward man knew part have to play sancho three others crept forward on hand knee under shelter of parapet to other end of platform where be to await signal rest halting at front of main entrance to cave here sight met eye filled with horror entrance opened into wide hall be lighted by dozen torch at farther end be hideous idol carved from solid rock in front of be sort of altar upon lay figure at once recognized a of donna clara beside stood two men naked to waist with body painted with strange figure have knife in hand rocking to fro be uttering sort of prayer incantation take fellow to left antonio will take other illustration fight in cave shot rang out together distance be sixteen seventeen yard without cry two priest executioner fell dead terrible cry of astonishment dismay broke from crowd before must recover from surprise vaquero two indian headed by will burst way through will have given strict order that there be to be general firing a men woman child be likely to be mixed up together a entered caught sound of four rifle outside knew that sentry have be disposed of will caught up girl who be evidently insensible threw over shoulder surrounded by men made way outside cave here handed over to antonio who be very powerfully built man latter without word started for step now men will shouted a with cry of fury indian followed spare one of bloodthirsty wretch woman fight be short indian being shot down a poured out on to platform others however maddened by loss of expected victim capture of stronghold fought desperately to end mexican using butt end of rifle while savage fought with knife after fight be over cave be thoroughly searched many of woman have fallen for have joined in fight a fiercely a men in darkness confusion be impossible to distinguish apart rest with child be forced to descend step ladder have be replaced by sancho party who having finished work have run off at once to bring up horse clara be still unconscious when returned will mounted antonio handed to sancho two of men accompanied while rest in charge of captive followed more slowly fire be blazing high at moquis village be evident that attack have be eagerly watched that firing on platform have shown that cave have be taken for on still night air came sound of horse drum loud shouting will at once urged horse into water companion swimming by horse close to so a to render assistance if necessary distance be short be not long before horse felt bottom again sudden chill of water have roused girl from faint where be murmured be safe in arm will said have got safely out of hand of wretch danger be over be will asked be dreaming be sure enough clara said be glad for once have dropped don followed with antonio sancho thirteen other vaquero be joined by genigueh chief teczuma one of tribe who

till have got strength again zona gallant zona be safe yes seemed pretty nearly recovered from fatigue when found morning will be ready to carry back again a approached hill saw number of people coming down zigzag path with torch who welcomed will on arrival with loud cry of triumph horse must go no farther a path like up to cavern be at several point cut away break being in daytime filled with long plank a girl be altogether unable to walk of boy ran up hill in quarter of hour returned with pole with litter be speedily improvised in be laid four moquis carried up hill will walking beside holding hand whole of villager be assembled on top of hill shouting dancing with joy at destruction of enemy for sancho have already made chief aware that men have be killed woman child be
