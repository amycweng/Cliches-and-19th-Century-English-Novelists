major farran died suddenly of sunstroke after heavy field day plan hope daughter may have entertained came to end name that of mother be put down among woman to be sent with next batch of invalid home to england suddenly accepted offer of marriage of young sergeant humphreys whose advance have previously treated with scorn be married six week later on day before mother be to go down by train with party of invalid to calcutta universal opinion of woman in regiment be that sergeant have got bad bargain man of spirit one of said must have taken up with girl who only accepted because must not do

sergeant major daughter have given air have thrown in way of young officer have be light flighty in manner be changed a soon a be married even most censorious be obliged to admit that made sergeant humphreys better wife than have expected home be admirably kept gay dress have be somewhat beyond station be cut up altered dressed neatly quietly be handy with finger thing always fitted well gained approbation of officer wife who have previously looked upon with disfavour a forward young person made effort to get on good term with wife of other non commissioned officer succeeded at last in overcoming prejudice a jane farran have excited there be doubt that be clever woman be equally beyond doubt that completely managed husband be much superior in education possessing far greater ability must twist round little finger although did so cleverly that never suspected that be victim of such operation month previous to opening of story have be confined of boy two day later mr clinton wife of captain of husband company also became mother before week be over mr clinton be taken dangerously ill a be impossible for to nurse child surgeon of regiment recommended that must be given into charge of sergeant wife a being strong healthy young woman must very well nurse a well a own be month after sergeant humphreys returning to quarter found wife sitting by side of bed on two infant be asleep be a alike a two pea said a looked at be sure wonder jane that know be mr humphreys answer did not seem to point captain clinton be rich man be not john yes say came into grand estate two year ago when father died that like enough will leave regiment when go home next year then one of baby will be rich man other stopped other will hope be non commissioned officer in th foot one of day sergeant said jane looked up at husband there be touch of envy discontent in voice be about to speak checked be yours john asked moment later returning to first remark be sure must not tell said with laugh baby be mostly pretty much alike a two be just same age just same size have got gray eye light coloured hair if can call hair nose to speak of see pin point of difference month later small party be assembled in captain clinton bungalow mr humphreys be standing with baby in arm mr clinton be lying upon sofa cry bitterly captain clinton be walking up down room hot angry surgeon of regiment be standing grave sympathetic by mr clinton sergeant humphreys be in attitude of attention by door with anxious troubled expression on face what in world be to be done doctor captain clinton asked never heard of such thing be most serious business can quite see that doctor replied when mr humphreys came to asked to break news to told at once that be terrible business own see that be altogether to blame be most unfortunate occurrence a have just told have when put child to bed put child in one of baby night gown a happened there be none of child clean in morning took out laid on rug on ground before beginning to wash dress went out to canteen to get something for husband breakfast when returned must not remember order in have taken out of bed laid down must not distinguish own child from yours must remember mr humphreys captain clinton broke in think over woman must remember how laid down indeed sir have be thinking morning have nursed two three time during night of course have changed position then never thought about having same night gown on if have of course must have be more careful for have said to husband over over again that be only by clothes must know apart for if have be twin must not be more alike be downright maddening captain clinton exclaimed pacing up down room be there mark anything by can be recognized why bless woman surely a mother ought to know own child mr humphreys shook head have nursed sir be mine be yours must not say to save life well put child down on sofa captain clinton said take off for present have done mischief enough for lifetime will let know what decide upon later on well doctor what on earth be to be done asked after door have closed upon sergeant wife what do think have best be done lucy mr clinton who be just recovering from illness be too prostrated by terrible blow to be able to offer suggestion be terrible business indeed clinton doctor said feel for most deeply of course possibility of such thing never entered mind when recommended to let mr humphreys act a foster mother seemed at time quite providential circumstance that too must be just confined in position to take to baby only possible suggestion can offer be that must for time bring up boy a own at present be certainly wonderfully alike be probable that a grow up will see in one other of likeness to wife that other will take after own parent of course likeness always exist in nine case out of ten resemblance can be traced between boy one other of parent that certainly seems feasible captain clinton said in tone of relief what do say dear be only bringing up two child for time till be able to be certain be own other will have have advantage of good education so on of course will be business to give good start in life will be awful having two child not knowing be own will be very unpleasant captain clinton said soothingly see in time will come to care for just a if have be twin will be almost a bad mr clinton cried feebly suppose one get to love wrong one best wo suppose that dear if love equally will when find out be ours treat other a adopted child complete education start in life a if be so fortunately expense will be nothing to woman have right to one of doe not deserve to have one captain clinton said angrily of course must make arrangement with be bound to do best to repair terrible mischief carelessness have caused well doctor will think over for hour two certainly suggestion seems by far best for to adopt hussy doctor said a walked away to quarter be more than half inclined to believe that have done on purpose never liked jade before married though own that have turned out better than expected always thought designing artful young woman gave credit for plenty of brain what must suit purpose better than change of child must see that in first place must get own boy well brought up perhaps provided for with sort of chance of making money out of affair may have be accident of course if so be wonderfully fortunate one for such be opinion among woman of regiment when news became known jane humphreys be speedily made aware of fact by change in manner towards have however small opportunity for demonstrating opinion for mr humphreys remained shut up a much a possible in room one two woman who be inclined to take favourable view of matter so called upon reported that be completely prostrated by occurrence among officer family greatest commiseration be felt for captain clinton wife matter be discussed at tiffin day with great animation think doctor that woman must know own child young ensign asked not at arbuthnot be to say not if mean that must know by sort of maternal instinct there be such thing have more mean of telling own infant out of dozen others of similar complexion age appearance than must have of picking out own pocket handkerchief out of dozen others of similar pattern if be unmarked sheep can pick out own lamb among hundred doctor be sure be alike a so many pea surely that must be maternal instinct not in smallest degree arbuthnot sheep other animal posse in very high degree sense be comparatively rudimentary in human being mean of course sense of smell sheep know lamb cow know calf by sense of hearing by of sight recognizes solely wholly by sense of smell just a dog can track master footstep out of thousand by same sense two baby be a alike a twin be not surprised that if really got mixed woman must not be able to detect one from other be awful thing for clinton major said here have got splendid estate will never be certain whether own son stranger be going to inherit after be enough to make man go out of mind see that must be likely to mend matter doctor said dryly in fact must lessen one chance exists of ever setting matter straight a have told though child be very much alike at present indeed most baby be be probable that a grow up there will no longer be resemblance whatever that own child will develop likeness to mr clinton while other child will resemble sergeant wife must hope will be so major said though there be lot of fellow who resemble in least of parent what be clinton going to do about have not settled yet wife be in condition to discus matter poor lady suggestion be that must bring up child a if be own until one other of develops likeness be speaking of suppose be best thing can do doctor will be awful business if a grow up likeness to anybody can be detected in of well major although at present doe seem awful thing wo seem so bad at end say of twenty year will naturally by time be a fond of one a other boy in fact will be like twin suppose property can be divided in such way a must be be really in relation to other see doctor one of captain said mr humphreys have to be considered to certain extent too be hard on mr clinton if get boy be certain at rate that one of be son mr humphreys will by arrangement have to lose child altogether seems to pretty rough on well brought on doctor replied whole thing have arisen from carelessness do think be carelessness doctor major asked be matter on will give opinion major be one upon one man can form judgment a well a thing may very well have happened in way describes again may be very cunningly devised plot on part be evident have everything to gain by such accident must get child taken off hand educated provided for must calculate doubt that must be nurse must expect in return for giving up claim to one other of very distinct monetary advantage at say that affair be not accident upon contrary admit that be accident might very well happen under circumstance what do say be nothing must have turned out better for just a tiffin be finished captain clinton soldier servant came into mess room with request that dr parker must go across to master bungalow well doctor captain clinton said a entered in first place want to go up see wife give sedative something for be terribly upset over affair in next place want to tell that have agreed to take advice in matter to bring up two child a own until can make out of two be child then want advice a to whether can be weaned without damage to health wife be determined upon point will not be brought up by mr humphreys there be other woman be there in regiment with young baby doctor shook head there be one two with baby not with baby young enough for to take to must certainly be far better that must have natural nourishment say that must necessarily suffer from being weaned still see clinton there be question whether woman will consent to part with child quite see that doctor of course will be ready to make money arrangement will content must see husband if be doctor said be steady well conducted young fellow however matter have come about quite acquit of having share in think will find more easy to deal with than wife unfortunately see there be always difficulty with adopted child father can not sell away right may agree to do so if change mind afterwards can back out of agreement however may bind never to interfere with fact remains that have legal right to custody of child though sergeant humphreys might keep agreement might make mother might give end of trouble afterwards see doctor of two evil think one propose be least wife say must not bear to see woman about child have good deal of same feeling at rate in present state of health wish to spare trouble anxiety a much a can therefore be better to buy woman off for present even though may have to run risk of trouble with afterwards anyhow something must be done at once child have be squalling for last hour though believe that have have milk something given to so have better send across for humphreys sooner matter be got over better young sergeant presently appeared sit down sergeant want to have talk with over terribly painful business in one respect quite understand that be a painful for mr humphreys a be for in other respect be much better off than be not only do not know be child know be heir to estate be a will understand most serious matter can quite understand sir sergeant said quietly only plan can see captain clinton went on be that for present will adopt child will bring up a own probably in time one of will grow up with resemblance to mr clinton other will show likeness to wife in case must propose to finish education of boy then to provide for by putting into army such other profession a may choose for must be very unfair after bringing up educating a own to turn adrift thus see in case adoption of must be greatly to benefit can of course thoroughly understand that will be very hard for mr humphreys to give up child very hard be quite ready to make pecuniary arrangement with that may think right may say that think that must be desirable that mr humphreys must continue a nurse want to consider boy a own presence must be constantly bringing up unpleasant remembrance in second place think that must be better for that must not act a nurse must know that one of be own separation when came must be very much more painful than must be at present of course expect answer from just at moment will naturally wish to talk over with will be glad if will let have answer a soon a can a be necessary that must obtain nurse without loss of time what say seems to very fair captain clinton sergeant said must give anything sir that must have happened must rather have shot first can answer for sir that accept offer of course be sorry to lose child baby be not much to man till get to know begin to talk will be satisfaction to know that be in good hand with far better look out than must have given will see wife sir let know in hour do think that will consent humphreys be sure will sergeant said briefly then added there be nothing else must do saluting went out of room suspect wife of having done on purpose dr parker said speaking for first time since sergeant have entered room say know suspect did notice how decidedly said that must consent fancy up to now have have own way in everything well what do say mr humphreys asked a husband entered door told shortly offer have be made laughed scornfully likely thing so be to have child be not to be allowed even to see be to pick choose a to like to say be theirs be to be shouldered out of altogether be just a bad for not to know be boy a be for woman be to take whole settlement of thing in hand feeling to go for nothing of course told that must not let do thing did not tell anything of sort told that accepted proposal must answer for accepting too then be never more wrong in life john humphreys said angrily wo consent to anything of sort luck have thrown good thing in hand mean to make most of ought to get enough out of to make comfortable for life if work well did not think that be soft soft not soft be going to be done a propose husband said doggedly be burden enough a be have lost child not care so very much about there will be time enough for more child add to comfort of close little quarter like whether like not have lost child in next place will never hear end of in regiment will see if can not manage to get transferred to there will be standing talk there will be let talk wife said scornfully what do care about talk care great deal said tell why because know what will say be true what do mean asked quickly mean jane know mixed up child on purpose how dare say so exclaimed making step forward a if must strike will tell why say so because went to drawer morning before going to parade saw of mr clinton baby night gown in yes see be in wash tub now be there morning when heard say have put child into one of baby night gown because have clean one of own knew that be lying that have done on purpose woman be silent moment then burst out be greater fool than ever thought did tell lie when gave reason for putting child into baby gown when took two clean one out of drawer did not notice until put on that be ours then thought be not worth while changing again just a child have got quiet comfortable then when found what have happened in morning have to make excuse other occurred to a best when came back did put into wash tub clean dirty in case one must come here to see about what harm be there in must like to know have acknowledged have told one lie over after that may say what like need not expect to believe well why go at once tell that believe that changed child on purpose because in first place can not prove because in second case be wife jane took for better worse have done be not for to round on anyhow will do can to set matter straight only way that see can be set straight be by doing a captain clinton say by letting have two child until grow up then see of two be like be like do want done suppose want to have care of suppose want to get paid for letting keep to have man woman in regiment asking question who sold child what be do want want to go a nurse well then can not do be evident that mr clinton hate sight of wonder wo have at price have best be contented with what have got what have got asked sullenly well have got trouble of child off hand have got knowledge that will be well taken care of provided for made gentleman of ought to be satisfaction to anyhow what be when might make nice little fortune out of can see way of making fortune said unless do know be offer to tell if will pay for in case instead of making fortune must be likely to find inside prison for year serve right woman be silent for time then said very well then will agree to term mind will make money out of yet so sergeant humphreys went across to captain clinton bungalow told that wife agreed to give up child be by far best thing for little chap whichever may be will be able to do deal more for than ever must wife did not quite see matter at first have come round to way of thinking sir want to be paid a captain clinton be about to speak a long a be fit for service want nothing day perhaps when get past service may ask to give job a lodge keeper such post where can earn living so matter be settled one of other officer wife have already lent ayah to take care of child until one must be found for ready manner in sergeant humphreys have done only thing in power to obviate effect of wife carelessness restored at once to good opinion of fellow sergeant men a be generally allowed that have done right thing that one must do more opinion however be le favourable a to wife be soon evident to who lived in non commissioned officer quarter that thing be not going on well between sergeant humphreys wife there be frequent violent quarrel sergeant be often down at canteen drinking more than be good for one day captain clinton sent for sergeant be sorry to say that hear from sergeant major that be drunk last night that have several time be worse for liquor be not formal complaint thought better to talk to have always be very steady man must be sorry in extreme if thing must happen must cause to be brought before colonel have doubt affair have troubled greatly that be entirely owing to that that have become unsettled try to pull round man know that nobody attribute slightest shadow of blame to in matter thank sir be coming to see if have sent for to say that wished to give up stripe return to rank know will be degraded if do of own free will must rather go down than be sent down what will wife do must be great change to humphreys wife have made up mind to go home sir think be best thing can do will never be comfortable in regiment to say truth be not comfortable together say that have friend in england will go stay with think be best to let go must rather cut hand off than ask for thing for myself a be sure that be for best that must go a hear of invalid woman going home at present must be very much obliged if must lend twenty pound have got thirty laid by fifty will be enough to send across by rail to bombay pay passage home leave twenty pound in hand when get there will pay off so much month be welcome to twenty pound without talk of repayment humphreys must take hasty step if be if wife have have quarrel may change mind in day two think better of sir think be pretty well agreed on point that have best go home people make mistake sometimes think made mistake when got married anyhow have agreed that be best to part for time accordingly three four day later mr humphreys left agra for bombay be seen more in regiment sergeant humphreys gave up stripe returned to rank for two year remained there after wife have left gradually gave up habit into have fallen at end of two year again became non commissioned officer be never heard to speak of wife after left so far a comrade knew did ever receive letter from soon after have again got stripe regiment returned to england month later captain clinton sent in paper retired from service chapter ii at cheltenham everything packed ready boy yes father think so dog cart will be at door at eleven be sure be ready in time wo do to miss train know well have have pleasant holiday time have very boy replied together have be awfully jolly one went on trip in brittany be certainly best thing have done though have always enjoyed holiday be ever so much nicer going to out of way sort of place stopping at jolly little inn without crowd fuss than being in great swiss hotel a be last year where one be english one have to be in at regular time almost fight to get something to eat hope next year will be able to take to norway a be saying yesterday must think must be just same sort of thing a brittany only of course different sort of scenery different language different people madge will have to set to get up norse to act a interpreter be very lazy boy have to do talking in brittany be supposed to have learnt french longer than have oh yes supposed nobody care about french lesson make difference in place in school so one take trouble to grind at well come along let take turn round place for hour before start two boy madge who be year junior went out through french window into garden captain clinton walked to window looked after be lad father might be proud of straight well built handsome english lad of about sixteen rupert be somewhat taller than edgar while latter have slightly advantage in breadth of shoulder beyond fact that have brown hair gray eye there be marked likeness between school fellow often wondered that there must not be more similarity between twin have pleasant open face be equally popular among school fellow a to be cleverest there be mean of ascertaining for although be at cheltenham together one be on modern other on classical side captain clinton having made arrangement purposely in order that there must be rivalry between unpleasantness sometimes arises when two brother be at same school one be more clever than other be thereby obviated rupert be more lively of two generally did largest share of talking when be together edgar although talked le have more lively sense of humour laughter broke out in garden be caused by quiet remark of captain clinton turned sharply round upon hearing sigh from wife well lucy know what be thinking holiday over be nearer to truth own plan have failed so far for ca see in of boy shadow of resemblance to myself people profess to see likeness mr tomline remarked yesterday that must have known rupert anywhere a son then colonel wilson said day before edgar have got just expression see scrap of likeness way begin to think dear want to see want to see percy love one a well a other still must like to know be own used to think so too lucy have be doubting for time about now be quite sure want to know be fine lad a say love one just a well a other parental instinct see go for nothing must like to know one of be son on other hand must be very sorry to know that other be think dear that be much better a be have got two son instead of one after idea that there must be great satisfaction in real one inheriting landed property have very little in there be plenty for of will be just a happy on three thousand year a must on six a matter stand now have divided property a nearly a possible equally between madge of course will have share have left in will that will draw lot will have part with house park on while other be to have sum of money sufficient to build equally good house on share of estate can only hope chance will be wiser than will give old house to right boy however whether son adopted son whichever be get doe not concern greatly there be enough for son to hold good position be comfortable happy beyond trouble at rate grievance if there be grievance be sentimental one while must be matter of real grief to must either of after having always looked upon a parent come to know that doe not belong to that have be along in false position have be in fact interloper here must be terribly hard for so hard have ceased to wish that matter must ever be cleared up to dread rather than hope must discover unmistakable likeness to of in one other of be right percy henceforth will worry more about must be hard dreadfully hard on of to know that be not son henceforth will like try to give up wishing must tell be hope will never get to know that there be doubt about be afraid can hardly hope that captain clinton said there be too many people who know story of course be talked about at station in india at time know that even about here be generally known will be better day other to tell ourselves making of course light of matter letting see that regard equally a son love care for alike that even if now knew truth must make difference in feeling towards be much better must learn from than from anyone else at eleven o'clock dog cart came to door boy be ready captain clinton drove to station four mile away in two hour after leaving home arrived at cheltenham with large number of school fellow of whom have be in train when entered while others have joined at gloucester at cheltenham there be scramble for vehicle be soon at boarding house of mr river smith have reputation of being most comfortable of cheltenham boarding house there be din of voice

anticipation a to effect of want of weight in football team be speedily verified trial match be almost lost team being fairly borne down by superior weight of opponent there be general exasperation at disaster for river smith house have for year stood high to be beaten in match after match be trying indeed skinner took matter terribly to heart be in chronic state of disgust fury a easton observed to edgar clinton skinner be becoming positively dangerous be like scotch terrier with sore ear snap at one who come near still be annoying edgar who thoroughly sympathized with skinner said well yes be annoying be annoyed take good deal to annoy think ought to do thing well seems to that have be doing can edgar said be sure have for be only yesterday skinner be holding up a example to of said ought to be ashamed of yourselves why look at lazy beggar easton work a hard a whole lot of put together if be not for must say have better chuck altogether ' observe skinner have be little more civil to lately easton said yes do best object to whole thing if one doe play one doe not like being beaten think have better have talk over matter together be always talking over matter edgar objected fellow who have chance of turning out well have be tried be sure play up well together one say that be beaten just because can not stand rush that afternoon house be badly beaten by greenites in trial match a there be special rivalry between green river smith disgust not only of member of team of whole house be very great seven of senior met after tea in skinner study to discus situation see thing to be done skinner said after various possible change in team have be discussed be not play want be weight greenites must average at least stone half heavier than do have nothing to say against playing simply can not stand against go down like nine pin suppose will lose match season see use in talking more about suppose one have anything further to suggest well yes have few word to say easton who have be sitting on table have hitherto not opened lip remarked in quiet voice well say away seems to easton went on without paying regard to snappishness of skinner tone though can not make ourselves heavier weight be not after only thing think might make up for by last when fellow be going to row race content with practice set to train hard seems to that if be to go into strict training get thoroughly fit ought to make lot of difference might lose goal in first half of play if be in good training ought to get pull in second half by playing up knew at first pumping a much a possible training ought to tell know skinner always said ought to keep ourselves in good condition mean more than mean strict training getting up early going for three four mile run morning taking run in afternoon cutting off pudding sort of thing going in for heart soul be use training unless one doe thing thoroughly well one must try skinner said there be reason why one must train for football just a one doe for rowing running be last fellow must have expected to hear such proposal from easton if be ready to do be sure one else will be there be cordial exclamation of assent from others well of course will be horrible nuisance easton said regretfully if one doe go in for thing of sort seems to that must be done thoroughly besides be very annoying just at ticklish point of game when must give anything to be able to catch fellow ahead of with ball to find that lung have given out that have cupful of wind left believe easton that be downright humbug scudamore said that while pretend to hate anything like exertion be just a fond of a skinner be well at rate skinner broke in will try easton suggestion from to night team will go into strict training will see river smith now get leave for to go out at six o'clock morning will settle about afternoon work afterwards of course pudding must be given up there must be buying cake thing of sort new bread potato must be given up must agree never to touch anything to drink between meal will try thing thoroughly will be month before play next match with green if can beat care so much about others there be two three house must have chance with if be to train a fine a university eight rest of team be at once informed of determination have be arrived at have emanated only from skinner several of member might have protested against hardship of going into training for football fact that easton have proposed weighed with if be ready to take such trouble over matter one else must reasonably object consequence be that although not without good deal of grumbling at being got up before daylight whole team turned out in flannel two thick jersey punctually at six o'clock here be egg half cupful of milk for of skinner said a gathered below look sharp beat up egg with milk here be mouthful of biscuit for river smith said did not like going out without taking something before started cornish who rowed in trial at cambridge told that egg milk be best thing to take five minute later comforted by egg milk party started want to go at racing speed skinner said merely good steady trot to make lung play want to pull down in weight think after last month work have fat among what want be wind last to morrow will turn out with heaviest boot have got instead of running shoe when can run four mile in ought to be able to keep up pretty fairly through hardest game of football there be good deal of lagging behind towards last part of run fact that skinner pointed out triumphantly a proof of want of condition after wash change of clothes party agreed that felt better for run mr river smith be a much concerned a boy at defeat of house at football when sat down to breakfast member of team found that mutton chop be provided for of strict order have be issued that nothing be to be said outside house of football team going into training a for afternoon exercise be only necessary that member of team must take part in football practice play up to utmost matter remained secret in first two three match played training made apparent difference must not be disheartened at mr cornish who be housemaster told fellow always get weak when first begin to train will find benefit presently be case won fourth match be against comparatively weak team however encouraged be victorious in next two contest although in second opponent be considered strong team victory have be regarded a certain improvement in river smithites team became topic of conversation in college there be rumour that have put into regular training that one have seen come in in body at seven in morning after having be for run challenge cup match be now at hand a happened be drawn to meet greenites match be regarded with special interest throughout school rivalry between two house be notorious although greenites scoffed at idea of being defeated by team have before so easily beaten great improvement latter have made gave promise that struggle must be exceptionally severe one skinner have for day before looked after team with extreme vigilance scarcely letting one of out of sight lest might eat forbidden thing in other way transgress rule laid down may not win admitted a talked over prospect on evening before match at rate will have work cut out to beat know be very confident of course weight be tremendously in favour now mind must press a hard a can for first game never leave for single moment be sure to get savage when find have not got own way will help to pump will have more left in second half than will then will be chance tactic be followed out from first game be played with exceptional spirit on side a greenites failed even by most determined rush to carry ball into opponent goal game became a skinner have predicted more more savage sympathy of school be for most part with river smith loud shout of applause encouragement with gallant defence of goal be greeted added to irritation of greenites when half play be called neither party have scored point a changed side be evident that tremendous pace have told upon party now be time skinner said to team be more done than be training will tell more more minute keep up hard when see chance make big rush carry down to end greenites be equally determined in spite of effort of opponent kept ball at end of field then skinner got made rush one of heaviest of greenites charged down upon at full speed be encountered by easton before reached two rolled over together river smithites backed up leader well be more than half way down ground before greenites have arrested progress then there be close scrimmage for time mass swayed backwards forward here weight counted for more than wind greenites be pushing opponent back when ball rolled out from mass edgar clinton picked up be off with in moment dodging through who attempted to check course be down near greenites goal before two of threw upon together friend be close behind after desperate scrimmage ball be driven behind greenite goal loose play followed greenite who have ball threw forward to one of own team who caught started running river smithites shouted dead ball dead ball claimed point holder of ball without heeding shout ran right through followed by rest of team touched down behind river smith goal ball be then brought out goal kicked time river smithites have not moved from behind greenite goal have remained there awaiting result of appeal to umpire who now at once decided in favour not satisfied with greenites appealed to referee who confirmed decision of umpire too angry to be reasonable captain refused to continue game called upon team to leave field be going when derisive shout of looker on caused again to alter intention game be renewed there be ten minute yet remaining for time game be played with fury caused to be long memorable in annals of cheltenham football weight strength must not prevail over superior last coolness of defender of river smith goal attempt be beaten off rush met a point have be added to score when time be called umpire decided that game have be won by river smithites by one touch down to nothing captain of greenites appealed from umpire referee decision to football committee of college who gave against then appealed to rugby union who decided that umpire decision be perfectly right victory thus remained beyond further contention with river smithites chapter iii gone bravo clinton well done indeed so shouted one of big boy score of others joined in in chorus be clinton woman who be standing looking on at game asked one of younger

like so much must of course have be very grieved that be not father mother that rupert madge be not brother sister must have be nobody fault be sure that must all still have loved to know that have be wicked fraud have be impostor palmed upon that there have be plot conspiracy to rob have mother who not only did who must propose to to go on deceiving even to join in fresh fraud to swindle rupert be so awful that there be nothing for to do to go away feel sure will all be sorry that though be not son must go on treating a if be younger brother of rupert must not bear father must not accept anything from for must feel that be result of wicked fraud that be what woman can not call mother have schemed for to get day when have made way when may not hurt so horribly a seems to do now will come see if will let to thank for love kindness must never have be mine will not be till be in position when can want nothing for feel now that be dying of hunger must not accept crust from hand for if did so must feel be party to abominable fraud god bless dearest father mother rupert madge unhappy edgar chapter iv back at school be long time after have with many break read edgar letter to end before rupert madge must compose sufficiently to accompany father into drawing room again broke down when met mother be not until captain clinton said come must pull together see what be to be done talk whole matter over calmly by great effort recovered composure now in first place must try to find edgar have got twenty four hour start of be not very much suppose think rupert that there be doubt that went up to town by night train have doubt that got away in time to do so father of course might have gone by down train pass through gloucester somewhere about same time think likely that did that rupert must say be sure to go to london be almost always goal people make for unless be in case of boy who want to go to sea when must make for liverpool other port think edgar be likely to do think have special fancy for sea so may assume that have gone to london what money have have that five pound note sent three day ago father to clear off tick have to pay journey home be what meant when said ' have taken note know wo grudge ' think have about pound left be about what have know when note came said that money have be enough to last to end of term so must have five pound note untouched when got to london if driven to must get must think six seven pound for watch chain must give enough to keep little time if have be couple of year older must say that must probably enlist at once a have made up mind to go into army although lad do enlist under proper age recruiting officer doctor must pas a being eighteen first thing to do will be to advertise for in first place to advertise offering reward for information a to whereabouts in second place advertising to direct begging to come home must never come father rupert said looking at letter captain clinton still held in hand must depend how advertised suppose be to say betatement of woman not believed be in a much doubt a before ' others looked up in intense surprise oh father how must say that rupert exclaimed oh if must say so must be quite quite content to know that of might be son must not matter so much if felt that loved equally how must say so because rupert captain clinton said gravely still think there be great ground for doubt do really father oh be pleased think yes be sure must bear now to know edgar be real son not must be so different to learn from lip to know that love still instead of hearing in dreadful way edgar did how do doubt father seemed to from reading letter so certain do really doubt percy mr clinton asked do indeed lucy will give reason in first place woman left india few week after affair certainly must not have seen child until returned to england so far a know have never seen since if have seen never can have spoken to come in sort of contact with therefore can not possibly have known be when saw at cheltenham rupert say that be there more than week met upon possible occasion stared hard at be evident therefore that be for time doubtful doubt be doing what used to do trying to detect resemblance now if in year with boy constantly watching way listening to voice must detect resemblance be extremely improbable that be able to do so from merely seeing score of time walking in street say that be impossible must have done so only say be extremely improbable think much more likely that finding must see resemblance determined to speak to first whom might happen to find alone there be mark father rupert said yes there be mark mr clinton repeated did not know have mark rupert wonder never noticed lucy be very tiny one father never noticed indeed can hardly see before glass for be rather at back of shoulder until edgar noticed one day be not larger than head of good sized pin be little dark brown mole perhaps be smaller lighter when be baby must have be there then must not have known about be so rupert mere fact that be there doe not in way prove that be son just see what edgar say about in letter remember woman must not have known of boy have mark that did not know be to say that have not recognized likeness appears from edgar letter be what say said that one of have small mole on shoulder knew that rupert have tiny mole there said be mark by knew son from hers suppose edgar have replied 'yes have mark on shoulder ' might not have said be mark by can distinguish son from of captain clinton others be silent then mr clinton said know percy wish to prove that one more than other of boy be ours naturally woman must wish to benefit own boy if have be own boy who have mark why must not have told edgar that have made mistake that be rupert who be son suppose lucy that cared in slightest be son main object of course be to extort money edgar doe not say anything at about of course at first must try make out that be ready to sacrifice for must scarcely say that expected to make handsome allowance when came into property have doubt be motive well see have already begun with edgar suppose said that have made mistake rupert be son edgar must have gone in told must probably have telegraphed to so must get to rupert before woman saw must have known then that story must have be upset altogether court of law must attach weight to what might say must have to stand confessed a having be concerned in gross fraud with having lied at first unless be in position to produce corroborative evidence to prove that child have mark word must go for nothing now feel sure that must produce such evidence mark be almost invisible one for be never afterwards noticed have shown to of woman of acquaintance must have come forward when change of child took place have pointed out that child must be easily distinguished inasmuch a child have peculiar mark feel sure that even husband knew nothing about mark for believe be party to fraud be terribly upset by whole business took to drink afterwards there be continual quarrel between wife left went to england believe if must have pointed out be child be own must have done so certainly must have attached little weight to woman story if have come here with must have turned out of house have told to go to court if dare claim custody of son must have known weakness of own position a say having once opened matter to edgar determined to stick to knowing that boy taken thus on sudden must be likely to believe whereas if said that be son must find already prepared probably have to confront too so see rupert can truthfully advertise 'woman story not believed be in a much doubt a before be regarded by a son be glad father rupert exclaimed excitedly oh if edgar have written to first instead of going straight away must have be better captain clinton said can not blame think be natural that must go a did must have thought have written to must have seemed a if wanted something from anything must have seemed better to than however must set about doing something at once will go by nine o'clock local to swindon on by night mail to town then will set detective at work may find out from porter if anyone noticed lad arrive by night mail morning will draw up carefully worded advertisement will write to mr river smith before start what must like rupert to go back to morrow to stay away until end of term if take advice will go back must be pity for to miss examination think must get through examination father with on mind besides what must say to fellow about edgar going away see if find before next term begin need say nothing about must have to account for having run away rupert anyhow think have better go back boy tell fact of story there be not slightest discredit in must be better for edgar that must be known that went under influence of mistake than sort of reason must be assigned for absence there will of course be occasion to go into full detail must tell story of confusion arose a to child say that edgar have received information led erroneously to conclude that problem be solved that be not son that therefore have run away so a to avoid receiving further benefit from mistake have be made perhaps must be best father indeed know what must do if be to stop here now with nothing to do to worry about be sure will be best rupert will tell master will return to morrow afternoon captain clinton went up to town by night mail in morning went to private detective office after giving particular of edgar age appearance went on a have luggage with there be nothing particular about personal appearance consider altogether useless to search for in london think possible that may try to enlist sixteen be too young for to take unless look good deal older than be yes quite see that at same time be only thing occurs to a likely for to try not likely to take to sea sir not at likely from what know of fancy still might do for couple of year with view to enlisting afterwards how about going to state canada again be quite possible have money with sir have about five pound in pocket gold watch chain that have only have few month must must think get seven eight pound for see what must do to get living if went abroad sir then young gent always have sort of fancy that can get on well out there if mind what turn to fancy most of can be in trouble sir will excuse asking young chap who get into trouble generally act in different sort of way to one who have gone out what may call venturesome no have got into trouble captain clinton said have gone away under misunderstanding there be nothing whatever to make wish to conceal beyond fact that will do can to prevent tracing at present here be dozen of photo if want more can get struck off must do with half dozen man said will send down to men who act with at southampton hull liverpool glasgow plymouth will send two three abroad might cross over to bremen hamburg good many go way now will look after recruiting office here a be only sixteen a say doe not look older think there be chance of trying that recruiting sergeant must take up sir must say that if have friend can go to chance be will try to ship for state canada what be to do if find captain clinton have not thought of of course man went on if gave authority for to send down to of agent must take step to stop captain clinton said after pause during have be thinking that a must not swear that edgar be son be in fact powerless in matter wish that done have idea whatever of coercing want if possible to see converse with before go if be not possible if be not found until just a ship be sailing then want agent to wire to name of steamer in go port to sail then if there be faster steamer going might be there a soon a be if not must wish to telegraph to private detective firm across water suppose must do to have somebody to meet steamer a came in without knowing to keep under eye until arrive must manage sir easily enough will send off four of photograph at once to port others a soon a get will go down with other photograph to recruiting office arrange with one of sergeant engaged there to let know if turn up will send man down to dock to watch ship there will send off other photo directly get there be nothing else for captain clinton to do before returned home wrote out series of advertisement left at office of principal paper ran a follows if ec who left cheltenham suddenly will return home will find that have acted under misapprehension woman story be untrustworthy be still regarded a son by pc lc having done drove to paddington went down by afternoon train rupert arrived at cheltenham just a others have sat down to tea hullo clinton back again eh glad to see rupert nodded reply to greeting heart be too full to speak dropped into seat be accustomed to use others moving up closely to make room for significant glance passed between boy saw that edgar be not with guessed that there be something wrong there have be good deal of wonder among at clinton sudden disappearance although several of boy have seen rupert go into brother dormitory none have seen edgar somehow other leaked out that rupert have started in cab to station alone there have be good deal of quiet talk among senior about agreed that there be something strange about matter especially a robert when questioned on subject have replied that mr river smith order be that be to say nothing about a precautionary measure order be given to junior that word about clinton absence be to be said outside house after tea be over rupert went up to pinkerton pinkerton must like to have talk with easton two three others skinner mossop templer yes scudamore just a like clinton of course if like to tell anything will be glad to hear know that brother be not sort of fellow to get into dishonourable sort of scrape can promise will ask question if must rather keep matter altogether to must rather tell rupert said know none of must think that edgar must have done anything wrong sort of story be certain to go about must rather that truth of matter be known be six head fellow of house when have told story can do a like about going further well if go up to study pinkerton said will bring others up in three four minute party be gathered there look here clinton easton said pinkerton say have told that be sure that whatever be about brother have done nothing need be ashamed about must like to say same thing if be painful for to tell say anything about will be quite content to know that have left if have left although hope will see again next term for good reason other must rather tell rupert said be curious story very unpleasant one for there be nothing at for to be ashamed about went on to tell whole story ending with see whether edgar be son of captain clinton of sergeant scheming wife be more than can say doe not matter bit to easton said breaking silence of surprise with have listened to story like brother for yourselves doe not matter rap to a far a can see to anyone else who father mother be call horribly hard line for skinner put in deuced hard line especially for brother pinkerton said by what say captain clinton wife care now be real son one be real other adopted a regard in same light even want to know be well now know that seems to be right anyhow see brother did know when woman told be mother that whole thing have be preconcerted plot on part can quite understand going straight away think must have done same if have have same story told to have seen be intended to be party to fraud of sort well be glad told think there be occasion for story to go further certainly not easton agreed must do good whatever of course must never be kept in house must come to be talk of whole school need be said be that clinton have told reason of brother leaving so suddenly that be of opinion that acted perfectly rightly in doing so that nothing more be to be said about matter will give clinton word of honour not to give slightest hint to anyone about to say that be curious story anything of sort just to stick to that have heard about be perfectly satisfied that will certainly be best plan pinkerton agreed think must be a well for to say have left for family reason that be nothing in way connected with that hope that will be back again next term yes might say that easton agreed family reason mean sort of thing anyone can take choice out of well clinton must worry over more than can help daresay edgar will be found in day two at rate may be sure that harm have come to be likely to come to if emigrates anything of sort be pretty safe to make way be sure that whatever be doing will always be gentleman good fellow that will mossop said cordially hope must have done a have under same circumstance must be big temptation to fellow to have alternative of good fortune nice estate on one side of going out into world making own living how can on other there be chorus of assent yes easton said be very easy to say 'do what be right never mind what come of ' must find very hard to follow in practice if have choice like before well tell brother when hear of clinton that think better of than before that whether be sergeant son captain will welcome heartily back be proud to shake hand so be settled to great disappointment of rest of house clue be forthcoming a to cause of edgar clinton leaving so suddenly a monitor senior seemed perfectly satisfied with what have heard be evident to others whatever cause might be be not to blame in matter during short time remained of term rupert got on better than have expected while examination be going on easton invited to do work in private study gave advice a to passage likely to be set coached up in difficult point came out higher in form than have expected to do three day before school broke up easton said clinton have have letter from father morning will be very glad if will come down to spend holiday at place so will there be very good hunting round father have plenty of horse in stable expect will be rather gay for brother come of age in week after christmas there be going to be ball so on know how feel about must say that must be better for than being at home where everything will call brother to mind being there will make worse for others be very much obliged to easton must like very much will write off to governor at once hear what say might like to have home possibly might be useful in search for edgar a have told feel sure that have enlisted must be certain to change name must be use anyone who did not know going to look at recruit agreed clinton that one must enlist at age be altogether too old to go a band boy yes know be what worry more than anything still can not help thinking that will try how to get into army if ca believe will do anything can to get living until enlist think can anyhow pas a eighteen clinton if be for anything else might get up with false moustache something see have got to pas strict examination by surgeon have heard that lot of fellow do enlist under age then fellow look good bit older than be believe doctor must be humbugged into believing that edgar be anything like eighteen well will write to father afternoon hear what say if think can not do good want at home will be very pleased to come to captain clinton letter came by return of post said that be very pleased rupert have have invitation must keep away have received news whatever of edgar think that must be of use for to join in search for there be saying where may have gone what may be doing agree with that will most likely take job offer to keep until can enlist arrangement have be made with one of staff sergeant at head quarter of recruiting in london to let know if young fellow answering to edgar description come up to be medically examined so will catch if present there unfortunately there be number of recruiting depot over country that there be saying where may try to enlist be if doe try however at present there be certainly nothing can do must like to have home mother say must like too do think that for sake be better must not come a long a be away there be nothing to recall at moment fact that edgar have gone whereas if be here absence must be constantly be before be quite ill with anxiety dr wilkinson agrees with that change be most desirable be sure must not hear of going away if be at home must give good excuse for staying here when hears that be not coming think may be able to persuade to listen to wilkinson opinion in case will take madge down to nice at once if can get there by christmas so much better for christmas at home must be terribly trying to once be there can wander about for two three month in italy spain across to algeria egypt anything to distract mind accordingly rupert accepted easton invitation went with to father in leicestershire have not be for uncertainty about edgar must have enjoyed holiday greatly although have always joined to certain extent in chaff of school fellow at easton care about dress little peculiarity of manner have never shared in skinner prejudice against always said that must do anything well that chose to turn hand to have appreciated readiness to do kindness to anyone who really needed have be turn now friendly companionship of elder boy have be of greatest value to easton have never said much in way of sympathy indeed must have jarred rupert feeling kindness have said more than word must do rupert a looked back felt ashamed at thought that have often joined in laugh about at home point have seemed peculiar at school be unnoticeable scrupulous attention to dress have there be in strong contrast to general carelessness of others in respect seemed natural in own house where there be good many guest staying rupert edgar have always be more particular at home than at school easton be same indeed rupert thought that be if anything le particular now than have be at river smith week after christmas rupert received letter from father written at nice saying that letter from edgar have be forwarded on from home giving brief word in lad said that be well that might be under uneasiness respecting doe not tell much captain clinton went on be very pleased inasmuch a seems that edgar doe not mean altogether to drop out of sight will hope write from time to time to let know at rate be well letter have london post mark of course show nothing may have be written anywhere sent to anyone perhaps to waiter at hotel at stopped in london with whom have arranged to post letter that might inclose to letter have greatly cheered mother who in spite of must say have hitherto have dread edgar in distress might have done something rash have never thought so for instant trust two boy be not only too well principled too brave to act coward part might befall mother of course agreed with in theory while admitted that edgar must never if in sens do thing urged that distress might be so great that must not be responsible for what be doing happily morbid idea have be dissipated by arrival of letter have great hope now that will rouse will shake off state of silent brooding have be causing so much anxiety be morning that received letter already look brighter more like than have done since brought news of edgar disappearance news enabled rupert to enjoy remainder of holiday much more than have done first fortnight edgar have be accustomed to ride since have be child have in christmas holiday for year accompanied father to hunting field at first upon pony previous winter on two light weight carrying horse have bought specially for mr easton have several hunter rupert who be well mounted thoroughly enjoyed hunting returned to school with nerve braced up ready for work wo say anything against easton again skinner said when heard from rupert how pleasant holiday have be made for noticed how took to made thing smooth for last ten day of term fully meant to tell be sorry have not understood better before only in first place never happened to have good opportunity in second place know that ever tried to make one however will tell now be not pleasant thing to be obliged to own that have behaved badly be good deal more unpleasant to feel not have pluck to say so accordingly next time easton came into senior study skinner went up to said easton want to tell that be uncommonly sorry have set against because have be more particular about dress thing than rest of because did not seem a keen a be about football thing know have behaved like as must like to be friend now if will let certainly will skinner easton said taking hand held out know that be altogether fault people at home be rather particular about being tidy that sort of thing when came here of rather made fun of about think that stuck to more because annoyed will be going up for sandhurst term be very glad to be on good term with fellow before leave so let say anything more about with shake of hand agreement to be friend be ratified term between christmas easter be always dullest of year house match at football be over although game be sometimes played there be languid interest in paper chase be leading incident in term there be general looking forward to spring weather when cricket must begin team commence practice for match of following term easton be going up in summer for examination for line be not troubling specially about indeed getting in be regarded a certainty for mr southley have said that must be safe for indian civil if chose to try considered great pity that be going up for so comparatively easy competition a for line occasionally went for walk with rupert while chatting with frequently about edgar be continually urging not to let thought dwell too much upon to stick to work watch at various port have long since be given up for have edgar intended to emigrate must certainly have done so very shortly after arrival in london a mean must not have permitted to make stay there think be very thoughtful of edgar easton said one day when rupert told that have heard from father that letter have arrived so many fellow when run away emigrate anything of sort drop writing altogether seem to give thought to anxiety at home be feeling for be evidently determined that will go own way accept help from people under circumstance can quite enter into feeling see doe not wish to be anxious troubled about think there be anything for to worry about clinton may be having hardish time of still be doubt getting living somehow other know that will do harm think be sort of fellow to make way in line take up though what have learnt here may not be of much use to at start having have good education be sure to be of advantage to afterwards fellow who must hold own in tussle such a have with greenites last term can be trusted to make good fight in anything at rate be of use worrying about see will be going up in year time for examination for line will have to stick to pretty steadily if be to get through at first trial wo help matter worrying about wherever be whatever be doing be sure to keep eye on list will feel just a much pleasure in seeing name there a must have done if have be here with so must say work steadily play steadily have good chance of being in college boat next term shooting will give enough to do be use sticking to too hard be telling skinner yesterday will regularly addle brain if keep on grinding a be doing now be of use talking to skinner when mind be set on thing can think of nothing else last term be football now be reading must be awful nuisance to be a energetic a be can not see why must not take life comfortably must say rupert laughed can not see why must do thing by fit start a do easton ah do on principle easton argued be for taking quietly only sometimes one get stirred up have to throw one self into thing one doe know one feel nuisance unfair wear tear of system system doe not seem to suffer seriously easton might if one be called upon to do thing often be time for to turn back will be late for tea chapter v enlisted edgar have found little difficulty in getting out from house have timed so a to arrive at station just before train left for gloucester taking ticket have slipped into empty carriage at gloucester there be hour to wait before up train came in time got into carriage with several other people did not want to spend night thinking a long a fellow passenger talked resolutely kept attention fixed on what be saying then when one after other composed for sleep sat with eye closed thinking over school day have already while lay tossing on bed thought over revelation have heard from point of view have exhausted subject must not allow thought to return to now fought football match of greenites over again in fancy seemed to that be event have taken place long time back quite in dim distance be wondering vaguely over when too fell asleep did not wake up until train arrived at paddington be with feeling of satisfaction that stepped out on to platform now there be something to do be too early yet to see about lodging went to little coffee house be already open for use of workman have breakfast there then walked about for two three hour until london be astir leaving thing at coffee house then went to pawnbroker pawned watch chain then having fetched thing from coffee house went into edgware road took omnibus down to victoria then walked on across vauxhall bridge set to work to look for lodging be not long in finding bed room to let here installed be convinced captain clinton must have vigilant search made for thought that be now fairly safe however sharp detective might be in hunt for felt deeply sorrow there must be at home for knew that up to now rupert have be loved equally that even discovery that have have no right to care kindness have received must make great difference in feeling towards have change of child be really result of accident must not have acted a have done have have hand in fraud be to accept anything now from captain clinton felt that must be accessary to have not mother own mother proposed that must take part in plot that must go on deceiving even that must rob rupert altogether of inheritance be too horrible to think of there be nothing for that must see for to go out utterly from life to fight way alone until must at rate show that needed nothing must accept nothing be dimly conscious that be acting unkindly unfairly to that after have done for have right to have say a to future at present pride be too hurt be too sore humiliated to listen to whisper of conscience sole thought be to hide to make own way in world lest resolution must be shaken carefully abstained from perusal of paper lest eye might fall upon advertisement begging to return mind be made up that must enlist knew that at present must not do so a private thought that might be accepted a trumpeter thought probable that must guess that such be intention must have given description of at recruiting office be for reason that determined to live a long a must upon money before trying to enlist a if time elapsed must be le likely to be recognized a answering description might be given by captain clinton than if made attempt at once from vauxhall often crossed to westminster soon struck up acquaintance with of recruiting sergeant want to enlist eh one of said be thinking of entering a trumpeter well might do that there be plenty of younger lad than be trumpeter in cavalry will look at list see what regiment have vacancy doubt whether will take without letter from father saying that be enlisting with consent have father that know of edgar said well then be likely will want certificate from clergyman schoolmaster a to character expect sergeant said shrewdly must have difficulty in getting such paper edgar nodded well lad if have quite made up mind about advice must be try here in london be lot more particular than be down in country must say be good deal more likely to rub through at aldershot canterbury than must be here be more particular here see have great interest in filling up rank of regiment while when go to regiment doctor officer of like seeing up to full strength so interest be to pas recruit if can have known score hundred of men rejected here tramp down to aldershot take train if have money enough in pocket to pay fare get passed without shadow of difficulty must rather not enlist for next month two edgar said there might be somebody asking after if will take advice lad will go back to friend there be many young fellow run away from home most of be precious sorry for afterwards be not likely to be sorry for sergeant if be will not go back do think must find anyone who must give lesson on trumpet must say that there must not be difficulty about there be nothing can not have in london if have got money to pay for if be to go up to albany barrack get hold of trumpet major must tell who must teach must not do daresay of trumpeter must be glad to give hour day if can pay for of course must save lot of trouble afterwards if must sound trumpet before joined took advice found trumpeter in blue who agreed to go out with for hour day on to primrose hill there teach to sound trumpet accordingly gave up room at vauxhall moved across to north side of regent park for six week worked for hour day with instructor who upon depositing pound with a guarantee for return borrowed trumpet for with edgar must start of morning walking seven eight mile into country spend hour in eliciting most mournful startling sound from instrument at end of six week money be nearly gone although have lived most economically accordingly after returning trumpet to instructor who although have be by mean chary of abuse while lesson be going on now admitted that have got on first rate went down to aldershot where friend recruiting sergeant have told that be short of trumpeter two in st hussar be a well that edgar have allowed two month to pas before endeavouring to enlist for after month have be vainly spent in search for rupert have suggested to father that although too young to enlist in rank edgar might have tried to go in a trumpeter inquiry have be made at recruiting depot whether lad answering to description have so enlisted sergeant have given note to sergeant of acquaintance in hussar put pretty strong young un friend have said when gave note mind stick to what say sergeant have indeed incited partly perhaps by liking for lad partly by desire to return equivalent for sovereign with edgar have presented drawn somewhat upon imagination have known young chap for very long time said father mother died year ago though be relation to look upon a guardian a be have learned trumpet bit will soon be able to sound call will make smart young soldier will expect take place in rank a soon a be old enough do best can for keep eye on will take round to trumpet major sergeant said have better go with to adjutant know what sergeant m'bride say in letter know exactly what say told must introduce to that must be sure do best to put through well have better hear what doe say be always awkward to have misunderstanding say have lost father mother understand that be right edgar said quietly that have known for very long time edgar nodded seems to very long time added that though be actual relation of yours considers stand in light of guardian be important know will remember that edgar said there be certainly no one a far a know who have better right than sergeant m'bride to advise give permission to enlist well stick to be right now come along wonder who young chap be sergeant said to a crossed barrack yard a to what m'bride said know about have be on recruiting staff think young un be speaking truth have lost father mother have known m'bride for time have got one who have right to interfere with rum too boy be gentleman over though have rigged out in clothes well be short of trumpeter suppose adjutant will inquire very closely trumpet major be quite willing to

at edgar critically smart young fellow said to got into scrape at home suppose run away of course have got up lie ready well sergeant what be lad wish to enlist a trumpeter sir here be letter from

matter further thought next day edgar be sworn in colonel hearing from adjutant that have questioned boy that there be impediment to enlisting passed without remark edgar be at once taken to regimental tailor measured for uniform hour later be marched out with four five of other trumpeter beyond confines of camp be there set to work at call work be by mean light be at once sent into riding school found very different thing to satisfy riding master sergeant than have be to learn to sit horse at home however previous practice in way rendered work much easier for than must otherwise have be be not very long in passing out from squad of recruit then have two three hour day of practice with trumpet hour day at gymnastics in afternoon two hour of school last item be however child play a soon a instructor saw that lad must without difficulty take first class employed in aiding to teach others evening be only time have to then if chose to take trouble to dress must go out into town stroll through camp take walk if disinclined for there be cavalry canteen with large concert room attached where entertainment be given by music hall singer brought down from london trumpeter bandsman have barrack room to edgar who have healthy appetite found food of very different description to to have be accustomed although up at six o'clock in morning even in winter a be there be nothing to eat until eight then there be mug of weak fluid called tea allowance of bread dinner be at one consisted of amount of meat scarcely sufficient for growing boy for although have allowance consisted entirely of flesh must have be ample be so largely reduced by amount of bone fat that meat be reduced to minimum however when eked out with potato bread sufficed well enough tea at six consisted like breakfast of mug of tea bread edgar found however that spartan breakfast tea must be supplemented by addition purchased at canteen here pennyworth of butter cheese bacon egg herring many similar luxury be obtainable two penny of pay be invariably spent on breakfast penny sufficing for addition to tea found that soon got on well with comrade be like going to fresh school there be

stripe at earliest possible opportunity knew well enough from what have heard captain clinton say that drink be curse of army that men although naturally sober steady be sometimes led into thereby lost chance of ever rising have never smoked be privation to to abstain from tobacco have therefore whole of pay after usual deduction for stoppage at disposal for food have always little in pocket to lend to comrade who have bad luck to be put on heavy stoppage by loss of of necessary in respect suffered somewhat heavily at first accustomed at school to leave thing carelessly about without slightest doubt a to safety be astonished shocked to find that very much laxer code of morality prevailed in army that necessary left about instantly disappeared first week after joining lost nearly

take part in regimental sport in spring when easter have passed weather became bright pleasant often took long walk alone for be seldom must find anyone willing to accompany have learnt drawing at cheltenham a found that must be useful for when obtained rank of non commissioned officer to make sketch map to send in with report of country reconnoitred accustomed to do on walk jotting down feature of country noticing spot where road came in width of bridge across canal nature of bank taking sketch of what appeared to position must be occupied to check pursuing force to be taken up by advanced one at time too joined class for signalling found highly interesting before end of summer must send message read one with flag flash light a soon a summer really began took to cricket here speedily attracted attention of officer have be best bowler in second eleven must have be in first next season at cheltenham be little time before proficiency a bowler became known although be soon seen that batting be far above average youngster handle bat well moffat one of lieutenant said to captain who be most energetic cricketer among officer who with one two of sergeant generally made up team when regimental eleven played against of corp yes play in good form doe who be young fellow at wicket now sergeant be trumpeter of d troop sir only joined three month ago must play bit when came got posted to troop before two others who joined four five month before man who be bowling now be not up to much sergeant suppose take ball for over two must like to see how young fellow must stand up to bowling sergeant who be one of regimental bowler took ball edgar who have be driving previous bowler in direction at once played carefully for over two contented with blocking ball then one came little wide cut to leg for four captain moffat took off coat waistcoat took end facing sergeant began to bowl slow twisting ball be in strong contrast to fast delivery of sergeant edgar felt now that be being tried played very cautiously there be run to be made off such bowling until bowler became careless tired at last ball came rather farther than usual edgar stepped out to meet drove nearly straight forward scored four be not until score ran up to thirty that be at last caught will do smith captain moffat said approvingly where did learn to play cricket learned at school sir ah well taught well if taught nothing else go on practising will give chance to play for regiment first time that there be vacancy two three match be played before chance came then sergeant stokes bowler hurt hand day before be going to play rifle brigade be considered strongest team in camp be unlucky business sergeant captain moffat said to a be talking over next day play thought if have luck might make good fight with rifle bowling be never strongest point now be out of will make very poor show be there of men outside eleven who show bowling talent sergeant shook head not one of sir hoped corporal holland must have made bowler seems to have gone off rather than come on must trust to bowler have got there be four five of who be not bad though except sir there be nothing so to speak to depend on can not depend on sergeant there be certainty about bowling sometimes do pretty fairly at other time get hit over field proper place be wicket keeping must never leave that if have two three bowler must depend upon well must go in for run making think that can do better than put on young trumpeter till can play again have watched several time at practice always keep wicket up well hit freely whenever get chance very well sir will warn that will be wanted to morrow there can be harm in trying for once anyhow there be little surprise among men who played cricket at hearing that trumpeter smith be to play in eleven against rifle little grumbling among who have hoped to be next choice however agreed that be very likely youngster hussar won toss went in first bowling of rifle be deadly ten wicket fell for fifty two run edgar be last to go in did not receive single ball partner succumbing to very first ball bowled after edgar have gone out to wicket then rifle went in loss of hussar fast bowler soon made felt two of best bat of rifle be at wicket in spite of several change of bowling seventy four run be scored without separation being made captain moffat looked round field despairingly have tried men on whom have dependence own bowling have be very severely punished have retired when thirty run have be scored be reluctant to take ball again a be standing undecided after over in twelve run have be scored eye fell on edgar a ran lightly across to take up place on opposite side smith edgar ran up to do bowl at have not bowled season sir used to bowl pretty fairly very well then take ball at end after next over be going to try smith at end said to young lieutenant who be long stop shrugged shoulder well there be one thing can not make worse mess of than be making already when over be concluded edgar took ball year have elapsed since have last played gymnastics hard exercise have strengthened muscle greatly a tossed ball from hand to hand while field took place felt that be more master of than have be before have then be remarkably fast bowler for age must have be in eleven have not happened that already possessed three unusually good bowler first ball sent up be comparatively slow one wanted to try hand be dead on wicket be blocked then drew breath sent next ball in with force shout rose from hussar a two of wicket went flying into air player came out at fourth ball of over middle stump be levelled what do think of langley captain moffat asked long stop a walked together to other end have found treasure bowl about a fast a one have ever seen ball be dead on wicket be first class lieutenant who be old etonian said wonder where learnt to play cricket wicket fell fast inning concluded for edgar taking seven wicket for twelve run captain moffat put in third in second inning scored twenty four before be caught out total score of inning amounting to rifle have therefore eighty one run to get to win only succeeded in making seventy six eight of being bowled out by edgar caught off bowling after took place regularly in hussar team be generally acknowledged that be owing to bowling that regiment that season stood at head of aldershot team chapter vi egypt naturally prowess at cricket made trumpeter smith popular figure in regiment even at officer mess name be frequently mentioned many guess be ventured a to who be what school came from that be gentleman by birth nobody doubted there be nothing unusual in for cavalry regiment contain considerable number of gentleman in rank men of class generally enlisting in cavalry in preference to other arm of service be however unusual for one to enlist at edgar age many young men after having failed to gain commission by competition enlist in hope of working up to one through rank class be men who having got into scrape of one kind run through money tired out friend finally enlist a only thing open to first class be among steadiest men in regiment speedily work way up among non commissioned officer second class be on other hand among wildest least reputable men in rank be good men in campaign where pluck endurance high spirit be most valuable among worst most troublesome when there be little to do time hang heavily on hand there be two of sergeant who have failed in examination for commission be hoping day to obtain one have be five year in regiment other three attention have first be called to edgar by getting first class in examination at once stamped a having have education greatly superior to of majority of recruit position in regimental cricket team further attracted attention took opportunity to speak to when happened be walking together met edgar returning from afternoon ramble across country well smith how do like soldiering like very well think that there be anything to complain of at be better than grinding away at latin greek mathematics sort of thing younger of two sergeant said with smile there be advantage way sergeant so there be lad of two like drill better than grinding at book worse luck if have be fond of book must not be wearing stripe asked band master if be learning instrument said be not so suppose mean to give up trumpet join rank a soon a get to eighteen yes must not care about being in band cricket be not bad thing for elder of two men said brings into notice will help to get stripe earlier than otherwise must do a man who doe regiment credit a good shot a cricketer in sport be sure to attract notice to be pushed on if be steady smart soldier if wo mind giving bit of advice must say try to push forward sometimes young fellow spoil chance by doing so of old non commissioned officer feel bit jealous when see youngster likely to make way up know can make very hot for fellow if like so be careful not to give chance even if be blown up when deserve be better to hold tongue than to kick against cheeking non commissioned officer never pay thank sergeant edgar said quietly be much obliged to for advice uncommonly good style of young fellow sergeant netherton who be son of colonel in army have be educated at harrow said to companion come from good school must say must have got into baddish scrape never must be here at age doe not quite follow other replied father may have died burst up somehow seeing nothing before place at clerk desk enlisting may have taken alternative not bad choice for putting aside altogether chance of getting commission be pretty slight one there be pleasanter life for steady well conducted young fellow who have have fair education than army be sure of getting stripe in couple of year after enlisting non commissioned officer have enough pay to live comfortably have care anxiety of sort have more time to than man in other sort of business there be end of staff appointment open to if writes good hand doe not mind clerk work if go in for long service have chance of being regimental sergeant major before have done can leave service with pension sufficient to keep in quiet way yes be very well summer can not marry be to say if have a be supposing be born educated a gentleman can not marry sort of woman must like a wife there be that drawback other laughed then see if have be obliged to take small clerkship leading to nothing must hardly invite young countess to share with a edgar walked back to barrack thought over advice have be given recognized value knew that chance of ever obtaining commission be exceedingly small that even young men whose father be officer of high standing considerable influence seldom obtain commission under six seven year service that majority of commission from rank be given to old non commissioned officer who be made quarter master pay master have not entered service a have two non commissioned officer with whom have be speaking for express purpose of gaining commission simply because have always have fancy for soldiering because seemed at time left cheltenham only thing open to have resolved from first that must regularly put by portion of pay so that must at time purchase discharge if wished to must see opening in must embark by time reached age of three four twenty must have gained experience might then if liked emigrate to one of colony resolved that when winter came must go into one of regimental workshop learn trade saddlery farriery must enable to earn living for time abroad until saw something better to do at school edgar have held place rather by steady work than by natural talent rupert be more clever of two edgar dogged perseverance have placed in more advanced position on modern side than rupert held on classical in position might find perseverance power of work strong common sense be likely to carry through edgar be conscious that have acted hastily wrongly in leaving cheltenham a have done yet felt that if again placed in same circumstance must do same captain clinton have certainly right to have voice in future yet felt so keenly dishonour of fraud in have be unconscious accomplice that must not have brought to accept assistance at captain clinton hand still knew that at home for still thought of a home must be feeling much anxiety about once month wrote short letter to captain clinton saying that be well be keeping comfortably letter gave in charge of comrade going up for day leave to london to post there for one day edgar have gone with dozen others to bathe in canal after doing so have returned to barrack have gone for walk by on return be walking along lane at distance of about mile from town when heard scream at once started off at top of speed at turn of lane came upon group of two tramp two frightened lady one of be in act of handing over purse to tramp while second man be holding other by wrist be endeavouring to tear off watch chain be struggling to retain just a edgar turned corner struck on face fell backward on to bank moment edgar be up to tramp turned with savage oath edgar who be carrying riding whip struck with with strength across eye man staggered back with shriek of pain other stood on defensive be match for edgar who be in hard exercise in regular practice with glove whose blood be thoroughly up fight lasted minute at end of time tramp be lying in road roaring for mercy shouting to comrade to come to assistance latter however be stamping with pain be still unable to use eye edgar turned to lady if will kindly walk on to town said send first man meet here to will take care of two fellow until arrives then will hand over to police be alarmed went on seeing that hesitated think have have enough of illustration edgar struck with strength lady hurried off before going many hundred yard came upon three infantry men who when heard what have happened set off at run to edgar assistance arrived just in time man on ground have recovered foot companion have attacked edgar with fury needed latter skill activity to defend a soon a soldier arrived upon scene combat ceased a measure of precaution tramp be first knocked down be then dragged on to foot conducted by captor into aldershot where be lodged at police station be followed by two lady who after sending on soldier have waited until return with tramp waited outside police station until constable came out asked to sign charge sheet did edgar now looked at fairly for first time recognized one of a being wife of major of corp belong to husband regiment said a came out from police station what be name smith madam be trumpeter in d troop oh yes remember face now have often seen in cricket field miss pearson be greatly indebted to must not mind so much being robbed of purse prize watch very highly a be present from father major horsley will see thank when hears what have done want thanks edgar said be pleasure to punish such ruffian hour later major horsley came across to edgar quarter sergeant called lad down be greatly indebted to smith said a edgar saluted greatly indebted to have behaved most gallantly have saved wife from loss of watch chain that greatly valued perhaps from serious ill treatment from ruffian a be one of struck very severe blow on face know enough of lad to feel that can not offer money for service that have rendered be assured that will not forget that when be in power to do good turn will do so thank sir edgar said be very glad to have be of service major nodded kindly edgar saluted turned away well pleased at having made friend who must have in power to be so useful to still more pleased that major have not offered money a reward for what have done hour later be sent for to orderly room where colonel in presence of several of officer thanked for gallant conduct be credit to regiment smith may be sure that will keep eye on concluded next day tramp be brought up before local magistrate committed for trial for highway robbery with violence month later be brought up at assize at winchester sentenced to five year penal servitude edgar gained great deal of credit in regiment from affair came to be known by nickname of bantam there be of course men who be jealous of young trumpeter popularity two three of non commissioned officer especially felt aggrieved at notice taken of one of be corporal in charge of barrack room occupied by edgar for have since have be regularly appointed to troop left quarter first occupied with band for allotted to troop d corporal however have little power in barrack room be in sort of transitional state between private sergeant be liable for even comparatively small fault to be sent down again into rank being case seldom venture to make obnoxious to men who be lately comrade may be comrade again before week be out corporal north however lost opportunity of making disagreeable in small way to edgar more than that must not venture upon for men must at once have taken lad part regiment have be for little time first on list for foreign service there be surprise when news ran round barrack room that order have come to prepare for embarkation be supposed that a matter of course india must be destination be soon known that regiment be for present to be stationed in egypt most of men must rather have gone direct to india where soldier be better off better cared for than elsewhere edgar however be pleased at thought of seeing something of egypt seemed to too that there be chance of active service there seems to said talking over with several of chum that sooner later must have fighting in egypt can not understand how be that of regiment there have not long ago be sent down to suakim have smashed up egyptian army seems to that a be really master of place be bound to protect native from savage tribe who be attacking down on red sea up in soudan egyptian always managed well enough until disbanded army if hick pasha have have a asked for english regiment two with must never have be smashed up by mahdi people seems to awful that garrison of sinkat tokar must be deserted when have lot of troop lying idle at cairo while baker be trying in vain to get up native force to march to relief wish instead of going to egypt be going straight down to suakim to help there be one thing if baker fails sinkat tokar fall into hand of native there will be such indignation government will have to do something so think there be very good chance of seeing active service there will be thousand time better than sweltering in hot barrack in cairo right be smith one of others said go in for reading paper know anything about chap in egypt if there be going to be row say let have share in be pretty well up in pursuing drill must be change to do with somebody to pursue anyhow wherever be will be good job to get out of aldershot with parade drill long valley whole blooming lot of three day later order came regiment proceeded by rail to southampton embarked a soon a arrived there transport started on following morning weather be fine voyage pleasant one have little to do for have left horse behind a be to take over horse of regiment be going to relieve steamer be fast one in twelve day after sailing reached alexandria be met when arrived there by terrible news general baker force have marched to relief of tokar on way have be attacked by native utterly defeated force being killed whole must have be annihilated have not reached sea shore where gun of vessel have brought down from suakim checked pursuit of enemy sinkat have fallen news have arrived only on previous day greatest excitement prevailed regiment at once proceeded to cairo by train took over barrack horse from small detachment have be left in charge of main body of regiment having crossed on journey from alexandria a be to proceed to india in same steamer have brought out hussar be scarcely settled in quarter before heard that now that be too late expedition be to be sent down to suakim two english regiment must have saved baker force from destruction must have rescued garrison of sinkat tokar now large force must have to be employed time must of course be needed for organization of expedition in meantime hussar have plenty of opportunity for investigating cairo to edgar town be delightful with bazaar varied population of comrade be never tired of wandering about examining shop with curious content bright coloured scarf wonderful pipe gaudy brasswork oriental stuff carpet population be even more amusing with mixture of egyptian arab negro clad in variety of garb from egyptian functionary in neat blue uniform fez portly merchant in oriental robe to arab muffled up in cotton cloth with turban bernous lightly clad fellah woman shrouded in dark blue cotton with face almost entirely hidden by yashmack needed dexterity to avoid string of loaded camel that made way through narrow street porter carrying heavy weight hanging from centre of thick bamboo pole resting on shoulder of two four men diminutive donkey with high saddle on top of be perched men who looked far more capable of carrying donkey than donkey of supporting weight men soon discovered that spirit be cheap in cairo result be considerable addition to number brought up at orderly room for drunkenness among to edgar satisfaction be corporal north who be at once sent back to rank sentenced to week in cell on day came out edgar went up to now look here north have made pretty hot for while be corporal if have given cause for must bear malice have be simply persecution a long a be corporal have to grin bear now that be in rank can settle matter so challenge to meet in riding school after be dismissed from parade to day will suit exactly north said want licking badly young fellow now will get well if be must say nothing about until be over edgar replied for see be quite possible that may be other way a several of men have heard conversation there be considerable gathering in riding school after be dismissed from parade sympathy of men be strongly with edgar most of thought that be hardly match for north who have fought several time before have got stripe be well built young fellow of two twenty fight lasted upwards of hour north have knowledge of boxing in respect edgar be superior be far stronger longer in reach while edgar be more active in early part of fight advantage lay with soldier edgar be terribly knocked about so much so that general opinion be that have better give in say that have have enough edgar laughed at suggestion have only begun yet said to man who be acting a second last tell in long run have seen that before now have double last have be fact edgar have be constantly at hard work since joined regiment while north have have comparatively easy time of since became corporal have too spent small portion of pay in drink although be seldom absolutely drunk have have more than one narrow escape of condition being observed on return to barrack in evening a fight went on then want of condition told upon edgar who have at one time seemed weak gradually recovered strength while north became exhausted by exertion have made in early part of fight edgar now took offensive at end of hour quarter fighting north be no longer able to come up to time loud shout from looker on proclaimed that edgar be victor went across to north held out hand let shake hand north said have be good tough fight owe malice now if get stripe again a daresay will hope will be lesson to not to drop unfairly upon anyone may take dislike to north took hand held out to have licked fairly smith said did not think have in think must have thrashed if have be in a good condition a be very likely not edgar laughed well next time fight hope will be against arab not against other fight greatly added to edgar reputation in regiment north be not popular character have always be considered bully pluck with edgar have continued fight be thoroughly appreciated neither of combatant be able to take place in rank for day after fight being obliged to obtain order from surgeon dispensing from appearing on parade though still did stable duty inner guard through surgeon matter came to ear of officer who by quiet inquiry from sergeant learnt particular of fight friend trumpeter smith be reported a unfit for duty dear major horsley said to wife be be sorry for that lady said be there anything can do for in way of sending soup anything of sort be not seriously ill hope be afraid be beyond skill emma major horsley said then seeing that wife looked seriously grieved went on be alarmed have only be fighting again oh be that be afraid be fever something of sort who have be fighting with doe look quarrelsome at have be fighting with man named north who be corporal in troop who a hear have be persecuting good deal fellow got drunk other day be reduced to rank young smith lost time in challenging to fight hear most of men thought be fool for doing so for north be five year older than be stiff built young fellow too hear that be very hard fight lasted nearly hour half after first hour seemed to one smith must have to give in for other man have best of knocking down round stuck to at last north be so beaten must not come up to time sergeant say of be terribly knocked about smith worst can hardly see out of eye will be fully week before of can take place in rank hear be longest fight that there have be in regiment for year sergeant major tell men be quite enthusiastic over pluck with young one fought see be not seventeen yet for lad of age to stand up against man one too who a hear be accustomed to use fist be feather in cap will do good in regiment have doubt of men be rather jealous of position gained from play at cricket from affair of yours be very mean of then mr horsley said warmly perhaps so dear favourite be not often popular anyhow will do good will give better standing in regiment than even cricket must do at rate who like be likely after to keep opinion to wish must do something for robert see have never done anything yet will have chance of giving helping hand day major replied may be sure that when opportunity come will do what can have not forgotten what owe can tell opportunity came sooner than major have expected in short time became known that four squadron of th hussar one squadron of st be to accompany expedition greatest excitement prevailed in corp a to troop must be chosen two day later edgar be delighted to hear that d troop have be named for service why have chosen d troop robert mr horsley asked husband partly dear because atkinson be senior captain oh yes forgot what be other reason well emma that reason be known only to myself mind knowing must not whisper to anyone what be wife asked curiously because dear trumpeter smith belongs to troop thought must give chance of distinguishing someday when come to question of promotion will count in favour that have seen active service oh be glad robert be very good of to think of wish that must know that thought of that certainly can not know major said decidedly must be nice thing for to be known by anyone that arrangement a to troop must go on service have be influenced by desire to do good turn to trumpeter other reason be good sufficient one atkinson a senior captain have almost right to first chance that offer be pretty sure to get brevet rank if there be hard fighting at moment there be knock at door orderly entered saluting handed note to major horsley glanced through expression of pleasure crossed face compliment to colonel will come across see at once what be robert wife asked a door closed behind soldier well dear be news that own give great pleasure be afraid wo like not that be to go with detachment robert yes emma be handed note dear horsley have just received order from general that field officer be to go in command of squadron a senior major have of course right to chance congratulate mr horsley turned little pale a read lip quivered a said well robert doubt be glad of opportunity a soldier wife will not say anything to damp pleasure be natural that must wish to go if be man must wish so too anyhow will only last very short time said thought that must be back again in month surely there can be very great danger in fight with savage smallest amount in world emma be not like baker force be composed of cowardly egyptian be ridiculous to suppose that wild tribesman brave a may be can stand against british troop armed with breech loader be afraid that share of business will be to do little scouting before fight begin little pursuing practice afterwards so there will be really occasion whatever for to be at uneasy child must own be extremely glad of opportunity of taking part in little expedition against fanatic well must go across see colonel mr horsley indulged in quiet cry while be away for although did not apprehend real danger thought that husband be going to run risk of life for first time since married be trial however looked bright cheerful when returned at once set to work to pack up kit required for expedition next morning detachment of st hussar eighty strong marched down to station with one hundred men of th hussar took train for suez here found two hundred twenty eight men of th who have come on by earlier train work of embarking horse on board steamer be to take down to suakim at once began be continued until recommenced again at daybreak for operation of getting horse on board ship slinging down into hold be necessarily slow one by mid day be concluded baggage on board troop in readiness for start be just sunset when vessel steamed away from wharf troop on board joining in hearty cheer a started ship be far more crowded than must have be case have be starting for long voyage run down to suakim be so short that be packed a full a must hold having in addition to troop number of mule for transport one be in high spirit change be most welcome one after monotony of barrack life in egypt moreover be burning to avenge destruction of baker force massacre of brave little garrison of sinkat voyage be pleasant one after passing out of gulf of suez with lofty rugged mountain of sinai with red rock patch of verdure rising almost from water edge entirely lost sight of land on left on right however ran range of steep hill became bolder loftier a made way south when night again fell engine be slowed down for be not deemed advisable to arrive off suakim before daylight a coast of neighbourhood abounded with reef entrance to harbour be intricate difficult a soon a day broke engine be again put at full speed in hour mast of shipping lying in port must be made out a neared port small launch be seen coming out officer soon came on board be to go down coast to trinkitat said to captain transport have gone down there be to be base of operation officer clustered round new comer to learn news have be more lucky than th said neva ran ashore on shoal eighteen nineteen mile away have become total wreck several steamer went out at once to help got out men horse good deal of baggage be lost fifty transport mule there be time to take out before went to piece be very close thing be very lucky that aid came two three hour after struck there have be trouble with black regiment scoundrel mutinied a soon a got on shore announced intention of joining rebel so marine have be kept here for defence of place instead of going with expedition be sorry to say that tokar have fallen groan broke from hearer be bad business went on happily there have be repetition of sinkat massacre heard news yesterday morning be brought by five soldier who made way down coast reported that civil governor of town have entered into negotiation with enemy have agreed to surrender on promise that life of garrison must be spared in afternoon two of spy came back confirmed intelligence seems that must have held out time longer that governor have behaved like traitor be annoyed by distant fire from six krupp gun taken at defeat of baker force worked by black artilleryman captured at same time fire did material harm seems to have frightened what little courage be left among official governor hundred fifty of townsman went out arranged surrender although knew perfectly well that in very few day help must arrive there be one thing surrender will enable general graham to choose own time to wait until troop be up instead of pushing forward a might otherwise have done directly thought have men enough to save tokar in five minute officer have taken place in launch be steaming back into suakim transport be making way south by noon be anchored off landing place low beach with flat country extending behind shore be alive with troop number of boat be plying backwards forward work of disembarking horse began immediately greater part of be on shore before night there found black watch gordon highlander irish fusilier th hussar mounted infantry corp of one hundred twenty six strong edgar greatly enjoyed bustle excitement troop be in highest spirit first comer be eagerly questioned said that during day th mounted infantry have made reconnaissance across lagoon lay between beach country behind enemy have be seen there in force retired at once upon seeing cavalry advance be expected that by following morning of infantry must cross lagoon occupy battery general baker have thrown up there to cover landing for trinkitat have be spot from too have advanced to relieve tokar scene of conflict in force have be destroyed must probably be crossed by british in advance tent have be taken be needed for even in february heat upon shore of red sea be very great a evening went on buzz of talk laughter died out troop lay down slept under starry sky chapter vii el teb next morning gordon highlander irish fusilier accompanied by squadron of hussar mounted infantry with couple of small gun crossed lagoon occupied intrenchment cavalry went little distance out enemy be seen in considerable number a there might be large force concealed among low sand hill attempt be made to attack a be undesirable to bring on serious fighting until whole force be in readiness to advance in evening cavalry recrossed lagoon a there be water obtainable on other side animal have to depend upon supply landed from steamer day work of disembarkation have be going on in spite of heat of blazing sun men have worked enthusiastically in getting horse store on shore next day naval brigade one hundred fifteen strong picked men from crew of gun boat with ten officer landed troop on beach be most anxious to advance a beyond lagoon have to depend entirely upon food water carried across to be unadvisable to push larger body of men forward especially a native have clearly intention of attacking contenting by keeping up distant fire expect beggar be gathering force just a be gathering ours one of hussar said a sat round fire have lighted with drift wood picked up on shore heat be in way required light be cheerful smoke kept away troublesome insect reckon said upon falling upon on march a did upon baker men will find have got into wrong box general baker came down in steamboat arrived afternoon heard one of officer say so edgar put in will be satisfaction to to see fellow well licked on nearly same ground where cut up force ah expect baker must give right hand to lead cavalry in charge what splendid officer be there be not man in army can handle cavalry a can must th fight with old colonel at head there be general chorus of assent how splendidly fought in turkey trooper said be told turk led must have done anything for have just same confidence in chap used to have if have be in command of whole army instead of rotten old pasha russian must have found very different job wonder when be going on now have got store ashore will be precious slow work being stuck on beach be waiting for th sergeant said serapis be expected morning be great luck for getting fight without trouble at how pleased must have be when heard at aden that be to be stopped on way up to have share in affair yes call that first rate piece of luck agreed to have good fight then go straight home while have got nothing to look forward to afterwards garrison duty in cairo must rather be going on to india fifty time like enough may see service there sergeant said if mahdi fellow come down say mean to do to invade egypt may be sure will have to go up to stop call 'fighting ' against savage one of trooper said what chance have got against regular troop know johnson zulu be savage made pretty tough fight against suppose want anything much harder than that fellow have be bit a brave a zulu cut hick pasha army into mincemeat have licked two egyptian army down in neighbourhood if think be going to be harder work than field day at aldershot think be likely to find be mistaken suppose sergeant that naked beggar be going to stand for moment against charge of eight hundred cavalry did not seem a if naked savage must stand infantry armed with breech loader see zulu did doe not seem possible arab can stand for moment against charge see understand fellow one know what regular infantry can do against cavalry may be will find that arab be not to be ridden over a easily a think when have got to reckon with men who care snap of finger whether be killed not never can count upon easy victory however badly may be armed however undisciplined may be there be nine o'clock broke off a bell on board gun boat rang out twice moment later bugle sounded light out call be repeated by bugler trumpeter of various corp few minute later men stretched out on sand silence reigned in camp next morning admiral hewett sent on shore eight seven pounder gun from fleet to take place of same number of little camel gun have be found to be of real utility at smoke of steamer be

time after officer have returned there be doubt that letter must arrive at destination before whole of force with exception of one hundred fifty men left to defend store on beach have crossed lagoon three hundred men be to remain in intrenchment when rest marched to defend transport animal store left there against attack bivouac fire be lighted round troop sat smoking chatting until bugle call ordered to lie down in rank be bivouacked in order in be to advance formation be to be sort of square of gordon highlander be to form front face royal highlander rear line irish fusilier right face

hospital appliance camel battery with seven pounder be to remain in reserve in centre of square while sailor with six marine gun be placed at left front of square next to gordon highlander bivouac fire be kept up night a be considered probable that enemy who occasionally fired from distance might attempt attack upon sleeping force night however passed quietly towards morning rain fell heavily soaking troop a lay there be general feeling of gladness when reveille called to foot fresh fuel be thrown on to fire men tried a best must to dry kettle be boiled breakfast eaten cavalry recrossed lagoon to beach to give horse water at tank there then rejoined infantry place be to be in rear of square two squadron be to move in extended order a scout mile in front of on flank order be that if attacked be not to charge enemy to open right left to retire at once rejoin main body in rear of square so a to allow clear space for sweep of infantry fire infantry be to fire only in volley on word of command be not to open fire until within three hundred yard of enemy moving out from camp force be halted on open ground brief inspection made to see that be in order soon after eight o'clock advance began in earnest a soon a moved forward enemy must be seen retiring evidently bent upon pursuing same tactic that have done upon occasion of advance of baker pasha force from same halting place month before officer with glass must make out swarming along slight ridge of ground in neighbourhood of well flag extended along front mile in length gun must be made out in position a column advanced enemy cleared off from rising ground whether have retired behind ridge be there waiting in readiness to pour out to attack whether be moving round to fall upon flank of column be uncertain a column neared position must be seen that breastwork have be thrown up that position of gun have be well chosen enemy must now be made out crowded among bush on ridge be now ten o'clock column be advancing briskly to martial music of pipe of royal highlander cavalry scout have moved away from front square be within five hundred yard of ridge be not however advancing directly against be moving in line almost parallel to face a general graham have determined to pas then attack in flank a be evident that there must be serious loss in front attack upon position so strongly held fortified be trying moment for expected that silence so far preserved by enemy must be broken by roar of cannon discharge of musketry that must be followed by tremendous rush have proved fatal to baker force square kept way for distance across face before enemy opened fire have doubtless expected that direct attack must be made upon position passage of troop without slightest attention to surprised disconcerted at last perceived that must take offensive suddenly hot fire of musketry broke out from bush earthwork while krupp gun manned by soldier who have formed part of tokar garrison opened distance be four hundred yard several of men fell out from place in rank wounded greater part of shot bullet flew overhead reply to fire be made by square direction be changed little more to right so a to take somewhat farther from face of enemy position artillery now opened fire upon gun of enemy square kept on course steadily while storm of bullet fragment of shrapnel shell flew around enemy gunner proved that training have be good worked gun quickly aim be accurate general baker who be acting a head of intelligence department be struck in face by ball from one of shrapnel shell imbedded so deeply in jaw that must not be got out by surgeon until after conclusion of fight gallant officer having have face bandaged up remounted horse continued duty throughout day upon getting to position at end of ridge held by enemy men be ordered to lie down while artillery continued fire against enemy battery at quarter to twelve arab gun ceased to fire men be ordered to foot again with loud cheer continued advance square moved on until well in rear of enemy position then marched straight towards owing to change in direction of march left flank of square now became front be th with naval brigade on one flank royal highlander on other who be nearest to enemy fast thick flash of musketry broke out from bush a square approached fire ceased then group of black form sprang to foot with loud yell rushed towards square waving spear sword seemed incredible that little group of ten twelve men must intend to assail solid line of british a fresh party moment sprang up charged down order be given to fire flash of flame ran along face of great square then continuous roar told that breech loading rifle be at work while machine gun of sailor added rattle to din of musketry illustration with desperate rush reached sailor a if utterly heedless of death arab rushed forward through leaden storm be mowed down like grass before not one of intrepid warrior reached face of square not one turned to fly of who left shelter to attack square man fell with face to foe without halting for moment square kept on way until front line reached bush then with wild yell swarm of arab sprang to foot with so sudden desperate rush that reached sailor for minute hand to hand struggle took place bayonet against spear wild courage of native be of avail against steady discipline of sailor assailant be swept away square moved on ground be now so broken with bush rock that even line must no longer be preserved from bush from rifle pit dug among from behind rough intrenchment party of arab leapt to foot hurled in vain upon british bayonet a front of square reached ridge have formed arab position fight be most desperate enemy throwing furiously on flank royal highlander sailor have to fight hard to win way through at last ridge be won two of enemy krupp gun be captured a soon a square have be formed up again in order be turned against position arab have now taken up in rear of first line of defence in centre of position now occupied be brick building where engine for pumping up water for irrigation purpose have formerly stood arab have loopholed wall surrounded building with rifle pit here made desperate resistance until at last door be burst in building stormed several mud hut be defended with equal obstinacy many of men be wounded by arab who lay feigning death in rifle pit then when first line of troop have passed leaped out rushed in among cutting slashing until bayoneted shot down while th be winning position gordon highlander carried village while royal highlander captured redoubt at extreme right of position enemy have first held enemy now have be driven from last line fled in direction at speed rendered pursuit by infantry impossible during early portion of battle cavalry have be kept in rear out of range of enemy fire men have nothing to do to sit quiet on horse watch attack of infantry square upon enemy position fretting fuming not little that be unable to take part in what be evidently desperate struggle at last body of arab be seen streaming out from position general stewart who be in command of cavalry division gave order wheeling far round to right of infantry led against large body of arab in plain beyond ridge enemy did not await attack fled hotly pursued by first second line for distance order to cease pursuing be sounded when be seen that third line composed of hundred men be attacked by body of arab who have advanced from left main body wheeled round advanced to assist ground between be already occupied by arab a cavalry advanced threw down among tufted hillock mound covered whole plain horse in course leaped hillock swerving at sight of dark figure lying among arab sprang instantly to foot in interval between horseman hurled spear at a lay thrust into horse a fell sprang upon rider cut down at same moment small body of mounted arab dashed into fray most of be cut down made way through line turning instant did so fell upon rear of charging squadron colonel barrow who commanded fell still pressed forward opposition becoming moment more severe general stewart led second line to assistance of first too be desperately opposed have to fight hard before must reach one of general orderly be killed two others wounded major slade of th hussar lieutenant freeman of th lieutenant probyn fell twenty men be killed a many wounded before enemy retired colonel webster squadron made several brilliant charge at enemy now joined rest of cavalry arab be momentarily reinforced after have be seen of desperation with fought be deemed imprudent to pursue further with exception of loss sustained by cavalry total loss at battle of el teb be small amounting to only thirty killed one hundred forty two wounded one infantry officer be killed one mortally wounded one severely so while many received slight wound loss of arab exceeded two thousand edgar squadron be among first line when charge be made to assistance of colonel webster squadron be in rear rank must not well see what be passing in front be astounded upon seeing men spring up apparently from earth furiously attack horseman with spear sword have very narrow escape horse swerved a leapt low bush almost simultaneously native sprang to foot lunged at with spear instinctively threw forward on neck of horse a did so felt spear graze back below shoulder next moment horse have taken beyond arab reach at instant heard cry saw corporal north horse fall with pierced by spear thrust given by native lying on ground before corporal must rise arab be upon with sword struck down with sweeping cut upon shoulder edgar have wheeled horse round instantly before blow be repeated be within striking distance of man sword fell upon uplifted wrist dropping sword arab sprang upon horse strove to tear edgar from saddle while at same instant arab who have first thrust at ran up fortunately came up at side on comrade be clinging to edgar be therefore unable to use spear against after moment hesitation plunged into horse reared high in air then fell edgar have at moment rid of man who be grasping by shortening sword plunging into body a horse reared drew foot from stirrup dropped off over tail coming down upon foot just a animal rolled over dead other arab rushed at with spear edgar cut at with sword severed iron head from staff then springing forward ran arab through before must take to sword several others be running up edgar felt that case be desperate by time corporal though badly wounded have freed from fallen horse drawing carbine from bucket shot arab nearest to others however came on without pause edgar wounded companion made desperate defence received several sword cut edgar felt end be at hand when with roar like thunder second line burst down upon arab be instantly cut down take two men up behind officer shouted two of trooper reined in horse assisted edgar companion to climb up behind then riding at full speed soon regained line in minute trumpet sounded for halt edgar companion now slipped from horse joined own squadron corporal be scarce able to stand edgar be not in better plight major horsley rode up to not badly wounded hope asked be miracle getting in when once dismounted think be pretty nearly done for sir corporal said wish to report that trumpeter smith have saved life by coming back to assistance when horse be stabbed fell with killed two men who attacked so gave time to free to aid in making fight of until second line came up a corporal north concluded fell insensible from loss of blood at moment surgeon came up be going to charge again major because if so men with others badly wounded have better be sent across at once to infantry there be too many of arab scoundrel about for to be left behind here if be not going to charge will give wound first dressing at once know major said will ride to general ask speak to about wounded sergeant meekings if order come to charge before return tell off trooper to take up man too badly wounded to ride let carry straight across to infantry after giving order rode rapidly away returned in two three minute be not going to charge again doctor said be mustering too strongly for to attempt general say will halt where be until worst case of wounded be attended to here two of men dismount assist surgeon get jacket off lad doctor said take corporal first be worst case other wounded men be now brought up wound be bandaged who must sit horse then mounted behind other trooper while number of soldier be ordered to dismount to lay others upon blanket carry in edgar be one of have received one cut on top of head helmet have alone saved skull from being cleft have gash on right cheek side be laid open with spear thrust weapon having fortunately glanced from rib have sword cut on hip be unable to walk from loss of blood felt that none of wound be very serious surgeon said to cheerfully will do lad wound be ugly to look at be not serious will be on horseback again in ten day major horsley have not spoken to have given little nod of satisfaction when corporal gave report cavalry moved across at walk towards well of el teb wounded being carried between line a there be saying how many arab might be lurking among bush on reaching well be taken to field hospital have already be organized there wound be more carefully examined re dressed after drink of lime juice water with little brandy in edgar soon dropped off to sleep in morning major horsley captain atkinson came round to see how men of regiment be getting on surgeon report be favourable except in case of corporal north think will pull round major be sure will never be fit for service again that wound on shoulder tell be first got have cut clean through collar bone penetrated almost to upper rib doubt whether will ever have use of arm again that can not say anyhow will be long before be fit for hard work trumpeter smith there be nothing serious matter with have have marvellous escape if helmet have not saved head blow must have cleft right through skull if wound in cheek have be couple of inch higher must have opened temporal artery if spear have penetrated instead of gliding off rib that alone must have be sufficient to have done business a be be not much worse except for loss of blood with luck will be fit to take place again in rank in fortnight be glad to hear so good account of smith major said a went up to bedside have reported conduct to general stewart name will be sent in among recommended for victoria cross mind say that will get lad think will for so many men distinguished yesterday in hand to hand fight that name sent in will be very much larger than number of cross given still having be recommended will count in favour when time come so saying with kindly nod moved on to next bed at nine o'clock force moved out towards tokar gordon highlander being left at el teb for protection of hospital store with order to find bury european have fallen during day many of egyptian garrison of tokar came into camp from surrounding village in afternoon mounted orderly brought in news that force have met with resistance whatever on way several party of enemy have be seen fled a soon a saw troop advancing in tokar seventy of egyptian garrison be found in half starved condition while comrade have consented to join arab have steadily refused to do so have be very badly treated in consequence by by inhabitant of town arrival of troop be hailed with great joy inhabitant have have terrible time during occupation of place by arab whole population be preparing to accompany troop on march back to coast cavalry have ridden out to debbah where camp of force besieging tokar have be established in afternoon edgar be so far recovered that be able to sit up wound be sore painful strapping of plaster in be enveloped rendered very stiff uncomfortable a said to soldier have be just a stiff sore after football match felt confident that in few day must be a well a ever next evening force returned from tokar edgar other trooper who be well enough to go outside hospital tent to see come in be amused at appearance for have before starting armed with spear taken from fallen arab for fight on previous day have shown that sword be of little avail against tactic of arab in throwing flat upon ground that spear be much better suited for warfare against savage be accompanied by greater portion of population of tokar who be to be conveyed in ship up to suakim cavalry have found that arab have left camp at debbah before arrived expedition there be however by mean useless for found immense quantity of rifle ammunition together with gatling mountain gun of have be captured by arab at rout of baker pasha army at destruction of force under colonel month before gun captured in intrenchment made up complete number of have fallen into hand of native on two occasion so left without artillery work of burying dead have be carried on by force left in camp by aid of who now returned be completed in short time le than thousand arab be found to have fallen in around intrenchment number must have got away only to die subsequently from wound be learned from prisoner osman digma have not be present at battle have sent thousand men to reinforce engaged in siege of tokar force now moved down to trinkitat with three hundred men of garrison of tokar who have rejoined four five hundred men woman child from town re embarkation be speedily effected few hour later ship entered suakim harbour be found that native of town have received news of victory of el teb with absolute incredulity arrival of tokar fugitive convinced that arab have really be defeated one of prisoner taken at sinkat came in day two later having made escape from osman digma camp reported that news of battle of el teb have arrived there before left that have be given out that seven thousand of english have be killed that be only nightfall that saved from destruction first step of admiral hewett general graham on arrival at suakim be to issue proclamation calling upon tribesman to leave osman digma to come in make submission promising protection pardon to who surrendered proclamation be backed by letter by sheik morghani who be held in highest estimation for holiness told that god have sent english to destroy because have forsaken old religion for new one entreated to come in make peace fortnight have now passed since fight at el teb edgar who have remained on board hospital ship have made rapid progress towards convalescence be now reported by surgeon a fit to return to duty be most anxious to do a be daily expected that force must move out against osman digma who be at tamai place sixteen mile to south west of troop have be disembarked be delighted when be again able to join squadron spy came went daily be unanimous in saying that osman must fight battle news that el teb be disastrous defeat be by time known explanation that misfortune be solely due to order having be disobeyed perfectly satisfied follower belief that be invincible be wholly unshaken most fanatical of coast tribe still held to on th of march twenty one of sheik sent in defiant reply to proclamation saying that ten thousand men commanded must meet in field be therefore evident that struggle to come must be much more serious determined than of el teb edgar received quite ovation upon rejoining troop manner in have defended wounded comrade have awakened lively admiration more so since man for whom have so imperilled life have lately be personal antagonist well young un be getting on sergeant said to wo say be getting luck for luck have nothing to do with time anyhow be doing well smith wo be many month before be in mess need prophet to see that have chance of going higher if keep on a began here be only about seventeen year old have made big mark in regiment already have got major rest of officer on side from affair at aldershot then fact that be best cricketer in regiment count for lot now have got wounded have be recommended for victoria cross if mount up after that will be own fault have advantage fact that have be gentleman be in favour for naturally men be picked out for promotion who be best fitted for position of officer having be able to take first class certificate in school in brings into notice be careful with self lad know drink so need not warn about get cocky think will for have done so at present notice have have from cricket that aldershot affair must have turned good many lad head be thing to be careful about know there be good many old soldier who be inclined to feel little jealous when see young fellow pushing forward if see be quiet give air be pleasant with one get over in time in case one will acknowledge that deserve luck may fall to so be careful on head smith will find very little jealousy among sergeant when once get into mess for there be very few of who have idea whatever of ever getting commission must take one if be offered sensible man know when be well off except for man who have have education have have one be much more comfortable a sergeant better off too than one must be a officer when one be with other men one want to do a do officer who have got to live on pay find hard work painful work of course most men promoted from rank mean class of men get quarter mastership there be great pull in quarter master be one thing other officer may try to put at ease way be not way have known many quarter master who if have choice must gladly come back to sergeant mess again thank for advice sergeant edgar said quietly will follow to best of power think there be anything to be cocky about for thing at aldershot be pure luck so be other day happened to be next to north when horse fell of course turned round to help without thinking who be anything about be just instinct have done good after for hear be not likely to live many day chapter viii tamanieb be sure feel fit for active work again smith major horsley said a met edgar in camp yes sir lad said saluting be little stiff hurt if move suddenly be sure must not feel if be engaged again well do anything rash lad fellow be not to be trifled with indeed be general opinion in camp men be ready eager for fight with enemy there be little of light hearted gaiety with contest have be anticipated before have met arab at el teb idea savage however brave must cope with british troop with breech loader have then seemed absurd extraordinary bravery with arab have fought recklessness with threw away life determination with have charged through fire in seemed impossible that human being must live have created feeling of respect there be nothing contemptible about foe be expected that not only must force be very much larger than met at el teb a must be composed of osman digma best men must be fighting under eye battle must be much more hardly contested than before cavalry be particularly impressed with formidable nature of strange foeman while must have hurled fearlessly against far superior force of best cavalry of europe felt that here discipline mastery of horse went for little must charge through number of enemy danger lay not in charge after arab tactic of throwing down only to stab horse a rode over then rising up cutting thrusting in midst be strange bewildering to be game to charge dozen squadron of cavalry one after other trooper said a sat round fire on night of th of march if have order to go at square of infantry must be ready to go although might not like job a for slippery black beggar le have to do with better will be pleased go at think have got own way then before can say knife there be yelling shouting sticking ugly spear into horse dancing round until fairly know what be up to there ai nothing natural decent about there be general murmur of assent will know more about way next time said lancer must be best for sort of work there be getting at beggar on ground with sword for horse will always leap over body so can not reach with sword lance must do business well care much for lance for regular work for sort of fighting there be doubt be real thing well there be one thing if get among nigger time know what have got to deal with up down there will be mercy shown on th royal highlander marched out six mile towards tamai formed encampment there defending with bush interlaced with wire kind of defence being known among native a zareba next afternoon rest of infantry marched out joined next morning cavalry moved out in afternoon whole force started cavalry thrown out ahead few shot be exchanged with party of enemy there be serious fighting march be slow for ground be thickly covered with bush through troop with ambulance commissariat camel moved slowly sailor have very hard work dragging gun through deep sand took four hour before reached spot suitable for encampment within two mile of enemy position spot selected for halt be space free from bush large enough to afford room for encampment to leave clear margin of fifty yard wide between bush a soon a column halted cavalry part of infantry took up position a outpost to prevent surprise on part of enemy rest set to work to cut down bush drag across sand to form fresh zareba when be completed cavalry trotted back to post held on previous night a must be useless in case of night attack horse might suffer from distant fire of enemy inside zareba greatest vigilance be observed fully ten thousand determined enemy lay short distance away might creep up through bush make sudden onslaught at time moon be full light must show object advancing across open space have not be for general must not have be justified in encamping at so short distance from enemy march have be short one heat have be great dust terrible troop threw down on ground exhausted when work of constructing zareba be completed after short rest took up post in readiness to repel attack during early part of night remained under arm commander rolfe of royal navy crept out at rear of camp gained bush crawled among until came within sight of enemy saw in great number sitting round fire stretched upon ground returned to camp with news that might be case later on certainly attack be meditated at present greater part of troop be thereupon allowed to lie down get what sleep must cavalry felt much anxiety respecting have left behind moon be sufficiently bright to permit signal to be flashed to from camp learnt to satisfaction that be quiet soon after one o'clock in morning stillness round zareba be suddenly broken roar of musketry burst from bush round be evident that enemy be assembled there in great force troop be ordered to lie down fortunately here a at el teb arab fire be far too high storm of bullet swept for most part overhead many of camel mule horse be however hit only one man be killed officer two men wounded grasping rifle troop lay ready to spring to foot repel attack must be made hour passed on slowly without expected movement taking place there be general feeling of relief when morning at last broke a arab continued fire nine pounder gatling gun be brought into play upon bush fire of enemy soon died out fell back to camp troop now have breakfast soon after have finished cavalry arrived from other zareba at eight o'clock mounted infantry moved out accompanied by party of abyssinian scout have gone short distance when very heavy fire be opened upon officer in command sent back to general to say that there be broad ravine stretching across country few hundred yard ahead although hidden by bush from observation until closely approached that ravine be held by enemy in great force infantry now moved out from zareba formed in two square second brigade composed of royal highlander th marine led way be commanded by general davis in centre rode general graham with staff a soon a have marched out first brigade followed taking place in echelon hundred yard on right rear so that fire commanded right flank protected from attack in rear consisted of th th th rifle under general buller camel baggage animal remained under guard at zareba mounted infantry abyssinian fell back a first brigade advanced a soon a have moved clear of face of square machine gun at angle opened fire enemy fire soon ceased brigade again advanced arab have simply thrown down have not retreated fire broke out again a soon a of machine gun ceased general graham now gave order for highlander who formed front face of square to charge with cheer went forward at double sweeping enemy before soon reached head of ravine result of order be however that square be broken up front face have moved on at run while flank rear have continued march at same pace a before there be consequently wide gap between th on right flank highlander in front order be given to th to hurry up a did so mass of enemy be seen coming on at run making for gap in square illustration battle of abu klea january th illustration battle of tamai th march right company of th tried to form up to meet while lieutenant graham rn with men of naval brigade working three machine gun under command threw into gap yell of enemy roar of musketry rendered impossible for men to hear order given before th have formed up enemy be close at hand fire that of gatling mowed down arab in hundred wild mob charged on hurled on to th others poured like wave over little group of sailor while rest dashing through gap flung on rear of d sergeant whose place be in rear of men be cut down almost to man rear rank facing round be at once engaged in desperate hand to hand fight with native be now confusion fresh mass of enemy poured down with exulting shout in confused crowd brigade retreated have not help be at hand must probably have met with same fate befell baker force none must have reached suakim to tell news of massacre sailor in vain trying to drag off gun be almost killed gun fell into hand of enemy check be given to advance of arab by cavalry who have moved forward to left of square officer in command saw be to charge across broken ground little force must be lost among throng of arab therefore dismounted poured volley after volley with carbine into thick of enemy in meantime general buller square be advancing have be attacked a desperately a have that of general davis be well handled formation have not be broken up by order such a have destroyed formation of other brigade so steady terrible fire be opened upon advancing enemy that not one of assailant reached face of square having repulsed attack advanced rapidly to relief of shattered brigade ahead pouring incessant volley into rank of arab a swept down to assault thus a advanced first brigade cleared right face of second from foe a soon a came up with retreating force halted reformed rank brigade be now formed in line advanced steadily towards ravine upon way came upon abandoned gun enemy have in vain tried to carry off sweeping arab before british force reached edge of ravine be filled by flying arab into terrible fire be poured by musketry gun until arab have gained opposite side be concealed among bush fighting be now over although enemy still maintained distant fire be necessary however to keep troop together for number of arab still lay hidden among bush leaping up flinging desperately upon who approached scene of conflict be terrible hundred twenty of british lay dead of whom more than half belonged to d three naval officer ten sailor be killed while large number of officer men of d th be seriously wounded slaughter among native have be very great le than four thousand of strewing ground in direction british wounded be sent back to zareba force again advanced crossing ravine made towards three village in rear here be osman digma camp arab mustering in strength again opened heavy fire be however unable to withstand british gun heavy volley of infantry troop advanced into camp be found filled with property of kind for arab have removed nothing making perfectly sure that must be able to repel english advance bag of money bundle of clothing koran great quantity of grain plunder of kind be found in hut osman digma have taken part in fight have looked on from distant eminence when saw repulse of arab attack flight of men at once made off next day cavalry went on to village two three mile distant here found great quantity of ammunition for krupp cannon other loot have be captured from force of baker moncrieff village be burnt ammunition blown up next day force started on return march after burning destroying osman camp three adjoining village attempt be made to pursue osman digma arab country beyond be steep mountainous there must have be chance whatever of overtaking capturing while troop might have be attacked in difficult position have suffered heavily be supposed that after two crushing defeat have be inflicted on enemy proof so afforded of falsehood of osman digma pretension tribesman must no longer believe in that authority must have be altogether destroyed expectation be not however justified by event for two year later arab again mustered under in such formidable number that expedition be necessary to protect suakim against gathering of fanatic reassembled under osman banner cavalry have suffered no loss during operation a have have share in fighting have materially aided shattered brigade by fire upon arab be not ill satisfied that have not be called upon to take more prominent part in operation little time be lost at suakim greater part of troop be at once embarked on transport taken up to suez small body only being left to protect town must arab again gather in force policy be short sighted one have protectorate be established over country to foot of hill force sufficient to maintain left there great bulk of tribesman must have willingly given in allegiance further hostile movement upon part of osman digma must have be possible fact that hastened away after fighting afforded protection to friendly native effectually deterred others from throwing in lot with enabled osman digma gradually to restore power influence among short though campaign have be have effect of causing inflammation in edgar wound a soon a expedition returned to coast surgeon ordered into hospital be six week before again took place in rank by time regiment be re united at cairo there be for month nothing to break even tenor of way long ere edgar have learnt that recommendation for victoria cross have not be acceded to however be surprise for after what have heard from major horsley have entertained little hope that must be among favoured recipient of cross never mind ned comrade said to when list be published name be found to be absent be not always that most deserve cross who get know that ought to have have if fellow ever did will think just a much of a if have got on breast in spite of heat cricket match be got up at cairo hussar distinguished here a have done at aldershot chief topic of interest however be question of safety of khartoum especially that of general gordon have be sent out by british government in hope that great influence possessed among native might enable to put stop to disorder prevailed in soudan at time that have be in service of egyptian government have ruled so wisely well in soudan that prestige among native be enormous have suppressed slave trading restored order throughout wide province by mingling mercy with justice be at once admired feared even by whose profit have be annihilated by abolition of slave trade although gordon have be rapturously received by inhabitant of khartoum tribe of soudan have not rallied a be hoped must do in opposition to mahdi whose army have gradually advanced have besieged city general gordon with troop there have made expedition up river in steamer brought in provision for besieged town have fought several battle with mahdist in have not always be successful be known that unless help arrived city must finally surrender many letter have be received from asking urgently for aid week month passed government who have sent out be unable to make up mind to incur cost necessary for despatch of so distant expedition in cairo public feeling ran very high among troop there indignation at base desertion of one of england noblest soldier be intense general at last news came that public feeling in england have become so strong that government must no longer resist that order have be issued to prepare expedition with haste number of flat boat be to be built for conveying troop up nile canadian boatman have be sent for to aid in navigation of river camel be to be purchased in egypt mounted infantry corp organized store of kind hastily collected people who knew river shook head said that decision have be delayed too long nile must have fallen to point so low that must be difficult if not impossible to pas up cataract long before help must reach khartoum city noble governor must have fallen into hand of mahdi there be much disgust among troop when be known that many of must remain in lower egypt that of cavalry especially very small force must be taken while three regiment mounted on camel two of consisting of cavalry men from england must take part in expedition of soldier however looked at matter more philosophically have have share argued if mahdi men fight a well a osman digma be quite willing that others must have whack there will be end of hard work what fighting get wo be one way sand heat preserved meat dirty water out of well be not very pleasant when have to stick to for month together like enough too there will be rumpus down at suakim while expedition be away then who be left here now will get more of although argument be loudly uttered there be doubt that there be considerable soreness that men felt hardship of favoured troop from england being employed in stead in service that if dangerous be likely to offer abundant opportunity for display of courage for gaining credit honour chapter ix camel corp trumpeter smith trumpeter smith shout ran through arched corridor of barrack soldier putting head through one of window repeated cry at top of voice for trumpeter smith be not in barrack room edgar in fact be walking on shady side of great court yard

river join there be if can get up cataract know egyptian say water will be too low for boat to go up may be true enough a to native boat draw so little water believe there must always be depth enough for for there be always good lot of water coming down here even at driest season regiment be disembarked at assouan next day four company went up in two steamer to wady halfa hundred eighty mile higher up river edgar troop formed part of detachment have expected to see place of size found that consisted only of few mud hut shed of unfinished railway here for day men practised infantry drill received equipment saddle then be marched to camel depot mile away soldier be immensely amused at sight of charger animal have be collected from part of egypt from aden arabia a soon a proper number have be received told off to men work of fitting on saddle commenced be by mean easy a camel hump differed greatly from other good deal of padding altering be necessary before saddle be comfortably fitted when men mounted formed in line found that animal be docile obedient to rein maneuvered together without difficulty several day be spent in learning to sit animal there be many spill a sand be deep harm came of caused great amusement to except victim greatest difficulty be mounting dismounting of performance have to be done when camel be kneeling in order to make kneel be necessary to tug at head rope at same time making sound like clearing throat then rope be pulled at until head be brought round to shoulder prevented from getting up again rifle be slung in bucket on one side behind rider be found to render impossible to get leg over consequently became necessary for man to mount with rifle in hand to drop into bucket afterwards a camel always rose lay down with great suddenness men be until accustomed to constantly pitched over head never want to see camel again edgar grumbled after one two day exercise diversified by numerous fall be most discontented beast ever saw mind growling trooper said be twistiness of brute hate when be looking after horse know what can do where can reach of course if get behind can kick when be standing beside that have got to look after be head can not bring round to bite very far brute can reach over place can kick at way can scratch ear with hind leg even rub top of hump with if be disposed scratch under chin neck be same can twist anywhere can bite root of tail lay head back give rub on top of hump there be safety with at when come at growling roaring with mouth open showing teeth be enough to scare be fortunate that hoof be soft spongy so that can not hurt like kick of horse edgar said spongy be blowed trooper replied mine kicked in chest yesterday went flying about ten yard breath be knocked out of body for quarter of hour be bad doubt edgar laughed if have be horse must be in hospital tent now with of rib broken if have be smashed up altogether be up to sort of trick trooper went on looking savagely at growling camel there be rogers morning be just passing camel who be kneeling down well who must think that kneeling camel must do anything except with head rogers swore that did not go within four yard of brute suddenly shot out hind leg caught on knee cut clean over thought for time that leg be broken blow camel say a camel be not to be used for fighting from in presence of enemy trooper be to dismount fight on foot when down camel be to be knee haltered one of fore leg being doubled up strapped prevented animal from rising camel received about five pound of grain night morning whole be taken down to river other day to drink conduct of many of be exasperating in extreme to rider when taken down into stream must stand look about in aimless way a if wondering what on earth have be brought there for must be sometimes ten minute quarter of hour before idea seemed to occur to that might a well have drink once on march went steadily well obeying slightest motion of halter keeping up regular pace without intermission from time started until be ordered to halt after week drill practice men became accustomed to way of animal be glad when order came for to start by time leading regiment of infantry have begun to go up in boat be broad flat craft have be specially built in england for purpose carried twelve men three month supply of provision store for be provided with sail oar a direction of wind be up river sail be of great assistance illustration towing boat up nile a cavalry passed great cataract have opportunity of seeing process of getting boat up rush of water be tremendous seemed well nigh impossible to force boat against must indeed have be impossible to row be dragged up by tow rope by united strength of troop large number of native at time in spite of effort of men at rope boat made progress whatever while if steersman allowed stream for moment to take boat head must be whirled round carried down to foot of rapid when work have to be recommenced trooper thought a watched exertion of infantry rough a be action of camel have decidedly best of such be not opinion on following day when a be jogging wearily along several of boat passed running before strong wind with soldier on board reclining in comfortable position in bottom on thwart again opinion changed when wind having dropped saw men labouring at oar in blazing sun there be pull way one of trooper said philosophically take round know have got best of if there be many of cataract must say be best off say there be lot of between khartoum think have got best of certainly edgar said for if come to leaving river pushing on be sure to be in journey from wady halfa to dongola be mile day march be generally about twenty mile halting place being made at spot previously settled upon where there be depot of provision formed for start be made about five o'clock in morning for first two hour men walked leading camel then when sun became hot mounted rode rest of distance at first found monotonous motion very trying became accustomed to in time must even go off to sleep in saddle with result however that be probably shot off if camel came upon sudden irregularity of ground in cool of evening men bathed in river officer often went out in search of game be found however to be very scarce there be many regret among men that have brought no fish hook line with for must have furnished not only amusement during halt might have afforded welcome change to monotony of diet country bordering nile be composed of low rocky hill hard gravel with occasional tuft of dry grass scrub sometimes troop marched four abreast at other time have to go in single file across rocky ground fun of camel riding very soon passed off men found march extremely dull monotonous be heartily glad when got to dongola here rest of regiment joined marching twenty mile up river crossed nile in boat day march took to shabadud after stay there of day drilling with other corp moved on to korti four

in life edgar said quietly be brought up by captain clinton a son be at cheltenham with rupert clinton who have just passed believed that be twin until day came when woman came down there told story told that be son yours then ran away here be wife sergeant exclaimed passionately have not seen heard of for fifteen year so came down told that be bad lot if ever there be one so told be son may be lad for aught know must be well content to know that be so what did come tell that for what game be up to now always knew be up to mischief what be motive in coming down to tell just let know what said said have deliberately changed a infant for good proposed to to continue fraud offered if liked to swear to rupert being child so might get property that might share in sergeant laughed bitterly bold stroke that of jane humphreys how did pretend to recognize a child more than other told that captain clinton child have tiny mole on shoulder a rupert have mark settled question jane humphreys told more than knew whether intended to make change of baby not know believe did whether be done by chance whether purposely mixed up together one thing be certain of be that confused a well a one else that did not know be when came into room first be like woman dazed clever a be be sure be not putting on have thought fancy that must easily distinguish one from other have never fancied that must have be confused a well a other people undressed looked over over be then noticed little mole on shoulder turned to said 'if have noticed before must always have told apart ' have pretty bad time of afterwards for made laugh of whole regiment caused end of talk worry have frightful row together taunted with being fool for not seeing that there be money to be made out of acknowledged to over over again that have intended to change child have dressed alike when asked what good have come out of scheming said that in first place have got rid of bother of bringing up boy that if be not fool might make good thing out of yet be vexed angry with for not having seen little mark for having lost clue a to be child told that a have intended to change must have cared nothing for own boy that only object must have be to make money did not deny simply jeered at for being content to remain life non commissioned officer when there might be fortune made out of say that if have be able to tell one child from other must have told for if have must certainly have gone to captain clinton told did not know woman can act well can not make herself a white a sheet put wild look into eye a have when found turning child over over trying to make out be must take bible in hand swear in court that jane humphreys knew more than did be child that have never noticed mark until after change be made to day doe not know one of point quarrelled on be that made start for captain quarter in such hurry afterwards said that when first came across that did not know child be blood seemed to go up into head

too late to put that right word be a good a hers a swore before did not know be swearing now that doe after year will go for nothing at edgar be silent for time then said have thought good many time since ran away be wrong in not waiting to hear what captain clinton said have reason to doubt story told when proposed must go on with fraud cheat rupert out of position a heir be too horrible thought that woman be mother be altogether too much to bear will not make such mistake again act in hurry present thought be that a have chosen way will go on in before captain clinton wife did not know be child loved equally now that believe that rupert be son be fraud will have come to give love be not going to unsettle thing again be present idea think that be likely to change will be glad to know need not consider that woman child though must not grieve now that know to be sure that be father captain clinton wife be father mother to up to day when ran away must never think of anyone else in light quite natural quite natural lad have never seen heard of must be rum thing if must of sudden come to care lot about know that may be son know at present like more for than did before so be quite of one mind over will be friend lad stout friend that will edgar said clasping warmly hand other held out to have be very kind to up to now now at rate may be father son will be drawn very close

nothing of beyond fact that have occasionally letter saying that be well comfortable be posted in london still believe that be in army father be a convinced a ever that statement of woman told of be false one edgar be just a likely to be son a be must gladly give up share of heirship to find however unless run against by pure chance be not likely to do that still put in advertisement occasionally

worse than mine in fact than one else rock be awful if nature have scattered ten million knife broadcast about valley must not have be more destructive to boot than rock used to think that although camel be well enough for taking up baggage a mean of conveyance for men be mistake that must be much pleasanter to march than to sit upon wearisome beast opinion have be changed by experience here if have to march many mile over country a whole force must be barefooted have frightful job of last night went round with field officer how be did break neck can not imagine have dozen tremendous cropper down rock lantern went out first time got smashed second major seemed to think that be duty to have kept alight happened to myself be a savage a bear lost way dozen time once came up to picket on

in great commendation be given by general for zeal with have worked large a be number of animal to be watered work be conducted with far greater speed ease than have be case on former arrival arrangement be excellent in comparatively short time whole be watered fed troop however be dismayed at change have come over camel animal be capable of enduring great fatigue scarcity of water food authority have acted a if there be limit to power for fortnight camel have be kept at work with only three four hour rest out of twenty four with very scanty supply of food sufficient allowance of

in daytime coming up by bank of nile be cooler now than be then be very well for men to march at night if have animal baggage train with be different thing altogether on such expedition a to begin with delay from falling behind readjusting baggage be far greater at night than at day there be much greater difficulty in keeping column together men be in state of drowsiness whole time if be marching must keep awake sitting on camel there be nothing to rouse then when get in camp heat of day have just begun what with fly be next to impossible to sleep what sleep get doe not refresh quite dread march on to metemmeh however have got to be done certainly must not mind so much if be going to travel by daylight be soon known that there be to be delay at gakdul order be issued that start be to be made on th intervening day being devoted to seeing to arm ammunition issuing store replenishing water supply water skin be extremely defective leaking freely only exception being india rubber

guard felt that danger of being recognized by easton skinner be great sitting with group of others sewing with face shaded by helmet risk be very much le than if standing up moving about camp at two o'clock in afternoon force paraded moved off in column of company heavy camel corp led guard followed baggage store be in centre mounted infantry in rear many of camel have to be left behind remained be only sufficient to carry absolutely necessary store ration for men quantity of corn must suffice to give two feed of eight pound to animal who be therefore obliged to depend almost entirely on such sustenance a must pluck from mimosa shrub dry yellow grass men carried hundred seventy round there be hundred round per gun for artillery only thousand round be brought for gardner gun quantity sufficient for five minute work when in action journey be over gravelly plain halt be made at six o'clock in evening fire be lit of shrub dry grass camel be unloaded fed be ranged in such order that in case of attack troop must form square at angle of mass thus support other protect convoy at three in morning trumpet bugle sounded fire be soon blazing again at half past four breakfast have be eaten camel loaded column on march again at ten o'clock there be halt for two hour for dinner short rest be not until just a be going to start that rear guard arrived having be delayed by breaking down of number of camel many of have fallen dead a walked while others incapable of movement have to be left behind to take chance of recovering sufficiently to browse upon bush make way back to well a load of fell have to be distributed among already exhausted companion prospect be far from cheerful starting at column passed conical hill known a gebel el nur hour later entered broad valley covered with grass tree twenty foot high where doubtless water must be obtained have force be provided with little abyssinian pump at five o'clock column halted a ground be sandy passed more comfortable night than one before one be in good spirit men found journey by day far le fatiguing than at night be able to obtain refreshing sleep in cool night air before daybreak again started over gravelly plain hoping to reach well of abu klea that evening halted at eleven in valley flanked by hill track according to map lay over steep hill in front then along pas between two hill well lying three mile beyond pas dinner be cooked a soon a have finished meal hussar started for well a horse have have water since leaving rest of force be stretched upon ground taking quietly when two of hussar returned at full gallop with message to general order be immediately issued for men to fall in for officer to examine arm ammunition then news spread through force that enemy have be discovered in large number upon hill be evidently prepared to bar way to well change effected by news be wonderful have be generally supposed that metemmeh must be reached without fighting spy agreeing in saying that there be force of enemy near line of march in moment fatigue thirst be forgotten quiet be exchanged for bustle animation men laughed joked with other in highest spirit prepared for fray with most absolute confidence a to result a troop fell in general with staff galloped ahead to rising ground with field glass reconnoitred hill surrounding pas upon number of white robed arab must be made out hussar speedily reported that there be considerable force in pas below with fighting men in front baggage behind troop moved slowly forward up hill in front finally took up position on piece of flat ground whence must see down pas by arab expected advance must be made on side of hill commanding have thrown up small stone wall from to fire on hilltop out of range large number of arab must be seen in constant motion gesticulating waving arm be now four o'clock in afternoon general decided that a real force of enemy be unknown must be imprudent to attempt to force passage with only hour half of daylight before consequently halt for night be ordered strong detachment of mounted infantry sailor with gardner ascended hill on other side of pas set to work to build small fort mount gun there company from of camel regiment extended to cover front camel be made to kneel leg being lashed at knee so that must not rise done whole of troop be set to work to build wall there be however few loose

of enemy took possession of top of hill twelve hundred yard away on right opened fire to three gun of artillery replied with shrapnel shell gun ceased firing when darkness came on enemy kept up occasional fire night drink of lime juice water be served out to men who then lay down with arm in readiness to repel attack by little wall night enemy kept on beating tom tom occasionally yelling approaching at time comparatively close to position knowing however that sentry be out in front men for most part slept quietly in spite of noise firing a arab must fire only at random two men be hit during night in morning be found that number of enemy on hilltop have largely increased during night bullet now flew incessantly round over inclosure lying under such shelter a wall afforded men ate breakfast of tinned meat biscuit carried in haversack must admit skinner easton said to comrade who have come across from own company to have chat with that be more unpleasant than have expected lying here listening to angry hiss of bullet be certainly trying at least own feel so be nasty skinner agreed sha' mind a soon a go at beggar doing nothing be a say trying wish must make up mind come out to if can not get up pluck enough to do that must sally out attack may be sure will before long skinner know well enough that can not stop here must move on to water sooner later knowing that must be fool if be to give up strong position to attack here at rate must rather be lying behind wall than moving about a general staff be doing major dickson have just be shot through knee hear there look there be officer down wonder who be do hope wo pot clinton few minute later officer passing by told that major gough of mounted infantry have be knocked senseless by bullet have grazed forehead that officer of artillery have be hit in back what do think of sergeant edgar asked a sergeant bowen be eating breakfast together under shelter of wall think that be going to be hot job lad if have

hour square proceeded have nearly emerged from pas on to plain beyond when number of green white flag be seen at distance on left front a firing have principally come from right a be from side that attack be expected there be considerable curiosity a to meaning of seemingly deserted flag small party be about to go out to investigate when great number of other flag suddenly appeared at same spot moment later vast mass of arab who have be concealed in gulley sprang to foot see plan on page be about five hundred yard distant from square be at moment halted at foot of stony knoll be moved at once on to rising ground skirmisher be called in arab with wild yell moved across left front disappeared for minute behind rock high grass then reappeared close to left rear when wheeled into line

when hussar fortunately hit upon well wounded who be unable to walk be at once carried there troop followed halted near in short time thirst of be satisfied although water be not to be compared with at gakdul being found in willow pool one two foot deep stirred up by arab till be almost of consistency of thin cream nevertheless be water be enjoyable indeed chapter xii metemmeh a soon a thirst of men be satisfied troop formed up for night on rising ground near well where be probable that native might renew attack volunteer be called for three hundred men from various corp started to march back to zareba to bring in baggage before daylight be heavy duty after such day work who remained behind have reason almost to envy engaged in active work for night be terribly cold men have left everything behind a advanced prepared for action have blanket nothing shirt suit of thin serge to protect from cold surgeon be at work night attending to wounded alarm be given by outpost during night a when morning broke there be sign of enemy men be allowed to fall out herd of lean cattle left by arab be discovered not far off hussar went out in pursuit of tired horse be however match in point of speed for cattle few of be shot cut up supply of fresh meat for day secured at seven o'clock baggage train came up camel be quickly unloaded men set to work to prepare breakfast having have nothing to eat since meal have taken previous morning under fire in zareba during day dead be buried arm left by native collected destroyed stone inclosure commenced near well for here wounded be to remain under protection of small force of sussex edgar sergeant protested that be perfectly capable of continuing march be permitted to take place in rank again at four o'clock force formed up hour later set out be given out that march must be short one must presently halt for night a hour went on became evident that general have determined to keep straight on for river distance of twenty six mile from well be known that there be considerable force of enemy at metemmeh a must be augmented by addition of thousand of arab who have be engaged on previous day be probable be enemy aware of advance of force battle even more serious desperate than first must have to be fought before reaching nile object of night march then be to reach river before be aware that column have started from well nile once gained supply of water ensured force must be able to withstand attack made on nevertheless must have be far better to have risked battle in open than to have made night march across unknown country guide differed among a to route to be pursued more than once column marched in complete circle advance guard coming up to rear thick grove of mimosa be passed through causing greatest confusion among baggage animal great number of lay down to die unable to proceed step further transport of kind got mixed up together in most utter confusion men who have have little sleep for two night be unable to keep awake on camel in passage through bush many of animal straggled away from main body sergeant bowen have managed to place edgar next to upon plea that being wounded wanted to keep eye upon being weakened by loss of blood be le able to resist pressure of sleep than others when animal got separated in passage through mimosa grove from main body stopped to crop leaf be unconscious of what have happened until edgar woke with start a one of bough camel have pushed aside struck smartly in face exclamation roused sergeant hullo what have happened know what have happened edgar said seems to that be alone here must have be asleep brute must have separated from column be pretty mess be sergeant said can not hear anything of there be row enough in rear with baggage to be heard mile away what on on earth be to do lad well be marching nearly south southern cross be almost dead ahead of have better steer by go on ahead until morning camel be at once set in motion for hour plodded on desire for sleep have be completely dissipated by excitement of situation talked in low tone a to what be to do if must make out sign of column when day broke agreed that only plan be to keep on until got to river that when arrived there must water camel give feed after rest start on foot along bank one way other until found column there be safe to be lot of firing sergeant said for even if arab discover force in morning before get to river be certain to turn out to attack a soon a get there judging by pace be going constant halt for baggage to come up there be very little chance of column getting to river before daylight a have nothing to delay expect will be there before be in one respect will be better edgar said for a soon a native make out column will be swarming over country to look for straggler whereas if be ahead of may get through to river without being noticed think that will be very long before morning break do know sergeant think camel be going faster than be think so too lad look a if be getting near water smell just a first sign of daybreak be apparent in east character of country changed must make out clump of tree a light grew brighter cultivated ground ten minute later gave shout of joy a on mounting slight ascent river lay before few minute later be on bank camel rushing down put nose into water rider slipped from back regardless of fact that water be knee deep wading back to shore threw down by edge took long draught of clear water then throwing off clothes rushed in indulged in bathe camel after filling nearly to bursting lay down in stream until sergeant edgar went out compelled to return to shore when set to work cropping long grass that grew abundantly there while rider sat down made meal from content of haversack well at rate sergeant said can hing just at present troop may be within mile may be ten mile off there be saying there be nothing for to do to wait until hear something of if hear anything of will know that have not struck river have struck so far off can not hear gun in case opinion be that may a well rest here for to day before move think will be decidedly better to take saddle off camel hide in bush then move away distance hide up ourselves be evidently cultivated country if there be native about will be sure to see camel so have better not be near there be fear of animal straying will be eating drinking day saddle be accordingly removed from camel back hidden two men went back few hundred yard from river lay down amongst bush be just dropping off to sleep when sergeant exclaimed listen be at edgar at once roused distinctly heard boom of distant gun be one of seven pounder sergeant said think can hear sound of musketry be not sure about presently however wind brought down distinctly sound of dropping shot skirmishing lad suppose enemy be hovering about have come to close quarter yet be horrible being here instead of with edgar exclaimed a rose to foot be use thinking of moving lad be four five mile away certainly a arab be probably round there must be slightest chance of joining there be nothing to do to wait here sound come from inland so be certain have not got to river yet a far a can judge be pretty nearly behind so when lick fellow be likely to come down on river somewhere near point will be down before evening may be sure have not got water enough to last through day so must move forward however many of native may be in way be not like last business then be on almost before knew be coming in flat country will have plenty of warning will bet year pay get up to square again think lad will get to set bandage right again edgar uttered exclamation of alarm there be large dark patch on sergeant trouser in dressing after bathe bandage have shifted little bleeding have recommenced be evident at once to edgar that great deal of blood have be lost for sergeant bowen lay faint exhausted upon ground unknown to action of camel have set wound off bleeding during night although have said nothing to edgar about have with difficulty walked up from river to hiding place edgar ran down to river with two water bottle when returned found companion insensible unbuttoned tunic got at wound from blood be still flowing washed made plug of wet linen with difficulty bandaged tightly after time sergeant opened eye try to move edgar said have staunched bandaged wound will be better soon be bad job lad just at present when want to be up doing there be nothing to do at present sergeant have only to wait quietly until fellow come down to river then will soon get assistance do hear firing still be just a be edgar replied after listening attentively for minute then expect have formed zareba a did at abu klea that will leave camel there march straight down to river will steal up to edge of desert if mind being left alone bit will be able to judge then how far be off do so lad be right here be too long away will be anxious edgar made way quarter of mile back cultivated field stretched before beyond rolling hillock of desert must see men on horseback foot moving about looking to right saw about mile distant place of extent be felt sure metemmeh number of men be pouring out from town firing be not straight ahead somewhat to left if attack metemmeh at once will be all right said to if march straight down to river will be right still will only have to move along to be lucky did not strike river above town for must have be next to impossible to get round to without being observed went back to companion told what have seen there be evidently going to be tough fight before get down to water sergeant said be very hard being cut off here not must be good for fighting if be with have great desire to be in fight like last edgar said one go at sort of thing be quite enough for hour passed slowly sergeant slept good deal anxious a edgar be too several time dozed off presently exclaimed fire be become much heavier sergeant be nearer too listen be arab lad sergeant said raising on elbow be heavy be nothing like roll of musketry hear when fellow begin a say be much nearer column part of be on march towards river five minute later dull continuous rattle came to ear be at now have stopped said minute later when roar suddenly ceased what have happened now wonder ah there be again that be more like steady even musketry came in sudden crash volley sergeant said be near for three four minute sound continued then there be silence have beaten off sergeant said did let get near time expect if have there must have be independent firing a long a hear volley may be sure fellow be not pressed beyond occasional shot firing have ceased how far do think be away now sergeant if be four mile before think be more than two now good bit more away to left be making to river so a to establish there before tackle metemmeh then in hour will be down on river edgar said will wait time then start get party to bring in have better wait until to morrow morning lad can do very well until then may be able to crawl by time anyhow will have hand full afternoon will have to make zareba by river attend to wounded perhaps send back force to bring in camel baggage who be doubt left behind at spot where be firing morning there be grub enough in haversack to last until to morrow plenty of water for fetching just a think best sergeant shoulder be smarting good deal will be better for few more hour rest will soon be getting dusk so will go down get supply of water at once then can do good twelve hour sleep without fear of being called up for outpost duty have got three four night sleep to make up be broad daylight before awoke sergeant got on to foot be evident to edgar that be altogether unfit for walking will saddle camel for sergeant lad will stay where be like enough arab will be swarming about just within gun shot of camp be obstinate beggar know when be fairly beaten if be a active a be might manage to get through on foot man on camel must be sure to be seen be very careful lad how go remember if be seen be lost for fellow must run down to certainty only chance be to get through without being noticed like leaving sergeant must leave lad have food to speak of left will be just a dangerous to morrow next day a be to day besides duty be with corp musket may be needed sooner go sooner will be fetched in very well then will start at once edgar said first went down to river filled two water bottle placed by sergeant side emptied what little food remained in haversack now will do for couple of day if anything must occur to prevent from sending out will do very well lad be not of will be thinking of gladdest sound that ever fell on ear will be tramp of infantry for then will know that have got safely through good bye lad god bless edgar wrung sergeant hand unable to trust to speak turned started through wood have not gone very far when found that grove be by mean large one for tree opened before bore to left hoping that must extend along river bank be not so grove be isolated large patch of cultivated land stretched down to river mile further there be grove whether be more extensive than in now be have mean of telling standing at edge of tree must see several figure on horseback moving about saw at once that be native hussar will want two three day rest expect said before horse be fit to go out drive fellow into town well here go descended bank of river be now low kept along under shelter until reached next grove seemed so much safer where be than must be above determined to keep under shelter of bank until reached camp have gone hundred yard farther when there be sudden exclamation on bank above almost at same instant spear struck helmet from head turned round brought rifle to shoulder in moment arab on bank be joined by score of others who with loud yell rushed down upon illustration good bye lad god bless saw that to fire be to ensure death resistance be worse than useless therefore threw down gun held up arm arab rushed upon in body with uplifted spear sword on order sharply given by one who seemed to be leader lowered edgar be however knocked down kicked beaten then cord be placed round body arm felt lifted up carried away be thrown down again in wood animated a seemed to angry discussion be carried on time have picked up good many arabic word not enough to enable to understand discussion have doubt that subject of dispute be whether must be killed at once carried away prisoner a after time be lifted up cord round leg taken off be hurried along with many curse occasional sharp prick with spear judged that in favour of sparing life for present have won day own prospect seemed desperate for time be more concerned at thought that man who be perhaps father be lying helpless in wood vainly expecting return did not consider case altogether hopeless a soon a troop be assembled on river bank must be sure to move forward against metemmeh even if did not pas through wood sergeant might gain sufficient strength to reach edge get sight of join unless one other of alternative took place be lost a to must not blame for misfortune have befallen have taken what seemed by far safest course have not be for accident that one of arab have be standing at moment at edge of river must have got through safely captor have evidently fear of being attacked probably column have gone out to fetch in baggage have not yet returned small force left at zareba on river bank must certainly not undertake offensive operation until came back be sorry now that have not persisted in own opinion remained with sergeant a in day two scouting party might have passed near grove in be concealed however might have made difference arab be evidently swarming about country party must be likely to occupy wood just a occupied one nearer to english camp a approached village arab raised shout of triumph crowd gathered a entered street gesticulating screaming so furiously that edgar thought must be torn to piece however captor forced way through crowd turned off from street entered court yard in centre of stood house of larger size than majority of composed town edgar leg be again tied be thrown into outhouse where lay for hour must hear almost continuous talking in house voice occasionally rose into angry altercation be surprised that have not be killed a entered place for arab if fought with same courage a engaged at abu klea must have suffered very heavily before fell back friend relative of who have fallen must be thirsting for vengeance upon european who fell into power then considered that be probable that people of metemmeh who lived by passage of caravan river traffic must at heart be a much opposed to mahdi a be of khartoum other city force with british have fought at abu klea be composed partly of mahdi regular follower partly of wild tribesman animated alike by mahommedan fanaticism hope of plunder although might unite in attack against christian have little love for other band into whose hand have fallen might be townspeople more probably be member of tribe have be summoned to arrest progress of troop going up to relief of khartoum now that be detained prisoner instead of being at once killed edgar felt that there be strong chance for in couple of day force might attack metemmeh in case might be rescued be however place of considerable size containing at present very large number of fighting men after loss column have suffered in first fight during subsequent encounter general stewart might well hesitate to risk still greater loss than have already suffered by attack upon place be probable that mahdi must send down large body of troop from besieging khartoum a soon a heard of arrival of small british force on river gun might be needed to maintain position repel attack until arrival of reinforcement across desert thus edgar felt to be very doubtful whether attack must be made for present of course a soon a reinforcement arrived boat column came up river metemmeh must be captured by time might be hundred of mile away boat column might not get round for six week while reinforcement coming across desert from korti must have to march for edgar felt sure that must be long time before camel be in condition for work again be well that when filled two water bottle for use of sergeant edgar have taken long drink for one came near until after dark suffered good deal from thirst from pain caused by tightness with be bound began to think that have be altogether forgotten when door of outhouse opened two arab came in seizing a if have be package dragged out into court yard then received two three kick a intimation that must sit up roped a be be unable to accomplish seeing men pulled against wall raised into sitting position against fire be burning in centre of court yard on cushion in front of sat man whom recognized a leader of party who seized other arab be squatted on ground standing round chief be past prime of life still powerful sinewy man feature be not prepossessing edgar looking round thought that expression of face be le savage than of majority of follower doe christian dog speak language of prophet asked speak little arabic edgar replied inwardly congratulating upon trouble have taken to pick up little of language during time have be in answer be evidently satisfactory chief bowed head be good said kaffir be slave in tent of sheik bakhat of jahrin tribe a pointed to edgar understood that captor intended to keep a own property at rate for present bowed head to signify that understood why be english foolish enough to come here sheik asked must know that can not stand against power of mahdi did not come to interfere with mahdi to bring back countryman gordon friend from khartoum will never reach khartoum sheik said bone will whiten in desert edgar did not reply partly because knowledge of arabic be insufficient for discussion partly because be not worth while to run risk of exciting anger of chief by pointing out that a have failed to prevent thousand men crossing desert to metemmeh might similarly fail in preventing force of seven eight time amount marching up bank of river to khartoum therefore remained silent mahdi be invincible sheik went on after pause will conquer egypt after will destroy kaffir take city of rome will capture constantinople if turk deny authority mahdi be great man edgar said gravely although with difficulty repressing smile who can say what may happen then seeing that answer be also considered satisfactory went on slave be hungry thirsty have be wounded bond hurt greatly if be to be of use to will order that food drink be given chief nodded at motion of hand two of follower freed edgar from bond dish containing boiled meal jug of water be placed beside edgar drank deeply be only able to take few mouthful of food a be feverish in considerable pain for wound in arm must have be comparatively slight have proper attention be paid to be inflamed angry arm greatly swollen a further attention be paid to returned to outhouse took off karkee tunic tearing strip from wetted laid on shoulder presently door be closed heard heap of brushwood thrown against effectual way of preventing attempt to escape for a door opened outwards slightest movement must cause rustling of bush arouse arab who be sleeping in court yard there be window edgar seeing that escape be out of question laid down tried to sleep pain of arm be so great that be hour before succeeded in doing so next morning be allowed to go out into yard for time attention be paid to then considerable hubbub be heard in town with much shouting yelling arab ran in at gate with news edgar must not understand hurried word effect be evident men seized arm then at sheik order edgar be again securely bound fastened in outhouse in course of hour heard firing first dropping shot then two three sharp volley knew that british be advancing against town that arab have gone out to skirmish with then there be long pause heard sound of english field piece listened for musketry in vain be only reconnaissance said to little gun must not batter down mud wall round town without expense of ammunition must not be afforded doubt troop must take by storm surely general must not risk heavy loss must suffer before got in especially a place must be of use to when took must fall a matter of course when rest of force arrives such being opinion be little disappointed when firing ceased knew by triumphant yell of arab that british force be retiring in short time heard clamour of voice in court yard be presently unbound released kaffir did not dare to attack place arab said exultantly have gone back to camp in day two there will be force here from khartoum berber then will destroy make slave of four day later there be great firing of musket triumphant yelling in street edgar felt very anxious fearing that expected reinforcement have arrived that tremendous attack be about to be made upon camp did not believe that have already taken place for felt confident that pain have be taken to strengthen position that in number assault might be made must be repulsed presently however sheik deigned to tell cause of rejoicing there be news from khartoum said city have be taken englishman gordon follower have be killed news be certain have be brought down to by tribesman on side of river told that mahdi be irresistible blow be terrible one to edgar in first place be grievous to think that expedition have be made in vain that owing to in authority at home delaying for month before making up mind to rescue gordon have failed in object that noblest of englishman have be left to die unaided by who have sent out thought of intense disappointment must be felt by troop of grief that there must be in england when news be known then wondered what must be done next be evident to at once that own position be altogether changed have before felt confident that unless captor moved away from town before arrival of main body of expedition must be rescued now seemed altogether uncertain whether expedition must come at so long a gordon be alive england be bound to make effort to rescue now that companion be dead khartoum have fallen might not feel called upon to attempt reconquest of soudan be probable however that must be best in end cheapest way out of difficulty here be force have at enormous expense be brought up almost to within striking distance of khartoum must be relied upon to make way thither to defeat army of mahdi to recapture khartoum without very great difficulty provision store have be purchased brought up scarce outlay additional to already incurred must be entailed by operation upon other hand to retire now must be to leave whole soudan in hand of mahdi fanatic must mean destruction of settled government established by egyptian must expose egypt to incessant invasion must be bound to repel common sense humanity even economy seemed to favour advance of force to khartoum british people roused to anger by fate of gordon must probably call loudly for vindication of national honour for act of retribution on murderer of gordon edgar felt that way out of difficulty might present to authority at home be not unlikely that counsel of who from first have be against expedition must prevail that must retire to egypt without striking blow in case seemed that there be nothing before lifelong slavery edgar however be at age when hope be not easily relinquished may be slave long time said sooner later will escape will get to speak language like native be already almost burnt to colour will ere long be able to pas a one of be hard indeed if after time can not manage to escape to make way back to egypt down to red sea into abyssinia if did not feel sure must do one other must do something must make kill at once chapter xiii abu kru sergeant bowen edgar be by mean only men who straggled away from main body during terrible night march from well of abu klea many straggled managed to rejoin column in morning others wandered away be never heard of again morning found exhausted worn out men animal still at distance from nile mile away long line of verdure showed where river lay general felt that at present men must do more that halt for hour be absolutely necessary party of enemy horse foot men must be seen among sand hill distant shot have already be fired object of terrible march have failed be no longer possible to reach river without fighting again to fight a be encumbered with baggage train overpowered with fatigue be to court disaster therefore halt be ordered to soldier order be unwelcome tired a be must rather now that river be four mile away have pushed straight on have done with condition of animal positively forbade camping ground be chosen on bare gravelly place on scrub where ground rose slightly work of unloading arranging camel at once began before be concluded dropping fire be opened by native from long grass bush in distance troop be set to work to erect zareba with saddle biscuit box other store while party of skirmisher endeavoured to keep down fire of enemy however be difficult task a native be entirely concealed men must only fire at puff of smoke arising from grass bush to arab however camp presented clear mark sharp rap of musketballs a struck wall thud with buried among crowd of kneeling camel be very frequent several men be hit soon after nine o'clock report spread through camp sir herbert stewart have received very dangerous if not mortal wound news caused deep sorrow throughout troop general be most popular with officer men there be not one felt that loss must be personal one be moreover most unfortunate for expedition at moment to be deprived of leader before starting colonel burnaby have be designated to assume command in case of accident happening to general burnaby have fallen at abu klea therefore devolved upon sir charles wilson who be accompanying force solely in diplomatic capacity who be to push up river in one of steamer communicate with general gordon a soon a force reached nile soon afterwards order be given that ridge of ground sixty yard distant on right front must be occupied a from point ground beyond be commanded to considerable distance enemy thus prevented from gathering for sudden rush from direction skinner easton be lying down together under cover of wall when order be given skinner be energetically denouncing night march present halt easton be smiling quietly occasionally pointing out difficulty must have ensued have companion view of matter be adopted be beastly lying here doing nothing skinner finally grumbled well there be occasion for to do so easton said a officer passed along saying that volunteer be required to carry box to build small work on ridge skinner at once jumped to foot ran to pile of biscuit box seized two of swung on to shoulder started for ridge easton followed in more leisurely fashion number of other officer men at once set about work be not pleasant a soon a concealed enemy saw what be being done directed fire upon party bullet flew fast across ground have to be passed over several men dropped work be continued vigorously in course of hour small work be raised upon ridge half company placed there a garrison hour after hour went on fire of enemy getting heavier heavier men dropping fast well easton what do think of now skinner asked think be most annoying easton said can not think why do something suppose general being hit have upset arrangement if be going to move see what advantage there be in putting off be a if be getting rest here hope to goodness be not going to wait here until dark hour stop add to casualty hear two of special correspondent have be killed cameron of standard st leger herbert of post camel be being killed in score four twenty hour of work there wo be enough men left to fight way down to river have got to be done might just a well do at once be not until half past three that welcome order be given to prepare to move forward portion of heavy camel regiment hussar naval brigade be left behind with three gun to hold inclosure while rest formed in square a at abu klea advanced camel with wounded be in centre marine grenadier formed front of square coldstream scot guard be on right mounted infantry on left sussex remainder of heavy in rear fire of enemy redoubled a square set out on way halting occasionally to fire few volley at spot where enemy fire be thickest square made way gradually onward keeping a much a possible on ridge so a to avoid being surrounded by enemy placed in commanding position at last fire of arab suddenly ceased great crowd several thousand strong headed by many horseman charged down upon face left flank of square be five hundred yard away cheer broke from british square when be evident that long suspense be over supreme moment at hand volley after volley be fired then seeing that fire be taking little effect knowing that nothing discourages men so much a seeing fire fail to stop rush of enemy sir charles ordered bugle to sound cease firing order be obeyed men stood steady until enemy be within three hundred yard then bugle call commence firing sounded from front left face of square sweeping volley be poured into crowded mass aim low fire steadily men be shout of officer so well be obeyed that front rank of arab be mown down like grass for time still pushed forward fire be too terrible to be withstood although few of leader arrived within fifty yard of square follower hesitated when still at distance of hundred hesitation in case of charge be fatal storm of bullet still tore way through mass arab wavered turned be soon in full flight battle have lasted few minute victory be complete three hearty cheer broke from victor there be halt for few minute for men to fill up pouch from reserve ammunition to have drink of water then moved forward again confidently expecting that attack must be renewed arab have have enough of square moved on without interruption until hour after sunset reached river wounded be at once carried forward to water then troop be marched up by company in turn be permitted to drink fill then guard be posted exhausted troop threw down on ground object of long march be attained nile be reached thenceforth there must be further suffering from want of water next day communication must be opened with gordon steamer friend must in morning be fetched in from zareba then there must be long rest until boat column arrived remainder of force from korti marched across to join in morning easton went across from own company to marine where be mr skinner asked sergeant be down with wounded at river sir have left arm broken by bullet just a left zareba be just in front of at time made shift to bandage arm tied up to body then took place in rank again kept on with until got here then when halted fainted right off carried down to hospital camp by water easton at once went down to visit friend be lying on stretcher well skinner be awfully sorry to hear that got hit how be feeling old man can not say much for just at present be only about hour since finished bandaging up putting on splint just stopped bleeding last night then asked to leave alone until morning have lot of serious case to attend to mine must keep well enough besides be so weak with loss of blood so really done up felt must not stand more then be asleep in very few minute however arm woke up before daylight be glad enough to have put in proper shape though hurt deucedly can tell however be comparatively easy now hope will be right by time advance begin what blessing be having shade water here be indeed easton agreed now must say good bye for know what be to be done be sure to be under arm directly troop moved off in few minute after easton returned to company after carefully examining ground small village named abu kru few yard from river on rising ground entirely deserted by native be selected for camp wounded be at once carried up there be left in charge of heavy while guard mounted infantry started for zareba sussex being sent out on right to watch metemmeh keep enemy in check must advance against village water skin camel tank be filled for little water have be left at zareba men although have scarcely eaten food for last forty eight hour started in good spirit perfectly ready for fight must enemy try to stop although large number of gathered on hill near town abstained from attack column reached zareba where be received with hearty cheer by little garrison have not be attacked during absence although scattered musketry fire have be kept up upon until dark to replied vigorously gun have done good service to square while on march by keeping up shell fire upon body of enemy must be made out on eminence near garrison have suffered great suspense after square have disappeared from sight for must see large body of men hurrying in direction anxiety be great when sudden outburst of musketry told that square be attacked what issue of fight have be knew not hope that arab have be defeated increased a time went on attack be made upon for have enemy be successful must speedily have poured down to attack of feebly defended baggage a soon a column arrived work of pulling down wall of box saddle getting camel to foot loading began so many of camel have be killed that number surviving be insufficient to carry down store therefore smaller redoubt be left untouched stronger garrison than before placed in rest moved down to river troop partook of hearty meal before start be made sir herbert stewart rest of wounded be taken down in cacolets with column rupert clinton have remained in zareba when square have marched forward have be greatly exhausted by night march have have slight sunstroke before square moved out doctor have therefore ordered not to accompany to stay at zareba assist general other wounded be looking very shaky clinton easton said when joined be all right to day replied rather heavy about head bath long night rest will set up again skinner be right hope be sorry to say have got left arm broken saw for moment before started got hit just after left here stuck to company through asked one of surgeon said that unless fever anything of sort came on be likely to go on right that did not think that there be much chance of losing arm have plenty of pluck skinner have must think so rupert said fellow who must play uphill game of football a must can be trusted to keep courage up under circumstance do know what be going to do easton be going to attack metemmeh have not least idea be big place lot bigger than expected there be tremendous lot of fighting men there be fortunate did not make rush at together yesterday although think must have made difference must be very risky thing to attack place a swarming with fanatic with present force must be too big to hold if took might lose two three hundred men in attack street fighting a be said that big force be coming down river to attack must certainly be risk big one to lose lot of men in attack on place will be able to take without difficulty a soon a rest of force come up expect will try reconnaissance if arab bolt find that can take place without hard fighting will take if show determination to stick there defend to last think will leave alone column returned to river without meeting with opposition be evident from number of arab who be seen moving about in direction of metemmeh that check of previous day have by mean disheartened that be still in very considerable force in around town late at night order be issued for troop to parade at past four in morning leaving small force to guard abu kru a be sometimes called gubat rest of troop marched towards metemmeh two village deserted by inhabitant be passed then view be obtained of town crowd of arab be seen outside wall officer in command of company of grenadier be marching in extended order in front of column picked out twenty of best shot ordered to elevate sight to two thousand yard fire five volley great a distance be effect be considerable with aid of glass two three of enemy be seen to fall rest scattered in direction speedily took shelter within wall seven pounder then opened fire shot produced little result simply punching hole in mud wall troop then moved nearer marching along southern side to see if place suitable for assault must be discovered everywhere wall be loopholed incessant fire showed that be strongly manned krupp gun on wall presently opened fire with so accurate aim that column fell back short distance at moment cheer rose a four steamer be seen coming along river flying egyptian flag ran towards shore landed two hundred negro soldier with small brass gun be speedily placed into position beside seven pounder negro infantry advancing in skirmishing order opened fire at once brought news that gordon be still holding out also three thousand of enemy be on way down be two day march away news decided sir chas wilson against running risk of materially weakening force by assault on town column fell back to abu kru on way portion of guard regiment be told off to search grove plantation to see that there be arab lurking there presently came upon two camel grazing in grove search about well men officer in command said owner may be hidden somewhere close in minute two one of men called out here be two saddle sir hidden in bush be scarlet belong to one of regiment officer speedily gathered to spot be certainly saddle officer in command said how in world did camel get here suppose must have wandered away during night march be picked up by of arab driven on here be riding camel one of others put in must have belonged to of men who be missing on night march poor fellow be killed doubt may have ridden on here easton suggested after got separated from column camel may have smelt water come on here before daylight broke be true easton see one of saddle have blood stain on perhaps rider be wounded will search grove thoroughly search be renewed in few minute sergeant ran up to group of officer have found man sir belongs to heavy be insensible officer hurried to spot yes poor fellow be sergeant of heavy doubt be right easton see have be wounded in side look in bad way there be two water bottle by easton said one be empty other be half full added a took up shook must have comrade somewhere doubt have easton must scarcely

thought when be talking over that missing man be brother then think have be killed rupert said hoarsely know that clinton may have be made prisoner see have searched ground between grove camp thoroughly to day have be killed there think must certainly have found of course may have happened further out on plain if be making way out to join square must think must never have done for arab be swarming round besides hussar be scouting about over plain morning if have seen body of of men must certainly have reported arab in fight never show mercy if came upon by might very well have carried off a prisoner especially if made resistance see be slave dealer at heart besides might think that white prisoner must be acceptable present to mahdi of course know more about than do must say that chance be quite a great of being taken prisoner a of having be killed one be a bad a other rupert said in broken voice be awful easton will walk up to camp again must mind seeing colonel of regiment officer of troop find out what can about easton soon found one of few surviving officer of edgar troop can tell anything about trumpeter smith asked have reason to believe that be relative of friend

with party to search plain to see if can find body be more inclined to think that have be taken prisoner easton said must hardly have gone out to meet square a must have seen plain swarming with arab that have chance whatever of getting through must have known that be making for water that must have far better chance of reaching by waiting until got there own idea be that did wait that arab came upon somewhere between grove camp if so did not kill for if have done so must have found body to day for searched foot of ground think that be prisoner in hand have better have be killed at once officer said agree with except that be just possible that slave may escape see on way up to khartoum if defeat mahdi troop certainly will do country will doubt submit there must be in first place chance of being given up to in second of escape be possible officer agreed certainly must not build on that probability be that if be taken prisoner will be sent to mahdi if be killed at once when get there will be when mahdi see that game be up easton nodded then thanking officer for information took way up to village where repeated to rupert what have heard own voice faltered a told story while

tom went on day night round metemmeh hard work upon troop be engaged kept for most part in good health wounded did extremely well doctor being surprised at rapidity with wound healed men recovered strength effect doubtless due to clear dry air troop in village enjoyed better health than down by river a obtained benefit of air from desert while down near stream heavy dew fell at night there be several slight case of fever looked eagerly for return of steamer from khartoum with news how thing be going on there a for own position one have slightest anxiety news have be received of approach of three thousand troop have be reported a on way down against felt confident in power to repulse attack that enemy at metemmeh must make against be too in hourly expectation of arrival across desert of reinforcement from korti chapter xiv slave although edgar have felt disappointed when sound of firing round metemmeh died away knew by triumphant shout of arab that british have retired have hardly expected that attack must be made upon town until reinforcement came up consoled with idea that within few week at utmost reinforcement must arrive that if arab remained in town until time must be rescued two three day later heard great hubbub just after nightfall in street outside arab who be in court yard snatched up gun din became louder than before above uproar edgar must catch word death to kaffir send to mahdi guessed that own fate be subject of dispute picking up one of arab sword determined at least to sell life a dearly a must for hour fate trembled in balance at time there be lull in tumult while few voice only raised in furious argument be heard then crowd joined in again yell became deafening moment edgar expected to hear clash of weapon to see little party to belonged driven headlong into house followed by mahdi men have before witnessed many arab dispute knew that however furious word gesture might be comparatively seldom came to blow though greatly relieved be not altogether surprised when at last uproar quieted down captor returned into court yard barred door behind in short time argument broke out almost a furious le loud than have taken place outside sheik have evidently own opinion be determined to maintain two three of follower sided with rest be evidently opposed to from few word edgar must catch in din gathered that sheik be determined to carry off a own particular slave while bulk of follower be in favour of handing over to mahdi officer arab be obstinate sheik happened to be exceptionally obstinate determined even for arab have mahdi officer recognized right to captive offered small present in return for slave must probably have handed over willingly enough that must threaten insist on handing over property be considered outrage to dignity independence be independent sheik to be treated a if be nameless slave ordered to surrender own to mahdi anyone else never must slay slave stab to heart rather than submit to be thus trampled on if follower did not like be free to leave to put on white shirt follow mahdi must do without such men well enough what must mahdi do for must send to be shot down by kaffir a have be shot down at abu klea outside town someone else must posse wife camel field if liked that must go went to gate unbarred threw open pointed to street effect be instantaneous arab have desire to become

until be over will be sensible at last asked surgeon a stood by litter possibly surgeon said have great interest in asking doctor be most anxious to have few word with if possible before dy if will

few drop of spirit between lip moistened forehead with sponge dipped in vinegar water do know humphreys rupert asked be rupert clinton dying man face brightened then lip moved where be smith left to get help never returned be away now rupert said anxious not to disturb dying man when got to be insensible be two day ago edgar be not in camp at present there be letter for yes be found on have read

on bible by one who knew that be dying thank rupert said be strange story will tell day after leaving hospital rupert went to easton in whose judgment have great deal of confidence after stating what have occurred asked if in opinion must take step to learn more about edgar think clinton be in place must go to commanding officer tell have learnt that trumpeter who be with wounded sergeant of heavy found in grove who left to fetch aid from camp be brother can say that on account of misunderstanding left home enlisted under false name beg that search be instituted for body also that politicals who be in communication with native must make inquiry whether white captive have be brought into metemmeh if like will say a much to colonel be sure that will give order whenever detachment go out strict search will be made of ground over pas be afraid that if do learn from native that be at metemmeh chance of getting back before take place be small for even if people into whose hand fell be willing to part with for ransom fanatical dervish must not allow however there must be harm in trying know that to day dozen native came in with cattle grain doubt others will be in to morrow rupert took advice at once went over to quarter of officer in command made statement that easton have suggested colonel expressed great regret promised that step must be taken to ascertain fate of brother to endeavour to recover if alive party be sent out in morning further most minute search made of ground between camp grove where sergeant have be found th hussar be directed while scouring plain to search depression to examine clump of bush to discover if possible body of missing soldier sign of clothes accoutrement political officer closely questioned native who came in came from village higher up river news be obtained of what be going on at next day there be great outburst of firing in metemmeh gun cannon being discharged incessantly for two three hour at first be thought that dispute might have arisen between various tribe now occupying place idea be abandoned when be seen that cannon on wall be discharged not into town towards open country be then concluded that great festival of mahdi be being celebrated following day be sunday just a troop be being formed up for church parade staff officer came up to rupert fellow aide de camp a be buckling on sword be anything wrong major rupert asked a saw that officer be much agitated yes have terrible news boat have just come down from wilson with news that arrived too late that khartoum have fallen that gordon be murdered exclamation of horror broke from two young officer do think be true major fear there be doubt of steamer got up to town mahdi flag be flying everywhere vessel be peppered with shot from battery there be other bad news wilson steamer ran aground can not be got off beresford be to go up bring party off be if can fight way past battery see be what firing in metemmeh yesterday be about doubt messenger have arrived from mahdi with news of fall of khartoum say anything about of course news will not be kept from officer be to be kept from men a far a possible feeling almost stunned with news rupert companion joined rest of staff proceeded to parade ground hour after service have concluded terrible intelligence be known to officer feeling of grief indignation rage be universal effort suffering have be in vain money spent upon expedition entirely wasted gordon egyptian garrison at khartoum have perished seemed not unnatural that authority at home must be blamed for hesitation have displayed in sending out expedition to rescue heroic defender even at last moment have countermanded order for purchase of camel have be available must have enabled general stewart desert column to march straight across instead of being obliged to send camel backwards forward in case steamer must have arrived in time to save gordon for be two day before reached khartoum that town have fallen never be expedition so utterly useless never did brave men who have fought way through difficulty find effort so completely vain news must not long be kept from men word of passionate grief indignation that burst from officer be soon caught up carried through camp rank file joined with officer in wholesale denunciation of who be responsible for disaster have suddenly overtaken expedition future be warmly debated among officer maintained that expedition having come so far money having be laid out must be allowed to finish work to proceed to khartoum to recover city crush mahdi restore peace order to soudan others asserted that after failure to carry out main object of expedition authority at home might now hasten to withdraw expedition have only with apparent reluctance sent out at rupert feared that latter alternative be most probable with hope of seeing brother before long be dashed to ground be maddening to think that be lying helpless prisoner in hand of arab in mud walled town two mile away for be now probable that force must march back edgar be left to fate easton skinner in vain attempted to cheer have however no argument to combat conviction that expedition must be abandoned must only fall back upon belief that sooner later edgar must manage to make escape from hand of arab to rupert distressed mind be poor consolation lord charles beresford at once started up river in small steamer to rescue sir charles wilson party a be known that there be strong battery below spot where steamer have be lost that beresford must have to run gauntlet of on way up much anxiety be felt a to result constant eager watch be kept up for sight of steamer on return when time came that be expected to make appearance sign be visible of anxiety heightened when day passed still did not return grave fear be entertained for safety at last welcome news came that smoke must be seen ascending from river higher up loud cheer burst from men when flag at masthead be seen above tree there be general rush down to shore of who be not on duty to hear news when arrived when drew up near bank first party landed be found that escape have be narrow one indeed in passing battery have have sharp engagement with artillery there shot have passed through boiler disabled have be obliged to anchor fortunately be little above battery when took place gun must not well be brought to bear upon although assailed by constant fire of musketry own gun gardner rifle of troop have kept enemy at distance prevented from shifting of gun so a to play upon until officer of naval brigade who be acting a engineer have managed to repair boiler while fight be going on sir charles wilson party be upon island near second steamer have sunk two mile higher up river be hotly engaged with force upon bank be able to see that rescuing steamer be disabled at night have crossed to river bank marching down to point opposite steamer opened communication with by signal then did what must to divert attention of enemy from by opening fire upon battery with one of gun causing enemy to turn two three of piece of artillery against at nightfall marched down river to point where steamer have signalled must pick up steamer ran past battery in morning fortunately escaped without serious injury then picking up whole of sir charles wilson party came down river without further molestation illustration shot have passed through boiler time despatch of kind have be received from korti although small reinforcement consisting of company of naval brigade battery of artillery have arrived camel rather portion of for nearly half have died upon journey have returned from gakdul with supply of store day passed heavily until on th of february general buller th royal irish arrived hope be entertained a be seen approaching that appearance of infantry signified that expedition be still to continue to advance be very soon known that royal irish have merely arrived to cover retreat next morning whole of wounded be sent off under strong escort then work of destroying store have be brought up by last convoy except what be needed for march down to gakdul be carried out two day later fort have be built with so much labour be evacuated whole force set out upon march down to korti time journey be performed on foot camel of three corp of vast baggage train with have started be bleaching on desert scarce enough animal remained for service of carrying down sick wounded rupert clinton be among strength have failed rapidly sort of low fever have seized have for day before convoy started be lying prostrate in hospital line skinner be at own request carried by same camel that conveyed rupert bed being swung one on side of have protested that be perfectly capable of marching doctor must not hear of when found that must accompany rupert be glad that decided against a be able to look after friend to keep up spirit to certain extent by talk several of wounded died on way down among sir herbert stewart who have survived wound much longer time than surgeon have at first believed possible one piece of news that have learned day before left neighbourhood of metemmeh have slight effect in cheering rupert native of town having reported that white prisoner have be brought in on day after battle near town have be captured by men of jahrin tribe not by regular troop of mahdi three four day later there have be quarrel mahdi people wanting to take prisoner send up to khartoum captor have objected claiming a private property a be only small party must doubtless have be taken from by force have not during night stolen out of town with taken boat crossed river made off thus there be evidence that edgar be still alive skinner endeavoured to impress upon rupert that in respect intelligence be favourable see clinton if brother have be sent up to mahdi villain must have endeavoured to force to change religion edgar must never have done in case be pretty certain that must have chopped head off a be chief of arab who took evidently mean to keep a slave for of course be not pleasant to be slave be better than having choice between worshipping greasy arab having head chopped off will give time to learn language to make plan of escape to carry out rupert be too weak ill to fully enter into question did see that edgar position be certainly better under arab master than must have be have be sent up to khartoum knowledge that be alive be in immediate danger of life did much to revive enable to bear weary journey down to korti better than must otherwise have done once there comparatively cool air of hospital tent quiet supply of luxury soon have effect in course of three week be up about though must be time before must be fit for active duty be still altogether uncertain what decision must be finally arrived at at home respecting expedition for present troop be stationed at various point on river a far down a dongola be hoped that later on advance against khartoum must be recommenced rupert a soon a be able to get about have long conversation with major kitchener political officer who be in charge of communication with native related to circumstance of brother capture how be prisoner of men belonging to jahrin tribe major kitchener promised that spy must make inquiry held out hope that by offer of large reward captor might be induced to bring down to camp time passed very slowly heat increased in intensity became intolerable from nine in morning until five in afternoon between hour there be nothing to do to lie still in mud hut that have now be erected for must have be well nigh impossible to exist in little tent that troop have brought with in early morning in evening one bathed in nile then officer of whom have picked up sort of pony from native went for ride chased wild dog wandered gun on shoulder in search of such game a be to be found after sunset be only really pleasant time of day when moon be up officer men enjoyed on dark night walking riding must be indulged in so broken be ground there be nothing to do to talk sing vary tedium by game of card guard camel regiment be posted close to dongola rupert who since death of general stewart have longer staff duty be attached to transport corp spent considerable portion of time going up down river in boat did not therefore see much of friend although never passed dongola without managing to make halting place so a to have few hour talk with have thoroughly picked up again clinton skinner said a arrived upon one of visit one must know to be same fellow who be brought down to korti with on wretched camel back think be very lucky to have got put on to transport work so do skinner give little time to sit think though be terrifically hot in middle of day can always manage to get up sort of shelter with straw matting of kind at rate be cooler there than on shore wish must give turn at skinner said can not offer to take oar for although arm be going on very well doctor say may be month before can venture to use in anything like hard work get up jolly horse race here once week in evening native enter animal of course have chance with on little tat sometimes manage to requisition two three horse from hussar dare not ride for though horse pony be very sure footed native ride in wildest way one might get cannoned over still be amusement to look on make small bet watch native crowd of come out to see get tremendously excited over wish must get up good football match guard against dongola must be awful fun a far a running go must not be in if one of got ball must carry right through up to goal for be a active slippery a eel of course when came to good close fight must have own way have managed to get up football on board ship skinner easton who be stretched at full length on ground asked lazily not yet skinner laughed if played at must have to use cannon ball so that must not be kicked over side then unless got iron shoe made for purpose must be laid up have got football in cabin once twice have have game at suakim very good fun be too no news suppose clinton easton asked sitting up rupert shook head not word hear very little of what be going on above native who do come in lie so there be believing word say have be thinking that if one must trust must pay one of sheik to dress up stain skin take with on wandering expedition to khartoum over country on side of river must be madness easton said of course if must talk language perfectly might be possible to manage for suppose that with dye false hair one might be got up to pas a far a appearance go not being able to speak language must be fatal of course must have to go a dumb man be asking surgeon other day if there must be great difficulty in cutting fellow tongue out in doing what easton skinner asked in astonishment cutting tongue out rupert said seriously see if tongue be cut out anyone must see at once be dumb of course must be pleasant believe must be possible to get to talk after time if there be other objection must not hesitate for moment unfortunately must have to pas for deaf a well a dumb for of course must not understand anything be said to have be thinking over in light really only great objection see to plan be that though one might depend upon chief being faithful if be well paid must be very doubtful a to follower be really serious in saying that must have tongue cut out clinton of course be serious rupert said almost angrily what be one tongue in comparison to one brother what do think easton do think idea be at feasible may say that for last two month have be working almost night day at language engaged fellow day came out of hospital be working for one of greek shopkeeper be native of dongola have be down in egypt picked up certain amount of french go about with in boat talk day a long a can keep awake at night of course think for moment must learn enough to pas a native for at least couple of year must be of use going up with party of arab if must not make out what say learn what news pick up make arrangement to get edgar away if find must be fearfully risky business clinton easton said gravely betting must be tremendously against say that be absolutely impossible that must be successful think must be necessary to carry out idea of having tongue cut out a say tongue be nothing in comparison to brother if thought that loss of tongue must ensure success must say nothing against must be matter for only to decide must think might be managed in other way fellow must be with must naturally avoid large encampment must send off to look after camel something if other native arrived at same encampment really mean easton skinner said that seriously think that might be done be that betting be not more than ten to one against think odds be longer than skinner know burton went to mecca in disguise believe that have be done since by somebody else grant that burton must talk language well that having to play part of dumb man add to risk still think a said that chance be more than ten to one against well will think over rupert said must be going now for boat will be loaded by time why did encourage clinton in mad idea easton skinner asked after rupert have left think did encourage told betting be ten to one against coming back alive call that encouraging believe be possible be not at sure that if be in place idea have occurred to must try to carry out chapter xvi in disguise a long a there be chance that expedition might again advance rupert did nothing farther indeed be unable to come to decision a to course have long since received answer from captain clinton to letter written a soon a be well enough to sit up after arriving at korti with news that edgar have be present with expedition be now prisoner in hand of arab captain clinton wrote in great distress said that wife be completely prostrated with news said know need not urge rupert to use mean to obtain news of edgar draw upon for amount however large that may be necessary for bribing native to find if possible rescue fear that latter be hopeless still if see even most remote chance of let question of expense stand in way even promise of reward seemed to to be fabulous failed in eliciting from spy information a to edgar whereabouts certainly be at berber at khartoum have people be with returned to metemmeh beyond negative information rupert must learn nothing continued to work assiduously with interpreter by middle of may have after three month work made such progress that be able to converse in simple phrase to understand what be being said by native around in third week in may on arrival at korti learned that order have day be received that whole force be to at once retire that even dongola be to be abandoned that wady halfa be to be highest point on river occupied that evening went up to general buller tent general be still at mess rupert waited outside tent until returned have several time spoken to general on matter of duty who be that general buller asked a saw figure standing in front of tent clinton sir be particularly anxious to speak to if can spare short time come in general said what can do for take seat there have perhaps heard sir made discovery at metemmeh that brother of mine who have two year half ago run away from school enlisted be trumpeter of heavy who be carried off by arab close to metemmeh yes heard that clinton be very sorry for can not imagine more distressing affair be really fault of that ran away general be under misconception altogether father mother blamed in slightest only say to show that did not run away from wildness one must have be steadier than be be frightful mistake connected with birth need not trouble about be greatly attached to other father mother be completely broken down at thought of being slave for life in hand of arab now sir for last three month have be working almost day night at language can get on fairly in yes general buller put in wondering what be coming next have come to ask if must be good enough to ask lord wolseley to let have six month leave intention be to disguise to go up country with one two friendly native must pas a being dumb a although can make understood in simple matter must of course be detected be native to enter into long conversation with have seen major kitchener to day say that have doubt must arrange with one of sheik for to go with to travel about country with until found brother father have authorized to spend money may be required must pay high enough to make well worth while of of native to be faithful see reason why must not succeed have be speaking to one of surgeon say that if at time be suspected that be not really dumb can in minute burn tongue so with caustic that if open mouth anyone must think have got disease of tongue prevents speaking a to disguise got captain hunter who sketch capitally to make sketch of head of of arab sent down to man at cairo have got up from wig will think deceive anyone be tremendous risk clinton general buller said when concluded tremendous risk know lord wolseley must consider justified in allowing to attempt idea doe honour upon word know what to say to seems mad scheme yet can not say that might not succeed seem to have worked out in own mind to carry through will require not only pluck unfailing watchfulness presence of mind simple word gesture might betray have thought of sir see reason why must be done be quite sure general that if have brother slave among arab must not hesitate moment about attempting general buller did not reply rising put on helmet will go to chief ask said think will feel authorized in letting go ask to authorize officially sir only ask for six month leave of absence even for month leave of absence at end of time of course name must be removed from army list think if ever return must be reinstated if not might get fresh commission granted oh must be all right general must see to wait here until come back in quarter of hour general buller returned come with to chief tent said think that if can convince that have thought matter out thoroughly be prepared at point will give three month leave will get renewed a long a there be chance of turning up alive rupert be most kindly received by lord wolseley who asked many question a to plan after have again explained rupert said major kitchener have kindly promised that if give leave will buy for two of fast camel said there be party came in yesterday with two exceptionally good one that doubt must sell if sufficient price be offered of course must not think of riding on of unless have to run for life until found brother for must at once attract attention native must ride on must have ordinary camel until time came to use fleet one have letter from father authorizing to draw to extent therefore question of money must interfere with carrying out plan thoroughly know what father must say to on return to england must never get back clinton be sure that if father be here must approve sir of course will write long letter explaining whole circumstance be a sure a if stood here that must say be perfectly right in making effort to rescue edgar must never be happy again be to turn face down river now leave to slavery for life among arab well will strain point let go lord wolseley said know whether be right in doing so can not resist desire to carry out scheme for brother rescue be noble attempt clinton honour for undertaking when preparation be complete let see again consider relieved of duty at once thanking lord wolseley general buller for kindness rupert left tent returned to quarter next morning went first thing to major kitchener camp told that question of leave be settled that must start a soon a camel be procured arrangement must be made with one of sheik very well clinton will manage for expect sheik down in three day who have worked faithfully with since beginning of campaign be man have in eye have made journey to wady halfa to point on red sea will know that promise a to payment will be kept that sum be agreed upon must be handed over at place to may take in order to prevent difficulty on score will before start give letter to merchant at wady halfa port requesting to pay sum may agree upon upon presentation of letter with signature attached put in way because be possible that may have to make way alone into abyssinia in case if be satisfied with guide will put name to letter may then obtain money at whichever port may go to of course will explain to will get two camel morning be exceptionally good beast owner will want very long price for camel like be very rare may be mean of saving life will pay want to sir quite see importance of getting be off duty now a sheik be not to arrive for three day will go down to dongola there be one of transport boat starting in hour will want to lay in stock of dye fortunately exact colour be not material for native be shade between yellow black when skinner easton came in from evening ride got off pony skinner entered hut be astonished at seeing native calmly sitting there with usual wild tangled hair dirty cotton cloth wrapped round for moment skinner stood astonished well be cheek exclaimed easton look here here be beast of native squatting in hut sentry what deuce do mean by letting nigger come into hut now then who be what do want what do mean by out go sharp will break neck two young officer for easton have joined friend stood astounded when native broke into yell of laughter be mad easton be mad nigger who have escaped from lunatic asylum skinner exclaimed go near perhaps bite might get hydrophobia how be sentry asked turning to soldier who have come up to door how be let mad nigger come in here did not see come in sir sentry said must have slipped in when back be turned saw officer come in hour ago have seen anyone else well move out sentry prod up with bayonet if wo go sentry be about to enter tent when rupert gasped be enough skinner order out will kill with laughing clinton word broke from lip of easton skinner simultaneously while sentry almost dropped rifle in surprise at hearing officer thus addressed in pure english by native be all right sentry can go easton said recovering first from astonishment then saying a soon a be alone what on earth doe masquerade mean clinton have gone out of mind then think will do easton do easton repeated truth dawning upon mean to say that be going to carry out that scheme talked about month since indeed do easton have obtained chief permission major kitchener be making arrangement for hope in three day to be out on desert again at rate will allow a far a appearance go can pas fairly a native skinner have not yet spoken now walked round round rupert two three time at last gave vent to feeling well be jiggered there be doubt about disguise clinton at least if be clinton not nigger who have stolen voice did ever see such head of hair easton never mind that easton said impatiently understand man that clinton be going away among arab to search for brother did not understand in fact did not hear word be said be too much stunned to do anything stare be really going clinton old fellow yes be off to morrow at daybreak for korti there be good strong breeze blowing will go up a quickly a came down there be delay of three four day before must get hold of man be to go with if will take so ran down here partly to get dye for skin in bazaar here principally to say good bye to wig that so astonishes skinner have made at cairo sent up well there be fear clinton of anyone recognizing a englishman may ride in middle of from here to khartoum must never suspect a far a look go have abandoned that idea about tongue hope yes have got bottle of caustic from one of surgeon put up to say if see that be suspected if slip aside rub one of little stick of caustic over tongue will make such sight of have only to open mouth let look at will believe readily enough that have got frightful disease in tongue can not use in case of necessity can mumble out few word state of mouth will quite account for difficulty may have in understanding will that stuff have got on skin wash off easton asked yes will with little difficulty have got other stuff that interpreter tell will only want renewing once week ten day then for goodness ' sake set to get off clinton put on own clothes let see again a be seem to be able to talk to naturally in disguise will be long time before get talk together rupert at once set to work with soap water nail brush in quarter of hour got face hand tolerably white then put on uniform now be again clinton sit down tell about be plan rupert told arrangement major kitchener be making for companion greatly approved of purchase of fast camel be capital idea if can get good start with may laugh at arab who be mounted on ordinary camel on foot must mind that there be fellow with horse about when make bolt see fellow who led attack be mounted suppose will find that few of principal men in large village have horse now horse will go faster than fastest camel for bit although camel will beat in long distance race what be going to do about arm can not take arm easton must betray at once can not show grant there be reason in world why must take brace of revolver must be stowed away easily enough with couple of box of cartridge somewhere in saddle there be room to hide anything in one of great clumsy contrivance of course pistol must be of use to if be discovered in middle of tribe big town if find brother make bolt for together on camel be pursued must make pretty good fight against dozen mounted men betting be against more than that getting together if have revolver apiece must advise most strongly to take think be right easton will certainly do so have got brace have only one then will have mine old fellow what calibre be yours ah be same a mine have got couple of box of cartridge a be done up in india rubber be sure to be right by way be true that be going down there be rumour last night that order have come yes be to retire to wady halfa what abandon dongola rupert nodded then call beastly shame more than call downright dishonourable action easton said hotly here be going to abandon town of twenty thousand inhabitant to fanatic not only that to give up to vengeance tribe between wady halfa metemmeh who have trusted in promise have thrown in lot with have for last four month be doing transport father used to be proud to call englishman by jove there be very little reason for to be that boer business be shameful humiliating enough be worse still say that be bound to go on to khartoum although must be best cheapest most satisfactory mode in way of settling mahdi ensuring order in soudan do think that be bound to hold river from korti downwards to protect tribe have be friendly to to save town from ruin desolation not only town peaceful village down river besides so long a be here arab will see that mahdi be not powerful may sooner later rise against tyranny well never thought campaign be going to end in disgraceful abandonment of nile valley from korti to wady halfa however went on checking suddenly be of use talking of now have got to think about expedition to three be far more important business how doe arabic get on fairly well say that can talk great deal a have learnt by ear speak with fair accent at least so ibrahim say have taken particular pain with what may call salutation such a one man give a pas other on journey what one say on entering house village can ask for food right return thanks for hospitality ask way sort of thing ibrahim said that in thing must pas very well a native especially a there be slight distinction difference between language of various tribe be very mixed people of arab egyptian negro blood so that a far a go language will pas of course day travel will improve intend a have said to pretend to be dumb whenever come across strong party of stranger sheik will shield a much a possible by sending out to look after camel to gather wood to fetch water on other business whenever be with stranger really think easton have very fair chance of getting through without being found out major kitchener tell that sheik only have two three of tribesman with that have doubt picked men can trust to hold tongue otherwise must get into mess when went back again among people of course men will be promised reward also if get safely through trouble on mind be more difficulty there will be in finding edgar getting off than about in first place there be saying a to direction in men who have got have gone have probably gone to out of way place so a to be out of way of mahdi people ibrahim tell that there be people more pig headed than arab if once make up mind to thing nothing will turn be better a far a risk of edgar falling into hand of mahdi be concerned only make more difficult to find there be saying where may have moved to may have gone far south of khartoum may have pushed away near border of abyssinia may be within few mile of suakim may be in desert crossed disguise from that be likely to be long search be nothing if be successful at last of course great thing will be to endeavour to pick up clue near tribe be very scattered one be to be found dispersed among other tribe way from berber to khartoum on eastern side of river hear that there be branch of who live in desert to west well be likely that edgar master will have stopped in of village among own people if only for few hour be from hope to get clue a to general direction at least in be travelling unless disguised edgar wrapped up a woman something of sort fact of white prisoner passing through be certain to have caused talk however be impossible to say where how may find clue at rate will stick to will tell father that a may take year to find edgar need not even begin to feel anxious until end of time that a will be continually improving in knowledge of language risk of detection will become le le month that anticipate difficulty when time come in passing down to suakim massowah must difficulty arise in direction in working down to wady halfa through abyssinia sat talked until far into night then lay down for few hour sleep at daybreak rupert said good bye to friend took place in boat spreading sail rapidly made way up two friend stood for long time looking after by jove clinton have turned out fine fellow skinner said grand fellow hardly thought have in of course knew be plucky sort of thing be tremendous undertaking be easton said of course now die be cast must not say word last night to discourage risk be tremendous however be going about

to plunder destroy encampment of tribe begging to send to el bahr nile fighting men in order that dervish must have lesson that must be well content to leave tribe alone in future a before woman child be perched on summit of household good on top of camel contrary to usual custom most of men walked a camel be loaded to full extent of power edgar have manufactured for soon after arrival at camp pair of sandal from skin of goat have be killed for food be therefore able to keep up with camel with comfort a be considered that there be occasion for hurry a camel be very heavily laden three day instead of two be devoted to journey even then be very fatiguing one for on foot on arriving at el bahr nile edgar found that oasis be much smaller than that have quitted soil be rocky although there be two large pool of clear water there be little ground round in way suitable for cultivation acacia other shrub however grew thickly down valley showing that there be certain amount of moisture below surface tent be soon erected by side of of first party when fire be lighted camel unloaded taken to water then turned loose to browse among tree place assumed home like appearance can shoot muley sheik said to edgar if give gun will fight against dervish certainly will sheik gun carry long way be wonderful weapon at metemmeh men be killed two mile away yes be good weapon sheik wish have one of here for be afraid must not be able to do much with gun sheik turned to wife fetch out that kaffir gun amina to edgar surprise brought out from tent martini rifle pouch filled with cartridge gun have be found strapped on to one of camel have be captured sheik have appropriated for own use concealing in one of bale so that edgar have not noticed when camel be unloaded understand sheik said be much stranger to than gun must be to tried to put brass thing with bullet sticking out into must not go into barrel will show how to use if dervish come will hand to for understand will do much better with than must show how work sheik astonishment be great when edgar pushed lever opened breech inserted cartridge closing breech said that be now loaded must be fired at once fire at rock said then load again a quickly a can edgar did so in few second be again ready to fire inwillah sheik exclaimed be wonderful wonder that tell that roar of gun be like never ceasing thunder that sound of one shot must not be heard from can take out cartridge without firing edgar showed how be done sheik then repeatedly loaded unloaded gun until must manipulate quickly what be thing asked touching back sight edgar explained to that sight be raised lowered according to distance of object to be aimed at frank be wonderful men sheik said gravely if have true faith allah be with one must stand against when ammunition be used up can make more edgar shook head if have cap to fit in here mould for bullet must refill case two three time after that must be useless powerful machinery be used for making case might be possible to have made by hand by skilled worker in brass in khartoum must be very expensive be afraid sheik when ammunition be gone gun must be useless unless can procure more cartridge from trader in egypt unless indeed countryman have retaken khartoum in case must obtain for quantity of cartridge countryman have retired to korti sheik said edgar gave cry of disappointment have feared that when news of gordon death be known expedition might be abandoned have still retained hope that might advance to khartoum news that have already fallen back to korti came a shock how did learn news sheik asked presently did not say that have spoken to anyone yes went little way into field in hope of catching sight of hamish came upon two peasant who be gathering crop have seen nothing of negro upon questioning a to what be going on at khartoum said that mahdi be still powerful that kaffir have fallen back from metemmeh be scattered along river between korti dongola that mahdi have announced that force must ere long advance conquer egypt destroy kaffir do mean to wait for attack of mahdi men here to go to meet edgar asked after long pause if come here too numerous to fight must fly if be not too strong will give battle here why must go to meet be for to decide edgar said know nothing of arab way of fighting seemed to that might be better if be not altogether too strong to meet a near other well a can why so muley must have water close to must have none if one be wounded must have to be carried long distance why do advise that must fight there told sheik that existence of well be only known to people small section of tribe be so muley be secret have be well guarded wady have served a retreat many time in history if come on of go back again secret will be secret no longer edgar said be for reason thought that have better go out meet there be one man with who know way hither against ball must be directed if kill must be without guide must be unable to find way for must never venture into desert knowing that if failed to find well might perish for want of water speak well sheik said have not thought of see that plan be good one a soon a learn that have arrived at well will set out to meet unless force be altogether too strong for on seventh day after arrival at wady messenger who have be despatched for aid returned news be that greater part of men be away be expected in few day might be week more before came back sheik be unwilling to send off few men at douar promised that a soon a main force returned must set out with whole strength of fighting men to assistance upon following morning one of men left to watch well also returned have come through without stopping reported late in evening before left companion have seen line of camel with horseman coming towards well have waited until morning in order to discover force put down a forty men be very bad news sheik said can only muster eighteen fighting men of be old others mere lad be two to one against if be beaten forced to fly horseman must overtake destroy think over muley be full of expedient how many men do expect to get from other douar encampment be same size a ours be sure to leave of old men to guard perhaps fifteen will come will make force nearly equal to theirs might defend wady though doubt be sure that must beat easily in desert be almost armed with rifle that took at el obeid from hick pasha men will have found abundance of arm at khartoum besides dervish fight desperately faith have in mahdi give strength courage care whether die live doubtless picked men have be sent on expedition fear there be nought before flight unless with knowledge of frank method of war can hit upon plan will think over sheik at present see way in can withstand might of course cut down tree make so strong fort here that might beat off in case might return in much greater number therefore seems to that if fight must fight at other wady then can not fight at sheik said decisively there be two to one against must be madness to attack when must with horseman cut off retreat will think sheik edgar said rising walking away in hour returned have thought of plan sheik be not without great danger care not for danger sheik said so that be possible idea be that must load up camel with closely pressed bundle of forage then that must advance day march across desert there that must form zareba with forage must of course take water skin with with sufficient to last for at least week must send camel back again a soon a be unloaded must order who remained behind to load good upon to set out for other douar of tribe for village to south must send messenger to other douar to say that be going to defend zareba to last praying to come at once to rescue promising moment appear to sally out fall upon dervish while attack in rear messenger must point out that before arrive number of enemy will certainly have fallen in attack upon will therefore be decidedly superior to in point of number plan be bold one sheik said do think that must be possible for to defend zareba think so sheik need be small one twelve foot square inside will have to cross open to attack outside can protect by facing of prickly shrub will do sheik said in tone of determination springing to foot one can die once if succeed will be tale for woman of tribe to tell for time chapter xviii zareba sooner have sheik decided to carry out edgar plan than rapidly issued order in five minute whole of inhabitant of douar be at work boy going out to fetch camel men cutting down long grass near well laying in great bundle very tightly pressed together woman cooking large supply of flat cake for party in two hour preparation be completed twenty men moved off from oasis travelled until ten o'clock in evening by light of moon be four day short of full sheik edgar selected point for erection of zareba be patch of rock cropping up from summit of sand hill fell away from on side be just about size required for zareba camel be unloaded bundle of forage laid down side by side formed into square wall being four foot thick two foot high whole party including boy who be to take back camel then set to work to cut thorny bush be piled thickly at foot of rock round being kept in place by stake driven into sand by rope interlacing work be only completed just a daylight broke think edgar said walking round little fort that men can get through hedge of thorn until have pulled away piece by piece that with lying in shelter above firing down upon will be difficult task indeed arab who have obeyed chief order with reluctance have be very silent upon journey out be now jubilant feeling convinced that must beat off attack of force a heard be advancing camel be now sent off have scarcely disappeared among sand hill when arab be seen approaching on camel be scout sheik said brings news tied cloth to end of spear waved minute later camel course be changed rider soon arrived outside fort what be news yussuf be going to start morning man said crept in a soon a became dark last night made way close up to gathered that have decided to march morning on to wady el bahr nile must not stay where be longer a have only brought with sufficient food for camel for march to wady where made sure must find abundant supply having given day rest be going to push forward at once to next wady where made certain of finding fugitive will be here to night edgar asked sheik must think not muley regular halting place be five mile away a be about way will probably stop there start perhaps hour before daybreak scout be sent off to wady with news little garrison spent day in strengthening fort making hedge of bush three four yard beyond other gathering large number of heaviest stone must find be laid on grass rampart be thus raised in height nearly foot opening being left in stone through defender must thrust gun fire without exposing head to shot of assailant still further added to confidence of arab when be completed indulged in defiant gesture wild yell signifying contempt in direction from enemy must probably advance at two of men be posted a sentry a be possible mahdist might push straight forward there be however alarm during night just a day broke sentry reported that there be horseman to be seen in distance a there be object in concealment leapt to foot nine horseman be seen on brow of sand hill two mile away be presently lost sight of a descended into dip minute two later line of camel be seen following in step spear with cloth be elevated a flag when horseman appeared on next sand hill be evident by suddenness with pulled up horse that saw minute later started again time at canter when came within mile sheik asked why do not fire muley gun will carry distance easily double that distance if necessary sheik be better not to let know that have such gun here until get close will be better for to fire sheik levelled long gun fired horseman at once drew up after little consultation two three of rode off on flank so a to make circuit of unlooked for obstacle while one of others rode back at full speed to meet camel train a soon a arrived rider of whom there be two on animal dismounted camel be led back to hollow where must be safe from stray bullet after short pause one of horseman again advanced at rapid pace made circle round fort at distance of two three hundred yard only scattered fire be opened by defender speed at be riding disconcerted aim having completed circuit rode off with yell of defiance to rejoin party for hour move be made be evident that strength of position have disconcerted dervish who have expected to gain almost bloodless victory a however hamish assured at very utmost sheik must put twenty men in field including several boy old men be finally decided to attack headed by horseman dervish started forward at run uttering shrill yell a did so edgar have persuaded chief that must be useless to open fire until be within two three hundred yard a few shot must tell men must be discouraged by finding that fire did not check advance sheik therefore commanded follower on account to fire until gave order dervish however be not sparing of ammunition fired a ran ball going for most part wide although few whistled over head of defender two three struck rampart now think be near enough sheik edgar who have levelled rifle at one of horseman said a spoke pulled trigger simultaneously with sharp crack of piece arab threw up arm fell from horse sheik five of men fired almost at same moment kneeling a closely a must there be room for seven along face of fort fronting enemy at edgar suggestion chief have divided men into three party of after firing be to fall to rear reload place being taken by others in succession thus there must always be reserve fire must be kept up without interruption volley after volley be fired edgar loading quickly enough to repeat fire with squad so rapidly did arab pas over intervening ground that reached outside hedge of thorn just a party who have first fired have again taken place in front five of dervish have fallen several be wounded have not checked speed for moment under order of leader at once fell to work with sword knife to destroy hedge work be done far more rapidly than edgar have thought possible then fell upon more formidable obstacle piled up against rock attacking on three side simultaneously defender now fired independently a fast a must load edgar shouting continuously steady steady take good aim time sheik re echoing word arab however be too excited to obey greater part of shot be thrown away several of dervish have fallen process of clearing away hedge proceeded with alarming rapidity work be however speedily abandoned at face where edgar be stationed for at crack of rifle dervish fell leaving three of men to defend face rest joined defender at side sheik taking command on one side edgar on other fire now became more steady sheik enforcing order by vigorous blow with staff of spear while edgar rifle on side more than made up for want of influence with men in fury several of dervish sprang boldly into midst of thorn strove to climb up be met by spear of defender not one gained entrance be le than ten minute after first shot have be fired when leader of dervish seeing how fast men be falling that must soon be no stronger than defender of fort called off from attack a turned ran defender leapt to foot with yell of triumph dervish turning round fired several shot sheik received ball in shoulder two of companion fell dead others at once took to shelter again kept up fire until long after last of dervish be out of range moment retreat began edgar looked out for man of whom have not hitherto caught glimpse in heat of conflict soon caught sight of taking steady careful aim with rifle on stone fired hamish fell headlong forward ball having struck fair between shoulder yell of triumph rose from arab traitor who have brought mahdist down upon be punished one man who must guide foe to wady be killed a soon a enemy got out of reach of shot gathered in consultation defender must see that discussion be excited violent waved arm stamped seemed on point of coming to blow with other while be so engaged garrison looked out at field of battle round fort le than fifteen of assailant have be killed while of defender two one old man other boy have fallen sheik begged edgar to bandage shoulder seemed to feel pain little so delighted be with issue of contest edgar soaked pad of cotton cloth laid on wound then with long strip of same material bandaged arm tightly to side with other strip fastened a well a must pad in place be scattering over sand hill one of arab said just a have finished in short time dropping fire be opened at fort arab must have replied sheik said that be waste of powder for gun must not carry a far a rifle in hand of dervish be better that must lie quiet behind shelter allow enemy to throw away fire what will do next do think sheik think will make attack muley at rate not in daytime must know be not greatly superior to in force being now twenty five to eighteen doubt many of be wounded may try to besiege will know that have supply of water must never have shut up here without will fail in time own supply will fail edgar said probably have only brought enough with for what supposed must be two day march to wady must think muley will send camel back to well perhaps with one of wounded men wounded man will remain there in charge of other will bring two three of out with full water skin can make journey there back two day can bring enough water for men horse think will send horse away will do with small portion of water if greatly needed must start from here at sunset keeping among sand hill until out of sight reach well drink fill be back in morning if attack at night will be between setting of moon daybreak must hardly think must do edgar said will soon restore thorn hedge must scarcely be mad enough to attack when know that have protection be almost a strong a be if be not that want to know way to wady must say that must venture to sally out march back must cost good many life for horseman must ride on ahead dismount open fire on from sand hill be off again on horse when went up to attack think can not do better than follow original plan water will hold out for week by putting ourselves on short allowance at end of day two if find that be determined to wait can make last for nearly fortnight long before tribesman ought to be here in case only mounted men will escape three of horse lie dead outside so there be five left ah if must cut off sheik said in tone of fury then might be safe for long time if of get back to tell tale mahdi will send force next time that there will be resisting edgar sat thinking for minute two have idea sheik said at last send off one of boy a soon a moon set let go to el bahr nile when friend arrive will tell of repulse have given dervish that there be now twenty five of several of whom be doubtless wounded tell that if ten men come to aid can defeat let other ten be if twenty arrive start first turning off track make detour come down at night upon wady there will find one man with camel must not show must hide close at hand then when horseman arrive must make ambush shoot down a pas let go through to well be sure to wait there for few hour can fall upon there let men be ordered to fire only at horse can deal with men after have dismounted great thing be to prevent horseman getting away mawillah muley plan be grand one have be bred in desert must not have better understood warfare what pity be that be kaffir must have be great sheik have be true believer gordon pasha be kaffir edgar replied be greater than sheik be great man indeed sheik said be very father to people there be withstanding fought against for interest lay with slave dealing scattered like sheep yes gordon be great man though a say be kaffir sheik sat in silence meditating upon what seemed to inscrutable problem while conversation have be going on bullet of enemy continued to whistle round zareba will try put stop to edgar said have rifle here a much better than a theirs be superior to gun of tribesman nearest hill be four five hundred yard away on several of arab must be seen sure that be nearly out of gun shot took little pain to conceal edgar rested rifle on stone took steady aim at three of who be sitting together fired yell of dismay came across air two of figure leapt to foot ran back moment later four five others who have be firing from among bush also dashed away while triumphant yell rose from zareba be one enemy le edgar said think others will trouble much in future must know that can be doing harm now discover be not going to have own way will not hear much more of shot be indeed fired occasionally from bush eminence discharge be far apart seemed to be intended rather to show defender of zareba that be surrounded than for other purpose day passed without further event a soon a sun have fairly set defender sallied out repaired hedge enemy probably guessed that be so employed kept up much heavier fire than have done during day edgar lying in zareba replied steadily firing at flash after time firing of enemy slackened defender when have completed hedge re entered zareba through very narrow gap have be left for purpose carrying with one of number whose leg have be broken just above ankle by one of enemy bullet under sheik instruction rough splint be made to keep bone in proper position bandage be then applied four sentry be posted one at corner of fort rest of garrison lay down to sleep twice during night sprang to foot at discharge of gun of one of sentry a movement of enemy followed soon lay down again supposing that alarm have be false one that sentry have fired at low bush that if have really seen man latter have made off a soon a have discovered that garrison be awake vigilant a soon a moon set sheik despatched one of young men to wady instruction be to crawl carefully taking advantage of bush until deemed well beyond of enemy who might be watching then to start at full speed if be fired at be if enemy be still in front of to run back to zareba if be behind to press forward at full speed for hour after have left garrison listened anxiously be under arm now lest enemy must try attack during darkness sound however broke stillness of plain be at last assured that messenger have got safely through for four day blockade continued occasional exchange of shot being kept up dervish however since have learnt range of edgar rifle seldom showed crept among rock bush fired shot then crawled off again to repeat operation fifty hundred yard away when hedge have be repaired on night after fight defender buried own dead in sand short distance off have dragged body of fallen enemy fifty yard away a have siege lasted many day fort must have otherwise become uninhabitable in morning one of arab have yelled to besieger that body be lying fifty yard away in front of fort that four of be free to come carry away bury a chose invitation passed unregarded during next night body be removed sentry be ordered not to fire if heard noise in direction for a edgar pointed out to sheik be important that body must be carried away next day several of arab went out raised heap of sand over horse still lay just outside hedge fourth night after departure messenger returned with news that tribesman eighteen in number have arrived in afternoon must carry out sheik order be mounting fresh camel just a started nine of must hide among sand hill two three mile away must there remain for twenty four hour so a to give time for others to get up to well sheik commanding party have suggested that soon after daybreak defender of fort must sally out advance in direction where dervish camp be situated a if intending to make attack must bring in enemy who might be scattered among sand hill near zareba a soon a engagement began with men must fall upon rear of dervish do think that be good plan muley think so sheik see if merely wanted to defeat one must not wish to rally into one body a great object be to prevent from returning be much better to do a sheik suggests let get together day passed a usual next morning shortly before sunrise defender of fort issued out assailant be on watch from four five different point round zareba shot be fired taking advantage of bush arab advanced slowly under direction of sheik dervish believing that garrison must have be driven from defence by thirst that be now in power rapidly gathered force advanced to meet opponent at first did so carelessly be checked by fall of one of leader by ball from edgar rifle then advanced little more cautiously edgar kept close to sheik will make rush soon said tell men not to fire till rise to foot where be others sheik growled if come will be outnumbered not by much sheik one two of men be certainly away with camel will drop two three more of at least when make rush others be sure to be up directly there look there be on top of sand hill dervish have be firing from enemy have now approached to within hundred yard be just preparing for rush when shout of welcome broke from party in front of be at once echoed from rear dervish sprang to foot in surprise alarm one of leader exclaimed there be few of slay in front first then will destroy in rear with yell of defiance dervish dashed forward sheik party poured in volley a did so then grasping spear sprang to foot edgar alone remaining prone firing four more shot a dervish traversed intervening space there be little disparity of number when party met sheik have at edgar suggestion ordered men to form in compact group with spear pointing outward a great point be to withstand rush until friend came up dervish recklessly threw upon spear in moment be engaged in hand to hand fight edgar feeling that with clubbed rifle must have chance against spear sword of arab kept between sheik two of most trusted follower loading a quickly a must throw out drop in cartridge brought down four men who rushed one after upon seemed age to be scarce more than minute after combatant have closed that with shout ten new comer arrived on scene edgar dropped fresh cartridge into rifle stood quiet have wish to join in slaughter dervish fought desperately none asked for quarter in two three minute combat be over have fallen save three four men who have extricated from fight dashed off at top of speed quickly pursued by exultant victor to edgar surprise did not run in direction of sand hill behind have thought camp be made bore away to south pursuer pursued be soon out of sight edgar turned to see how companion have fared three of have be killed six of others have received spear thrust sword cut more le severe must have gone hard with sheik if friend have not come up must have beaten sheik said that gun of yours must have turned scale have not be for must have be too strong for for be fighting men in prime five six of men be match for in hand to hand fight mawillah have be great day will be talked of long in tribe how with twenty men many of not at best withstood forty dervish so beat that when reinforcement of eight men came to destroyed altogether four may have got away edgar said must have left horse in direction in fled suppose feared that of might crawl out hamstring did picket near camp when first saw friend on hill first thought be that have done wrong not to bid secure horse before attacked now see that must not have found be well sent such order for have done so might have lost time looking for have arrived late for hour unwounded of party be occupied in bandaging up wound of others at end of time men who have pursued fugitive have arrived have caught sheik asked a approached overtook two killed others reached horse man be waiting there in charge of three rode off leading fourth horse never fear men will catch at next well body of fallen dervish have be examined be found that among fallen be leader being distinguishable by gay garment from others who simply wore long white shirt formed with coloured straw skull cap uniform of mahdi men two men who have escaped belonged to rank file joy of arab be extreme loaded fired off musket yelled danced gesticulated did not believe in mahdi follower have come to be considered among a invincible be therefore triumph indeed for tribe that invading party have be annihilated new comer be surprised at finding white man among defender of fort sheik be so proud of possession that did not hesitate to say that successful defence be chiefly due to advice of slave whom described a being although so young great captain preparation be now made for start camel of new comer be brought up from spot where have left on advancing to take part in fight six wounded men mounted camel behind rider sheik three of principal follower mounted behind rider of other four camel rest proceeded on foot two men being left behind at fort with instruction when eight men who have gone on to other wady returned with own camel seventeen camel of dervish be to be loaded up to extent of power with bundle of forage have done such good service a basis of fort for supply at wady

child with camel be halted until news must arrive of result of fight be six mile away be midnight when party arrived great fire have be lighted there be scene of liveliest rejoicing a woman child arrived there be thought of sleep night story of battle be told over over again incident being rehearsed with appropriate gesture even friend of six who have fallen restrained grief for time partly from pride that have died so honourably partly because show of grief must have be out of place amid rejoicing for so great exploit with exception of child edgar be only occupant of douar who closed eye night have waited up until return of camel woman have assisted to unload animal with sheik tent baggage to put thing into something like order have then withdrawn from group of excited talker by fire thrown down among bush distance away have have little sleep from time party have marched to meet dervish be upon advice that have gone felt to extent responsible for result during time siege have lasted scarce hour have passed without rising to see that sentry be vigilant to assure that silence of desert be unbroken night before have not thought of sleep have doubt that arab who be coming to assistance must do best to arrive at right moment still something might occur to detain little although arab have behaved with great bravery hitherto felt sure that in fight in open must be match against fanatical dervish who always fought with full assurance of victory be absolutely indifferent a to own life have seen three time at work held courage in deepest respect next day there be grand feast several kid being slaughtered for purpose following morning caravan be seen approaching whole encampment turned out to meet men discharging gun shouting cry of triumph welcome to new comer

ration after caravan have started sheik called into tent muley said have done great service acted upon advice have turned out well have shown that be brave fighter a well a one strong in counsel have son if be willing to accept true faith will adopt a son will be no longer slave one of tribe edgar be silent for minute two thinking over how have best couch refusal in term must not anger sheik then said be indeed grateful for offer sheik doe great honour be to accept know that even in eye must be viewed with contempt have people captured metemmeh when be there carried off prisoner know well that must have treated with scorn offer people might have made of post of honour wealth among if must have abjured mohammed become christian must have died first must indeed sheik exclaimed hotly honourable men change religion for profit sheik be born follower of prophet be born christian believe what be taught a child be in blood can not be changed be to say word must make mohammedan know well that must say with lip not with heart must be false mohammedan a well a false christian must a easily change colour of skin a religion in heart must be first to condemn despise did do so sheik sat for time stroking chin in silence be right muley said at last man can not change religion a can coat did not think of when made offer a say must rather die thousand death than abjure mohammed though now think worthy to be son to become sheik after might not think worthy did become renegade believe sheik edgar said rising feel deeply kindness of offer so long a remain with will take a much interest in tribe a if be member of will do best to prove faithful slave saved life by refusing to hand over to mahdi will never forget will be ready at time to risk for for kind mistress for tribe have spoken well muley although be sorry can not feel angered at decision edgar saw that interview be over left tent well content that have be able to refuse offer without exciting anger of sheik for two month tribe remained in wady by time forage be running short sheik announced intention of leaving for time of going to el obeid where might obtain employment for camel by trader edgar be pleased at news chance of escape from present position in desert be small indeed opportunity might present during trading journey knew that time must yet elapse before must speak language sufficiently well to hope to pas a native although must make understood fairly comprehend purport of be said to still must gain acquaintance with country learn more of people saw that must not hope to pas a one of arab tribesman that if escape be to be made at must be in disguise of trader in one of town four day later tent be levelled belonging of tribe packed on camel caravan left wady on march across desert chapter xix long search be with mixed feeling that rupert turned on camel to take last view of camp at korti when must see countryman again must ever see journey be sure to be long one there must be constant danger of discovery have to trust entirely in fidelity of three men riding ahead of be true that love of gain be also enlisted on side might well be that must in time conclude must be a well to be contented with good have already received in part payment with two valuable camel instead of continuing to run risk of prolonged journey in company in order to earn sum promised upon arrival in egypt at port on red sea however die be cast have wish to withdraw from task have undertaken with wave of hand towards distant camp turned set face forward to desert sheik be seated upon one of heiries two laden camel followed tied with head rope to tail of one in front then followed one of tribesman on other heirie with two laden camel three more be led by other arab rupert ibrahim brought up rear of procession with three loaded camel following that upon be riding wore cotton cloth passed over one shoulder be wrapped round waist while second formed sort of petticoat sheik must have preferred that must have dispensed with cloth over shoulder rupert pointed out that be really essential to a must while travelling wrap round shoulder so protect skin from ray of sun be naked from waist must in very short time raise blister over whole of body wig with wild tangle of long hair acted a capital protection to head on saddle be fastened long arab gun sword knife be stuck into girdle carried long spear in hand one of baggage camel be laden with store for personal use on journey consisting of number of jar of liebig cocoa milk tin of tea box two of biscuit tin of preserved vegetable case two of arrow root store of medicine chiefly saline draught quinine ipecacuanha eatable calculated must afford morning meal for many month for main article of diet depended of course upon such food a arab must obtain by end of time hoped to have fallen completely into native habit to be able to content with such food a guide might subsist upon at nightfall halted at well be farther to east than desert column have used in march to metemmeh rupert have observed that short time after have got fairly into desert sheik have altered line on be proceeding have have little talk with since bargain have be concluded a arab have considered better that must not be seen together a of other native in camp might notice must meet afterwards circumstance might lead to detection to rupert course taken be absolutely indifferent knew that journey must be very long one a have only to trust to chance sagacity of companion there have be discussion whatever a to route to be taken after time ibrahim weary of silence urged camel on until came up level with of rupert well ibrahim be fairly on way yes lord have cut stick mistake rupert smiled ibrahim have picked up knowledge of english at alexandria conversation abounded with slang phrase used in perfect seriousness there be objection to calling lord when speak in english ibrahim when be talking in arabic be sure always call hamza be what be now what do think of journey ibrahim ibrahim shrugged shoulder be same to better here than in boat soldier man good to fight very rough in tongue call ibrahim sort of name sometimes darkie sometimes mate sometimes call nigger very bad sah one man call cockalorham what be cockalorham sah rupert laughed cockalorum mean nothing in particular ibrahim be rather friendly sort of address mean good sort of fellow be so bad that not so bad then one soldier call jocko that name for monkey sah thing very unpleasant mean anything ibrahim call other sort of name too that so ibrahim said nodding head very funny name often call other blooming something other ibrahim always carry dictionary look out blooming blooming same a blossoming mean plant out in flower ibrahim must not make head tail of lot of other word bad word ibrahim must not understand mean anything ibrahim be just ugly way of talking mean same much ' great ' nothing more le now have better go on talking arabic word like in arabic ibrahim said arab man say what want to say proper word know ibrahim when have seen arab quarrelling shout scream at other though know what say must think be using pretty strong expression whatever may be yes when angry call bad name one understand lord white soldier sailor use bad word when not angry at be habit ibrahim very bad habit a tell doe really mean anything see have turned east went on in arabic ibrahim nodded not go straight to metemmeh said expect sheik be going round by berber such proved to be case for when halted for night sheik explained to rupert by mean of ibrahim that intended to follow course of river for present must keep on edge of desert until have passed point at boat expedition have arrived there must be chance of prisoner having be brought down anywhere in neighbourhood of british a most of tribe have sent contingent to fight white a advanced against metemmeh captive might be anywhere beyond point reached by expedition must be better to search regularly on way up a might otherwise leave behind advantage be that regular caravan track left nile hundred mile below dongola struck across desert to elbow of river below berber that when got upon that route must be supposed that have travelled all along by must thereby avoid suspicion of having be trading with british camp rupert quite agreed with justice of reasoning sheik selected route led through desolate country reached elbow of nile without encountering native save two three small party at well from time left camp course be dictated not only by reason that have given rupert by fear for safety of caravan tribe along main route of travel respected trader passed along free passage be essential to town people lying further in interior interference with caravan route must have be resented punished tribe lying within great loop formed by bend of river be true ishmaelites whose hand be against one who regarded passing through territory a lawful prey sheik therefore conducted march by route little traversed even by native avoiding locality where be likely to be met with be greatly pleased when after ten day travel encamped on bank of river just above elbow main caravan track lay upon opposite side at season of year when nile be very low be fordable at several point caravan often selected western bank of river for passage be now again in comparatively populous country village surrounded by belt of cultivated land occurred at short interval at be received with hearty welcome for since war have begun trade have come almost to stand still two three of camel be loaded with merchandise specially fitted for want of native cheap cotton tinware trinket iron head of tool knife cheap silk handkerchief scarf for woman have be bought from enterprising trader who have set up store at korti few of bale be unpacked at first village at arrived small present be given a usual to chief man of place brisk trade at once commenced a camel be fully loaded rupert wondered what sheik must do with good obtained in exchange consisted chiefly of native cotton other article considerably more bulky than gave for found that have entered into arrangement with head of village by latter agreed to take charge of merchandise until return will be perfectly safe sheik said if return for couple of year if never return will be no great loss since have purchased good with monies have received from if return way camel will be unloaded will pick up good at various village through pas bring down here then sell to trader who have boat in will take down river rupert be now called upon to play part in earnest ibrahim be treated by sheik when in village a two slave while companion exhibited good drove bargain with villager rupert ibrahim unloaded camel drove out to pasture took down to river to drink taking meal a must apart from rest on occasion store be untouched rupert companion made meal on dry date cake of coarse flour baked in ash of fire ibrahim be fortunately light hearted fellow made best of matter joking at idea of arab feasting upon stew of kid mutton while have to content with coarse fare rupert cared nothing about food one way other be now really engaged in search for edgar there be moreover excitement caused by risk of discovery when in village seldom opened lip except to reply briefly to companion talk for chance word might be overheard when spoke be in guttural voice a if suffered from affection of tongue malformation of mouth prevented speaking clearly thus have villager overheard conversation between ibrahim defective arabic must pas unnoticed day after getting away from halting place learned from sheik what have gathered in village native be heartily sick of present state of affair have market for good be deprived of trade upon have hitherto relied few restless spirit have joined mahdi people have gone to war cultivator in general sighed for return of old state of thing of peaceful day enjoyed while under rule of egypt even tribesman of interior be highly dissatisfied none have gained anything from war except who have taken actual part in capture of berber khartoum other city have obtained considerable amount of plunder beyond be worse off than before there be longer profitable employment for camel for trade purpose promise of mahdi have be altogether falsified many of tribe on other side of river have gone down to fight under osman digma at suakim instead of promise of victory being fulfilled have suffered terribly have lost vast number of men suakim be a far off being taken a ever berber great market centre of trade of part of country be said like dead city shop be closed trader have be either killed fled market be empty mahdi soldier treated inhabitant a slave sheik satisfied that there be rumour current of there being white prisoner in hand of tribesman there be white prisoner at people said gordon be killed great number with others of egyptian officer trader with wife family be made slave divided among mahdi officer of white soldier who have come across desert have heard of prisoner being taken why must there be asked beat arab in two battle carried off wounded on camel have be left behind must have be killed at once why do ask sheik have replied that merchant far down river from whom have purchased good have told that white be always ready to pay good ransom to recover of colour who might have be taken captive have advised if must hear of prisoner in hand of arab to ask what must sell for so that on next journey might bring money good to redeem villager have told that must not be for mahdi required captive to be sent to that who refused to acknowledge a prophet be at once put to death have always appeared perfectly satisfied with explanation have turned conversation to other topic doe not show said to rupert that there be captive in hand of tribesman in interior if have must keep secret at rate a long a white troop be on river can only be holding for sake of obtaining ransom think that there must be much chance that brother be in part for have be captor must before now have sent in messenger to one of camp saying that be in hand asking what ransom must be given for be far to south that must look for at same time be wise to make inquiry a go along so that will be always looking before not wondering whether have left behind when reached village few mile below berber stopped for three four day sheik two follower went alone into city to make inquiry returned after being absent for three day saying that be certain that there be white captive in hand of mahdi people there have talked to several tribesman who have fought at metemmeh knew that white prisoner have be taken by party of arab of jahrin tribe trouble have arisen owing to sheik refusing to give up have fled in night with party taking prisoner with beyond fact that have crossed river none have heard anything of a there be now no motive for going to berber permission to trade must only be obtained by large present to mahdi governor party started early next morning struck out into desert made long detour before two day later came down again upon river bank above city then continued journey day later crossed river at ford mile below metemmeh be certain wherever edgar might be must not be in neighbourhood of town for week journey continued at time left river bank journeyed considerable distance to visit tribe village situated in interior sometimes caravan be divided in two portion remaining in charge of one of sheik follower with ibrahim rupert with bulk of camel baggage while sheik with other follower two three camel made excursion to village at distance in case took few good with so a not to tempt cupidity of tribesman of party of mahdi men might come across by time rupert have made considerable progress in arabic thanks to continually conversing in language risk of detection have greatly decreased once twice week fresh dye be applied to from head to foot be now accustomed to scantiness of clothing have completely caught manner gesture of native colour of eye be sole point even close observer must detect a being peculiar in appearance have fallen into habit of keeping partly closed darkened eye lash greatly lessened chance of colour being noticed have moreover by advice of one of doctor before leaving taken with bottle of belladonna small dose of prior to entering populous village have effect of enlarging pupil thus of darkening general effect of eye sheik frequently crossed river with one of follower made excursion among tribe on opposite bank with inquiry news be obtained of white captive be not until three month after leaving korti that caravan approached khartoum be more likely that news must be obtained here than elsewhere sheik have be unwilling to enter town until rupert arabic must fairly pas muster even now agreed that there be little chance of detection in sort of casual conversation in khartoum there must be people from part of soudan slight peculiarity of accent must be little likely to be noticed besides in city there must be le chance of one closely questioning slave of passing merchant than must be case in village before going into town one of sheik follower be sent on ahead with camel with present for of mahdi official upon return with document authorizing sheik to enter city dispose of merchandise caravan set forward be with mingled emotion that rupert entered town here perhaps edgar be captive have possibly be put to death for refusing to acknowledge mahdi here gordon have fallen victim to fanatical zeal hesitation of english government treachery of of troop have led to victory here hundred of egyptian men woman child have be slain here be head quarter of false prophet who have brought such ruin destruction over fertile province upon showing pas to official at ferry leading across to city soldier have be told off to accompany conducted to empty caravansary in city one of arab be despatched with two unladen camel to market place where bought store of provender brought in by country people on return rupert ibrahim fed animal be fastened by rope from head stall to ring in wall of court yard then sallied out with one of arab into town be still busy place although aspect have greatly changed since capture there be egyptian soldier in gray cotton uniform fez official trader in european costume in street shop have formerly held large assortment of good brought up from egypt be occupied by native vending absolute necessary of life mahdi soldier in cotton shirt decorated with rag of coloured cloth carrying gun lounged about street poorer part of native population went about with cowed dejected air food be scarce dear for although mahdi by promising protection to coming in to trade have endeavoured to induce agricultural population to bring in produce for sale invitation be very partially accepted country round indeed have be swept clean of grain during progress of siege fear of mahdi follower be so great that peasant contented with tilling only sufficient for need arab muttered curse beneath breath a walked along while rupert ibrahim followed in silence seemingly paying attention to what be going on around when returned to caravansary found sheik with several of native shop keeper engaged with in conversation at order rupert ibrahim at once began to undo of bale held up good for inspection sheik named price required be at once declared by native to be impossible sheik simply ordered assistant to fasten up bale again have brought way from egypt be not going to give away be not one in time like who will risk beast good on adventure trader have gone down river with white men may be month year before caravan route be open again who be going to bring up good to sell when there be nothing for camel to carry down again when whole country be disturbed there be law order in land will journey on to el obeid kassala will get what price like to ask there trader poured out torrent of expostulation must see good again doubtless be of better quality than supposed so bargain be recommenced after hour considerable portion of good have be brought up be disposed of in case trader arranged to come late in evening with servant to fetch away good have bought must never do one said to let be known that have money sufficient to make such purchase be only by assuming greatest poverty that can carry on business unmolested only few of cheapest good can be displayed to eye of public rest being hidden away to be brought out privately for benefit of special customer sheik be well pleased with result of traffic price have charged be five six fold more than that good have cost sent out one of follower to purchase kid be presently converted into stew after be eaten went out with one of follower leaving other to deliver good to purchaser when became quite dark trader arrived one by one with one two porter to carry away good be paid for in cash drawn from buried hoard sheik be late before returned told rupert that have met kinsman of who be now officer of mahdi have have long conversation with belief in mahdi said have faith that be going to conquer world told that finding trader must hire camel have time brought up load on own account that seemed to there be money to be made if one must purchase of people who have be enslaved when city be taken said that must not be that greater part of trader have be killed that who remained be now zealous follower of mahdi lupton bey be held a slave by mahdi have to run before when rode there must be possibility of releasing others in mahdi hand inquired whether of kaffir who have come to metemmeh have be taken prisoner said have heard of one who be reported by black slave to be in hand of petty sheik who be living at oasis in desert nine day journey from here have already be reported to mahdi that man have taken kaffir prisoner at metemmeh have refused to give up have escaped with kaffir in night strict order have be issued for arrest nothing have be heard of until slave brought news mahdi sent off three officer forty men on camel with order to destroy everything to kill found with exception of sheik white captive who be to be brought here to await pleasure went though be two month ago have never returned party be sent three week later to place to order to return instantly when arrived there found oasis deserted two skeleton be found sun vulture have done work whether have belonged to troop went to arab there none must say may be found that sheik party have travelled to el obeid elsewhere have pursued so far news have be heard of whole matter be mystery what do think have happened sheik know not what to think kinsman said that black slave reported there be twenty men in with sheik not more than half of must be considered a fighting men therefore must not have resisted for moment force against be possible may have fled into desert tribe know of well whose existence be kept secret from may be that well be known to sheik that have made for may be that negro guide led party in pursuit misfortune may have happened may have lost way perished from thirst though must be strange indeed be none able to make way back to oasis what think have better do sheik give indication at least of direction in brother be taken sheik sat for minute without answering be difficult said at last sheik el bakhat be a have told wanderer have heard of though have never met father be powerful sheik a young man el killed son of sheik of same tribe fled later on gathered few follower be in service of slave dealer who go down to great lake of late year since gordon broke up slave trade have returned at time remained for week sometimes for month in part of country occupied by tribe for be so many year now since killed man vengeance be no longer hot against have name of being headstrong man indeed must be so must never have embroiled with mahdi people for if have be driven out of oasis must know that there be safety for anywhere near here where have gone to man must say one might a well try to follow flight of vulture may have gone down near coast may have made way to confines of abyssinia may have journeyed away towards lake where emin pasha still rule in name of egypt there be just one chance may be hiding in desert before start on long journey may return to oasis may send messenger to see if be still occupied by mahdi men think that best chance be to proceed thither at once to wait there for while to see if come from if at end of fortnight three week none come can then decide in direction to set out upon search again proposal seemed to rupert to offer more prospect of success than other on following morning caravan started camel now carrying scarce weight with have left korti a sheik have learned from kinsman name of oasis to troop have be sent have difficulty in obtaining from of tribesman in city precise direction a to route to be pursued ten day after leaving khartoum arrived there place be absolutely deserted established near well camel found abundant grazing a crop have shot up again with great vigour during time have elapsed since have be cut sheik at once pointed out to rupert that although el bakhat of follower be down at probability be that people have occupied place for time a cultivation have be carried on to considerable extent here be where tent stood said see evidently brought back good deal of plunder for here be empty tin jar scattered about remained for three week in camp one of party have be always on watch human being have be seen to approach during time sheik rupert have many discussion a to direction in fugitive have probably travelled finally decided that probability be in favour of having taken southern route made for country ruled over by emin in first place be familiar with line in second must be safe from mahdi when reached be country be rich fertile said probably emin when find be altogether cut off from north will try to open way down to zanzibar el bakhat may find good employment for camel a at rate there be reason why fugitive must have chosen route more than other be decided to follow chapter xx found before starting upon journey sheik said to edgar on journey here travelled by unfrequented track be sufficient to cover up so that none who passed must notice will be different now therefore must dress in own fashion hair can never be made to look like ours must be bound in turban with burnoose face hand only will be visible be now so darkened by sun that fairness will scarce be noticed woman will prepare dye will darken to shade wish to dress like for reason have done great service though will not change religion regard almost a one of tribe wish henceforth to consider a slave be improving fast in language if speak little will pas unnoticed men be more silent than others need speak little when stranger be with a one of will attract le notice than a slave none will say 'where did get fellow to what part did belong be brought from great lake be inclined to sell be likely youth what will take for ' be ready to do what think best sheik edgar said indeed there can be doubt that be far le likely to be noticed if wrapped up in fashion than if went half clothed a slave accordingly low close fitting turban be wound round edgar head be wrapped up in loose cotton garment covered with burnoose hood of came over head face hand neck be slightly stained when be done arab admitted that must not for moment have suspected of being other than seemed most of woman child old men be left behind at wady goat sheep must supply with milk cheese there be sufficient supply of grain for use until crop have be sown a soon a arrived must come into bearing when preparation be complete party started on way consisted of twelve men mounted on camel while two other animal followed behind of sheik rode at head of party upon horse have be captured from mahdist amina also have camel to while four other woman who accompanied party rode two on camel yussuf five six lad of from fifteen to seventeen year old walked by side of camel led camel be lightly loaded carrying only tent cooking utensil provender for journey food water for party edgar must see reason why yussuf boy must not have ridden except that be custom for slave lad to walk be six day journey to point aimed at march be long one supply of water carried be ample for want of party camel be given good drink before starting on fourth day journey be turned loose evening on arriving at halting place left to pick up what subsistence must from bush good feed being given to morning from provender carried a must have carried much more edgar inquired why enough have not be brought to give feed at night a well arab of whom have asked question said that be better for to browse at night a moisture in herbage enabled to do with much le water than if have be fed entirely upon grain edgar be very glad when desert journey be over glare of sun from sand rock be almost blinding wrap in be muffled up greatly added to discomfort on arriving at cultivated land same picture presented that have seen near khartoum everywhere village be almost entirely deserted field lay waste blighting influence of mahdi seemed to weigh upon whole country few native remained fled in fear at sight of stranger old people met with in village be crushed with grief despondency of what use to cultivate land when mahdist might at moment sweep off crop even must gather grain where must sell there be market indeed still open mahdi tax gatherer must demand proportion of proceeds must sweep away profit what be to become of allah alone knew edgar be filled with pity for poor creature over over again thought with astonishment of policy after sending force to within short distance of khartoum amply sufficient to have crushed mahdi to have restored peace comfort to population of soudan have withdrawn when goal be reached left unhappy people to fate after journeying for day passed plain strewn with skeleton see sheik said be remains of army of hick pasha here be attacked by mahdi army defended bravely must advance retreat at last be vanquished by thirst fatigue be slaughtered a stood hick pasha band of officer rode right into midst of mahdist died fighting there there be heard two three kaffir with besides many egyptian officer black troop fought splendidly egyptian made poor stand came to same in end what must do against follower of allah illustration army of hick pasha on march egyptian be follower of allah too edgar said yet a say be poor fighter sheik admit extraordinary bravery of tribesman fought against at suakim saw charge down upon square at abu klea have fear of death men ever fought more bravely be matter of race rather than religion people have always be free for rule of egypt be after nominal one egyptian have be slave for century have lost fighting power in old old day thousand of year ago of have record in sacred book have learned from other source egyptian be among most war like of people carried arm far wide for many hundred of year now have be ruled by stranger be not very long ago that people fought great tribe in south of africa tribe who knew nothing of allah who have in fact religion at yet fought a stoutly a well a people have done here be matter of race be just a ready to die a be tribesman that not because believed a do death in battle must open gate of paradise to simply because be will of king mawillah sheik said stroking beard must have be brave indeed to throw away life if knew nothing of paradise merely at will of one man be folly indeed man have one life be why must part with did love king of theirs know that loved edgar said feared law be very cruel one be death to turn back in battle have better have cut throat have gone about own business sheik said why must one man be master of life of people be so among white be so in country not in others edgar said country be ruled over by men chosen by people power of peace war of making law of kind be in hand of men king have very little power in other country king be absolute if say be war be war sheik be silent why must people fight die because one man tell said after pause be astonishing be just same thing with people here mahdi edgar said tell to fight fight if told to scatter to home must do so sheik made further remark be evident to edgar that be thinking out problem have presented to for hour afterwards suddenly remarked who live in tent wander where will be only free men be more clear to than ever when be within day journey of el obeid met one of sheik follower who have left wady four day before rest with instruction to go to city find out whether must be safe to enter halted camel when reached that of sheik must go nearer city father said have learned that order have be received by mahdi governor to arrest with must present yourselves there there be much talk about party of soldier who went into desert to arrest having disappeared altogether others have be sent to find have discovered trace of so there be order that of tribe from

passed in without further inquiry took up abode with people told of have found out for have told be three day since order concerning be received thought there might be danger at el obeid sheik said calmly will turn off so a to avoid city will make south to join white pasha for while must not be safe anywhere here without further word turned camel from track have be following bore away more to south think that white pasha will be able to maintain position sheik shook head for time may in end must either surrender try to strike down to sea troop will weary at last even if be not beaten by army mahdi will send against will say 'why must go on fighting what good can come of holding out when aid can possibly reach from egypt ' mahdi will be glad to come to term with allow to live there in quiet with wife family possession if will acknowledge hand over white pasha with two three white officer have with will make difference to know country by great lake there be arab trader there in plenty who buy slave ivory take down to coast can find employment with for camel can stay with until be safe to return can not go on for ever besides in time of trouble event pas quickly out of men mind in year mahdist will have forgotten name a to loss of forty men what be have lost thousand since war began when get to white pasha sheik must hand over to if offered ransom for sheik said decidedly must not take near why must part with have brought good fortune thanks to defeated mahdist captured camel that have besides like why must part with what good must do with be no longer treated a slave a one of own people what must be with white pasha officer of troop getting pay running risk of being one day seized sent with others prisoner to khartoum have desire to stay with white pasha edgar said must rather be with than in so hopeless position a be might make way down to coast never sheik said at least never alone there be fierce tribe between lake sea white man must get through alone must only do by going with great band of fighting men carrier by buying way by present through great tribe fighting way through small one may travel down to sea day with if join caravan of arab then if there be countryman of yours on coast a have heard must pay good ransom for may see about be ungrateful to wish to leave not ungrateful sheik for wife have treated with great kindness be natural that one must wish to go to one own people have be taken prisoner carried to england however well be treated must sigh for free life in desert for people friend must escape if saw chance be human nature to love land where one be born land may be be true el bakhat admitted can not escape now there be nowhere for to go to be true sheik must be well content did know that be travelling straight either for suakim zanzibar for at place know must obtain from countryman money to pay ransom might set upon even sum must buy fast camel much good make wealthy man in tribe be not content to wait for year be not thinking of making escape now el bakhat asked looking scrutinizingly at edgar under heavy eyebrow sheik edgar answered from day that captured made up mind must escape sooner later risk knew well that must never traverse country until must speak language like native have made great progress can now understand be said can talk freely easily not so must travel alone a native will be month yet before can do after kindness with have treated must leave suddenly without warning when feel can safely travel alone will give fair warning will say to sheik if will now travel with to suakim other port where can obtain money for paying fair ransom will remain with until such ransom be paid into hand if will not do so will consider free to escape when can of course will be open to to treat again a slave to use vigilance to prevent leaving will consider that by giving fair warning will be free to use best endeavour to get away speak boldly sheik said speak fairly do give promise not to attempt to escape until after warning yes give that promise sheik be well el bakhat said gravely know that must not lie to after have given warning will know what to do so saying got up walked away to tent three day later a caravan be halting at well yussuf who have gone out with camel ran in there be large body of men on foot on horse approaching from south how far be off sheik asked a leapt to foot scarce mile negro replied then be too late for flight sheik said reseating must be here long before must saddle camel be doubtless body of mahdi troop if come from south will have heard nothing against when mahdist rode up sheik rose saluted commander who be officer asked be humble person one el bakhat of jahrin tribe travelling with camel little merchandise have permit of one of mahdi officer to trade lord did not know that be needful assuredly be needful officer said camel good be forfeited people must travel with to el obeid where inquiry will be made about lord sheik said be poor man have done harm after fighting against infidel went back to people with such spoil a have taken have dwelt there quietly be ignorant that needed permission for to journey with camel well if can prove when get to city officer said governor may take lenient view of case may content by taking portion only of camel a fine if be lying will be worse for remember now that be prisoner will be shot down if one of attempt to escape sheik bowed submissively officer ordered of men to keep rigid watch over prisoner then paid further attention to sheik re entered tent sat down stern silent without speaking amina who have heard what have passed be in greatest state of alarm saw that husband be not to be spoken to at present went to door of tent beckoned to edgar in whom felt most implicit confidence heard have passed muley heard lady position be full of danger be fertile in expedient can not suggest thing see if be taken to el obeid where have have news of expedition sent from khartoum disappearance in desert husband must be sent in chain to mahdi know what fate must then be while least will befall will be to be sold into slavery what then do advise with permission will think over edgar replied position be difficult one danger be a say great go then think over muley edgar went out of tent squatted down position have at first be very fatiguing to be now accustomed by ember of fire before thought over what have best be done for felt sure that must make escape for though general watch might be kept one man must doubtless crawl away in darkness felt that must not abandon sheik in moment of danger be in fact owing to that sheik be now in present position be true that arab have refused to give up to mahdi people at metemmeh not from love towards of own obstinate headstrong disposition however that refusal motive have undoubtedly saved life moreover sheik have behaved with great kindness to since felt that be clearly duty to do in power to assist now how be upwards of hour before rose from fire again entered sheik tent sheik be sitting smoking gravely amina be baking bread over ember in middle of tent what be counsel muley asked see plan said by lord can get away with follower camel one two might steal out from camp thought at first that if yussuf who must not be so closely watched a will be for there be two sentry outside tent must manage to steal out with gun to open fire in darkness upon camp mahdist thinking be attacked must seize arm run out in confusion lord of others might make escape plan be full of danger might not succeed for might suspect that who attacked be of party portion must remain to keep guard over then must be last resource for if attempt be made failed escape must be more difficult than ever appears to that first thing to do be to try bribe chief at present only suspect of trading without license be lord to see to offer camel burden to let go free with remainder might accept if failed can still try plan must take gun crawl out with yussuf must go two three hundred yard away to right must then fire a quickly a must moving while did so so that might think that there be many attacking then lord in confusion wife with child must try to make escape a soon a camp be aroused be advancing against must move round to left of camp must join there make straight across country be far away by daylight how must travel without camel sheik broke in impatiently must surely overtake before long there be deserted village in might hide until pursuit be over edgar said a must gain camel good must matter little to that three four person have escaped not until reached el obeid sheik said then must learn who be must scour country for camel must have if be to escape besides must be ruined man might a well be killed at once not altogether ruined sheik edgar said remember that buried many of valuable arm at wady must never get there without camel sheik said gloomily might be done sheik several men accompanied camel on foot must perform journey so on way back must not counsel that idea be that must get a far away from here a possible must then leave wife child in village must take with good must be quite sufficient to ensure welcome for until return then must propose that with yussuf who be certainly faithful must make way down on foot a arab fighting men to berber then on to osman digma who be know close to suakim thence might readily find mean of escaping entering town then a told can promise ransom must enable to buy more camel good than have lost here to return to wife child take with to wady a to camel altogether despair of getting be a usual grazing outside camp know voice mine when first escape might lead four of away take to left of camp where be afterwards to meet before morning must be very many mile away ah if must do that chief said showing for first time lively interest in matter might be possible however will try first of if officer will accept bribe if will do so will give two day start can then arrange matter a say without word rose went to door of tent two sentry placed there stepped forward told that order be that be not to leave wish not to leave said desire only to speak to commander have something of importance to say to will pray to come to one of sentry at once went across to commander tent shortly returned with master sheik said have done wrong in journeying without license came from desert did not know law must pay for fault though can not think that commander at el obeid must be hard upon one who have erred from ignorance however a be urgent for to press on journey will relinquish to one third of camel burden if will let travel on with others give permit from so that none may molest in future a officer have suspicion that arab first story be untrue hesitated then said not so all camel be forfeited for breaking law of mahdi who err in ignorance be surely not punished like who err wilfully sheik urged be pressed for time be journeying south to tent of wife father who have sent to say that be sick unto death wish to see before dy be content lord take camel officer thought that offer be good one be probable that governor of el obeid must not fine arab more than camel seeing that have broken law inadvertently in case must have small share in spoil whereas if consented to proposal camel must fall to saving one two might give to officer to induce to keep silence a to affair will be more merciful than deserve arab said will take camel with load see that cheat not if do will be worse for divide animal good to morrow morning in two equal part will take plea most have spoken turning upon heel went back to tent edgar standing within conversation have heard sheik said when have entered half property be gone have freedom other half have have worse misfortune than so far counsel have turned out well muley now about future will have four day start will reach el obeid by evening day after to morrow there will hear that have let through finger man for whom country be in search horseman will be despatched instantly in pursuit probably will be here next evening be reprieve journey a fast a will will soon overtake yes if pursue course in same direction sheik must not do must say that a soon a division be made must start south be a well that must see direction in be travelling then a soon a be well out of sight of camp must say let break up party into six eight part bid travel in different direction east west then make to point where arrived from desert strike across to wady party like ours must be noticed at once two three person with camel carrying belonging must be scarce observed mahdi horseman asking if caravan of ten camel have passed must be told that such party have be seen at rate most of men must be able to regain wady there to await return then must propose that on one camel wife child on with such good a require to pay way with on foot dressed a formerly a slave must strike in direction of khartoum keeping side of river until reach berber of course must take yussuf with not a might choose think that must find useful must like to go sheik asked in tone of suspicion for flashed across that if edgar yussuf made common cause must be at mercy must like to go negro have always be civil obliging to from day when thrashed companion if when arrive at port on red sea be willing to part with will gladly arrange to buy of at reasonable price that might name so be sheik said matter be settled next morning sheik follower be on foot early divided camel with greatest care into two portion debating earnestly on merit of animal then good be of trifling value be also divided when be done mahdi officer came down closely inspected lot of animal there be nothing to choose between said have made just division will take right hand lot horse be of course mine to disgust of sheik ordered one of follower to take to tent here be permit for to journey trade a will soldier be already under arm arab hastily packed tent cooking pot on camel remained to two party set off almost at same instant in two opposite direction when have travelled for hour sheik halted caravan explained situation to follower a soon a mahdist reach town will hear of hot pursuit will be instantly set on foot therefore be necessary for present to abandon plan for to return at once to wady from started if pursuer obtain news of caravan of size will be sure to overtake therefore be also necessary that must separate at once let man therefore take camel wife belonging journey singly let go east west making circuit to avoid el obeid reach edge of desert a best may wait there for other let a reach strike across to well when reach wady wait there for go with wife muley yussuf will take two camel journey north there hope to obtain sum for surrender of muley will more than repay loss have suffered to day arab at once obeyed order of sheik in few minute be speeding across country will go on for three four hour march sheik said before turn to east pursuer will be sure to inquire for at place pas if hear that solitary camel men have be seen making way across country will turn off at once in pursuit be therefore better that must move off distance before turn off sheik have chosen two camel though not remarkable for look be of better blood than rest more capable of performing long journey wife child rode on one of animal edgar with yussuf behind on other at noon turned off from southern course have before be pursuing continued journey until long after sunset then halted for few hour to rest camel moon rose at eight o'clock a soon a be up started again travelling now in north easterly direction in order to throw pursuer off track at daybreak halted again time in grove fire be lit yussuf cooked meal cake bountiful feed of grain be given to animal a speed be le object than secrecy move be made until in order that might pas through village unobserved journey be continued until following morning when again halted be now following track must sheik said lead after few mile into main road between el obeid khartoum time halt be of few hour duration a hoped that have baffled pursuer must now travel without attracting special attention have reached road be proceeding along when yussuf saw dust rising in distance called attention of sheik to camel be pressed forward to utmost speed camel will seldom go far beyond accustomed walk soon became apparent that be being rapidly overtaken by stranger who be pressing on behind by time must be seen that party following be also mounted on camel two rider have detached from main body be coming on at rapid pace must be mounted on heiries sheik said see how come along there be avoiding be not mahdi men said presently can see by dress that be in arab robe be riding for purpose sheik said must not travel so fast yet if purpose be hostile must hardly leave follower so far behind if know aught of el bakhat will know that be not man to surrender without resistance prepare gun muley methinks there be two men with four camel behind if slay first will have difficulty with illustration be rupert voice can not be rupert stranger came rapidly up a approached sheik saw that be arab trader wild looking native a came up reined in camel trader gave usual arab salutation be responded to by sheik two three of usual ceremonial sentence be repeated on side brother name be el bakhat new comer said name be own sheik replied be concern of stranger come a friend arab said arrived at el obeid yesterday heard that body of horseman have set out in pursuit of yesterday evening returned with prisoner who said that party have separated that be travelling north two party of horseman be ordered to start at daybreak thinking that might make for khartoum set out at once to warn by time wild looking young native have slipped from camel walked up to edgar staring fixedly at edgar not knowing what to make of movement shifted rifle forward when native gave wild cry edgar edgar gazed at with stupefaction be rupert voice how must wild figure be rupert how must be here edgar do not know be rupert edgar must doubt no longer flung from camel rushed into brother arm be mad dreaming exclaimed a still failed altogether to recognize rupert in disguise be rupert voice surely can not be rupert be sure enough edgar be mad dreaming hair edgar said still bewildered gazing at wild unkempt lock be wig neither more le edgar made for at cairo first rate job too edgar must doubt no longer with certainty joy strange weakness seemed to come over must have fallen have not rupert seized stand up old boy be right natural enough heard at metemmeh of having be carried away a of course be going to let remain slave among fellow got leave of absence from wolseley got disguise first rate guide thank god have come to at last surprise of el bakhat at seeing meeting between muley young native be much greater than of other arab who have heard at el obeid evening before that white slave be journeying in disguise with captor be brother sheik edgar said to have come way in disguise to look for rescue have done well sheik said warmly while amina clapped hand in pleasure be story about pursuit after true edgar asked yes quite true horseman will not be many hour before overtake hurried consultation be held between two sheik be decided to strike off to south east again a soon a follower arrived with camel united party left road made across country edgar taking place on camel behind rupert still felt like one in dream even now must scarce believe that be really rupert who be riding before latter who have be looking forward to meeting be yet scarcely le surprised at what have taken place have seemed hopeless task looking for edgar over so wide expanse of country that must scarcely credit that have succeeded in finding for time feeling be so deep on side hardly word be spoken be not indeed until camel came to halt late in evening that began to talk naturally chapter xxi home be nice fellow ai edgar to give trouble rupert said a held at arm length gazed at in light of fire that yussuf have lighted see now that made awful as of edgar said think must have done same if have be in place rupert have heard what heard have doubt must rupert agreed must have be awful thing to hear still must have seen by advertisement that father did not believe woman story did not see advertisement edgar said must not look at paper because thought must advertise for to come back felt must not do so must have be harder to keep away if have seen told be well at home be first question have asked after have mounted rupert camel quite well when last heard wrote told about then sergeant be found did not die died first day after found rupert said gravely be insensible when discovered must have known nothing about if have found two letter upon one to one to father saying that wife story be lie that must swear that of must in way identify of from other recovered consciousness before died signed in presence of witness deposition to same effect so saw at korti edgar must not make known must not have believed of well see rupert did not know at time that sergeant be who be still believed woman story to be true besides have gone own way did not mean to see of again until have got on must do without assistance seemed to to be like asking for help after have have under false pretence must have rather died than do see be under false pretence edgar have a much right to consider be son a have must have known that from sergeant afterwards yes did learn that edgar allowed think that made even more disinclined than before to show must have looked a if have come back only to put in claim be most pig headed fellow ever saw edgar however hope have got out of that feeling now quite rupert be quite ready to go back with beg pardon at home for trouble have given to think that have run awful risk to find stuff nonsense edgar when found that have be carried away a slave a matter of course determined to get out a soon a possible just a must have done have be caught by must have done nothing if have be for arab be travelling with of course will be well paid still men be often tempted to be unfaithful however well be paid then went on to tell edgar of arrangement have be made with sheik edgar in return gave short sketch of life since have parted at cheltenham told of promise have made to el bakhat if must take down to one of red sea port suppose be discussing matter together said glancing at two arab who be deep in conversation on other side of fire well sheik what plan have determined upon think that will be impossible for to travel north to egypt to berber thence to suakim will be on watch for everywhere best plan will be to make for massowah well sheik have heard that ben ibyn have agreed to deliver at one of port for handsome reward know that englishman word can be relied upon that there be fear of not getting amount promised brother agree to give equal sum to will receive there have not told sum el bakhat said tell term ben ibyn rupert put in not of course have already received for expense sum be to be paid when arrive at port sheik repeated term to el bakhat who at once expressed a perfectly satisfied with english be rich generous said el bakhat will do best to take where wish to go be thinking of travelling with train rupert asked ben ibyn there be occasion to do so have friend at village on nile there follower camel will remain el wife child will remain with also four will then travel on alone taking with yussuf to cook for look after camel will separate from others at once a will be much safer to travel in two small party there will be no fear a to safety a will take regular permit to trade one will connect in way with el bakhat brother will ride heiries have half bred camel will carry well although will not compare in speed with yours el camel be also good one if be pursued have agreed that best plan will be to turn off find hiding place for to push on alone on camel may defy pursuit if pushed will travel hundred fifty mile day when get to massowah will wait until join there be content to trust to word still hope that may keep together for although brother now speaks arabic so well that must pas a native in casual conversation be better that must be together in case will be who will do talking have two heiries edgar asked rupert be not quite full bred be very rare to meet with price be extremely high be nearly full bred can swing along a fast a horse can trot keep up for twelve hour at stretch march be resumed at midnight two sheik rode ahead edgar rupert followed on heiries while yussuf be mounted on one of spare camel rode with other arab in rear two brother talked by turn be surprised when first streak of daylight appeared party now separated sheik wife child taking seat on one of camel took warm farewell of edgar amina will never forget young white man who have lived in tent said be brave in war be wise counsellor will be great man among own people will never forget edgar replied kindness to white slave when sheik return from massowah will bring with token of remembrance a soon a party have separated sheik put camel to best speed yussuf have be taken up by edgar rode behind heiries carrying double weight with ease at sunset halted be now el bakhat said to edgar beyond reach of pursuit may be stopped arrested by others from el obeid will never see tail of camel wish edgar said a be riding along next morning that
