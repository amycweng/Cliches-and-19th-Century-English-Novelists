about dinner in afternoon mr hardy felt strongly tempted to go into kitchen to see how thing be getting on restrained resolving to let maud ethel have entirely own way dinner be great success although soup be rather hot from ethel in anxiety having let too much pepper slip in cabinet pudding came up all over dish instead of preserving shape having stuck to mould maud having shaken so violently that have come out with burst broken up into piece have caused flood of tear on part of little cook did not taste worse however when little girl came in to dessert in white frock looking rather shy very

inhabited part will perhaps have one within many mile of now be just possible that at first indian may be disposed to be troublesome suppose that will be just a well to be prepared for everything there be reason why boy must not be able to shoot a straightly a man have therefore bought two carbine be invention of american named colt have revolving breach so that fire six shot there be spare chamber to be very quickly shifted in place of one discharged so that of must fire twelve shot in very short time will carry up to five hundred yard be new invention account agree that be excellent

here father instructed in use of revolving carbine then after practice with cap only allowed to fire few shot firing be certainly rather wild owing to difficulty felt at first of firing without shutting eye after few week practice became very steady in three four month must make pretty certain of bull eye at three hundred yard of mr hardy girl knew nothing there be not same secrecy observed with reference to shot gun took home with mr hardy said that understood that plain of south america swarmed with game that therefore be well that boy must learn how to shoot insisted however that only one gun must be taken out at time to diminish danger of accident after that boy took out gun by turn when went to work of morning many dead blackbird soon attested to improving skill chapter ii start

of time be to be at liberty to marry to leave must choose knowing scarcity of young englishwoman in country that be going to number of englishman doing well in town a farmer mr hardy have considered precaution to be absolutely necessary a otherwise sarah might have married left within month of arrival at end of year so doing must not matter so much a by time party must be comfortably settled in new home whereas during necessary hardship at first must be great comfort having faithful reliable servant last look party cast toward england a welsh coast sank in distance be le melancholy than of most emigrant young people be full of hope excitement while even mr hardy felt little disposed to give way to sorrow a have be arranged that in three four year if went well must bring daughter over to england to finish education very lovely be that first evening a sat in group together upon deck little girl remarked that did not think that sea be anything like a terrible a have expected that did not feel least sea sick father smiled 'wait little dear there be old proverb halloo until be out of wood ' next day be still perfectly calm when towards evening child be told that be now fairly getting into bay of biscay must scarcely believe intelligence one must think maud ' father said 'that be disappointed at being calm that really wanted storm papa do think must be great fun must be so curious not to be able to walk about to see everything rolling tumbling think so boy 'yes think so maud great fun charley said 'well young people captain who have be standing by watching sun now fast nearing horizon who have overheard remark said 'if be satisfaction to can tell that be very likely to have wish gratified question if will like a much a expect ' expect wind captain trevor mr hardy said have be thinking that almost oppressive stillness of to day look of sunset black cloud banking up in south west meant change doe glass say be falling very rapidly ' captain answered 'we be in for sou wester stiff one too be mistaken ' now that appeared likely that wish be about to be gratified young hardy did not seem so pleased a have expected although charley still declared manfully that be quite in earnest that did wish to see real storm at sea a sun set party still leaned against bulwark watching great bank of cloud seemed moment to be rising higher higher there be still nearly dead calm around heavy beat of paddle a lashed water into foam dull thud of engine be only sound that broke stillness now then however short puff of wind ruffled water then died away again 'look at great cloud papa hubert said 'it almost look a if be alive ' 'yes hubert be very grand there be doubt about there being wind there ' great cloud bank appeared to be in constant motion shape be incessantly shifting changing now great mass must roll upwards now sink down again now whole body must seem to roll over over upon then small portion must break off from mass sail off by getting thinner thinner disappearing at last in shape of fine streamer momentarily whole of heaving swelling mass rose higher higher be very grand be terrible grandeur others be quite inclined to agree with ethel who shrank close to father put hand in saying ' like cloud papa frightens ' at moment mr hardy who have be down below arranging cabin came up to group 'what dark cloud frank how move be going to have storm do think ' clara think that be in for gale if will take advice will go down at once while be calm see that trunk everything can roll about be securely fastened up will come down help boy have better go down see that everything be snug in cabin ' in quarter of hour necessary arrangement be completed even in short time must feel that change be taking place there be now steady decided rolling motion young one laughed a found difficult to walk steadily along cabin upon reaching deck saw that smooth surface of sea be broken up by long swell that wind now came in short sharp puff that bank of cloud covered nearly sky that detached scud be now flying overhead previous stillness be gone between sudden gust roar of wind in upper region must be heard sun have set now pall of deep blackness seemed to hang from cloud down to sea at line where cloud water touched gleam of dim white light appeared in preparation for coming storm sailor have put on thick waterproof coat many of passenger have gone below who remained have followed sailor example have wrapped up in mackintosh moment gust increased in frequency power regular line of swell became broken up into confused white headed wave white gleam under dark cloud grew wider broader at last with roar like of thousand wild beast gale broke upon just before mr hardy have taken mr hardy girl below promising latter that must come up later for peep out if still wished charley hubert be leaning against bulwark when gale struck for moment be blinded half choked by force fury of spray wind crouched down behind shelter to recover then with hearty laugh at drenched appearance made way to mainmast then holding on by belaying pin be able to look fairly out on gale be dark so dark that must scarcely see a far a foremast around sea be white with foam wind blew so fiercely that must scarcely hear other voice even when shouted steamer laboured heavily against fast rising sea here mr hardy joined for little time clung there watching increasing fury of gale then drenched almost confused by strife of wind water that have be watching made way with great difficulty down into cabin here feeling of sea sickness excitement of scene have kept off increased rapidly be glad to slip off upper clothes to throw upon berth before paroxysm of sickness came on when questioned afterwards a to event of next thirty six hour young hardy be obliged to confess that time be sort of blank in memory sort of horrible nightmare when one moment seemed to be on head next upon foot never lying down in comfortable position when sometimes top of cabin seemed under foot sometimes floor over head then for change everything must go round round noise too groaning thumping cracking thud of wave thump of paddle general quivering shaking creaking bewilderment altogether be most unpleasant nightmare have dim vision of mr hardy coming in several time to see after to give cup of tea to say something cheering to four have distinct idea that have many time wished dead upon second morning after storm began showed sign of abating mr hardy said to son 'now boy make effort come upon deck be use lying there fresh air will do good ' two dismal groan be only response to appeal 'yes know that feel very bad that be difficult to turn out still be worth making effort will be very glad of afterwards come jump up else will empty water jug over there need not take much trouble with dressing ' went on a boy seeing that be in earnest turned out of berth with grievous moan hold on by something get head over basin will empty jug on there now will feel better slip on clothes come up be hard work for charley hubert to obey order for ship rolled so tremendously that must only proceed with dressing by fit start be more than once interrupted by attack of weary sea sickness however father stayed with helping joking with until be ready to go up then taking by arm assisted up stair to deck miserable a boy felt must not suppress exclamation of admiration at magnificent scene before sea be tossed up in great mass of water a neared ship threatened to overwhelm a rose on summit passed harmlessly under hurling however ton of water upon deck wind be still blowing fiercely rift in cloud above through sun threw down bright ray of light upon tossing water showed that gale be breaking excitement of scene difficulty of keeping foot influence of rushing wind soon have effect father predicted boy look brightened courage returned although still have occasional relapse of sickness felt quite different being must not have returned to blank misery of cabin upon consideration be soon able to eat piece of dry toast mr hardy brought up with cup of tea at breakfast time to enjoy basin of soup at twelve o'clock after pronounced a cured by afternoon force of wind have greatly abated although heavy sea still ran motion of vessel be perceptibly easier sun too shone out brightly cheeringly mr hardy be able to bring little girl who have not suffered so severely a brother upon deck two more day of fine weather quite recruited party great be enjoyment a barbadoes entered tagus steaming between picturesque bank past cintra dropped anchor

harbour of rio flat uninteresting coast be most disappointing 'what distance be anchored from shore hubert said when have recovered little from first feeling must be three four mile off ' 'not so much a hubert ' maud who be just little fond of contradicting said more than two mile must think hubert stuck to opinion a captain came on deck referred matter to 'the distance of object across water be very deceiving ' said 'it be from eight to nine mile to building see ' maud looked rather crestfallen charley asked 'why do anchor such long way off captain ' 'because shore be so flat that there be water for to get in closer in couple of hour will see boat coming out to fetch in unless happens to be high tide even can not get to beach will have to land in cart 'in cart captain trevor ' repeated 'that will be strange way of landing ' 'yes be ' captain answered think that can safely say that argentine republic be only country in world where only way to land at chief city be in cart ' captain

outside hut must ask to tell tale of indian experience upon one of occasion charley said to 'but of near escape that have have be most hazardous ever have do consider be narrowest touch ever have of being killed ' seth considered for time in silence turned plug of tobacco in mouth expectorated two three time a be custom when thinking then said 'that be not altogether easy question to answer have be so near wiped out such score of time that ai easy job to say be downright nearest in thinking over conclude sometimes that one go be nearest sometimes that ai way easy to say now think that at time

charley said least better a far a be concerned if mind telling ' 'no mind how seth answered `` ll just think over see where to begin ' there be silence for few minute young hardy composed comfortably

at rosario will go up straight from buenos ayres to new orleans steamer will take up river in three day to rube location good bye of told father afternoon ' there be hearty leave taking many expression of regret at leaving after shake of hand many good wish young hardy went up to house really sorry to part with yankee friend chapter viii farm work amusement although two month have elapsed since ground be ploughed up planted progress made by crop of maize pumpkin be surprising former especially be now nearly six foot high rapid growth be result of extreme fertility of virgin soil aided by late abundant supply of water heat of sun maize have given great deal to do for when be about six inch high have to be thinned out so that plant be nine ten inch apart have be done by united strength of party mr hardy boy working for two hour morning a much in evening girl also have assisted peon have worked whole day except from eleven to three when heat be too great even for many hand make light work in consequence whole ground under maize cultivation be thinned in little over week latterly maize have grown so fast that boy declared must almost see grow at end of two month after sowing be in flower maize indian corn strongly resembles water rush in appearance feathery blossom also resembles that of rush indian corn form main article of food in south america in northern state of north america be equally useful common in india in other tropical country scarcely le be used in italy other part of southern europe be first introduced into europe from east by great family of polenta who ruled important town of ravenna for nearly two hundred year ground maize be still called polenta throughout italy great family will live in name of useful cereal introduced when memory of warlike deed be lost except to learned one evening when mr hardy with wife child be strolling down in cool of evening to look with pleasure upon bright green of healthy valuable crop hubert said indian corn papa great yellow head covered with grain like bead one see in corn dealer shop in england ' 'yes hubert 'well if be so can not make out how long delicate stem can bear weight bend over like corn to puff of wind doe not seem possible that must bear quarter of weight of heavy yellow head 'nor must hubert nature have made wise very extraordinary provision for difficulty other plant tree with be acquainted have fruit seed where blossom before grew in maize be placed in entirely different part of plant in very short time will see indeed may see now in most of plant stalk begin to thicken at foot eighteen inch from ground in little time will burst head of maize so enveloped in leaf that look mere bunch of will come forth will for time grow larger larger then plant will wither die down to place from head spring part remains will dry up until field appears covered with dead stump with bunch of dead leaf at top then be ready for harvest 'what strange plant papa quite long for time when head will come out what be going to plant upon bit of land have got ready for sowing now be about six acre ' mean to plant cotton there hubert have sent to buenos ayres for seed of what be called carolina upland expect here in few day 'but take great deal of labour doe not papa ' 'the calculation in northern state hubert be that one man can cultivate eight acre of cotton assisted by wife child at certain period that a labour be not always required can with family cultivate eight ten acre of other produce so about half of peon labour will be required in hoeing picking time can help not machinery required to separate seed from cotton charley asked 'it be not absolutely necessary charley although be of course economical when cultivation be carried on upon large scale variety be going to try be sometimes called bowed carolina because used to be cleaned by placing upon number of string stretched very tight be struck with sort of bow vibration caused seed to separate from cotton have drawing of one of contrivance in book up at house when time come boy will make one will be work for to do indoors when weather be too hot to be out of course if find that succeeds pay well will take on more hand get proper machinery extend cultivation intend to plant row rather wide apart so a to use light plough with ridge board between instead of hoeing to save labour ' 'how much cotton do get from acre mr hardy asked 'in southern state expect twelve hundred pound upon new ground be twelve hundred pound of pod make about three hundred of cleaned cotton when have got cotton fairly in ground mean to plant acre two of tobacco same quantity of sugar cane a experiment before do that must make garden up at house be really urgent need ' 'must grow rice here papa 'no doubt must hubert mean to try to succeed with rice must have to keep ground on grew in state of swamp must be very unhealthy be why irrigate field oftener than be absolutely necessary anything approaching swampy even wet land in climate like must be almost certain to breed malaria besides must be eaten alive by mosquito will certainly not try rice other tropical production will day give trial to ginger vanilla other thing must doubt flourish here believe that of must give extraordinary rate of profit for though land be cheap labour be scarce still must be interesting must cause little variety amusement in work be always important point doubt there must be generally profit though occasionally may make total failure very often at daybreak girl must go down with brother to river watch waterfowl on surface be so amusing a dabbled played in water unsuspicious of danger favourite though be beautiful scarlet flamingo with slender leg long graceful neck whose great employment seemed to be to stand quiet in water where be only two three inch deep to preen glossy red feather over over again girl wished that must get few waterfowl especially flamingo to tame in order that might swim on dam pond come be fed boy have several talk with other a to most practicable way of capturing of at last thought of making sort of enclosure of light bough with entrance into bird must easily pas through must not easily return to scatter grain up to into enclosure to entice bird to enter on explaining plan to mr hardy said that have doubt that must succeed in capturing bird that when caught must be impossible to tame full grown wild fowl that only plan be to find nest take egg very young bird determined to do a bush close to river be too thick to permit examination from shore started one morning early going down to river entered waded along for considerable distance discovered two swan nest several of different description of duck in bird be sitting upon egg in others young brood be just hatched scuttled away into bush with parent bird upon being disturbed charley hubert made remark at breakfast upon success of expedition when charley went two day after to rosario procured from mr percy who kept quantity of chicken two sitting hen be placed with nest in bullock cart in hamper mr hardy who have idea of purpose to be to be put be quite pleased on arrival at mount pleasant at addition to stock indeed have be long agreed that must keep hen a soon a maize be ripe next morning boy went again brought back twenty egg of various kind of wild duck including four swan egg to obtain have to shoot parent bird furnished larder for day placed under hen in place of own egg then took girl in triumph to see commencement of tame duck project little girl be delighted be immense amusement to to go down constantly to see if egg be hatched a of course one must tell how long have be sat upon previous to being taken have remarked that four of egg be much larger than others have idea that be swan ' in course of few day six of young duckling be hatched hen be so unhappy at difficulty of continuing to sit while have care of young one on mind that one hen little one be removed to distance from other nest whole of egg be put under remaining hen four swan five more duck be safely hatched when hen refused to sit longer remaining egg be lost now that swan be safely hatched boy told sister what really be delight be extreme in few day be taken down to dam soon found way into water to great distress of foster mother who be obliged to stand upon bank calling in vain till little one chose to come ashore hencoop be soon knocked together from old box be placed near dam ere long hen became accustomed to fancy of charge for water must walk about picking up insect while little one swam about on pond twice day girl went down to feed with grain bit of boiled pumpkin for pumpkin soon began to come into bearing duckling cygnet last be at present little larger than others must swim rapidly towards when saw must feed greedily out of hand be not for week later that desire for young flamingo be gratified boy have be out for ride coming upon river where be wide with flat sandy bank round timber grew determined to tie up horse enter stream to see if must get more egg with difficulty made way through bush getting into water waded along until turn in river brought in sight of flat bank there be twenty thirty flamingo upon for bird be very gregarious be standing in water a usual boy must not make out what of others be doing on flat shore be several heap of earth across of bird be apparently sitting with one leg straddling out side so comical be aspect that boy burst into laugh so scared flamingo that took flight instantly boy now waded up to spot then got ashore to see what strange heap be for to great delight found that be nest upon top of several of be eight nine egg carefully arranged leg of flamingo be so long that bird be unable to double up sit upon nest in usual fashion hen bird therefore scrape together pile of earth on top of lay egg then place astride to keep warm boy have argument whether must take away two nest entire whether must take few egg from nest decided upon former plan in order that of young brood might be hatched simultaneously upon boy reaching home with treasure sister delight be unbounded hen be soon placed upon new charge being good sitter took to without much difficulty when young brood be hatched girl be greatly disappointed at appearance of little greyish fluffy ball instead of lovely red thing have expected be by mean consoled when father told that must be three four year before gained beautiful colour however became great pet be very droll with long leg slender neck great curved bill became extremely tame must after time follow girl about stalk up to house of own accord to be fed food always being placed in water a never feed by picking upon ground for indeed peculiar construction of beak be entirely unfitted be perfectly fearless of dog on part be too well trained to touch funny way extreme tameness be source of constant amusement to whole family must now retrace step after important work of getting certain amount of land under cultivation next most urgent business be formation of garden land inside enclosure round house be first ploughed up then dug by hand turf being left in front of house to serve a lawn rest be planted with seed brought from england pea bean tomato vegetable marrow cucumber melon many others of be native of warm climate while others be planted in small patch a experiment fortunately well supplied abundance of water whose only drawback be that like most water upon pampas have strong saline taste be until have become accustomed to very disagreeable to hardy a well have be dug close to house on highest part of slope water be conducted from pump by small channel over garden growth of various vegetable be surprising long before must come into bearing welcome supply be afforded by yam indian corn yam resemble sweet potato if indian corn be gathered green little corn nibbed off boiled mixed with little butter exactly resemble most delicate delicious young pea young potato too have come in so that have now abundance of vegetable only point in have before be deficient drink be mate may be termed national beverage of paraguay brazil argentine republic be made from leaf of mate yuba plant grows in paraguay brazil native generally drink without sugar milk sucking up from vessel in be made through small tube be however greatly improved by addition of sugar milk better still cream greatly softens bitter taste distinguishes none of party liked at first a be assured by in country that must like when became accustomed to persevered after time came to prefer even to tea occasionally one other of boy went over to rosario with cart mr hardy bought hundred of young fruit tree apple pear plum apricot peach of be planted in garden at side in rear of house others in open beyond round light fence with one wire being put up to keep cattle from trespassing clump of young palm banana other tropical tree shrub be also planted about for future adornment of place fence be erected round cultivated ground enclosure be made into cattle be driven at night fence be easily cheaply made wire cost little more at rosario than must have done in england chief trouble be bringing post be made of algaroba wood from town wood grows abundantly upon upper river be there cut down floated in great raft down to rosario be tough wood split readily be therefore admirably suited for post be of reddish colour have pretty grain when polished furniture be made of from constant rubbing by sarah girl now shone brightly have very good effect ceiling be now put to room be greatly improved in appearance thereby difference in temperature be very marked very short time after capture of wild fowl egg be unanimously agreed that chicken be indispensable large hen house be accordingly built at short distance from dam a be considered a well not to have building with exception of men hut near house hen house be quickly built a be mere framework covered with felt with bat across for fowl to perch upon floor be made a of house have be of lime clay beaten hard small cut be made to dam by water must at will be turned over floor to keep clean neat next time cart went to rosario brought back fifty fowl have only cost few dollar henceforth egg omelette became regular part of breakfast pudding be notably improved chicken gave very little trouble a foraged about for finding abundance of insect everywhere getting in addition few pot of indian corn morning maud ethel took by turn week about to take charge of hen house great pleasure be to to watch numerous brood of young chicken to hunt up egg in spite of nest temptingly prepared for hen must frequently persist in laying in nest of own in long grass hen have however numerous foe who be great trouble to young mistress be skunk animal of weasel tribe much resembling squirrel in appearance possessing most abominable smell so much so that dog who must attack almost anything must run away from be at first exceedingly common created terrible depredation among hen girl be in despair called in brother to assistance boy shot good many for animal be very tame fearless number be so great that method of destruction be of slight avail then prepared trap of various kind made by elastic stick bent down with noose at end placed at small entrance left purposely in hen house so that when skunk be about to enter touched spring stick released flew into air carrying animal with with noose round neck other trap let fall heavy piece of wood crushed invader in way skunk be pretty well got rid of most unpleasant work being removal of body from trap have to be effected by taking hold of with two piece of wood for odour be so powerful that if body be touched smell must remain on hand for day have now added specie of domestic animal to stock be boy charge mr hardy when pumpkin began to ripen bought six pig be of little trouble for although sty be built for be allowed to wander about a pleased by day wire being added to fence round cultivated land to keep from trespassing crop of pumpkin be enormous mr hardy determined that pig must be killed for eighteen month by time a animal increase rapidly there must be quite large herd of although immense deal of hard work be got through during four month followed completion of house arrival of mr hardy daughter must not be supposed that be not mingled with plenty of relaxation amusement there be few day when one other of boy did not go out with gun for hour before sunrise after sunset seldom failing to bring home wild fowl two of kind other sometimes of afternoon must go out for ride with sister have chase after ostrich run after grey fox abounded be very destructive among young lamb once twice during ride boy brought puma to bay a always carried ball in one of barrel with revolver soon despatched unwelcome visitor have contrived apparatus with strap sort of little pocket in muzzle of gun went so that hung from saddle down in front of leg stock of gun being secured by strap against pommel of saddle at other side of be revolver holster be inconvenient way of carrying gun in respect a strap have to be unfastened to get at chance of shot thereby lost considered preferable to mode have at first adopted of riding with gun slung behind gave up because with utmost care occasionally got fall when galloping from armadillo hole shock be greatly increased from weight of gun besides risk to one riding near of gun exploding when riding quietly upon lookout for game carried gun in readiness upon arm be after one of ride when hubert have brought down with bullet swan be making for bed in river maud said at tea ' wish must shoot too must be great amusement must enjoy ride good deal more if knew must take shot in case lion deer came out ' 'well girl mr hardy said have always intended that must learn to shoot have have so much to do since came here that did not think of have besides intended to wait until one of expressed desire to learn brought out three light rook shooting rifle on purpose for mamma can begin to morrow morning if like ' thank papa thank very very much that will be nice ' girl exclaimed clapping hand in excitement 'and what do say mamma mr hardy asked thank ' mr hardy said have plenty to do with husband two son two daughter to defend consider that be essential think that will be nice amusement for girl so next morning nearly morning afterwards girl practised with light rifle at mark until in time hand became so steady that at short distance of sixty seventy yard must beat brother who be really good shot be principally owing to fact that charge of powder used in rifle be so small that there be scarcely recoil to disturb aim be time before must manage to hit anything flying be very proud one evening when having be out late with boy fat goose came along overhead girl firing simultaneously fell with bullet in body after too carried rifle out with during ride one who have known maud ethel hardy at home must have scarcely recognised now in sunburnt looking lassie who sat upon horse a if have never known other seat in life dress too must have be most curious to english eye wore wide straw hat with white scarf wound round top to keep off heat dress be very short made of brown holland with garibaldi of blue coloured flannel wore red flannel knickerbockers gaiter coming up above knee of very soft flexible leather made of deer skin gaiter be absolute necessity for place literally swarmed with snake constantly found in garden when going out to gather vegetable most of snake be harmless a of be very deadly protection of gaiter be quite necessary girl did not like at first especially a brother must not help joking little hubert said that reminded of two yellow legged partridge however soon became accustomed to felt so much more comfortable about snake afterwards that must not have given up upon account boy always wore high boot for same reason have fear whatever of snake mr hardy insisted that of must always carry in small inner pocket of coat phial of spirit of ammonia small surgical knife piece of whipcord same article being always kept in readiness at house instruction be that in case of bite must first suck wound then tie whipcord round limb above place bitten that must then cut deeply into wound cross way open a much a possible pour in spirit of ammonia that must then pour rest of ammonia into water bottle always carried slung over shoulder must drink off if direction be instantly thoroughly carried out mr hardy have little fear that bite even of deadliest snake must prove fatal in addition ordered that in case of being near home must upon arrival be made to drink raw spirit until must not stand that if be distance away from home be together one bitten must lie down while other galloped at full speed to take back bottle of brandy order assistance to be sent remedy be well known throughout india one bitten by poisonous snake be made to drink spirit be able to do without being affected by to extraordinary extent man who at ordinary time must scarcely take strong tumbler of spirit water being able when bitten to drink bottle of pure brandy without being in least affected by when spirit doe at last begin to take effect patient show sign of drunkenness be considered to be safe poison of spirit having overcome poison of snake chapter ix neighbourly visit advice must not be supposed that hardy during whole of time be leading perfectly solitary life upon contrary have great deal of sociable companionship within range of ten mile there be le than four estancias owned by englishman besides of first friend mr percy ride of twenty mile be thought nothing of out on pampas estate immediately to rear of own be

be held early so that jamiesons englishman must ride back to home before heat of day other three remaining to dine returning in cool of evening canterbury be entirely sheep cattle farm owner have five thousand sheep hundred of cattle have comparatively good deal of time upon hand a stock sheep farming doe not require so much personal care supervision a must be bestowed upon agricultural farm jamiesons on contrary be entirely occupied in tillage have sheep only few head of cattle mr hardy be remarking upon one day to mr percy who replied 'ah poor fellow be very unfortunate brought out fair

affair manfully in face sold animal bought couple of plough draught bullock hired peon two set to work with will will get on slowly for time have doubt that will do well in course of few year men with pluck perseverance be certain to get on put in mind hardy of matter upon have intended to speak to be just getting now to time of year when indian attack be most likely to take place sometimes be quiet for year two then be very troublesome again five six year ago just after first came out have terrible time with vast number of cattle be driven off sheep le seldom take because can not travel so fast do drive off sometimes good many shepherd be killed two three estancias captured burnt inmate murdered be now farthest settler consequently most exposed estancia be strong well built be well armed good shot be think in respect safe except from sudden surprise dog be sure to give alarm still must sleep with everything in readiness ' percy will take advice expected from what have heard when bought place from hearing nothing of indian time have almost forgotten will prepare for defence without loss of day house have only one vulnerable point door shutter will measure afternoon will get to take over letter forward to rosario by first opportunity for sheet of thin iron to cover with ' mr percy promised to forward letter very next day by bullock cart be sending in also that same cart must bring back said that if conveyance be sent over in two day time for must be in readiness at place conversation caused mr hardy great uneasiness be possibility have be quite prepared for must not feel that danger be really at hand without anxious feeling thousand sheep have cost l cattle a much more lambing season have come gone flock of sheep have doubled in number cattle too have greatly increased sheep be nearly ready for shearing altogether value of stock be over l loss must not be absolute ruin a have still l of original capital in bank at buenos ayres must be very serious loss mr hardy have be alone with mr percy when conversation took place determined at once to take boy into entire confidence therefore called to to come out for stroll down to dam told word for word what mr percy have related to charley eye brightened at thought of excitement of fight with indian for when in england eighteen month before have longed finger tightened upon gun a said right papa let come '

fear if come to fighting three with arm can thrash hundred of what be thinking of be cattle not will take good care against sudden surprise be more than whole tribe must do to take mount pleasant if be prepared mean to tell mamma girl papa ' ' mean to tell that be necessary for time to be on guard that girl be on account to venture to ride out alone that must not stir out of enclosure even a far a hen house without first of going up to top of lookout to see that be clear must see that in future sheep cattle horse be driven at night into wire enclosure have not be very particular about cattle lately that gate be fastened padlocked at night will puzzle to get out own three horse will have in future kept within own enclosure so that may be always at hand night day bought with special eye to

fifteen mile especially with heavy fleece on hour riding took to scene of attack a neared saw two figure lying upon grass there be occasion to go near stiff distorted attitude be sufficient to show that be dead mr hardy purposely avoided riding close to knowing that shocking sight of men who have met with violent death be apt to shake nerve of one unaccustomed to such sight however brave may be 'they be evidently dead poor fellow said 'it be use stopping ' charley looked at body with fierce frown upon face muttered to 'we will pay out for cowardly scoundrel hubert did not even glance towards be tender hearted boy felt face grow pale strange feeling of sickness come over even at momentary glance have at first taken at rigid figure suppose mean to attack until night papa ' charley asked 'well boy have be thinking matter over have come to conclusion that will be better to do so directly get up to ' 'and do think papa three will be able to thrash lot of must be poor miserable set of coward 'no charley think that will be able to thrash lot a say with weapon will be able to give terrible lesson if attack at night will soon find out how few be number having particular dread of weapon may rush at overpower in spite of thing boy be want to give lesson must know that sha come murder steal on place with impunity ' scarcely word be exchanged for next hour at long steady gallop swept along there be difficulty in following track for long grass be trampled in wide swathe several time too exclamation of rage burst from boy a came across dead sheep evidently speared by savage because must not keep up with others after passing several of mr hardy called to boy to halt while leapt off horse by side of one of sheep put hand against body into mouth be quite dead be papa ' hubert said 'quite hubert never thought be alive mr hardy leapt upon horse again wanted to see how warm body be if try again hour ride ahead will be able to judge by increased heat of body a to how

eye open there for be bit a brave a be push on so fast charley spare horse will want be got in before have done think that must be gaining upon very fast now see dead sheep lie hundred yard so instead of quarter of mile indian know well enough that must take whole day out on edge of settlement to collect dozen men for pursuit must have idea that three men must set off alone so expect that will now have slackened pace little to give sheep breathing time ' after ten minute ride mr hardy again alighted found very perceptible increase of warmth in body of sheep think that can have be dead much more than quarter of hour keep sharp lookout ahead boy may see at top of next rise ' not word be spoken for next few minute two three slight swell be crossed without sign of enemy then upon breasting rather higher rise than usual saw mass of moving being in distance mr hardy shouted boy instantly drew rein off boy only head have shown against sky can hardly have noticed there hold horse loosen saddle girth of yours too let breathe freely take bridle out of mouth seemed to by glimpse got of enemy that be just stopping be going on to make sure of ' so saying mr hardy again went forward short distance going on hand knee a came on to crest of rise in order that head might not show above long grass when reached saw at once that first impression have be correct at distance of little over mile mass of animal be collected round be scattered number of horse while figure of men be moving among 'it be a thought boy said when rejoined son have stopped for while animal must be completely done up can not have come le than thirty mile will require three four hour rest at least before be fit to travel again one hour will do for horse rinse mouth out with little water let graze if be disposed in hour will give double handful of indian corn ' having attended to horse hobbled to prevent straying mr hardy boy sat down made slight meal none of felt very hungry excitement of approaching attack having driven away keen appetite that must have otherwise gained from ride mr hardy begged boy to endeavour to eat something a must be sure to feel want of food later meal over mr hardy lit favourite pipe while boy went cautiously up hill to reconnoitre there be change most of animal be lying down there be little sign of movement two three indian however be standing motionless rigid by horse side evidently acting a sentry boy thought that hour longest that have ever passed at last however father looked at watch shook ash out of pipe put in pocket 'now boy be five minute to hour examine carbine revolver see that everything be in order that there be hitch tighten saddle girth examine buckle see that ammunition spare carbine chamber be ready at hand ' in five minute party be in saddle boy last word ride ahead lag behind regulate pace by mine look out for armadillo hole be more dangerous than indian remember order on account use second chamber of carbine unless in case of great urgency change chamber directly have emptied fire shot until spare one be charged again now boy hurrah for old england 'hurrah boy shouted a started at canter up rise a caught sight of indian everything be quiet a before in moment saw men on watch throw on to horse back figure leapt up from grass ran towards horse in little over minute whole be in motion beurely be not going to run away from three men

be watch kept by indian in spite of belief that pursuing force must be sent after be little time before must get weary animal on leg in motion even at easy canter at mr hardy approached have neared to within mile before be fairly off small party only continued to drive animal rest of indian wheeling sharp round uttering wild war cry came back at full gallop towards white illustration onset of indian page 'halt boy steady dismount take up position quietly fire till give word will try rifle first ' well trained horse accustomed to master firing from back stood a steady a if carved in stone head turned inquiringly towards yelling throng of horseman who be approaching mr hardy boy have dismounted so that horse be between indian saddle serving a rest for firearm 'five hundred yard charley

between shot take a steady aim a possible now well done two more of scoundrel down steady hubert missed that time there be better ' indian yelled with rage astonishment a man after man dropped before steady to mysterious fire be kept up upon still did not abate rapidity of charge 'done papa ' charley said a two boy simultaneously fired last shot when leading indian be about two hundred fifty yard distant 'change chamber mount ' mr hardy said a again took aim with rifle enemy be not more than hundred fifty yard distant when leapt into saddle started at gallop boy keep horse well in hand never mind ball must no more hit man at distance from back of horse than must fly there be chance of catching there wo be many horse faster than ours ours be good deal fresher keep good lookout for hole pursuer pursued be now going over ground at tremendous pace indian have ceased firing for most of who have gun have discharged a mr hardy son have mounted be impossible to load at speed at be going during first mile of chase mr hardy have looked round several time have said time be holding own boy be good hundred yard behind keep horse in hand ' at end of mile face brightened a looked round 'all right boy be tailing off fast three quarter of have stopped already there be not above score of best mounted anywhere near mile will give lesson ' mile be soon traversed mr hardy saw that only about twelve indian have maintained distance 'now be time boy when say halt draw up jump off take very steady aim always at nearest throw away shot be only hundred yard off revolver will tell try to use second chamber there be time for use pistol when have emptied carbine halt ' not five second elapsed after word be spoken before charley carbine rang out then came sharp crack of carbine pistol in close succession indian hesitated at tremendous fire be opened upon then halted delay be fatal to in little over minute eighteen shot have be fired five indian lay upon plain evidently chief have be carried off across saddle of one of follower who have leapt off when saw fall two others be evidently wounded have difficulty in keeping seat 'now boy change chamber take shot two after ' mr hardy said a again reloaded rifle boy however found by time be ready that flying indian be beyond fair chance of hitting father took long steady aim with deadly rifle upon report horse man went down rider be in instant upon foot again soon caught one of riderless horse have galloped off with companion followed comrade 'well done boy mr hardy said with hearty pat on shoulder have done gallantly for first fight feel proud of ' boy coloured with pleasure 'how many have killed ' think seven fell at first attack papa six here counting one carried off besides wounded ' be enough to make heartily wish

halting place 'the moon will be up by one o'clock boy mean to remain where be till then do see that hollow run just side of where be doubt there be small stream there ' time indian made move to retreat farther knew now that assailant be only three in number be armed indeed with weapon in terrible rapidity of fire be altogether beyond anything have hitherto seen in darkness must be of avail against sudden rush if indian did not run away did a before attack assailant horse have be placed in middle of cattle with few indian standing by to keep quiet rest of indian be not to be seen mr hardy guessed that be lying down in long grass be concealed among animal rascal have got clever chief among boy except half dozen head see over horse back there be nothing to see of know that if go close can pick off with gun bow arrow without giving single fair shot at go nearer boy doubt there be many of best shot hidden in grass 'we must scatter cattle with rocket papa ' 'yes must hubert must gain nothing by have got men by horse must soon get herd together again will keep that for night hallo to right boy for life ' not moment too soon did mr hardy perceive danger chief of indian expecting attack have ordered twenty of best mounted men to separate from main body to hide in dip of ground near place where first attack have taken place be to allow white to pas be then to follow quietly fall suddenly upon complete success have attended manoeuvre be fortunate that party have firearm having be distributed among main body with cattle for be within forty yard of mr hardy before be seen be in fact repetition of manoeuvre have proved so successful in attack upon cattle be not immediately in rear of mr hardy rather to left a mr hardy son turned to fly number of indian sprang upon foot from among grass discharged volley of gun arrow at fortunately distance be considerable one of arrow however struck mr hardy horse in shoulder while stuck in rider arm went through calf of hubert leg stuck in flap of saddle there be time for word complaint buried spur in horse side gallant animal feeling that occasion be urgent seemed almost to fly in mile be able to break into steady gallop enemy being now seventy eighty yard behind mr hardy have already pulled arrow from arm hubert now extracted a stooped to do so father who have not noticed that be wounded saw what be doing 'hurt much old man ' 'not much ' hubert said did hurt good deal nevertheless want to tire horse more boy mr hardy said will try stop rascal with one of revolver so saying drew one of pistol from holster turning round in saddle took steady aim fired at same instant however horse trod in hole fell mr hardy being thrown over head with tremendous force boy reined horse hard in hubert gave loud cry a saw father remain stiff unmoved on ground indian set up wild yell of triumph hubert jump off pick up papa pistol arrange horse in triangle round be right now throw away shot ' nearest indian be scarcely thirty yard off when charley bullet crashed into brain three immediately following fell in rapid succession chief arm sank useless to side while horse of fell shot through brain boy be pale hand be a steady a iron felt a if with father lying insensible under protection must not miss so terrible be destruction continued fire wrought among leader that others instinctively checked speed of horse a approached little group from fire ball seemed to stream began to discharge arrow at boy hanging on other side of horse so that by foe must not be seen favourite manoeuvre with indian a boy fired last barrel drew revolver from holster taking aim a indian showed head arm under horse neck over back twelve barrel added to indian scattered over ground hubert give two last revolver put two fresh chamber into carbine seeing only one of foe on defence indian again made rush forward charley shot two first with revolver others charged up stooped moment to avoid spear rising little on one side discharging with hand pistol at indian who be now close 'quick hubert ' said a shot with last barrel indian who have just driven spear into heart of mr hardy horse animal fell dead a stood indian with yell charged at opening a did so hubert slipped carbine into brother hand two again poured in deadly fire have so checked indian advance continuation of fire appalled indian seven survived turned fled ' will load hubert ' charley said trying to speak steadily beee to papa at once empty one of water gourd upon face head ' hubert looked down with cold shudder neither of boy have dared to think during brief fight have have many fall before on soft turf of pampas hurt have resulted be more frightened at insensibility of father than at indian horde be so short distance away must doubt return in few minute in overwhelming force great then be hubert delight when upon looking round saw that mr hardy have raised with arm have happened ' said in confused manner hurt papa hubert asked with tear of joy running down face frightened so dreadfully please drink little water will pour little over face ' mr hardy drank water hubert dashed more in face 'that will do hubert said with smile will drown there be right now be stunned suppose there be ' got up on to foot see be not hurt now where be indian 'there papa ' said boy with pardonable triumph a pointed to thirteen dead indian father must not speak grasped hand warmly saw how great danger must have be how gallantly boy must have borne 'the indian may be back in few minute papa horse be dead there be one of indian standing by dead master let catch shift saddle ' animal when approached made move to take flight saw that master foot a fell have become entangled in lasso well trained beast have stood without moving in three minute saddle be transferred party again ready for fight flight 'what next papa 'we turned to right rather towards home when started so indian halting place be to south east of be not ' 'yes papa a near a may be charley said making out point with difficulty on pocket compass one of carried a danger of being lost upon pathless pampas be very great have ridden about two mile when got fall so be mile to west of camp will ride now couple of mile due north indian be sure to send out scout to see whether have returned home track will lead to believe that have be dusk now will get three hour rest before have to move ' be perfectly dark before reached halting place saddle be again loosened little indian corn moistened with water given to horse slight meal taken by boy by mr hardy order though sorely against own wish then lay down to get couple of hour sleep while mr hardy went back about hundred yard along trail have made on coming then turned aside sat down at distance of few yard to watch in case indian must have followed up trail here sat for over two hour then returned to boy charley found fast asleep pain of hubert wound have kept awake mr hardy poured water over bandage then waking charley gave instruction a to part be to play of felt rather uncomfortable when heard that be to be separated from father raised objection however promised to obey instruction to letter then mounted horse hubert having to be lifted up for leg be now very stiff sore then began to retrace step keeping hundred yard so to west of track by have come rode in single file have taken precaution of fastening piece of tape round horse nostril mouth to prevent snorting must approach of own specie night be dark star shone out clear bright at starting mr hardy have opened watch have felt by hand that be ten o'clock after time felt again be just hour from time of starting 'now boy be somewhere close to place of fight in ten minute must separate ' at end of time again closed up 'now boy see that bright star be nearly due east of go on a nearly a can guess for ten minute at walk a before will then be within mile of enemy then get off horse mind on account be to leave bridle stand with one hand on saddle ready to throw into keep two blue light give one speak word a if life depended upon detecting sound a indeed do be to remain there until see have fairly succeeded then be to dash in behind cattle fire off revolver shout so a to quicken pace a much a possible think there be least fear of indian following rocket will scare too much when have chased herd for about two mile draw aside mile on side then listen for indian passing in pursuit of cattle wait ten minute then blow dog whistle sharp short note if hear indian following think there be danger blow twice go still farther to right god bless boy think there be much fear of falling upon scout have be too badly cut up to day must look upon gun a witch need not say keep together if attacked light blue light throw down ride short way out of circle of light will come straight to through everything be nervous about there be not least danger ' in minute boy lost sight of father turning horse proceeded in direction have ordered now then stopped to listen not sound must hear own horse hoof made noise a fell upon soft turf at end of ten minute just a charley be thinking of stopping heard sound caused to halt simultaneously be low baa of sheep seemed to come from directly ahead of charley now alighted hubert brought horse up beside keeping place however in saddle leaning forward on neck of horse for felt that if got off must be unable to regain seat hurriedly in case of alarm 'about mile off must say by sound charley whispered 'and just in direction expected ' spot charley have chosen for halt be slight hollow running east west so that even have moon be up must not have be visible except to one in line of hollow here carbine cocked ready for instant use remained standing for what appeared to age listening with most intense earnestness for sound might tell of failure success of father enterprise mr hardy have ridden on for a nearly a must tell two mile so that be now to south west of enemy then turning west kept along for mile when judged that be a nearly a possible mile in direct rear now advanced with greatest caution faculty absorbed in sense of listening be soon rewarded by sound of baaing of sheep dismounting leading horse gradually approached spot at last on ascending slight rise fancied that must make out black mass at distance of quarter of mile of however be not certain be sure from occasional sound that herd be exactly in direction at about distance now left horse taking precaution of tying four leg to prevent starting off at sound of rocket next set to work to cut turf with formed narrow sloping bank with hollow for rocket to rest in calculating exact distance angle required during operation stopped minute two listened with ear on ground except faint stamping noise from distant cattle be quiet being prepared mr hardy took signal rocket placing at much higher angle than intended for others struck match applied to touch paper in moment afterwards there be loud roar rocket soared up with train of brilliant spark behind burst almost over indian camp five six ball of intense white light broke from gradually fell towards ground lighting up whole surrounding plain yell of astonishment fear broke from indian in moment rocket rushed out mr hardy watched fiery way with anxiety saw with delight that direction be true describing slight curve rushed full at black mass struck something turned abruptly then exploded with loud report followed instantly by cracking noise like straggling fusilade of musketry have scarcely ceased before third followed greeted like predecessor with yell from indian success be equal to of predecessor mr hardy be delighted by sound of dull heavy noise like distant thunder knew that success be complete that have stampeded cattle now ran to horse be trembling in limb struggling wildly to escape soothed by patting loosed bond sprang into saddle went off at full gallop in direction by have come have not ridden very far before heard in still night air repeated sound of firearm knew that boy be upon trail of cattle mr hardy have little fear of indian pursuing felt sure that slaughter of day by new mysterious firearm together with effect of rocket must have too much terrified cowed for to think of anything flight be however much alarmed when after quarter of hour riding heard single sharp whistle at about few hundred yard distance 'hurrah papa ' boy said a rode up to 'they have gone by at tremendous rush sheep cattle started moment saw first rocket got up just a rushed past joined in behind fired yelled till be hoarse think will stop again to night ' see hear anything of indian boy 'nothing papa when first rocket burst saw several dark figure leap up from grass where have be no doubt scouting run towards camp be what be to do now ' 'ride on straight for home need not trouble about animal wo stop till be back must go easily for horse have done very long day work already have be between fifty sixty mile think that have better ride on for hour by time moon will be up will be able to see for mile across plain then will halt till daybreak will only be three hour horse will be able to carry in at canter afterwards so be done in hour moon be fairly up choosing rise whence clear view must be obtained horse be allowed to feed mr hardy hubert lay down to sleep charley taking post of sentry with order to wake others at daybreak day be just dawning when aroused 'wake up papa there be figure coming over plain mr hardy hubert be on foot in instant charley ' 'from north papa must have passed in pursuit of

buenos ayres ready to be picked culture of tobacco requires considerable care ground be first prepared with great care be well thoroughly manured be not required in present case a rich virgin soil needed artificial aid be then dug in bed something like asparagus bed about two foot wide with deep trench between seed be raised in seed bed when nine ten inch high be taken up carefully transplanted into bed two row being placed in plant being foot apart there be various method of cultivation be one adopted by mr plant grew rapidly ground between being occasionally hoed kept free from weed when be four foot high top be nipped off leaf showed sign of disease be removed stem have from eight to ten leaf when leaf began to turn rather yellow mr hardy announced that time for cutting have arrived one morning hand be mustered to work consisted merely in cutting stem at level with earth laying plant down gently upon ground by breakfast time two acre be cleared be left day to dry in sun little before sunset be taken up carried up to one of store shed have be cleared prepared for purpose here be placed in heap on ground covered over with raw hide mat left for three day to heat after be uncovered hung up on lath from roof close to other yet sufficiently far apart to allow air to circulate between here remained until be quite dry be then taken down damp covering being chosen for operation a otherwise dry leaf must have crumbled to dust be again laid in heap covered up to allow to heat once more second heating required day to accomplish operation required great attention a tobacco must have be worthless if plant have heated too much in ten day operation be complete leaf be then stripped off upper leaf be placed by a also middle lower leaf higher one being of finest quality be then tied in bundle of twelve leaf be packed in layer in barrel great pressure being applied with weighted lever to press down into almost solid mass in filled three barrel smallest of containing sixty pound of finest tobacco mr hardy kept for own use that of friend rest sold at buenos ayres at profitable rate venture like of cotton have proved success trouble care required have be very great mr hardy determined in future to plant only sufficient for own use that of men employed upon estate next experiment be perfected be that with sugar cane in far more than in others mr hardy girl took lively interest sugar have be one of few article of consumption have cost money have be used in considerable quantity for converting fruit into fine pudding preserve be not contemplated to make sugar for sale only for supply of house two acre therefore be extent of plantation mr hardy procured cutting from friend who have small sugar plantation near buenos ayres cultivation of sugar be simple land having be got in perfect order deep furrow be ploughed at distance of five foot apart in cutting be piece of upper part of cane containing two three knot be laid at distance of three foot apart plough be then taken along by side of furrow so a to fill up again cover cutting in sugar plantation row of cane be close together mr hardy have chosen distance a enabled horse hoe to work between thus keep ground turned up free from weed without expense of hard labour in short time shoot appeared above soil in four month have gained height of fourteen foot glossy stem showed that be ready to cut 'now clara mr hardy said 'this be manufacture know be only to work under superintendence cane be ready to cut how do intend to crush juice out because be really important question ' young hardy looked aghast at other for in pressure of other matter question of apparatus for sugar manufacture have be quite forgotten 'have really idea how to do frank ' really have not dear have certainly no wood on place must make roller besides must be rather difficult business mr hardy thought for minute then said ' must think that mangle must do ' there be general exclamation of 'capital mamma then burst of laughter at idea of making sugar with mangle mangle in question be part of patent washing apparatus mr hardy have brought with from england consisted of two strong iron roller kept together by strong spring turning with handle ' do think that mangle must do clara mr hardy said 'and be all much obliged to for idea have thought of great washing copper for boiling sugar mangle altogether escaped will begin to morrow please get tub scrubbed out scalded put out in sun to dry long will take papa ' beome day ethel must only cut cane a fast a boiler can boil juice down ' next day work began cane be cut at level with ground top be taken off cane cut into length of three foot be then packed on bullock cart taken up to house be next passed through mangle succeeded admirably juice flowing out in stream into tub placed below to receive when cane have be passed through mangle screw be tightened to increase pressure be again passed through by time although juice be not so thoroughly extracted a must have be by more powerful machine quantity remained be not important a tub be filled content be taken to great copper under fire be then lighted crushing of cane be continued until copper be nearly full when mr hardy ordered cutting of cane to be discontinued for day fire under copper be fed with crushed cane burnt very freely mr hardy now added small quantity of lime sheep blood last ingredient caused many exclamation of horror from mr hardy young one blood however mr hardy informed be necessary to clarify sugar a albumen contained in blood must rise to surface bringing impurity with fire be continued until thermometer showed that syrup be within few degree of boiling surface be covered with thick dark coloured fire be then removed liquor allowed to cool family now going about other work a so large quantity of liquor must not be really cold until next day following morning tap at bottom of boiler be turned syrup came out bright clear about colour of sherry wine scum descended unbroken on surface of liquor when copper be nearly empty tap be closed scum what little liquor remained be taken out bright syrup be now again poured into boiler fire re lighted syrup be kept boiling to evaporate water condense syrup down to point at must crystallize required many hour boiling to effect scum rose to surface being carefully taken off with skimmer at last be found that syrup on skimmer began to crystallize mr hardy pronounced to be fit to draw off into large washing tub to crystallize fresh batch of cane be now crushed so process be repeated until cane be cut took fortnight altogether only five day of be actually occupied in cutting crushing cane a sugar crystallized be taken out dark pulpy looking mass at young hardy looked very doubtfully be placed in large sugar hogshead have be procured for purpose in bottom of eight large hole be bored be stopped up with piece of plantain stalk through porous substance of stalk molasses treacle slowly drained off a wet sugar be placed in cask layer of slice of plantain stem be laid upon a spongy substance draw dark colouring matter out from sugar plantain grows freely in south america mr hardy have planted number of graceful tree near house have not be advanced enough to cut have therefore procured sufficient quantity from friend at rosario be three month before drainage of molasses quite ceased hardy be greatly pleased on emptying hogshead removing plantain stem to find sugar be dry of very fairly light colour sugar cane did not require planting again a will grow for many year from same root although cane from old stool a be called produce le sugar than of first year planting juice be clearer requires far le trouble to prepare refine before year came round boy made pair of wooden roller of eighteen inch in diameter be covered with strip of hoop iron nailed lengthways upon at short interval from other thereby obtaining better grip upon cane preventing wood from being bruised grooved roller be worked by horse mill mr hardy have ordered from england be made for five horse did great deal of useful work grinding indian corn into fine flour for home consumption for sale to neighbouring settler into coarse meal pulping pumpkin root for pig other animal mr hardy also tried many other experiment a climate be suited to almost kind of plant vegetable among be cultivation of ginger of vanilla bean of flax hemp coffee in of obtained more le success difficulty of obtaining labour necessity of devoting more more attention to increasing flock herd irrigated land prevented from carrying out on large scale however served purpose for principally undertook of giving object of interest amusement to child chapter xii steady hand be now more than eighteen month since hardy

time be now again approaching when indian foray be to be expected be still month earlier than attack of year before mr hardy with increased number of men have not least fear of successful assault upon

that danger there be have be defeated 'now papa ' charley said 'you give account first ' have not much to tell charley fitzgerald have ridden out distance five mile must say when dog stopped at thicket put out lion fitzgerald fired with left hand barrel be loaded with beast fell got off to skin dash barked furiously saw couple of dozen indian coming up close to stopped moment to give barrel with duck shot then jumped into saddle rode for unfortunately have be foolish enough to go out without revolver pressed hard be never in fear of actually catching only alarm be that one of might repeat disaster of armadillo hole so only tried to hold own thirty forty yard ahead made sure that one other of must see coming must have shouted loudly enough can tell to warn a came up besides knew at worst arm be hanging above fireplace that only wanted time to run in catch up get to door to be able to defend house till must help now what be story charley ' have even le than papa be down at dam then went into hen house be just thinking must make better arrangement for nest when indian war yell between house be followed almost directly by two crack knew be girl rifle rushed to door looked out saw two indian coming along at full gallop by direction be taking must pas only little way from hen house so stepped back till heard be opposite then going out gave barrel to nearest to stopped galloping about pretty effectually when reached place saw that hubert have have narrow squeak of for maud have fainted ethel be in great state of cry have time to ask many question for ran up to hoist danger flag then saw fitzgerald coming along with indian after now hubert let hear story ' papa know said yesterday be sure that have seen new duck afternoon rode out to pool in hope that might still be there left horse crept on very cautiously through reed till got sight of water sure enough there be duck rather on other side waited for long half hour at last came over rather nearer dived at first barrel a came up gave second flirt went in brought out be new sure enough two blue feather under eye duck hubert charley put in 'we care for blue feather want to hear about indian 'well be coming to indian hubert said 'but be new duck for if like will show there ' took out of pocket laid on table one appeared to have slightest interest in to pay attention to so hubert went on 'well after looking at duck put into pocket went out from bush to horse a got to heard yell nearly made tumble down startled so not hundred yard away riding to cut off from home be thirty forty indian be not long a may guess climbing into saddle bolted like shot must not make straight for home have to make sweep to get round be better mounted than of except three kept gradually gaining on while rest in turn gave up chase like papa have left revolver behind black tom did best encouraged to utmost began to think that be up with for be convinced that must catch before must get in when be little more than three hundred yard from gate saw maud come dashing down with rifle towards gate little afterwards ethel came too indian kept getting nearer nearer expected moment to feel tomahawk must not think why girl did not fire supposed that did not feel sure enough of aim have consolation that indian nearest must not be going to strike must risk shot on went indian be so close that must feel horse breath idea came across mind that brute be trying to catch hold of calf of leg at hundred yard must see face quite plain then felt certain be saved looked a steady a if have be taking aim at mark thought flashed across of how last week have hit small stone on post at eighty yard first shot when charley have missed dozen time then there be frightful yell almost in ear then heard maud cry out stoop hubert stoop be stooping before head went down to horse mane can tell then there be crack of two rifle yell of pain must not look round felt that horse behind have stopped be safe that story papa illustration hubert escape from indian page few more question elicited from mr hardy that knew of then warmest commendation be bestowed upon girl ethel however generously disclaimed all praise a said that must have done nothing at have not be for maud steadiness coolness 'and now let have tea ' mr hardy said 'and then can talk over measure for to night ' think that will attack papa ' ethel asked 'yes ethel think that most likely will a came across plain noticed several other party quite in distance there must be very strong body out altogether probably have resolved upon vengeance for last year defeat have better have left alone for have more chance of taking house with upon guard than have of flying there be one advantage in will get such lesson do think will be perfectly free from indian attack for future after tea lopez came up for order will place mr hardy said 'two peon at corner of outside fence one of will come round half hour to see that be right instruction be that in case hear movement one be to come up to immediately with news other be to go round to tell other sentry to do same be to be done in perfect silence want to know that be ready for reception bring fresh straw up lay down here on floor woman can sleep here ' 'what will do about own horse signor ' lopez asked mr hardy thought moment think have better send down to enclosure with others might be driven off if be left up here see that can require ' 'but what about cattle papa ' charley asked must be serious loss if be driven off especially milch cow if like will go down with terence can take up station among must be strong post for indian of course must not attack on horseback with carbine terence gun brace of revolver think must beat off easily enough especially a must cover with gun have thought of plan charley must be dangerous must cause up here great anxiety imagine too that a doubt great object be vengeance will attack first here may make effort upon cattle at same time that attack here will not begin with animal will find very difficult business to break down fence must do to drive out while be about will not be idle depend upon ' preparation be soon made be agreed that mr hardy hubert must go round alternately with charley fitzgerald a usual thing indian attack take place in last hour two of darkness mr hardy thought however that exception must be made in present case in order that might get a far a possible away before pursuit took place wife of peon lay down to sleep on straw have be thrown down for men sat outside door smoking cigarette talking in low

have foreseen possibility of such thing now that be mentioned wonder did not do so before mr cooper have be here so much that thing must have certainly struck have not a say looked upon maud a child against mr cooper have nothing to say like extremely principle be good must in point of money be of course excellent match for little girl at same time can not permit anything like engagement mr cooper have seen other lady for so long time that be natural enough must fall in love with maud maud on other hand have only seen fifteen twenty men who came here know nothing of world be altogether inexperienced be going to england may not improbably meet people whom may like very much better may look upon love making in pampas a folly at end of two year when maud be nineteen if mr cooper renew

of assent separated to look for tool two three spade be found thrown down in garden where party have be at work other day then looked to mr hardy ' think ' said 'we can not do better than lay where

think will be before who intend to come can join ' mr hardy asked there be pause then one of jamiesons said 'judging by time message reached must have sent off before seven most of on receipt of message forwarded by fresh messenger on farther of course delay occurred in so doing especially a many of may probably have be out on plain when message arrived person to whom sent might also have be out friend who must be likely to obey summons at once live within fifteen mile so that make thirty mile going returning allowing for loss of time have mentioned must allow five hour must bring on to twelve o'clock ' there be general murmur of assent that case ' mr hardy said propose that eat meal a hearty a can before starting charley tell terence to bring horse with provision here ' animal be now brought up mr hardy found that in addition to charqui biscuit mr hardy have sent large supply of cold meat happened to be in larder bread large stock of tea sugar kettle tin mug cold meat bread afforded ample meal be much needed by who have come away without breakfast by twelve o'clock six more have arrived last comer being mr percy new comer be filled with rage horror upon hearing of awful tragedy have be enacted at twelve o'clock exactly mr hardy rose to foot friend said ' thank for so promptly answering to summons need say word to excite indignation at massacre have taken place here know too that child have be carried away intend with son friend from canterbury going in search of into indian country first object be to secure second to avenge murdered friend heavy lesson too given indian in own country will teach that can not with impunity commit depredation upon unless lesson be given life on plain will become so dangerous that must give up settlement at same time conceal from that expedition be most dangerous one be entering country of know nothing indian be extremely numerous be daily becoming better armed time may be away be altogether vague for if be year return until have found child know that there be not man here who must not gladly help to rescue ethel not one who doe not long to avenge murdered friend at same time of have tie wife child whom may not consider yourselves justified in leaving even upon occasion like of know will accompany if one feel doubt from reason have stated if one considers that have no right to run tremendous risk let say so at once will respect feeling friendship goodwill will in way be diminished a mr hardy ceased eye wandered round circle of stalwart looking figure around rested upon jamiesons one answered for moment then elder of brother spoke hardy be right kind of to say that who might elect to stay behind must not forfeit respect esteem for one say that must deservedly forfeit own have known esteemed mercer have known may say loved family from have one received very great kindness warmest hospitality know love dear child who have be carried away say that who stay behind be unworthy of name of man for brother say that if fall in expedition if never set eye upon wife again will die satisfied that have only done duty be with to death ' loud general cheer broke from whole party a usually quiet scotchman thus energetically expressed man in turn came up to mr hardy grasped hand saying 'yours till death ' mr hardy be too much affected to reply for short time then briefly heartily expressed thanks after went on 'now to business have here about three hundred pound of charqui let man take ten pound a nearly a can guess there be also two pound of biscuit man tea sugar tobacco kettle eighty pound of meat will put on to spare horse terence will lead if be well packed animal will be able to travel a quickly a can ' there be general muster round provision man took allotted share remainder be packed in two bundle secured firmly upon side of spare horse tobacco sugar tea being enveloped in hide placed securely between kettle placed at top of then mounting horse troop sallied out a mr hardy watched start felt that in fair fight by day must hold own against ten time number of indian man with exception of young hardy who have colt carbine have long rifle in addition to have pistol most of having revolver use of since hardy have first tried with such deadly effect upon pampas have become very general among english settler nearly be young with deep sunburnt hue gained by exposure on plain man have poncho sort of native blanket used either a cloak for sleeping in at will rolled up before on saddle must have be difficult to find more serviceable looking set of men expression of face a took last look at grave of mercer boded very ill for indian who might fall into clutch chapter xv pampas on fire party started at canter pace knew horse must be able to keep up for longest time breaking half hour so into walk for ten minute to give breathing time be well mounted on strong serviceable animal have not in case be bought specially for speed a have of hardy be evident that chase must be long one indian have twelve hour start be much lighter men than white carried le additional weight horse therefore must travel a fast a far a of pursuer sheep must be true be encumbrance cattle must scarcely be termed so be probable that first day must make journey of fifty sixty mile travelling at moderate pace only a must know that instant pursuit must take place indeed strength peon have estimated at five hundred men must render to certain extent careless a upon open plain charge of number of men must sweep away force must be collected short of obtaining strong body of troop from rosario for next two day be probable that must make a long speedy journey a animal must accomplish after being well in own country must cease to travel rapidly a pursuit have ever be attempted in former instance there be difficulty in following track mr mercer have possessed nearly thousand cattle five thousand sheep ground be trampled in broad unmistakeable line once twice mr hardy consulted compass trail ran south west by west there be not much talking whole party be too impressed with terrible scene have witnessed tremendously hazardous nature of enterprise have undertaken to indulge in general conversation gradually however steady rapid motion sense of strength reliance in other lessened sombre expression general talk began mostly upon indian fight in most of older settler have at one time other taken part mr hardy took part in encouraged conversation knew how necessary in expedition of sort be to keep up spirit of engaged endeavoured therefore to shake off own heavy weight of care to give animation life to spirit of younger men rose rapidly insensibly pace be increased until mr hardy a leader of party be compelled to recall to necessity of saving animal many of have already come from ten to fifteen mile before arriving at rendezvous at mercer after three hour steady riding arrived at bank of small stream there mr hardy called halt for purpose of resting animal think ' said 'that must have done five twenty mile will give hour rest then do fifteen of have already done forty will not do to knock up first day girth be loosened horse be at work cropping sweet grass near water edge whole party threw down on sloping bank pipe be taken out lit probable direction of chase discussed in short time charley rose saying ' will see if can get anything better than dried meat for supper ' exchanged rifle for mr hardy double barrelled gun be carried by terence whistling for retriever strolled off up stream in ten minute double barrel be heard at short distance quarter of hour afterwards again time faintly ten minute before hour be up appeared wiping perspiration from face with seven half brace of plump duck be killed in four shot said a threw down 'they be asleep in pool let fly right into middle of before heard ' there be general feeling of satisfaction at sight of bird be tied in couple fastened on horse in two minute more be again in saddle hubert saying to father a started 'there be one satisfaction papa ca miss way have only to ride far enough must overtake ' mr hardy shook head knew enough of indian warfare to be certain that artifice manoeuvre must have to be looked for baffled for even when believing safe from pursuit indian never neglect to take possible precaution against after riding for two hour longer mr hardy consulted guachos if there be stream near said that must be at least two hour riding before reached that be very uncertain supply mr hardy therefore decided to halt at once a men knew part of plain thoroughly from hunting ostrich on from frequent expedition in search of strayed cattle have lived hunted at one time with indian many of guachos take up abode permanently with indian being adopted a member of tribe living dressing like indian visit be generally undertaken to avoid consequence of little difficulty man killed in gambling quarrel for rivalry in love sometimes make peace again satisfy blood relation with bull secure absolution readily enough by confession gift of small sum to church return to former life a often a not remain with indian even attain to rank of noted chief among men who accompanied expedition be of former class have taken to pampas to escape consequence of crime other have grown perfectly sick of have returned to civilised life in point of moral be not perhaps desirable companion be brave enough thoroughly knew country farther inland if not enthusiastic in adventure be yet willing enough to follow respective master ready to fight for life upon occasion just a halted mr herries thought that caught sight of deer short way ahead therefore started at once for stalk several of others going off in other direction mr herries proceeded very cautiously wind being fortunately towards be enabled to creep up tolerably close animal be extremely shy have however idea that danger be about before must get within fair shot a knew that must be off in instant at once practised trick have often found to be successful threw on back pulled red handkerchief from neck tied to one of boot so a to let float freely in air then threw up leg in form of letter v then began moving slowly about waving to fro deer be upon point of flight paused to gaze at strange object then began to move in circle look still directed at unknown thing to gradually kept approaching a moved round at last be fairly in shot herries whose leg be beginning to be very weary sprang to foot in instant foremost of deer lay quivering in death taking upon shoulder proceeded to camp where arrival be hailed with acclamation fire be already alight made of grass turf former being pulled up in handful by root making fierce short lived blaze large quantity have be collected at hand duck be already cut up one be handed to for man be own cook upon pampas other hunter shortly returned bringing in of little deer for stag of pampas be of small size be speedily skinned by guachos cut up party be now engaged in roasting duck venison steak on steel ramrod over fire when be satisfied double handful of tea be thrown into kettle be already boiling pipe be lighted general feeling of comfort experienced horse have be picketed close at hand man having cut pulled heap of grass placed before beast beside picket rope allowed horse to crop grass growing in small circle of be centre mr hardy chatted apart for time with guachos anxious to know a much a possible of country into be entering others chatted told story presently mr hardy joined again in general conversation then during pause said 'although friend consider most improbable that indian be in neighbourhood still be just possible that may have remained on purpose to fall at night upon party who might venture to pursue at rate be right to begin work in business like way therefore propose that keep watch regularly be now nine o'clock will be moving by five will make four watch of two hour must say that three men in watch stationed at fifty yard from camp upon different side must suffice ' there be general assent to proposal save trouble ' mr hardy went on ' suggest that keep watch in alphabetical order of name twelve of will be on to night next twelve to morrow night ' proposal be at once agreed to three who be first on duty at once rose taking rifle went off in various direction first agreeing that one of must give single whistle a signal that watch be up that two whistle close together must be warning to retreat at once towards centre watch also ascertained be next three men to be roused succeeding watch agreed to lie next to other in order that might be roused without awakening companion in few minute there be general unrolling of poncho soon afterwards only sleeping figure must be seen by dim light of smouldering fire mr hardy indeed be only one of party who did not fall to sleep thought of event of last twenty four hour of best course to be adopted of heavy responsibility upon a leader of perilous expedition prevented from sleeping heard watch return rouse relief lay down in place in half hour rose walked out towards sentry be young man named cook one of new settler to east of mount pleasant that mr hardy asked a approached ' be just coming in to wake ' 'what be mr cook strike sir that there be strange light away to south west have only noticed last few minute thought be fancy get more distinct minute mr hardy looked out anxiously into gloom quickly perceived appearance that friend alluded to for minute two did not speak then a light evidently increased said almost with groan 'it be what feared must do have set prairie on fire need not keep watch longer be a much separated from indian a if ocean divided ' cook gave two short whistle agreed upon to recall other men on guard then returned with mr hardy to rest of party then mr hardy roused companion man leapt up rifle in hand believing that indian be approaching must be up doing ' mr hardy said cheerfully 'the indian have fired pampas there be thrill of apprehension in bosom of many present who have heard terrible account of prairie fire speedily subsided at calm manner of mr hardy fire ' said beay be ten mile away yet must say that be be difficult to judge for grass doe not flame very high smoke drift between wind fortunately be light will be here in little over hour now let four guachos attend to horse to see stampede rest form line couple of yard apart pull up grass by root throwing behind so a to leave ground clear wider can make better fell to work with hearty zeal looking over shoulder sky now appeared on fire flickering tongue of flame seemed to struggle upwards there be occasional sound of foot a herd of deer flew by before danger far will go papa do think ' hubert asked father next to whom be at work ' must say that must most likely stop at stream where halted to day hubert ground be wet boggy for distance on other side ' horse be now getting very restive there be momentary pause from work to wrap poncho round head so a to prevent seeing glare fire must not have be more than three mile distant when space cleared be a wide a mr hardy deemed necessary for safety regular noise something between hiss roar be plainly audible when wind lifted smoke flame must be seen running along in unbroken wall of fire bird flew past over head with terrified cry close hot smell of burning be very plainly distinguishable starting about half way along side of cleared piece of ground mr hardy set dry grass alight for moment two burned slowly then fanned by wind gained force spread in semicircle of flame horse be already unpicketed half of party held at short distance in rear while rest stood in readiness to extinguish fire if crossed cleared space over over again fire crept partially across for clearing have be done roughly be speedily stamped out by heavy boot of watcher spectacle a fire swept away before wind be fine in extreme party seemed enclosed between two wall of fire main conflagration be now fearfully close burning flake be already falling amongst sound of fire be like hiss of surf upon pebbly beach 'now mr hardy said with horse one to own animal put poncho over own head a well a horse '' in minute party stood clustered upon black smoking ground fire have kindled have swept clear there for five minute remained without moving unscorched by raging element around half choked with smoke then mr hardy spoke 'it be over now can look up ' there be general expression of astonishment a head emerged from wrapper eye recovered sufficiently from effect of blinding smoke to look round where have fire gone where indeed main conflagration have swept by have divided in two when reached ground already burnt column growing farther farther asunder a newly kindled fire have widened be already far away to right left while beyond between be fire that have kindled now two mile wide already far in distance fire in pampas although frequently extend over vast tract of country be seldom fatal to life grass rarely attains height exceeding three foot burn out almost like so much cotton man on horseback having other method of escape can by blindfolding horse wrapping own face in poncho ride fearlessly through wall of fire without damage to horse rider be only therefore young hand who have felt uneasiness at sight of fire for settler be in habit of regularly setting fire to grass upon farm year before rain a grass afterwards spring up fresh green for animal care have to be taken to choose calm day when flame can be confined within bound instance have occurred when fire so commenced have proved most disastrous destroying many thousand of animal 'there be nothing to do to remain where be until morning ' mr hardy said 'the horse have better be picketed then who can have better get few hour more sleep will want more watch to night ' in few minute most of party be again asleep young hardy be about to follow example when mr hardy came up to said quietly 'come way boy be going to have council ' boy followed father to where eight nine men be sitting down at short distance from sleeper boy made out by glow from pipe to consist of herries farquhar two jamiesons mr percy four guachos 'this be terribly bad business ' mr hardy began when son have taken seat on ground expected be heavy blow nevertheless 'why what be matter papa ' boy exclaimed anxiously 'have lost anything ' boy mr hardy said have lost what be at moment most important thing in world have lost trail charley hubert uttered simultaneous exclamation of dismay a truth flashed across mind trail be lost have never thought of in excitement of fire have never once occurred to that flame be wiping out trace of indian track mr hardy then went on addressing to others course fire be lit with especial intent of throwing off scent have idea how far be likely to have come asked guachos 'that be be aware of existence of wide stream damp ground must have checked must therefore be farthest boundary of fire ' guachos be silent minute then perez said 'the next stream be fifteen mile farther be small must not stop fire going with wind beyond there be certain stream a far a know of ' ground rise grass get thinner poorer thirty mile so on must say that must light side of ' martinez said other guachos nodded assent 'we took bearing of track by compass ' farquhar said 'must not follow on by compass across burnt ground hit upon other side mr percy mr hardy shook head pretend to say where trail be gone ' former said one place where be quite sure be not be on continuation of present line ' mr hardy continued 'as say percy there certainly be not indian when got to place be probably about half across burnt ground turned either to right left travelled steadily in direction sending one two of number in old direction to light grass so a to sweep away trace of trail may have gone to right to left may even have doubled back passed again at only few mile distance have clue to guide at present except certainty sooner later indian will make for own camping ground be exact state of affair mr hardy repeated what have just said in spanish to guachos who nodded assent 'and in direction do guachos believe that camping ground lie mr jamieson asked after pause 'because appears to that be waste of time to look for trail that only plan be to push straight on to village may reach before get there in case if found unguarded might seize woman hold a hostage until return then must exchange for ethel when have once got must fight way back 'capital capital ' other english exclaimed think so papa ' hubert added seeing that mr hardy did not join in general approval plan be admirably conceived one there be great difficulty in way observed yesterday that trail did not lead due south a must have done if indian be going straight back to camping ground questioned guachos agree with on subject trail be too westerly for camping ground of pampas indian too far to south for country of flat face of sierra fear that there be combination of two tribe a there be in attack upon that went first day in direction must be most advantageous for that on reaching halting place perhaps twenty thirty mile from here made division of booty tribe drew off towards own hunting ground in case have first to find two trail then to decide terrible question party have taken ethel ' again guachos upon being translated to expressed perfect accordance with mr hardy view surprise at idea having be so identical with own upon subject a for six young men be too dismayed at unexpected difficulty have started up in way to give opinion uncertainty be terrible felt that must have most depressing effect upon upon whole expedition for how must tell after journeying for hundred of mile whether step might not take farther from object of search in state of depression remained for minute when perez guacho said in broken english tribe take most plunder most cattle most sheep take girl ' thought of perez ' mr hardy exclaimed warmly 'that be clue for sure enough a say tribe who have furnished most men will a matter of course take larger share of booty ethel being only captive must naturally go to strongest tribe ' rest be delighted at solution of difficulty have before appeared insuperable most lively satisfaction be manifested plan for day be then discussed proposition be made that must divide into two party go one to right other to left until arrived at unburnt ground edge of must follow until met scheme be however given up a party must have seen trail inspected by other opinion must therefore be formed a to respective magnitude of party who have passed matter requiring most careful examination comparison accurate practised judgment be finally resolved therefore to keep in body to proceed in first place to search for trail of party to south calculation be made upon supposition that indian have travelled for twenty five mile upon old course then separated party making directly for home to avoid mistake to allow for detour be determined to shape direct course to point considerably to east of given by calculation to follow edge of burnt ground until trail be arrived at then to cut straight across in order to find examine trail of western indian a conclusion be arrived at first dawn of light appeared in east mr hardy at once roused sleeper then gave brief account of conclusion to have arrived in night of reason for so doing there be general expression of agreement then girth be tightened in five minute troop be in motion how great be change since preceding evening then a far a eye must reach stretched plain of waving grass bird have called to mate covey of game have risen at approach deer have be seen bounding away in distance ostrich have gazed for instant at unusual sight of man have gone off with head forward wing out stretched before wind now eye wandered over plain of dingy black unbroken by single prominence undisturbed by living creature except a hubert remarked to father 'it looked a if have be snowing black night men horse be anxious to get over dreary plain pace be faster halt le frequent than have be day before be fortunate that fire have not taken place at earlier hour of evening a horse must have be weakened by want of food a be have have five hour to feed after arrival men horse however suffered much from thirst former have good reason to congratulate on having filled water skin at first halting place of preceding day cloud of black impalpable dust rose a rode along eye mouth nostril be filled with be literally a black a ground over rode twice stopped drank sparingly washed out nostril mouth of horse be great relief to for suffered a much a did master a also did dash who owing to head being so near ground be almost suffocated indeed hubert at last dismounted took poor animal up on to saddle before at last after four hour steady riding gleam of colour be seen in distance in quarter of hour reached unburnt plain worn parched a be looked refreshing indeed after dreary waste over have passed guachos after consultation among agreed in opinion that little stream of have spoken be short distance farther that although channel might be dry pool must doubt be found in be determined therefore to push on hour riding by edge of burnt grass brought to spot when following course of channel soon came to pool from men horse took long drink at approach immense number of wild duck rose a soon a horse be picketed charley again started with gun taking terence with to assist in bringing home bird soon heard gun terence presently returned with six brace of duck goose request that man must go back with for that bird be so abundant so apparently stupified from flying over smoke flame that must bring in quantity one of jamiesons herries therefore went out returned in le than hour with charley bringing between four more goose eighteen brace of duck charley be greeted with round of applause be soon at work with friend upon meal be now ready after breakfast there be comparison of opinion be at last generally agreed that have ridden nearly forty mile since daybreak that must not be far from spot where indian ought to have passed if have kept direction a calculated be also agreed that must be better to let horse remain where be till late in afternoon when might accomplish fifteen mile so mr hardy then proposed that who be inclined must accompany on walk along edge of burnt ground can not be very far off from trail said 'if calculation be correct if can find examine before be time to start may be able to night to cross to other side thus gain hour herries farquhar two jamiesons cook young hardy at once volunteered for walk shouldering rifle started at steady pace have not walked much over mile when shout of pleasure broke from a upon ascending slight rise saw in hollow below broad line of trampled grass showed that large body of animal have lately passed along hurried forward close anxious examination took place opinion differed good deal a to number have passed accustomed a be to seeing track made by herd of cattle flock of sheep must come to approximate agreement on subject have number be smaller task must have be easier be question requiring extreme knowledge judgment to decide whether four hundred cattle two thousand sheep six hundred cattle three thousand sheep have passed over piece of ground mr hardy at last sent charley back accompanied by mr cook to request mr percy to come on at once with guachos to give opinion charley companion be to remain with horse be to request not specially sent for to stay there also a must be imprudent in extreme to leave horse without strong guard pending arrival of mr percy mr hardy friend followed up trail for distance so a to examine in soft bottom on rise returned in hour to starting place be shortly after joined by mr percy guachos again careful prolonged examination took place tolerably unanimous opinion be at last arrived at that very large number of animal have passed apparently larger half that positive opinion must be arrived at until comparison be made with trail on western side although conclusion be arrived at unanimously appeared to be reluctantly conceded to by most of reason of became apparent a be walking back towards horse have little doubt that conclusion have arrived at be correct ' herries remarked 'although somehow be sorry for for ever since talk last night have made up mind that be most likely to be taken to west suppose because indian there be more warlike than of pampas therefore likely to have furnished larger contingent of course have reason for thinking so so be ' be just what thought hubert said other englishman admitted that have entertained somewhat similar idea at four in afternoon be again in saddle having taken precaution of filling water skin of watering horse last thing 'how far do think be across papa ' hubert asked 'it can not be very far hubert be so much nearer place where fire began that think can have spread more than ten mile so across ' mr hardy conjecture proved to be correct hour half riding brought to other side of burnt prairie striking point felt sure be to south of place where trail must have left a have done more than fifty mile since morning horse be much distressed with effect of dust be resolved to encamp at once horse received little water be picketed out to graze fire be soon lit duck cut up spitted upon ramrod be so much exhausted with heat ash fatigue want of sleep of previous night that tea pipe finished watch posted rest laid down to sleep before sun have be hour below horizon rose at daybreak refreshed with quiet night rest be soon in saddle on way northward have nearly hour ride before came upon trail there be unmistakeably at first sight a broad a much trampled a other after careful examination of there be one opinion namely that number of animal who have passed be decidedly le than who have gone south one of guachos now told mr hardy that knew that at short distance further to west there be spring of water much used by indian where have doubt have halted on night of fire finding that be not more than hour ride mr hardy after brief consultation determined to go over there to water horse breakfast before retracing footstep across burnt prairie in little over time named came to small pool of bright water from little stream issued running nearly due north across plain after drinking heartily filling water skin kettle horse be allowed to drink dash plunged in with greatest delight emerging usual bright chestnut colour whereas have gone into water perfectly black after have come out have shaken commenced hunting about sniffing so violently that hubert attention be attracted to presently dog ran forward few pace gave sharp bark of pleasure hubert running forward gave so loud cry party rushed up hubert must not speak there buried in ground pointing west be indian arrow round head be twisted piece of white calico with little blue spot upon mr hardy instantly recognised a piece of dress ethel have worn when left home surprise kept quiet for while then exclamation of pleasure excitement broke from while mr hardy son be greatly affected at proof of recent presence of lost one arrow be deeply sunk in ground be placed at spot where grass happened to be particularly short so that one passing outward from spring must hardly have failed to notice piece of calico upon grass there be perfect shower of congratulation be time before be recovered sufficiently to renew preparation for breakfast at last sat down round fire face radiant with excitement perez martinez however sat somewhat apart talking in animated undertone to other did not even approach fire to roast food mr hardy attention being attracted by circumstance asked what be talking so earnestly about of answered repeated question then perez replied beartinez think same trick girl gone other way conversation eating be alike suspended at ominous word looked blankly into others face now that attention be called to whole circumstance of case rushed to mind a felt probable truth of what perez said hope fell to zero mr percy be first who after long silence spoke be afraid hardy that what perez say be right that have be very nearly thrown off scent by most transparent trick watched a ethel must have be be probable that must have possessed herself of arrow have fastened strip of dress to without being noticed still more impossible be that must have placed arrow where found one must have passed without noticing so unless suppose that be allowed to linger behind one be out of question arrow must not have be put there by true percy mr hardy said with sigh after short silence 'it be altogether impossible must call clumsy artifice be not that deceived for while however there be one comfort decides question a have decided ethel be gone with larger party to south breakfast be continued with very subdued feeling hubert have now finished being lad of restless habit took up arrow lay beside began toying with first untied piece of stuff smoothed put into pocket book while eye filled with tear then continued listlessly twisting arrow in finger while listened to conversation around presently eye fell upon arrow started flush of excitement rushed across face hand lip trembled a closely examined feather gazed at with astonishment 'oh papa papa ' cried at last know arrow ' 'know arrow repeated 'yes be quite quite sure know remember charley day that wounded indian started a be taking quiver down to noticed that one arrow have two feather have never seen before must not guess what bird came from be light blue with crimson tip pulled one off to compare with others be at home now remember that chose one did because other one have two of little side feather gone be feather can most solemnly declare see fellow one be gone that arrow belongs to one of men recovered ' crowded round to examine arrow then mr hardy said solemnly 'thank god for mercy have decided way now undoubtedly a hubert say one of men aided be of party wish to show gratitude so have managed to get piece of ethel dress have tied to arrow hoping that must recognise feather thank god there be more doubt thank too ethel have at least one friend near be now joy congratulation hubert rubbed hand said triumphantly 'there charley be always chaffing wanting to know what be good of collection now see what be good have put on right trail for ethel will never be able to laugh at about collection again chapter xvi at stake be on evening of fifth day after capture by indian ethel hardy rode into wide valley in heart of mountain be entered by narrow gorge through ran stream beyond hill receded forming nearly circular basin mile in diameter from side of rock ascended almost perpendicularly so that only mean of entering be through gorge clump of tree be scattered everywhere about nearly in centre stood large indian village numbering about three hundred lodge population of consisting almost entirely of woman child came out with shrill cry of welcome to meet returning band be two hundred strong before drove about four hundred cattle fifteen hundred sheep in midst of band ethel hardy rode apparently unwatched forming part of girl be very pale turned even more so at wild yell of triumph rose around when who have be left behind learned how signal have be success of warrior heard that captive in midst be one of family have inflicted such terrible loss upon tribe two year previously fortunately must not understand volley of threat curse woman of tribe heaped upon although must not mistake furious ejaculation ethel have cried at first until must cry more have now nerved for worst have heard that indian have mercy pity for one who may exhibit fear of death knew that entreaty tear must move in slightest courage firmness must at rate command respect admiration have therefore schooled to show emotion when time came now except that have given involuntary shudder at sight of gesticulating throng betrayed sign whatever of emotion looked round so calmly unflinchingly that violent abuse gesticulation died away in murmur of admiration of pale faced child who looked so calmly on death illustration ethel capture by indian page nevertheless a troop drew up in front of council hut alighted woman pressed round a usual to heap abuse upon prisoner one of indian stepped up to waved back saying be child of great chief took by arm handed over to care of wife of one of principal chief selection be good one for woman who be young be known in tribe a fawn for gentle disposition at once led captive away to lodge where bade sit down offered food spoke kindly to in low soft indian tongue ethel must not understand kindly tone moved more than threat of crowd outside have done broke down in torrent of tear indian woman drew girl to a mother might have done stroked long fair hair soothed with low talk then motioned to pile of skin in corner of hut when ethel gladly threw down upon indian woman covered up a must have done child with nod of farewell tripped off to welcome husband hear news knowing that there be possibility of captive making escape exhausted with fatigue emotion ethel sob soon ceased fell into sound sleep of terrible catastrophe at mercer have confused idea be sitting round table talking when without slightest notice warning window door be burst in dozen of dark form leapt into room saw mr mercer rush to wall seize pistol then saw more be seized thrown over shoulder of indian before have time to do more than leap to foot there be confused whirl of sound around shriek threat pistol shot savage yell then sound swam in ear fainted when recovered consciousness found that be being carried on horse before captor that air be full of red glare supposed to arise from burning house on chief who carried perceiving that have recovered sens called to one of follower who immediately rode up bringing horse upon sidesaddle have be placed to ethel be transposed in minute be galloping along by side of captor even now must hardly persuade herself that be not dreaming that instantaneous scene at mercer confused sound wild cavalcade of dark figure who rode round must not surely be real ala must not doubt a thought came across what must say at home when heard burst into agony of silent tear towards daybreak be often startled to hear word ethel hope ' in spanish distinctly spoken close to turned hastily there rode dark form a usual still felt sure that be not mistaken own name have distinctly heard although must not form conjecture who unknown friend must be still be great consolation to to feel that have at rate one well wisher among enemy have told to hope too ethel spirit with elasticity of youth rose at word why must not hope thought be sure to hear at home next morning even if one escaped took news earlier be certain that within few hour of hearing father friend must be on trail before night fell at latest must be assembled twenty four hour start must be utmost that indian must possibly obtain

that might not be able to attack indian directly came up for must not be very strong party whereas indian be several hundred strong believed that sooner later in way other father brother must come to

consulted with two three of principal adviser then moved forward waving hand to command silence countenance be calm unmoved although inwardly be boiling with rage at defiance of authority be too politic chief however to show knew that great majority of tribe be with yet employment of force to drag raven companion from post must probably create division in tribe final result of none must see for consequence of must in case of reverse be held responsible looked upon with disapproval by party raven friend have great heart said courteously 'they be large enough to shelter little white bird

earnestly together be in way deceived by appearance of friendliness stag have assumed knew that henceforth there be bitter hatred between that very life be insecure a to ethel be knew only short reprieve have be granted stag must not risk division in tribe for sake must attempt to bring to formal execution first time wandered from hut must be found dead with knife in heart raven however felt certain that help be at hand friend who knew mr hardy be alone of tribe convinced that pursuit must be attempted fact that such attempt to penetrate into heart of indian country have ever be made have lulled rest into feeling of absolute security raven indeed calculated that pursuer must now be close at hand that on night next must probably enter gorge make attack result of council be that left friend walked in leisurely way back to own hut taking notice of hostile glance of more violent of stag supporter cast towards on entrance be welcomed by wife young girl whom have only married since return from expedition to whom from what have learned of position of woman among white allowed more freedom of speech action than be usually permitted to indian woman have be one of small group who have pitied white girl raven be great chief said proudly 'he have done well mouse trembled be glad to see lord stand forth stag will strike though ' added anxiously 'he will look for blood of raven stag be great beast ' indian said sententiously 'but raven eat at last then sitting down upon pile of skin chief filled pipe made sign to wife to bring fire then smoked in silence for time until sun

following trail since have struck broad line of trodden ground frequent carcase of sheep sufficiently told tale be night of terrible anxiety to knew that already be in indian village thought with sickening dread of what might happen next day nothing however must be done many of party be already exhausted by long day walk under burning sun be altogether impossible to reach village night before lying down for night mr hardy asked party to join in prayer for preservation of daughter during following day be strange impressing sight to see group of sunburnt travel worn men standing uncovered while leader offered up earnest prayer mr hardy then said for night be unnecessary to keep watch a usual indian have pushed on must no longer dread pursuit therefore there be risk of night attack besides there be little chance of sleeping proposition be most acceptable one in very short time perfect silence reigned in camp before daybreak be again on march on foot leading horse in order to spare a much a possible must be required at night speed be now object be knew hopeless to attack in broad daylight a indian must be probably more than match for ethel life must be inevitably sacrificed walked therefore until within six seven mile of gorge nearer than dared not go lest might be seen by straggling indian halting place be determined by finding stream with abundance of fresh grass on bank dared not light fire chewed of tough charqui watched distant cleft in hill led to ardently wished for goal a evening fell be in saddle be pleased to find that horse be decidedly fresher for rest did not draw rein until ground became stony knew that must be at mouth of gorge then dismounted picketed horse two of guachos be stationed with a guard rest went stealthily forward rocket

inmate compel one of under threat of instant death to guide to hut in ethel be placed suddenly mr hardy be startled by dark figure rising from rock against have almost stumbled with word man good tawaina friend come to take to child then followed few hurried question word can express delight gratitude of mr hardy son intense satisfaction of others on finding that ethel be alive for present free from danger be agreed to wait now for two hour to give time for indian to retire to rest while waited raven told have happened up to arrival at village passing over last day proceeding by saying briefly ethel have run great risk of being put to death that delay have be obtained by friend having told story said friend to great white chief gave signal with arrow save little white bird to day tawaina indian not like see indian killed white chief promise not kill indian woman child mr hardy assured indian that have thought of killing woman child 'if can take little white bird without waking

beust go out on plain ' raven said earnestly 'if go out on plain killed indian two hundred fifty brave eat up white men on plain ' be afraid be true enough tawaina though will prove very tough morsel still must fight at fearful disadvantage in open what be to do ' 'come back to mouth of canon hold can keep indian off a long a like indian have to make peace ' 'capital mr hardy said delightedly for have reviewed position with great apprehension a have not seen how must be possible to make good retreat on tired horse in teeth of indian very thing a say can hold gorge for month if necessary sooner later will be sick of agree to let retreat in quiet besides week rest must set horse up again then must make retreat in spite of ' 'one more thing ' raven said 'when great chief got little white bird

while at same instant saw gleam of light in other corner of tent heard rustling noise knew that indian have cut slit in hide wall have escaped a mr hardy pressed child to heart terrific war whoop rose on air behind hut 'come mr hardy said together make run of ' ethel have laid down without taking off even shoe so strong have be hope of father arrival be therefore impediment to speed of retreat for short distance be unopposed indian indeed rushed from hut like swarm of bee disturbed by intruder ignorant of nature of danger unable to see cause be for minute wild confusion then guided by war whoop of indian who have given alarm hurried toward spot a did so several saw little party of white loud whoop gave intimation of discovery rush towards be made 'now revolver mr hardy said 'we be nearly out of village ' not a yet however be indian gathered thickly enough to stop few who attempted to throw in way be instantly shot down in le time than have occupied to read description reached end of

shooting up brightly enabled to see how small be body of white rushed forward again with fierce yell white be by time hundred fifty yard away be already disappearing in gloom mr hardy cried beteady with rifle man single out indian fire ' yell of rage broke from indian a fourteen fifteen of number fell momentary pause took place again then a be again reinforced continued pursuit two hundred yard white have gained be long start in half mile distance to be traversed white well knew that be running for life for once surrounded in plain case be hopeless well be then that ethel be so accustomed to out of door life hope fear lent speed to foot running between father brother be able to keep up speed equal to own scarce word be spoken a with clenched teeth beating heart dashed along only once mr jamieson said 'can ethel keep up gasped out 'yes white have great advantage in race that knew that have only mile in to run therefore put out best speed whereas although few of indian saw importance of overtaking fugitive on plain greater portion believed that prey be safe in hand made great effort to close with at once white too have advantage of being accustomed to walking exercise whereas indian almost living on horseback be seldom in habit of using foot consequently white reached narrow mouth of gorge full hundred fifty yard ahead of main body of pursuer although party of fastest runner be not more than half distance in rear there be general ejaculation of thankfulness a party now halted turned to face enemy be now that full advantage of mr hardy precaution of firing indian hut have become manifest fire have communicated to next two three dwelling broad flame rose up against glare of indian stood out distinctly while white be posted in deep gloom boy mr hardy said 'pick

cattle for journey forgive if have done wrong if white men be on plain raven must say let young man charge hold pas gun shoot without loading be too strong have spoken well there be low murmur of applause feeling that position of white men be impregnable be general felt convinced that terrible enemy must devise unknown scheme must end in total annihilation of tribe raven proposition be therefore unanimously assented to raven then laid aside arm attended by six of principal chief carrying green bough in token of amity advanced towards mouth of gorge mr hardy with five of white with

ethel of week of anxiety upon mother sister have so shaken that change even if have not be previously determined upon must have be imperatively necessary be not too much to say that mr hardy maud have suffered even more than ethel at least have known seen danger be sustained except during morning when be fastened to stake with strong hope belief of rescue left behind must hing picture up scene of horror pas time in alternately praying weeping be sadly shaken nervous during short time remained for at mount pleasant sea voyage fresh breeze soon brought health colour into cheek none of ever after felt bad effect from terrible week now story be drawing to close stormy period of mount pleasant settlement be over hard work difficulty danger of life of new settler on extreme edge of civilisation have be passed nothing remained to continue to devote attention energy to estate to reap fruit of labour for two year after departure of wife daughter mr hardy remained at post be now nearly six year since have left england longed to return to felt that must do so without uneasiness a to future rosario be according to anticipation rising into large important town country be fairly settled for league beyond estate land be rapidly rising in value there be now fear whatever of indian attack flock herd have multiplied greatly be doubling two year income obtained by sale of cattle fatted on alfalfa upon sale of wool other farm produce be considerable dairy alone brought in large yearly amount charley be now twenty two hubert year younger be a capable of managing estate a be one day therefore unfolded plan to 'as know boy be going to england shortly although will perhaps now then come over here will make england permanent home boy will therefore jointly manage estate income year will reach l must be much more did not keep greater portion of animal to increase stock have now l in bank after busy life have led here must not remain inactive present intention be to take large farm upon long lease with option of purchase object will be to obtain farm of large acreage poor land improvable by better drainage outlay of capital will risk l in also income draw from here for next two year profit will increase year will therefore in two year have sunk l in farm portion being devoted to building suitable house will of course during two year spend money may require in fact be impossible for to spend much money here at end of two year propose that first charley a elder will come home to england for year then that hubert will take turn will then stay year here together again have year in england so on regularly from end of two year will draw income of estate will take other half between to invest use a may think fit at end of six year calculate that estate will be stocked with a many cattle sheep a can support fifteen thousand cattle say thirty thousand sheep will then sell annual increase profit will be greater year at end of ten year from time if a think probable will have have enough of life will sell estate by time will be centre of populous district land will be greatly increased in value will be equal to in country so much so indeed that will probably be out of question to find purchaser for whole must therefore break up to suit purchaser dividing into lot of one two three four square mile square league dividing stock in proportion house must of course go with arable land mile two of pasture beyond share of yearly income will devote to buying estate say price be l will with income from here income from estate probably be able to make in ten year estate with l propose to risk in drainage etc ought then to be worth value of estate of fifty thousand acre with flock herd ought to be at least double amount so that at end of ten year will be rich man with care can certainly save l in ten year will receive l a share of estate will consequently boy at age of thirty one thirty two be able to settle down in england in very comfortable circumstance sister will of course be provided for out of share do approve of plan boy warmly expressed satisfaction at plan gratitude to father for intention so thing be carried out six month after
