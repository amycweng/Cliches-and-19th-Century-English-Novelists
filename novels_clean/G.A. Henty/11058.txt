up high street under great gate along through wide straggling street beyond into open country then across through field to harbledown jack never paused till hot panting entered gate father elder brother who have seen coming across field be standing in porch hurrah jack latter shouted be going to be first out after going to be first out jack gasped what on earth do mean harry come into parlor jack father said will hear about here mother two sister be sitting dear boy former said rising throwing arm round neck be sudden indeed what be sudden mother what be sudden jack asked what be about noticing tear on mother cheek went on ca be beastly verse be subject most upon mind being prominent must be that even if wallace took into head to make row about there must not be time what be mother sit down jack father said know boy have always said that must like to go to sea have interest that way six month ago wrote to nephew charles who be a know first lieutenant in navy asked if thought must get midshipman berth wrote back to say that be at present on half pay feared must be long time before be afloat again a there be few ship in commission have not much interest if be appointed might be able to get berth on board ship a did seem very hopeful thought better to say nothing to about however morning just after have started for school postman brought letter from saying that owing to threatening state of affair in east number of ship be being rapidly put in commission that have be appointed to 'falcon have seen captain a latter who happened to be old friend of have one in particular whom wished to oblige have kindly asked admiralty for midshipman appointment for have of course obtained 'falcon be being fitted out with haste be to join at once so will take to portsmouth to morrow jack be too much delighted surprised to be able to speak at first after minute two recovered breath uttered loud hurrah of delight then gave vent to feeling by exuberantly kissing mother sister be glorious said only to think that who have just be blown up for verse be midshipman in majesty service can hardly believe that be true oh father have so wished to go to sea have never said much about because thought did not like now to think of getting when have quite given up hope just at time too when there seems to be chance of row what be about father have heard say something about dispute with russia never gave much attention to cause of dispute be trumpery enough in wholly insufficient to cause war between two great nation began by squabble about holy place at jerusalem a to right of greek latin pilgrim respectively what have got to do with latin greek pilgrim jack asked must have thought that be quite bothered enough with latin greek verse without having anything to do with pilgrim besides did know there be latin now greek ai much major archer smiled latin pilgrim be member of country profess roman catholic religion while greek be who profess religion of greek church be to say in present case principally russian there have for year be squabble swelling sometimes into serious tumult between pilgrim of creed matter being generally complicated by interference of turkish authority with russian government have be endeavoring to obtain from turkey protectorate of christian in dominion france a leading catholic country naturally object to however be only pretext real fact be that russia who have for century be casting longing eye upon turkey think that time have arrived when can carry out ambitious design have always be policy upon other hand to sustain turkey have large interest in mediterranean considerable trade with levant be russia to extend dominion to constantinople position must be seriously menaced moreover perhaps be principal point be absolutely necessary for in future to be dominant in east of mediterranean egypt be rapidly becoming highway to india many men think that in future trade with great dependency will flow down valley of euphrates consequently be necessary to prevent russia at cost obtaining footing south of black sea do think father that there will really be war be inclined to think that there will be jack although be not popular opinion have so long in england be talking about iniquity of war that believe that emperor nicholas have persuaded that will not fight at price in be sure that be wholly mistaken so long a there be probability of war people of england have quietly permitted cheese paring politician who govern to cut down army navy to point when can hardly be said to have army at be convinced that people of england be at heart a warlike a of old few nation have done more fighting than roughly speaking war have always be popular if people at large once become convinced that honor interest of england be at stake will go to war politician in power will have to follow popular current give way to men who will do so at present however general idea be that demonstration upon part of england france will be sufficient to prevent russia from taking further step think that russia have gone too far to draw back russia be country where czar be nominally powerful where in point of fact be a much bound a other sovereign to follow wish of country conquest of constantinople have long be dream of russian now that czar have held out hope that dream be about to be realized will scarcely like to draw back surely father harry archer said russia can not think match for england france united know that boy russia have enormous population far larger than of england france united man from highest to lowest be at disposal of czar there be scarcely limit to force be capable of putting into field russia have not fought since day of napoleon in day russian troop showed to be a good a in europe at borodino smolensko be barely defeated after inflicting enormous loss on emperor army a in end annihilated largest army even napoleon have ever got together may well think that fighting close to own border while england france have to take troop across europe will be more than match for now jack must go down to town there be much to do to think about principal part of outfit will of course get at portsmouth where tailor be accustomed to work at high pressure underclothes can get here now dear if will go upstairs look through jack thing let know exactly how stand will go down with to

overtake along straight road must back against best of there be fear of trying that chief said pointing to rifle must soon be stopped if tried on however be not likely to make such mad attempt be after only young boy spirit have speedily evaporated however a measure of precaution ordered that man who be acting a sentry over boy must always keep rifle in hand meal over muleteer produced from pocket writing paper pencil chief then wrote on piece of paper figure followed by word dollar then said to boy capitan giving pencil sheet of note paper pointed to figure have written down then to sun

party peasant of twenty year old be then selected to letter be given with full instruction a to conduct during next two day boy maintained appearance of extreme despondency lay on ground with face buried in arm at time strolled listlessly about must see that conduct have lulled to rest suspicion of captor that might attempt escape sentry no longer kept in immediate vicinity although retained gun in hand did so a mere form others went about business several of absenting for hour together at one time three men including guard remained at encampment boy kept faculty on alert be ready to seize first opportunity however slight might offer agreed that however much guard might be reduced must be unsafe to make attempt in daytime a be wholly ignorant of way down to sea shout of pursuer must be sure to attract attention of of party who might have gone in direction a to two day assigned for payment did not anticipate that crisis must arrive at end of time a felt sure that falcon must have sailed before messenger must have arrived in case fresh negotiation must probably be set on foot so proved on evening of day after departure messenger returned news that brought be greeted with outburst of ejaculation of anger disappointment on part of brigand crowded round boy shook fist at cuffed kicked when have somewhat recovered equanimity made sign that ship have departed by using word governor made boy understand that fresh letter must be written to officer be done at once of party started immediately with late on into night boy talked in low voice a to best plan of attempting escape although free in daytime be tightly bound at night guard who be changed two hour never for moment relaxed vigilance finally concluded that only chance be to endeavor to slip away on following evening just a became dusk when party generally reassembled be busy cooking food relating what have happened during day immediately in front of encampment slope be extremely steep brigand in going coming always turned to right left kept along brow for distance to point where a boy supposed slope became more gradual path existed by must make way down to shore at one time boy thought of rolling down steep slope taking chance agreed must be last resource a be probable that slope ended in absolute precipice have idea jack said suddenly in middle of day what be jack see that heap of rug in wrap when go to sleep now vote that when get dusk stand for time at edge looking down into sea then when see guard chatting with one of men who have just arrived others busy round fire will quietly move back towards if guard notice at wo pay special attention a be going that way will steal up to rear of blanket within few foot of where be standing will crawl quietly under when be missed be sure to suppose that have made down slope along brow will at once set off in pursuit betting be will go if only one two be left may take by surprise at rate seems best chance hawtry agreed be decided that must attempt to put plan into execution that evening late in afternoon brigand a usual came dropping in in two three one brought in kid two others exhibited to admiring friend purse containing ten twelve dollar in silver related amid uproarious laughter of comrade manner in have threatened worthy farmer late possessor into surrendering proceeds of day marketing without resistance be already dusk jack hawtry have minute before be standing near edge of slope guard be chatting with last comer keeping one ear open to narrative told by fire suddenly glanced round perceived that figure have a believed scarcely taken eye off be missing madre de dios exclaimed where be prisoner at exclamation round fire started into activity hasty glance round encampment showed that captive be not within circle with exclamation of fury captain seized gun with butt end struck sentry to ground then in furious tone ordered man off in instant pursuit snatching up arm hurried off one way shouting threat of vengeance a went a voice receded there be slight movement among rug boy head peered out from below hiding place encampment be deserted save on ground lay form of prostrate sentinel while captain stood gun in hand on edge of slope peering down into gathering darkness boy rose stealthily to foot keeping along by side of hill so a to be out of direct line of sight must brigand turn towards fire noiselessly approached did not look round until be within five pace be then too late turned threw up gun before must level threw upon taken wholly by surprise staggered backwards be pace from edge of steep declivity in moment fell backward gun exploding in air a went boy heard body a rolled crashed through slight brushwood on slope fainter fainter became sound then suddenly ceased a long a continued boy stood motionless be turning to go when there be crack of rifle ball whizzed between leaping round saw guard whom have supposed to be insensible have risen to foot throwing down rifle have just discharged drawing long knife rushed at dodge hawtry dodge get hold of rifle will get stick from fire boy separated one going way spaniard still bewildered by stunning blow have received hesitated moment then rushed at jack who darted round fire hawtry seized rifle with butt end attacked spaniard who turned to defend jack snatched up heavy brand from fire coming behind spaniard who be waiting knife in hand for opportunity to rush in between sweeping blow hawtry be dealing at with butt end of rifle smote with force across side of head with scream of agony spaniard fell prostrate jack snatching up knife while hawtry still retained rifle darted off at full speed along brow presently heard footstep of men hastily returning drawing aside threw down among low bush men be talking eagerly have heard two report of gun have doubt that captain have discovered fugitive when spaniard have passed boy rose to foot continued flight at top of speed men have come from below boy soon discovered trace of path descending slope at once took proceeding with caution now for descent be extremely steep one path little more than goat track fortunately moon be shining brightly by light be enabled to follow winding after hour descent found in rough road along face of hill doubted not be road from one of coast village into interior now went more cautiously for road be extremely rough with large stone lying here there upon heavy fall sprained ankle must be disastrous have fear of pursuit once twice fancied that heard shout far above considered likely that band must be too far paralyzed by loss of captain to again take up pursuit three hour later stood by sea shore near tiny fishing village composed of three four house only held consultation a to whether must be better to rouse villager explain circumstance have become suspicious of spaniard thought likely that there must be close relationship between people here band in neighborhood light be visible in village be probable that inhabitant be already in bed sat down for hour to avoid chance of being surprised by straggler then proceeding to shore launched small boat hawtry stepped mast hoisted sail be soon making way off land wind be light progress slow for time kept straight out to sea then turned boat head towards gibraltar wind presently died quite away lowering sail got out oar set to work beyond

enormous number of pack animal bullock cart be at work even at early period of campaign immense superiority of french arrangement over english be manifest be natural a french like other european nation have be in habit in time of peace of regarding army a machine might be required for war have therefore kept commissariat transport other arrangement in state of efficiency in england upon other hand army have be entirely neglected have be made subject of miserable petty economy in branch consequence be that war found wholly unprepared except that possessed army of seasoned soldier such a in

crashing blow on head sent staggering back against wall jack one on arm rendered useless will never do english officer shouted let make rush at scoundrel fight way to door be only chance wait moment jack said thought striking stooping down behind others pulled out matchbox from pocket struck light applied to muslin curtain hung before window in moment broad sheet of flame leaped up greek uttered shout of terror surprise now jack shouted together in moment five dashed down table flung upon greek taken by surprise paralyzed by great sheet of flame be already licking wooden ceiling recoiled be

time large number of troop together with sailor from fleet have arrived work be fortunately done have not be for early appearance of french battalion energetic measure adopted great portion of greek quarter must have be destroyed among who have landed be strong party of seaman from falcon under mr hethcote boy joined returned with on board ship reported to lieutenant share have have in affair be unpleasant business said blame for going to assistance of attacked when heard englishman call for help still mr archer be clear that have pretty nearly burnt down town of gallipoli know light in admiral sir george brown may view affair a say that one took notice of at time that name of military officer be taken be possible that inquiry will be made about will of course report matter to captain stuart must act a think fit in meantime must advise to say nothing of share have have in matter to one must have gash have got plastered up will speak to surgeon do know name of english officer concerned yes sir be lieutenant tewson of grenadier guard only exchanged few word before went away begged to go see must advise to keep away from altogether until matter have blown over mr hethcote said did give name sir have time better mr hethcote said will of course come out in course of inquiry two midshipman be concerned be just a well that can not give name expect ship to be ordered up to constantinople in day two hope may be off before inquiry be made one can never say how big wig may take thing sir george brown be tremendous martinet may consider that must have be far better that five officer who chose to go to gambling house must be killed than gallipoli full a be of valuable store munition of war must run risk of being destroyed by fire there now go off to surgeon get face strapped up then ask to come to at once if two young gentleman go on a have begun be not likely to live to obtain eminence in profession be two month since left england have not yet seen enemy yet have have two a narrow escape for life a one must wish to have very severe be cross questioning lad have to undergo in midshipman berth a to manner in came by cut face be obliged to take refuge under strict order of first lieutenant that be to say nothing about fortunately next day falcon received order to proceed to bosphorus got up anchor steamed up dardanelles before dark presently mr hethcote came up to jack who be on duty on quarter deck tell what jack said quietly be very lucky for that be away french officer died during night hear that lung be pierced sir george brown be said to be furious threatens to try tewson by court martial for entering gambling house in spite of strict order to contrary of course be well known that score of other officer have done same be only when thing be found out that there be row about tewson have be dining on board french ship be going home with two french officer who be also there none of have be in gambling house before seems have heard of place be one of most notorious den in town agreed to look in for few minute to see what be like began to play have extraordinary run of luck winning something like four hundred pound bank be broken greek wanted to stop till more money be procured must not do greek then attacked tewson have strong interest affair will probably in case blow over greek have made complaint against for wilfully setting fire to house be most serious part of affair be told that tewson french officer deny having done so say that be done in order to effect diversion by two officer who came in to assistance in middle of fight declare that know who be anything about a only saw for minute in middle of confusion one have said that two young naval officer be seen just at beginning of fire doubt inquiry will be set on foot now that be fairly off will find out nothing at gallipoli be likely that will all blow over authority have plenty to think about at present without troubling very much in following up clue of kind in world there be more lovely scene than greeted jack archer eye a went on deck following morning falcon be anchored about mid channel on left be constantinople with embattled wall palace green foliage down to water edge dome minaret rising thickly separated from by golden horn crossed by bridge of boat be pera galatta street rising above street straight over bow of ship be bosphorus with wooded bank dotted with villa palace to right be scutari with great barrack standing on edge of cliff fifty foot in height little did who looked at great square pile of building dream ere many month must be crowded from top to bottom with british sick wounded that even ample corridor must prove wholly insufficient to contain water be thronged with shipping of nation men of war merchant steamer crowded with store troop ship thronged with red coat great barge laden to water edge slowly made way between ship shore boat of shipping filled with soldier rowed in same direction men of war boat with regular steady swing went hither while among crossed re crossed from constantinople to scutari light caicques with one two white shirted rower boat in world be more elegant in appearance none except built specially for racing can vie with in speed passenger sits comfortably on cushion in bottom of boat smoke long pipe boatman a matter of course fill hand to a take seat while boatman generally albanian singularly handsome athletic men lay down to work with vigor heartiness must astound boatman of english watering place scene so varied so beautiful so busy must not be equalled elsewhere chapter v brush with enemy two day later jack obtained leave to go on shore hesitated for moment whether to choose right left bank plateau of scutari be covered with tent of british army be daily being added to a scarce hour passed without transport coming in laden with troop after little hesitation however jack determined to land at constantinople camp at scutari must differ little from at gallipoli while in turkish capital be innumerable wonder to be investigated hailing caicque be passing took seat with young coveney who have also got leave ashore accepted with dignity offer of long pipe however by mean answered expectation mouthpiece being formed of large piece of amber of bulbous shape too large to be put into mouth be consequently necessary to suck smoke through end practice very difficult at first to accustomed to hold pipe between teeth in ten minute boat landed at pera close to bridge of boat across golden horn for time lad made motion to advance so astonished be at crowd surged across bridge turkish english french soldier turk in turban fez turkish woman wrapped up to eye in white blue clothes hamals porter staggered past under weight seemed to boy stupendous pacha other dignitary riding on gayly trapped little horse carriage with three four veiled figure inside black guard standing on step carried lady of one harem to visit of lad observed that for most part dame instead of completely hiding face with thick wrapping a did sister in street covered merely with fold of thin muslin permitting feature to be plainly seen lady evidently took lively interest in what be going on in way took amiss when english french officer stared unceremoniously at pretty face although black guard gesticulated angrily on occasion be clearly far more indignant concerning admiration mistress excited than be lady at last boy moved forward across bridge jack presently found next to two young english officer proceeding in same direction one of turned sharply round a jack addressed companion hallo jack hallo harry what here have idea have got commission yet how be old fellow how be at home one be right jack thought must have known about be gazetted three day after started be ordered to join at once wrote to tell have never have letter since left home jack said suppose be knocking about somewhere one be complaining about post well be jolly see be in d too regiment wanted to get into when did arrive came in two day ago in 'himalaya be encamped with rest of light division who have come up sir george brown command will be here from gallipoli in day two with rest of division boy now introduced respective friend to other four wandered together through constantinople visited bazaar fixed upon lot of pretty thing a present to be bought taken home at end of war then crossed bridge again to pera have dinner at missouri principal hotel there great rendezvous of officer of british army navy then took boat rowed across to scutari where harry did honor of camp at sundown jack messmate returned on board falcon next three week passed pleasantly jack spending time when must get leave with brother latter often coming off for hour two to falcon early in may news arrived that russian have advanced through dobrudscha have commenced siege of silistria few hour later falcon several other ship of war be on way up dardanelles convoying numerous store ship bound to varna shortly afterwards general of allied army determined that varna must be base for campaign against russian accordingly towards end of may troop be again embarked varna be seaport surrounded by undulating country of park like appearance troop be upon arrival delighted with new quarter here english french be encamped together with turk few day after arrival jack obtained leave for day on shore rowed out to alladyn nine mile half from varna where light division consisting of th th d d th th regiment be encamped close by be fresh water lake undulated ground be finely wooded with clump of forest timber covered with short crisp grass more charming site for camp must be conceived game abounded officer who have brought gun with found for time capital sport everyone be in highest spirit hope that campaign must soon open in earnest be general in however be destined to be disappointed for on th of june news came that turk have unaided beaten off russian with such heavy loss in attack upon silistria that latter have broken up siege be retreating northward weary delay then occurred while english french home authority english french general in field be settling point at attack must be made upon russia delay be disastrous one for allowed enemy more dangerous than russian to make insidious approach heat be very great water bad indeed almost undrinkable climate be notoriously unhealthy one fruit of kind together with cucumber melon extremely cheap soldier consequently consumed very large quantity of through june up to middle of july however very evil consequence be apparent on st of july two division of french troop under general canrobert marched into dobrudscha in search of body of russian who be said to be there on night of th cholera broke out before morning in one division le than men lay dead other division although situated at considerable distance be simultaneously attacked with equal violence three day later expedition returned having lost over men scarcely le sudden le fatal be attack among english line for time english camp be ravaged by cholera jack be extremely anxious about brother for light division suffered even more severely than did others be not able to go to see a to state of thing for naval officer be not allowed to go on shore more than be absolutely necessary a camp of light division have be moved ten mile farther away on to slope of balkan must have be impossible to go return in one day such precaution a be taken however be insufficient to keep cholera from on board ship in short time fleet be attacked with severity almost equal to on shore although fleet put out to sea flagship in two day lost seventy men fortunately falcon have left varna before outbreak extended to ship crimea have now be definitely determined upon a point of assault turkish vessel with heavy siege gun be on way to varna falcon be ordered to cross to crimea report upon advantage of several place for landing of allied army mission be exciting one a beside chance of brush with shore battery there be possibility that might run against of russian men of war who still held that part of black sea whose headquarters be at great fortress be main object of expedition to crimea falcon started at night in morning of second day hill of crimea be visible in distance fire be then banked up lay to with steamed on until within mile two of coast here again anchored with early dawn steam be turned on falcon steamed along a close to shore a dare go lead being constantly kept going a little be known of depth of water on shore presently came to bay with smooth beach ground rose gradually behind small village stood close to shore look good place captain stuart said to first lieutenant will anchor here lower boat mr hethcote with three boat have better land at village get information that can see that there be troop about if attacked by small force will of course repel if by strong one fall back to boat will cover retreat with gun of ship other two boat will be employed in sounding let master have charge of make out a far a can perfect chart of bay in few minute boat be lowered men in highest glee took place jack be in gig with first lieutenant order be given boat started together towards shore have not gone fifty yard before there be roar of cannon succeeded by whistle of shot two masked battery one upon side of bay mounting six gun have opened upon cutter commanded by second lieutenant be smashed by round shot instantly sunk ball struck close to stroke oar of gig deluging occupant with water ricochetting over gunwale of boat between stroke oar mr hethcote two shot hulled falcon others whistled through rigging pick up crew of cutter mr hethcote return on board at once captain stuart shouted engine of falcon at once began to move captain interposed ship between nearest battery boat few second later heavy gun have previously be got ready for action opened upon fort in two minute boat be alongside with hand save one of cutter crew who have be cut in two by round shot men leaving boat towing alongside rushed to gun heavy fire of falcon speedily silenced opponent then a object be to reconnoitre not to fight captain stuart steamed out to sea be determined however to obtain further information respecting bay appeared to one adapted for purpose of landing will keep off till mr hethcote will then run in a close a dare showing light will then ask to take boat with muffled oar to row to village make way among house a quietly a possible seize couple of fisherman bring off with interpreter will be able to find out from at rate general detail a to depth of water nature of anchorage who will take with sir regular gig crew mr simmonds have passed may give chance of promotion think by way may a well take launch also carry gun let men from land keep lying few yard off shore to cover retreat if necessary mr pascoe will command there be deep quiet excitement among men when at vessel head be again turned towards shore crew of gig launch told to hold in readiness cutlass be sharpened pistol cleaned not le be excitement in midshipman berth where be known that simmonds be to go in gig one knew who be to accompany launch however jack turned out to be lucky one mr pascoe being probably glad to please first lieutenant by selecting relation although officer must not have shown favoritism on behalf be about eleven o'clock when falcon approached former position rather to point mile seaward of a nearly a master must bring for night be extremely dark land scarcely visible not light be shown not voice raised on board only sound heard be gentle splash of paddle a revolved at slowest rate of speed fall have be greased rowlock muffled crew took place in perfect silence understand mr hethcote be captain stuart last word that be not to attempt landing if there be slightest opposition very quietly boat left falcon side rowed abreast close to other in order that first lieutenant must give order to mr pascoe in low tone men be ordered to row quietly to avoid splashing throwing up of water be longer row than have expected be evident that master deceived by uncertain light have brought vessel up at point considerably farther from shore than have intended a got well in bay must see light in village ahead occasional gleam near point at side showed that men in battery be awake active a boat neared shore men rowed according to first lieutenant order more more gently at last when line of beach ahead became distinctly visible order be given to lie upon oar listened intently then mr hethcote put on helm so that boat have still way on drifted even closer to launch do hear anything mr pascoe know sir seem to make out distinct sound there certainly appears to be sort of murmur in air so think too again listened know sir jack whispered in mr pascoe ear fancy at time see faint light right along behind tree be very faint sometimes outline seems clearer than at others mr pascoe repeated in low voice to mr hethcote what jack have remarked fancied so once twice said there added suddenly be neigh of horse however there may be horse anywhere now will paddle slowly on lay within boat length of shore mr pascoe keep gun trained on village let men hold arm in readiness in minute gig bow grated on beach quietly lad first lieutenant said step into water without splashing then follow a quickly a can beach be sandy one footstep of sailor be almost noiseless a stole towards village place seemed hushed in quiet just a entered little street figure standing in shade of house rather larger than rest stepped forward challenged bringing a did so musket to present instant later fired just a word russian sentry broke from first lieutenant lip almost simultaneously three four other shot be fired at point along beach rocket whizzed high in air from side of bay bugle sounded alarm voice of command be heard a if by enchantment chaos of sound followed deep silence have before reigned from house armed men poured out steady lad steady mr hethcote shouted fall back steadily keep together fire shot till get to boat then give volley jump on board now retire at double for moment russian a poured from house paused in ignorance of direction of foe shout from sentry indicated scattering fire be opened however be at once checked by shout of officer to dash forward with speed after enemy a mass of russian rushed from village howitzer in bow of launch poured volley of grape into checked advance however from along bush on side fresh assailant poured out jump on board lad jump on board mr hethcote shouted sailor discharging musket at enemy leapt into place give volley mr pascoe get head round row let men waste time in firing volley from launch again momentarily checked enemy just a got round discharge from gun further arrested boat be not however thirty yard from shore before be lined with dark figure who opened tremendous fire of musketry row lad row mr pascoe shouted to men will be out of sight in hundred yard chapter vi alma desperately men bent to oar heavy boat surged through water around swept storm of musket ball although darkness haste rendered fire of russian wild uncertain many of shot took effect with sigh mr pascoe fell against jack who be sitting next to just at moment when jack experienced sensation a if hot iron have passed across arm several of men dropped oar fell back boat still held rapidly on way in two three minute be safe from anything random shot at moment however three field piece opened with grape iron hail tore up water near fortunately be now almost out of sight although fort threw up rocket to light bay joined fire to of field gun boat escaped untouched thank god be out of mr hethcote said a fire ceased boat headed for light hung up to direct then have many hurt mr pascoe be afraid sir mr pascoe be killed badly wounded be lying against give answer when speak to one else hurt mr hethcote asked in moment men exchanged few word among there be five down in bottom of boat sir six seven of have be hit more le be bad business mr hethcote said have two killed three wounded here be hit mr archer have got queer sensation in arm sir seem able to use so suppose be think be much pull away lad mr hethcote said shortly show light there in bow to steamer light be answered by sharp whistle heard beat of paddle of falcon a came down towards five minute later boat be hoisted to davit casualty hope mr hethcote captain stuart said a first lieutenant stepped on board seem to have got into nest of hornet yes indeed sir there be strong garrison in village have suffered fear heavily eight ten killed a many wounded dear dear captain stuart said be unfortunate circumstance indeed mr manders do get wounded on board carried below will step into cabin mr hethcote give full detail of unfortunate affair upon mustering men be found that total casualty in two boat of falcon amounted to lieutenant pascoe killed midshipman archer wounded ten seaman killed nine wounded jack wound be more severe than have at first thought ball have gone through upper part of arm have grazed badly bruised bone in passage doctor said must probably be week before must have arm out of sling falcon spent week in examining crimean coast then ran across again to varna here everything be being pushed forward for start over six hundred vessel be assembled with tonnage vastly exceeding that of fleet have ever sailed sea twenty seven thousand english twenty three thousand french be to be carried in huge flotilla for although french army be considerably larger than english mean of sea transport of latter be vastly superior be able to take across whole of army in single trip whereas french must convey half of force unfortunately between lord raglan english commander in chief marshal saint arnaud french commander there be little concert agreement french whose arrangement be far better whose movement be prompter than own be always complaining of british procrastination while english general went quietly on own way certainly tried sorely patience of ally even when whole of allied army be embarked nothing have be settled beyond fact that be going to invade crimea enormous fleet of men of war transport steamer with sailing vessel in tow extending in line farther than eye must reach covering many square mile of sea sailed eastward without fixed destination consequence be a might be expected lamentable waste of time halt be called council be held reconnaissance sent forward vast fleet steamed aimlessly north south east west until when at last landing place be fixed upon near eupatoria disembarkation be effected fourteen precious day have be wasted over journey be generally performed in twenty four hour even slowly moving transport might have easily accomplished in three day consequence be russian have time to march round large body of troop from other side object of expedition capture of sebastopol by coup de main be altogether thwarted more imposing sight be ever seen than witnessed by band of cossack on low shore of crimea when allied fleet anchored few mile south of eupatoria front extended nine mile in length behind came line after line of transport until very topmast of in rear scarce appeared above horizon place selected for landing place be known a old fort low strip of bush shingle forming causeway between sea stagnant fresh water lake known a lake saki at eight o'clock in morning of th of september french admiral fired gun in little more than hour six thousand of troop be ashore while landing of english did not commence till hour after boat of men of war transport have already be told off for ship carrying light division be to be first to land in wonderfully short time sea between first line of ship shore be covered with multitude of boat crowded with soldier boat of falcon be employed with rest a three week have elapsed since jack have received wound be able to take share of duty although arm be still in sling ship to falcon boat be told off lay next to have carried d a rowed past exchanged shout wave of hand with harry who be standing at top of companion ladder seeing men of company take seat in boat be day of tremendous work man officer carried three day provision tent other unnecessary store be to be landed artillery however have to be got ashore work of landing gun on shingly beach be laborious one indeed horse in vain tugged strained sailor leaped over into water worked breast high at wheel so succeeded in getting ashore jack have asked permission from captain stuart to spend night on shore with brother just a be going off from ship for last time simmonds who have obtained acting commission in place of mr pascoe said archer must advise to take tarpaulin couple of bottle of rum will be useful before morning can tell for be going to have nasty night indeed rain be already coming down steadily wind be rising few of who took part in will ever forget first night in crimea wind blew pitilessly rain poured down in torrent twenty seven thousand englishman lay without shelter in muddy field drenched to skin jack have trouble in finding brother regiment be in advance two three mile from landing place harry be delighted to see sight of tarpaulin bottle did not decrease warmth of welcome jack be already acquainted with most of officer of d hallo archer young ensign said if have be in place must have remained snugly on board ship nice night be in for so long a daylight lasted officer stood in group chatted of prospect of campaign there be nothing to do possibility of seeing to comfort of men place where regiment be encamped be absolutely bare there be mean of procuring shelter how big be that tarpaulin jack about twelve foot square jack said pretty heavy found can tell have better do with asked harry ca lie down under that know with colonel sitting out exposed to rain best thing jack said after minute consideration must be to make sort of tent of if must put up at slant six foot high in front with back to wind must shelter lot of fellow might hang of blanket at side captain lieutenant of harry company be taken into consultation with aid of dozen soldier musket bound together ramrod penthouse shelter be made sod be laid on lower edge to keep down side be closed with two blanket cord from one of baggage cart be used a guy rope to corner very snug shelter be constructed harry invited colonel officer to use although space be limited greater portion of managed to sit down in who must not find room taking up place in front where tent afforded considerable shelter from wind rain one thought of sleeping pipe be lighted jack two bottle of rum afforded tot to night must scarcely be called comfortable one even with aid be luxurious indeed in comparison with passed by exposed to full force of wind next morning jack said good bye to brother officer of regiment to whom presented tarpaulin for future use be folded up smuggled into ammunition cart be not of course jack to give being government property must be able to pay regulation price for on return hour later jack be on beach where high surf be beating day work of landing cavalry artillery went on under greatest difficulty many of boat be staved rendered useless several charger drowned be evident that weather be breaking up ten day of lovely weather have be wasted at sea be more bitterly regretted than ever tent be landed troop remained wet to skin with additional mortification of seeing french ally snugly housed under canvas while even turk have managed to bring tent with natural result be that sickness again attacked troop hundred be prostrated before three

last over that be about to meet enemy troop saluted hare leaped out at foot at footstep a broad array swept along with shout of laughter yell during halt number of frightened creature be knocked over slung behind knapsack to furnish meal at night bivouac smoke of burning village farmhouse ahead announced that enemy be aware of progress presently on eminence across wide plain mass of enemy cavalry be visible five hundred of light cavalry pushed on in front equal number of cossack advanced to meet lord cardigan be about to give order to charge when mass of heavy cavalry made appearance suddenly one of extended battery of russian artillery opened fire upon cavalry artillery came to front after quarter of hour duel russian fell back soon after army halted for night at stream called boulyanak six mile from alma where russian a be now known be prepared to give battle weather have now cleared again rank be in high spirit a sat round bivouac fire how savage will be on board ship harry archer said to captain lancaster to see fighting big battle without having hand in almost wonder that have not landed body of marine blue jacket fleet must spare men help might be useful do think russian will fight soldier will fight captain lancaster said when have got strong position need very different sort of courage to lie down on crest of hill fire at enemy struggling up in full view to be necessary to make assault have too advantage of knowing ground while know absolutely nothing about believe that general have more idea than have seems happy go lucky way of fighting altogether however have doubt that will lick somehow seems though pity to take troop direct at position enemy have chosen fortified when by flank march in undulating country like must be performed without slightest difficulty must turn position force to retreat without losing man such be opinion of many other officer at time such have be opinion of military critic since have army made flank march enemy must either have retired at once have be liable to attack upon right flank when if beaten must have be driven down to sea shore under gun of ship killed captured to man unfortunately however owing to jealousy between two general illness of marshal arnaud incapacity of lord raglan there be plan concert army simply fought a marched general of division doing best leading men at portion of enemy position happened to be opposite to sole understanding arrived at be that army be to march at six in morning that general bosquet division be next to sea be covered by gun of ship to first carry enemy position there that when have obtained footing upon plateau general attack be to be made even plan simple a be be not fully carried out a lord raglan did not move troop till nine in morning three precious hour be therefore wasted pursuit after battle must have turned defeat into rout be therefore prevented sebastopol saved to cost ten of thousand of life before fell russian position on alma be along crest of hill on left by sea rose precipitously offering great difficulty for assault further inland however slope became easy towards right centre right against english attack be directed hill be simply slope broken into natural terrace on be many wall vineyard near sea river ran between low bank inland bank be much steeper south side rising thirty forty foot enabling defender to sweep ground across assailant must advance while on left russian force be not advanced in front of hill formed position on lower ground occupied vineyard inclosure down to river gun be placed in battery on step of slope enabling to search with fire whole hill side a well a flat ground beyond river attack a intended be begun by general bosquet bonat brigade crossed river by bar of sand across mouth where water be only waist deep while d'autemarre brigade crossed by bridge brigade swarmed up precipitous cliff offered great difficulty even to infantry achieved object without encountering resistance whatever gun of fleet having driven back russian regiment appointed to defend post enemy brought up three battery of artillery to regain crest french with tremendous exertion succeeded in getting up battery of gun with aid maintained position have gained when sound of bosquet gun showed that part of programme be carried into effect second third division of french army crossed alma be soon fiercely engaged with enemy canrobert division for time made little way a river be too deep for passage of gun be forced to make detour around white stone tower yard on left dense mass of russian infantry be drawn up opened so tremendous fire upon french that for time advance be checked one of brigade from fourth division be in reserve advanced to support joining with of regiment of canrobert division aided by troop whom general bosquet have sent to aid great rush be made upon dense body of russian who swept by grape of french artillery be unable to stand impetuous attack be forced to retire in confusion french pressed forward at point also of field day be won in mean time british army have be also engaged long before came in sight of point be to attack heard roar of cannon on right knew that bosquet division be engaged a troop marched over crest of rounded slope caught glimpse of distant fight must see mass of russian infantry threatening french gathered on height watch puff of smoke a gun on side sent messenger of death white smoke hung over fleet a vessel of war threw shell far over head of french into russian mass soon heard louder roar proclaimed that main body of french army be in action burning with impatience to begin men strode along to take share in fight until within few hundred yard of river troop must see nothing of village on bank for ground dipped sharply before reached brow twelve russian gun placed on rising ground yard beyond river opened upon people may say what like harry archer said to captain cannon ball make horribly unpleasant row must be half a bad if must come silently a spoke round shot struck down two men few file to right be first who fell in d steady lad steady shouted officer a regularly a if on field day english troop advanced rifle under major northcote be ahead dashing through vineyard under rain of fire crossed river scaled bank pushed forward to top of next slope be on plateau beyond that russian main body be posted for time rifle have hard work to maintain in meantime light division be advancing in open order sometimes lying down sometimes advancing until gained vineyard here regular order have so far maintained be lost a ground be broken up by hedge stone wall vine tree th th d d be then led at run right to river by general codrington course being marked by killed wounded crossing sheltered under high bank such be state of confusion in arrived there that momentary pause be necessary to enable men of various regiment to gather together enemy taking advantage of brought down three battalion of infantry who advanced close to bank a four regiment dashed up met with tremendous fire a hotly be answered russian retired while battery again opened fire there be little order in british rank a struggled forward up hill even under tremendous fire men paused to pick grape exertion of officer must not maintain regular line of advance from rising ground russian regiment kept up destructive fire upon gun in battery on flank fired incessantly slaughter be tremendous regiment held on way unflinchingly in few minute th have lost third of men d be down not le be storm of fire around d confused bewildered stunned by dreadful din harry archer struggled on with company voice be hoarse with shouting though must scarce hear word uttered lip be parched with excitement acrid smell of gunpowder man after man have fallen beside be yet untouched there be thought of fear danger now whole soul seemed absorbed in one thought of getting into battery small a be number who still struggled on determined advance began to disquiet russian for first time doubt a to victory entered mind when day began felt assured of general have told that must annihilate foe priest have blessed assured of protection succor of saint british be still coming on must not be denied infantry behind battery began to retire artillery left unprotected limbered up in haste although three time a numerous a men of light division russian still firing heavily retired up hill while with shout of triumph broken group of d th d burst into battery capturing gun russian have be unable to withdraw chapter vii before sebastopol not long be light division to enjoy position have won breathless exhausted bleeding be handful russian looking down upon seeing that be unsupported again advanced in heavy mass light division fell back have division have whole of strength might have be enabled to hold position have won just a crossed river there be unfounded alarm of cavalry attack on flank th th be halted to repel took share in advance by rest of division a shattered regiment fell back before russian in state of disorder saw advancing up slope behind brigade of guard in a regular order a if on parade for moment splendid formation be broken a disordered troop came down upon opening file allowed light division to pas through then closing up again moved forward in splendid order highland brigade keeping pace with on left while regiment of light division reformed in rear followed after steadily under storm of fire guard advanced grape canister round shot shell shot swept through kept forward till nigh crossing bayonet with russian infantry at moment however two british gun mounted on knoll opened upon russian victorious french threatened flank russian gunner limbered up retired infantry suddenly fell back on right of light division general sir de lacy evans have also be fighting sternly second division have advanced side by side with of prince napoleon resistance encountered be obstinate more skilled in actual warfare than brother general covered advance with fire of eighteen gun so bore forward suffering far le than division on left have however very heavy fighting before gained river village have be set on fire by russian smoke flame greatly incommoded men a fought way through th however dashed across bridge under storm of missile while th th waded through river step by step won way up hill then firing ceased battle of alma be won force under russian consisted of men of whom be cavalry have eighty gun besides two light battery of horse artillery inferior in number a be discrepancy be more than outbalanced by advantage of position have troop on side be of equally good material honor of day must have rested with defender british loss consisted of officer killed wounded men killed wounded french have only officer killed wounded men killed wounded turk be not engaged russian lost officer killed wounded men killed wounded allied army have gun against of russian former owing to nature of ground played small part in fight whole of loss fell upon comparatively small number of english regiment a french have men in reserve who have not fired shot there be season why greater portion of army with cavalry must not at once have followed on track of beaten russian have done so war in crimea must have be over in three day time however elapsed before move be made reason assigned be necessity of caring for wounded burying dead might have be committed to hand of sailor marine of whom might have be landed at night in case whole allied army must have marched at day break be sad sight when four regiment of light division mustered after work be done hitherto in confusion fierce excitement of fight men marked not who stood who fell now a diminished regiment paraded mere skeleton of fine corp have marched gayly from camping ground of night before terrible extent of loss be manifest tear rolled down cheek of strong men who have never flinched in storm of fire a saw how many of comrade be absent glory of victory be dimmed indeed by sorrow for dead wanted to see battle harry archer said to captain lancaster who like have gone through fight without scratch be more than bargained for to think of one friend comrade gone in about two hour fighting have be deadly affair indeed yes a far a be concerned archer not for whole army heard doctor alexander say just now that casualty be about that out of men be mere nothing to proportion in many battle french have hear lost rather le thought in battle harry said one must see something of general affair certainly did not in fact from time when dashed up river bank till capture of battery saw nothing knew there be of men by side of that be pushing forward beyond knew absolutely nothing be something like going through tremendous thunder shower with one head down only thousand time more so after parade men scattered in group went down to river to fill canteen others strolled through vineyard picking grape in spite of fact that in many place dead lay thickly together careless laugh be sometimes heard regiment have not be engaged be at work bringing in wounded doctor alexander assistant be busy at ghastly task of amputating limb extracting ball next day few officer from fleet came up among be hawtry who be charged with special mission from jack who must not again ask for leave to inquire after brother wounded be sent down in arabas litter to ship painful journey of three mile french wounded fared better a have well appointed hospital van seven hundred fifty russian wounded be collected laid together be given in charge of inhabitant of tartar village near dr thomson of th regiment with servant volunteering to remain in charge of with certain risk of capture when russian troop returned after departure on morning of d army started continuing march along road to sebastopol way being marked not only by debris thrown away by retreating russian by cottage pretty villa having be sacked by cossack a retired troop halted for night at katcha where french be reinforced by men who be landed from transport just arrived english by scot grey th a be found that enemy have battery along northwest of harbor of sebastopol must cause delay trouble to invest while army engaged in operation must have to draw provision store from harbor at mouth of katcha river be determined to march round sebastopol to invest on southern side where russian not expecting must have made slight preparation for resistance towards sea face sebastopol be of immense strength mounting seventeen gun at telegraph battery at fort constantine eighty at fort saint michael forty at battery fifty others in smaller battery be on north side of harbor on southern side be quarantine fort with fifty one gun fort alexander with sixty four arsenal battery with fifty fort saint nicholas with fort paul with eighty in addition to tremendous defence boom have be fixed across mouth of harbor three decker three two decker two frigate sunk in line forming formidable barrier against entry of hostile ship besides whole of russian black sea fleet be in harbor prepared to take part in defence against attack by sea upon other hand sebastopol be naturally weak on land side lay in hollow gun from upper ground must everywhere search at time when allied army arrived before only defence be old loop holed battery of fourteen gun six mortar one two battery be a yet scarcely commenced march from katcha to south side be performed without interruption on th six day after battle of allied army reached new position according to arrangement british occupied harbor of balaklava while french took possession of kamiesch kaznatch a base for supply of army at mouth of balaklava harbor be ruin of genoese fort standing foot above sea be supposed to be unoccupied a staff however be entering town be astonished by four shell falling close to agamemnon be lying outside at once opened fire fort immediately hung out flag of truce garrison consisted only of commandant sixty men officer on being asked why must have opened fire when knew that place must not be held replied that did so a have not be summoned to surrender felt bound in honor to fire until did so british ship at once entered harbor disembarkation of store siege train commenced harbor of balaklava be ill suited for requirement of large army be half mile in length few hundred yard broad looked like little inland lake for rock rose precipitously at mouth passage through made bend so that outlet be not visible from ship once fairly inside coast be steep bold rocky cliff rising sheer up from water edge to height varying from to foot vessel coasting along must not notice narrow passage dream on entering that harbor lay hidden behind on side of harbor inside hill rose steeply on left hand so steeply that side be useless for purpose of shipping on right hand there be breadth of flat ground between water hill here upon lower slope stood village of balaklava valley extended for distance beyond head of harbor most of ground being occupied with vineyard beyond be wide rolling plain upon battle of balaklava inkerman be to be fought taken completely by surprise inhabitant of balaklava have made attempt to escape upon arrival of british general deputation received with present of fruit flower by time fleet have come round sailor be soon hard at work assisting to unload transport get store siege material on shore be reported that marine battery be to be formed there be eager excitement on board a to officer who must be selected of men of war contributed quota lieutenant hethcote found that have be told off a second in command that be to take midshipman twenty men of falcon matter a to midshipman be settled by captain stuart may a well take archer said wo like to ask for because be cousin asked for berth know mind doing little bit of favoritism once so to jack intense delight found that be to form portion of landing party be in in number work be in first place to assist to get heavy siege gun from wharf to front be necessary that position occupied by ally must be perfectly comprehended in order to understand battle operation subsequently took place may be described a triangle with one bulging side apex of triangle be height on seashore known a marine height here at point foot above sea where ravine broke line of cliff be camp of marine in position almost impregnable against enemy force following seashore on land slope of hill down towards balaklava lay highland brigade guarding approach from plain from marine height to mouth of balaklava valley at mouth of be camp of cavalry not far off sailor camp with heavy gun men side of triangle continued along over undulating ground three mile farther reached right flank of position of ally above sebastopol formed base of imaginary triangle position be plateau of one side sloped down to sebastopol end broke steeply off down into valley of inkerman while behind slope be more gradual to left fell away gradually towards sea formed third side of triangle between balaklava sebastopol land made wide bulge outwards in bulge lay french harbor of kamiesch from marine height to crest looking down upon sebastopol be distance of seven mile from right of position above inkerman valley to kamiesch be about five mile glance at map will enable explanation to be understood at commencement of siege british be posted on right of ally doubt be post of honor threw upon enormous increase of work in addition to defending balaklava be upon that brunt of assault by russian army acting in field must fall must have equal share of trench work have five mile to bring up siege gun store whereas french harbor be close to camp be tremendous work getting up gun soldier sailor willingly toiled away pushing hauling aiding team principally composed of bullock have be brought up from constantinople other turkish port long line of arabas laden with provision store crawled slowly along between balaklava front string of mule horse laden with tent driven by men of nationality bordering mediterranean followed same line party of soldier in fatigue suit went down to sebastopol to assist unloading ship bringing up store party of officer on pony brought from varna other port on black sea cantered down to make purchase of little luxury on board ship in harbor from levantine who have set up little shop near be life gayety be very well mr archer growled dick simpson old boatswain a men paused after helping to drag heavy gun up one of slope in here weather wo be laughing matter when winter come on why here field must be just sheet of mud why bless last winter be staying with brother of mine what farm bit of land down in norfolk after week rain must put horse on to field here sile look just similar only richer deeper how mean to get big cart laden up through beat altogether yes dick jack archer answered expect to take place before winter come on expects old tar repeated scornfully for part think nothing of soldier chap why be up here with first party a come day after got here there war nothing in world to prevent walking into here have got men enough sir to have pushed rotten old wall down with hand here be digging shovelling on hillside nigh mile from place russian be digging shovelling just a hard at side see last night after got back to camp seems to a if here general wanted to give time to make place so strong a can not take before begin why stand to reason that rooshians who have got gun stored close at hand soldier sailor handy trouble a to provision store can run up work arm just about three time a fast a can where will be at end of three month will be just shivering shaking starving with cold short of grub on 'ere hill rooshians will be comfortable in town laughing at tell mr archer opinion be 'ere soldier be better than fool seem to have common sense hope be not a bad a that dick jack laughed certainly doe seem a if be purposely giving russian time to strengthen will see when go at will make short work of well hope so mr archer dick simpson said shaking head ominously be dubious about by time ox men have recovered breath again set to at tiresome work although weather be fine position of camp high healthy cholera have ravaged rank at varna still followed during three first week in crimea ally lost a many men from cause a have done in battle of alma by th of october forty piece of heavy artillery have be brought up to front work of trench began in earnest on morning of th russian battery for first time opened heavy fire upon distance be too great for much harm to be done on th russian made first sortie be easily repulsed on th of october bombardment commenced french english have gun in position russian fire commenced at half past six by french magazine at extreme right blew up killing wounding men while french fire at part be crushed by of russian opposed to day however cannonade continued unabating on side men of war aiding land force by engaging fort during night russian having plenty of gun at hand labor in abundance mounted larger number of gun superiority be so marked that bombardment be gradually discontinued even most sanguine began to acknowledge that enormous mistake have be made in not attacking upon arrival that be impossible to say how long siege must last ammunition too be already running short for next day two however gun continued fire french have be so completely overpowered by heavy russian metal that be unable to assist sailor have have full share of work during bombardment captain peel who commanded party be just man to get greatest possible amount of work from always in high spirit taking full share in work exposing recklessly in heaviest fire be almost idolized by men jack archer lived in tent with five other midshipman be attended upon by one of fore top men who not having be told off for party have begged permission to go in capacity tom hammond be most willing of servant ability be by mean equal to good will idea of cooking be of vaguest kind salt junk be scarcely warm through be boiled into soup preserved potato be sometimes burned from neglect of putting sufficient water have forgotten to soak beforehand resembled bit of gravel rather than vegetable sometimes boy laughed sometimes stormed tom be more than once obliged to beat rapid retreat to escape volley of boot other missile at first tent be pitched in usual way on ground one of boy in ramble through camp have seen officer tent prepared in way added greatly to comfort at once adopted tom hammond be set to dig hole of eighteen inch smaller diameter than circle of tent be three foot in depth with perpendicular side at nine inch from edge trench foot deep be dug in centre be old flour barrel filled with earth upon stood tent pole tent be brought down so a to extend six inch into ditch nine inch rim of earth standing inside serving a shelf on to put odds end wall of sod two foot high be erected round outside of little ditch thus comfortable habitation be formed additional three foot of height added greatly to size of tent a occupant must now stand near edge instead of in centre only be much warmer than before at night draught be excluded by tent overlapping ditch by wall outside short ladder at entrance enabled to get in out tom hammond have grumbled at first at labor freak of master entailed a work went on saw how snug comfortable be result took pride in time be not far off when utility be to become manifest indeed later on in winter greater portion of tent be got up in manner camp of light division be not far from of sailor two brother be often together fortunately of have so far escaped illness have already decimated army chapter viii balaklava on morning of th harry ran into jack tent wake up jack there be row down near balaklava russian be coming on in force be off duty be not so be only

edge of plateau be stirring one great body of infantry be marching across undulating plain strong regiment of cavalry swept hither thither two battery of light gun have already opened on redoubt line of british infantry must be seen drawn up at foot of slope from balaklava to marine height where marine be getting gun in position to command plain solid body of british cavalry be drawn up near mouth of valley drum bugle be sounding over plateau behind group troop be already forming up staff officer be dashing about with order there go regimental call harry said must go back again jack will push on jack said come along fellow be too far off to see much of here let get down a near balaklava a can so saying midshipman set off at run for few minute gun of redoubt farthest out of replied to russian fire then turk menaced by overwhelming force beyond possibility of assistance left gun bolted across plain towards second redoubt few of however reached for russian cavalry swooped down on nearly be sabred a ran a soon a russian obtained possession of redoubt turned gun upon british d highlander who be drawn up in front of entrance to balaklava valley be forced to fall back cavalry be formed up in slight dip of ground be invisible to enemy a russian advanced turk in second redoubt fled towards third russian cavalry be too quick for few escaped gun be turned by russian upon third redoubt untaught by fate of comrade that be safer to stand than to run turk here also bolted ran for town again did russian cavalry sweep down naval gun from marine height french turkish battery on road up to camp in vain spoke out sent shot shell far out on plain distance be too great many of turk be cut down rest reaching line where formed up behind d by time whole sweep from sebastopol plateau to balaklava be alive with spectator british infantry be drawn up ready to defend position to march down take part in general battle heavy column of french be marching from distant camp while group of general mounted officer watched progress of fight lord raglan general canrobert who now commanded french marshal st arnaud having gone on board ship day two after battle of alma where died two day later have taken up position on rising ground above kadikoi village lay near mouth of balaklava valley a russian cavalry on left of advance crowned slope saw highlander drawn up in line across plain halted till joined by number of other squadron then dashed at highlander a came sweeping in magnificent array turk fired volley bolted highlander stood firm immovable when russian came within yard long flash of fire ran along british front distance however be too great russian came steadily on although shot from british battery be plunging thick among when within yard of highlander flash of fire swept out along line time so great be effect that russian squadron recoiled in minute be galloping back towards main body while cheer ran along height from marine battery to sebastopol lord raglan now sent order to lord lucan to advance heavy brigade moved forward just a large body of russian cavalry came over brow in front of british trumpet rang out charge scot grey inniskillings who formed first line of heavy brigade dashed at enemy gathering speed a went two splendid regiment rode at heavy mass of russian cavalry faster faster grew speed till with mighty shout flung upon foe for moment seemed wild confusion to spectator redcoat black be inextricably mixed together over like play of rapid lightning be flash of steel a sword rose fell presently redcoat be seen emerging from rear having cut way through surging mass flank of russian column however be lapping in seemed that little body must be annihilated when th th dragoon guard forming second line of heavy brigade burst upon like torrent smitten a if by thunderbolt russian cavalry men horse rolled over before stroke column shattered broken into fragment galloped away to shelter of infantry while roar of triumph arose from long line of ally by time french infantry have arrived upon ground balaklava be safe then came episode by battle of balaklava be best known famous charge of six hundred order be sent from lord raglan to lord lucan to advance light cavalry farther captain nolan who bore order be light cavalry officer of great enterprise distinction who have unlimited faith in power of british light cavalry excited probably by sight of glorious feat achieved by heavy burning to see emulated by comrade of light regiment so gave order to lord lucan that latter conceived to be duty to charge order be simply to advance when lord lucan asked how far be to advance replied pointing to russian there be enemy there be gun lord lucan conceiving that order be absolute ordered lord cardigan to advance upon gun lord cardigan saw at once desperate nature of enterprise gun be mile half distant backed by whole russian army line to be ridden over be swept not only by fire of gun be about to charge by of other battery on flank support be possible for heavy cavalry be at time far away executing movement have be ordered lastly even if successful charge must be attended with great result a must be impossible to hold carry away gun enterprise be indeed desperate one lord cardigan gave order light brigade numbering in strength of single regiment set out at trot towards distant russian a approached quickened speed spectator saw with feeling of mixed horror admiration enterprise on have embarked when at distance of yard from russian thirty piece of artillery opened fire upon men horse rolled over before iron shower squadron closed up gap rode straight forward with sabre flashing in sun leaving plain behind dotted with killed wounded again a neared battery iron shower swept through rank then with mighty shout dashed upon gun brief be struggle here russian gunner be cut down gathering together boot to boot british cavalry rode straight at russian line of infantry formed up yard behind gun

have witnessed be worth anything october ended battery of besieged besieger continued to play russian causing much annoyance by heavy shell threw up from mortar battery worked by blue jacket suffering particularly russian have now gun in new work number far superior to of ally a yet damage have be inflicted on enemy work day face be pitted with shot night russian repaired damage in mean time

rattle told of volley by british rifle well be that two out of three division be armed with minies for created terrible havoc among russian whose smooth bore be match for newly invented weapon with beating heart boy watched conflict must mark that british fire grew feebler in place ceased altogether while wild yell of russian rose louder a pressed forward exultingly believing that victory lay within grasp thing look very bad jack allison said ammunition be evidently failing be impossible for fellow to hold out much longer against such terrible odds what on earth be french doing time fellow

british wearied exhausted be able to take short breathing time then with pouch refilled spirit heightened joined in fray again a fight went on cheer of british shout of french rose louder while answering yell of russian grew fainter le frequent then thunder of musketry sensibly diminished russian artillery men be seen to be withdrawing gun slowly sullenly infantry fell back from ground have striven so hard to win be heavy defeat have cost men at least have for time saved sebastopol for with diminished force british general saw that hope of carrying place by assault before winter be at end that must need effort to hold line through month of frost snow be before when battle be over captain peel returned to point where have left midshipman followed back to camp where however be not to stay for disposable man be at once ordered out to proceed with stretcher to front to bring in wounded terrible be sight indeed in many place dead lay thickly piled on ground manner in englishman russian frenchman lay mixed together showed how tide of battle have ebbed flowed how patch of ground have be taken retaken again again here russian grenadier lay stretched side by side sometimes with

held dead lay thicker than elsewhere on plateau while down in ravine where cathcart have led men body of d lay heaped together sailor have before starting fill bottle with grog administered to friend foe indiscriminately saving many life ebbing fast with flow of blood lad moved here there searching for wounded among dead awed sobered by fearful spectacle more than one dying message be breathed into ear more than one ring watch given to to send to dear one at home through short winter day worked aided by strong party of french who have not be engaged be satisfaction to know when night fell greater portion of wounded british french have be carried off field a for russian who fell on plateau received equal care with ally far down among bush covered hillside lay hundred of wounded wretch whom succor day at least must be afforded next day work of bringing in russian wounded be continued strong fatigue party be at work digging great pit in dead be laid of nationality being kept separate british camp on night after inkerman afforded strong contrast to scene presented night before merry laugh arose from men crouched round fire song sounded through wall of tent there be none of joy triumph of victory loss have be suffered be so tremendous a to overpower other feeling of regiment absolutely engaged fully one half have fallen men officer chatted in hushed voice over good fellow who have gone of chance of who lay maimed bleeding in hospital tent to great relief jack have heard early in afternoon that d have not be hotly engaged that brother be unwounded two young officer of th who have few hour before be spending evening so merrily in tent have fallen a have many of friend in brigade of guard whose acquaintance have made on board ripon in regiment being encamped near by

too be discussed be agreed that be fixed where be for winter prospect be dreary one for if have have so many discomfort to endure hitherto what must be during next four month on bleak plateau for however be indifferent in respect a be already known party on shore must be shortly relieved chapter x great storm two day after battle of inkerman party of sailor who manned battery before sebastopol be relieved by fresh set from on board men of war of who have be away at front returned on board ship while others among whom be jack archer be ordered to join camp at marine height above balaklava to fill place of men invalided on board ship change be in respect agreeable one in others reverse position be very high exposed to wind on other hand men being able to obtain material at balaklava have constructed warm shelter ravine below be well wooded be consequently enabled to keep up cheerful fire whereas at front supply of fuel barely sufficed to cook food be almost useless for purpose of warmth there be far le privation here for balaklava lay within twenty minute walk store of kind must be bought on board ship there be too entire absence of heavy continuous work in wet trench great drawback to position be indeed absence of excitement change quiet seemed almost preternatural after almost continual boom of cannon at front jack be pleased to find chum hawtry on duty at height be grand view hawtry said a stood at edge of cliff morning after arrival below at foot lay great fleet of transport to left cliff stretched away wild precipitous rising to height far greater than point at stood foot above sea on right hill sloped gradually down to old genoese castle then sharply to harbor in lay several men of war in balaklava line of wooden hut have be erected for hospital felt covered roof contrasted with red tile of tartar house with white wall tower of church along valley at foot of harbor long line of arabas pack animal looking like mere speck from point where lad be standing must be seen making way to front while seven mile distant on plateau above sebastopol rose like countless white dot tent of allied army turning still farther round saw undulating plain across light cavalry have charged upon russian gun while standing boldly against sky be lofty table land extending from above village of inkerman right across line of sight to point known a mackenzie height from farm belonging to englishman situated there on height be encamped large body of russian troop be splendid view dick jack archer said added turning to look at fleet of transport again must like to be on board one of ship if came on to blow must be rocky bottom holding ground be what one be saying jack one can make out why let go inside of course must not unload at once there be room for to shelter if laid in tier a must be in crowded port yes if get storm say in black sea do have terrific gale during winter fear will have terrible business here two day later have taste of what storm in black sea be on afternoon of friday th wind got up blowing straight into bay very rapidly sea rose a dusk came on sailor on marine height gathered on edge of cliff looked anxiously down upon sea already great wave be tumbling in dashing against foot of cliff sending cloud of spray half way up to old castle foot above ship be laboring heavily tugging straining on cable from funnel of steamer volume of black smoke be pouring showing that be getting up steam to keep screw paddle going relieve strain upon anchor must be aboard one of craft old sailor said not for enough money to find in grog 'bacca for rest of life if gale get stronger half ship will be ashore afore morning if do god help on board happily storm did not increase in violence when morning broke be found that although many of vessel have dragged anchor damage have be done by collision none have gone ashore knowledge however of how heavy sea got up in gale of even moderate force how frightfully dangerous be position of vessel must might be thought have served a lesson unhappily did not do so naval officer who be in charge of harbor be obstinate again refused request of master of many of transport that shipping might all be allowed to enter harbor refused upon be responsibility of terrible loss of life ensued on th wind again began to rise sailor a night came on looked over sea be going to have bad night of again officer in command of post said a gazed seaward look a wild night a ever saw look how fast scud be flying overhead last week gale be stiff one unless be mistaken will be nothing to be upon louder louder roared wind till men must scarce keep foot outside shelter tent shook rocked men must hardly hear other voice above storm even in darkness of night sheet of foam must be seen dashing up to very wall of castle jack archer dick hawtry who with two other midshipman occupied tent sat listening awe struck to fury of gale there be gust fiercer than usual accompanied by crack like sound of pistol followed by stifled shout there be tent down hawtry exclaimed must wonder did not finish for at moment pole of own tent broke asunder like pipe in instant four be buried beneath fold of canvas with much shouting laughter struggled to entrance made way out tent be already levelled to ground ten minute later not one remained standing midshipman crowded into turf hut of officer have have erected scarcely have entered when there be boom of heavy gun thought so dick hawtry said there be first of how many more will there be before morning door opened sailor put in head gentleman captain say be to turn out be going to take party down to castle with rope in few minute hundred men mustered moved down hill so fierce be gale during squall be impossible to keep on foot have to lie down till fury of gust have passed be pitch dark groped rather than made way along fast now one after came sound of signal gun there must be dozen of adrift dick shouted into friend ear during one of lull god help what will become of ship must be dashed to piece like eggshell against cliff when reached lowest point of cliff party be halted told to lie down keep in readiness in case service must be required officer struggled forward to edge tried to see what be going on down in bay below little must be seen save mighty sheet of spray a wave struck cliff here there in wild water fancied occasionally that must see dark form of ship even of must not have be certain save for twinkling light rose fell dashed to fro like fire fly in flight now then flash of cannon momentarily showed ship laboring in trough of mountainous sea believe be 'black prince ' jack shouted to friend big steamer have be lying there last week if be be ever so much nearer to shore than be suddenly blue light threw glare on sea came from almost under foot good heaven dick there be vessel on rock already look dozen more close in example be followed several other blue light be burned showing plainly terrible nature of scene vessel be wallowing in tremendous wave many have cut away mast to relieve strain on anchor paddle screw of steamer be working at full speed for line of white foam behind must be plainly seen even availed little for almost ship lay nearer to line of cliff than did when night fell several be close to foot of rock looker on noticed that have lain near shore be missing on deck of ship must be seen number of person holding on to rope bulwark sometimes from deck of vessel rocket soared up wind catching a rose carrying far inland by captain order several blue light party have brought down be burned to show on board that position be perceived beyond nothing must be done presently even above noise of gale tremendous crash be heard fancied that heard wild shout come faintly up can nothing be done jack shouted to friend nothing sir old sailor said close by be doomed there be over thirty ship there morning for counted doubt if one will live out night by time sailor unable to lie inactive have joined officer be scattered in group along cliff be there possible way of getting down near water jack said think so sir if be daylight might make shift to try let try anyhow jack said oh there be a crash be heard above gale anything be better than standing here think cliff go quite sheer down everywhere let try dick must be relief to be doing something right jack let stick together do lad said turning to three four sailor who be standing by keep close to lend hand at point where be standing be clearly impossible to get down for rock sloped straight from foot farther to left however went down more gradually here boy began to try to descend there be sort of hollow here jack shouted sort of ravine be best place cautiously step by step holding on to such bush a grew among rock pausing sometimes flattened against rock by force of gust drenched moment by sheet of spray boy made way down till paused at spot where rock fell away sheer under foot must go farther at moment heard wild scream vessel appeared through darkness below crashed with tremendous thud against rock mast be so close that boy seemed almost able to jump upon a reached nearly to level on be standing instantly going over side peering over must see black mass in midst of surging white water at foot sailor have paused way up ascent appalled by difficulty boy lighter more active have accomplished go up to top again hawtry said climbing back to bring down one of spar brought down block long rope short one to serve a guy get dozen more hand 'd better fix rope at top firmly use to steady a return there be ship ashore just underneath think can get down in few minute sailor descended again carrying with spar twenty foot long with immense difficulty be lowered to spot boy have reached one of sailor have brought down lantern by light block be lashed to end long rope roved through then shorter rope be fastened to end a guy spar lowered out till sloped well over edge lower edge be wedged in between two rock others piled round now dick said will go down will never get down alive sir one of sailor said wind will dash against cliff will try sir if like be heavier let go down with jack said two of be heavier than man will have four leg to keep off cliff besides can help other down below right dick said fasten to rope hardy make two loop so that will hang face to face yet be separate give short rope of two three fathom long so that can rope together one hold on in case other be washed off foot when get down look here hardy do lie down look over edge when hear yell let hoist away now for boy be slung a dick have ordered lower away steadily dick said stop lowering if yell in minute lad be swinging in space ten foot out from face of cliff for first few yard descended steadily then a rope lengthened gust of wind flung violently against face of cliff fend off with leg jack be way by jove be ducking said a mighty rush of spray enveloped a mountainous sea struck rock below think will do there be something black down below think part of still hold together slowly shouted up in one of pause of gale hardy response of aye aye sir came down to be desperate three minute at end of time bruised bleeding half stunned by blow half drowned by sheet of water flew over lad foot touched rock formed sloping shelf of thirty foot wide at foot of cliff wreck have appeared immediately under be forty foot away appeared vague misshapen black mass have be seen for have waved lantern from edge of cliff before starting have several time shouted a descended a neared ground be delighted at hearing by answering shout that labor have not be in vain that one still survived throw rope dick shouted at top of voice in moment heard rope fall close to groping about in darkness found just a wave burst below dashing high over head drove against rock then floated off foot rope from above held however lower away dick yelled a regained foot then aided by rope from ship scrambled along be hauled on to wreck before next great sea came have broken arm dick jack said never mind now how many be there alive there be sixteen men huddled together under remains of bulwark greater portion of ship be gone altogether only forty foot of stern remained high on rocky ledge on have be cast survivor be for most part too exhausted to move who still retained strength vigor at once set to work in pair be fastened in sling hauled up direct from deck of vessel rope being fastened to held by on wreck by mean be guided saved somewhat from being dashed against cliff in ascent when below felt by rope no longer passing between hand that sling have reached top waited for minute to allow in to be taken out then hauling upon rope pulled sling down again for fresh party so slowly painfully whole party be two by two taken up from wreck several time while operation be being performed great crash be heard followed by loud shout scream a vessel after vessel drove ashore to right left of jack friend who consulted together agreed that by possibility must be aided a be only just at point where wreck lay that rock at foot of cliff be high enough to be above exceptionally high wave one adventuring many yard to right left must have be dashed to piece against cliff by first wave midshipman be last to leave ship dick have in vain begged messmate to go up in one of preceding batch a last pair must necessarily be deprived of assistance from lower rope have so materially aided rest jack however refused to hear of when sling came down to for last time put on stood on wreck watching till great wave came when have passed slipped down side of ship by rope hurried over rock till immediately under spar whose position be indicated by lantern held there then in answer to shout rope tightened again swung in air wind blew more fiercely than before indeed be scarce possible must do so be now utterly exhausted during hour half have stood upon remains of wreck have be minute two deluged with water sometimes indeed sea have swept clean over have not be that have lashed with rope must have be swept away great wave have swept away plank beam of wreck when left scarce fragment of deck remained attached to rudder post terrible be buffeting received a ascended time after time be dashed with immense force against face of cliff to jack noise confusion seemed to increase strange singing sounded in ear a sling reached top burst of cheering broke from seaman there consciousness left officer in command of party be at spot many others having made way down when news spread that rescue be being attempted dick too be unable to stand be carried by sailor to top of slope here cup of strong rum water be given to dick while pure spirit poured down throat soon recalled jack to consciousness latter

bay afternoon before half dozen only have weathered hurricane city of london alone have succeeded in steaming out to sea when gale began jason few others have ridden to anchor through night rest of fleet have be destroyed victim to incompetence pig headedness of naval officer in charge of harbor that there be ample room for within be proved by fact that later on far larger number of ship than be present on day of gale lay comfortably within largest ship lost be prince with whom nearly men went down even inside harbor vessel dragged anchor drifted ashore so terrible be gale indeed be declared by old sailor by inhabitant of town to be most violent that ever experienced enormous quantity of store of kind must have be of immense service to troop in winter be lost in gale even in camp on shore

accustomed to unquestioning obedience to order of superior although never before have count preskoff issued such strange unaccountable command to steward thought never occurred to latter of questioning for moment when have left room count turned to midshipman brow relaxed can not tell said under what obligation have placed family little did think that little kindness might show to stranger prisoner here must be returned by service of hundredfold greater value danger hang over may for time be averted by discovery know enemy too well to suppose that be more than postponed delay

truth enemy must take care that never reached be so powerful that few must dare to brave hostility by presenting indeed surrounded a nicholas be by creature whose great object be to prevent from learning true wish of people must be easy to obtain opportunity for laying document before even be attempt made that successfully such doubt must be thrown upon that might well be deceived must be said that evidence of alexis serf devoted to master be valueless a stranger very imperfectly acquainted with language might well have misunderstood conversation count smerskoff must swear that be only repeating statement paul have previously made to that only promised money because paul insisted that a first condition of informing against must receive fund to enable to leave part of country where life must assuredly be unsafe will thankfully take such document from friend for may be useful must not trust too much to now come with continued a steward reappeared have seen how russian noble can be kind to serf will now see how punishes traitor followed by steward two midshipman count proceeded to stable here by light of lantern saw paul standing bound against manger feature be ghastly pale

die alexis restrained for sake from taking life of wretch when heard plotting against will now act a executioner right willingly man replied taking down huge axe hung by wall wretched prisoner who have hitherto maintained absolute silence now burst into agony of cry prayer for mercy curse seeing in unmoved countenance of judge that nothing must avail that alexis be approaching screamed out demand for priest before died be reasonable count said go into house demetri ask papa ivanovitch to come hither for in family of russian noble priest resides a matter of course presently priest arrived with steward papa ivanovitch count said be know devoted to family in father grandfather be priest before can therefore be trusted with secret secret will never go beyond present be here to shrive man about to die then count related incident of discovery of treachery of prisoner priest who shared with serf veneration affection for lord must scarcely overcome repugnance horror of prisoner so far a to approach listen to for five minute present withdrew from stable leaving priest prisoner alone together then door opened priest came out be finished said may god pardon sinner moved away rapidly towards house alexis spoke word to fellow servant lifted heavy log from wood pile in courtyard carried into stable then seized paul in spite of scream struggle laid with head across log alexis

according to law though hundred be killed in fit of hasty passion by slow ill treatment inquiry be ever made still be case of life against life safety happiness that of dear wife daughter be concerned be life of fifty serf at stake must not hesitate although boy felt that matter if brought before english court of justice might not be favorably considered sympathy be so thoroughly with count that did not hesitate to say that thought must not have acted otherwise than have done that life of traitor be most justly forfeited will now have respite for short time count said count smerskoff will of course be perturbed annoyed at non appearance of spy will after time quietly set inquiry on foot will tell demetri to give to be understood that paul have asked for leave of absence for few day to go to distance to visit friend who be ill be always silent unsociable fellow others will not wonder at having started without mentioning intention to of be to say to lady sir jack asked must invent

jack that have entirely forfeited confidence fortunately be now late lad be not called upon long to maintain appearance of gayety ease be very far from feeling when retired to room have long talk

served right nevertheless be long before got to sleep for week scene in stable be constantly before eye scream entreaty of dying man rang in ear next morning sight of pony delighted girl in pleasure

to see at once inform of what have taken place jack said that must be very much obliged if must do so will return afternoon to see patient doctor bertmann said a parted will then bring news from count who will doubt come to see cell to boy be conducted be small one horribly dirty jack shrugged shoulder a looked at be not fit for pig said to after russia be not such pleasant place a thought yesterday when be left alone jack set to work to cheer up companion who be weak inclined to be despondent from loss of blood have suffered at rate old boy jack said in reply to dick assertion of

countess three girl if father have be sent to siberia turned out penniless besides old fellow be long way from being dead yet after be only governor word against ours may be sure that count will move heaven earth to bring matter right be dusk before doctor returned have seen count said lady be greatly distressed at news be plain to see that be prime favorite young lady be very niobe count be most anxious to learn particular must only tell that asserted governor have attacked first drove in at once made doubt that must be allowed to see in however be disappointed indeed have have most fortunate escape officer second in command here be relative of late governor fortunately be absent morning only returned afternoon like late count be of violent passionate temper when heard news swore have be here must have instantly have brought out shot in square indeed be with difficulty that other officer dissuaded from doing so upon return have ordered that court martial will assemble to morrow that will be at once tried executed surely jack said court martial of officer must find guilty count violent temper be notorious be against reason two unarmed men must make attack upon one armed with sword within call of assistance know doctor bertmann that reason alleged for attack be false one a be not asked for parole be of course aware of that doctor said must attend to give evidence case be doubtful one officer of line regiment be for most part poor friendless men promotion be almost entirely by favoritism must need very considerable amount of courage independence to give verdict in teeth of commanding officer in next place for have heard talking over among there be sort of feeling for honor of russian army be almost necessary that must be found guilty since must throw discredit upon whole service be published to world two unarmed young english officer have be attacked with sword by russian officer of rank then thing look rather badly for said jack well ca be helped know count will doubt write to people at home to tell truth of case oh said doctor must not misunderstand only said that new commandant have ordered that must be tried by court martial be very different thing from being done must get out of prison to night speak very confidently jack said laughing how be to be done oh answered doctor there be great difficulty on score may be taken a certain that a rule russian official from highest to lowest be accessible to bribe that prisoner with powerful friend outside need give up hope be military prison soldier at gate be open to imbibe unlimited amount of vodka whoever may send officer in command of will be easily accessible to reason will induce to shut eye to what be going on warder here can of course be bought count be already at work a mean be ample although under cloud at present connection powerful there be little fear that will fail in succeeding by way have news to tell do hear bell tolling news have arrived that nicholas be dead alexander new czar be known to be liberally disposed be there time count must go to st petersburg obtain audience with explain whole circumstance by way have related to of course be out of question even be there time for to go return must not be possible for to obtain audience with new emperor just at present wish must have be so jack said of course dick will be glad enough to avail ourselves of chance of escape for must be foolish to insist upon waiting to be tried by tribunal certain beforehand to condemn still one doe like thought of making one escape so leaving to be supposed that be conscious of guilt oh doctor said need not trouble upon score governor be hated by one one really doubt that attacked first upon contrary population be inclined to look upon a public benefactor there will then be feeling against here even if there be must make little difference at present one in russia be talking thinking of nothing death of czar of change may be made by son detail of squabble in obscure town will attract attention whatever will not probably even obtain honor of paragraph in odessa paper first thing for to do be to get friend into fit state to walk how do feel asked bending over dick feeling pulse ever so much better dick said cheerfully since have heard from that there be chance of escape have be fretting so at thought have got jack into such wretched mess by folly in telling governor that knew of treachery if have be only must have cared why dear dick jack said cheerfully never dreamt of blaming if have spoken out have doubt must have done so old fellow come of blame can stand do think doctor asked oh think so dick said rising managed to totter across cell be right doctor said in quarter of hour will have good dinner sent in from restaurant have arranged for

that must be obliged to weaken hold on poland so far however great a be number of troop russia have poured down to meet ally have in way weakened hold upon poland indeed even larger number of troop than usual be massed in country insurrection at present going on be intended rather a proof to europe that poland yet lived ground down though be under heel of russian tyranny than a movement from success must be reasonably hoped for lad be now able to look round at wild group filled clearing greater portion be peasant although dress bearing of several proclaimed that belonged to superior class of peasant be armed with gun be quite in minority greater portion carrying scythe blade fastened to long handle although clumsy to look at be terrible weapon in close onslaught russian soldier must seldom be kept firm by officer when in spite of fire polish peasantry rushed among pole be in high spirit own loss have be small have inflicted great slaughter upon head of russian column have gained considerable number of arm party have attacked rear of column at same moment when main body fell upon head have for time obtained possession of wagon with spare ammunition have succeeded in carrying

dick in reply gave narrative of adventure said that be making way to austrian frontier must be absolutely impossible pole said for to succeed in making way in safety town be full of russian troop who be forever scouring road must be out of question for one except native to succeed in getting through even pole must find difficulty so strictly be one questioned of course object be to prevent band from increasing to capture of who may be returning to home only manage to assemble by marching constantly in wood by path known only to villager must find too matter of extreme difficulty to cross frontier even must gain a there be perfect cordon of troop posted along frontier to prevent one from escaping once in austria must be safe must not cross into prussia even if succeeded in passing russian troop stationed along line for prussia who be a harsh master to pole under rule a be russia act a policeman for latter turn fugitive back who may cross frontier at present fear can give assistance there be talk of union of several of band further west in case might travel with might pas on see that have guide for present can either lodge in village where wounded be now taken where be not likely that russian will find at rate for present if like to join need not say how glad will be to receive a comrade england have always be friend of poland more than one of countryman have fought in polish rank a england be at war at present with russia will be doing a much service by fighting here a in crimea here too will have satisfaction that be fighting for oppressed people struggling for freedom against tremendous odds lad asked for twelve hour before giving final answer then having shared pole rough meal chatted with for long time upon progress chance of insurrection polish leader told that there be score of band like own in forest admitted that saw little hope of final success unless russia be completely crippled in war with england france said in poland rise only when

polish patriot saw that must be impossible for to make way on to frontier alone considered that chance of life be le if captured in action by russian than if found in village with number of wounded insurgent wrong of poland be in day subject moved men heart in england midshipman rejoiced at thought of striking blow in so good cause be reason in talking matter over assigned to other in reality love of adventure excitement in slight degree influenced to have taken part in real polish insurrection to join in guerilla attack fierce onslaught on russian column to live wild life in wood be thing appealed strongly to imagination of midshipman in morning expressed to stanislas chernatony willingness to join fight against russian until opportunity occurred for to cross frontier rejoin force before sebastopol good pole said be heartily glad to have two english officer fighting under warfare be of kind very different to to be accustomed can guarantee that will see that pole undisciplined badly armed fighting hopeless battle can yet die a bravely a own trained soldier in crimea be now going back to place left day before yesterday regard a headquarters have news that column attacked be to set out a so far none of band have visited neighborhood thought might take by surprise succeeded in doing much damage success be not a great a gained in last fight when succeeded in capturing two

must be filled at once must more piece be taken men must be available already trained to work for four day drill went on without intermission lad found polish peasant very intelligent although be difficult for to understand why movement must be performed with mechanical regularity at first too boy ignorance of polish caused great difficulty stanislas wrote down for translation of word of command movement be taught by boy performing insisting upon motion being accurately imitated worked from morning till night by end of fourth day be satisfied that men must serve gun in workmanlike regular way pole be delighted when found how swiftly smoothly work must be done now that have mastered looked forward with anxiety to try result upon russian have not long to wait in short time friend from next garrison town brought news that considerable body of fresh troop have arrived there that attack be to be made on following day by two heavy column messenger be sent off at once during night insurgent be joined by three other band raising number to nearly men stanislas told lad that intended to move before daybreak so a to attack one of column a soon a entered forest while other be too far away to arrive at scene of action until must be over propose said to fell tree across road arranging so that gun can fire between while trunk will afford gunner shelter men will be arranged among tree on side so while gun sweep column will attack upon flank will place hundred of best men at barricade to defend gun must column press forward in spite of effort believe that will have easy victory recent partial success have considerably added to stock of arm a be first time that have brought cannon into play may rely upon effect being considerable lad begged that might go forward with party charged with felling tree in order that might choose spot see to construction of defence stanislas chose one of lieutenant who spoke russian giving men ordered to carry out instruction of lad set off hour before daylight just a dawn began arrived at spot where struggle be to take place selected point where rise of six foot afforded view of road far in advance placed gun just so far behind tree while must sweep road muzzle only must be seen by advancing foe two large tree felled stripped of bough be placed across road in front of gun being when placed just high enough for gunner to look over strong party be then set to work to cut sod with earthwork be thrown up across road four foot high embrasure be left for gun be made very narrow a fire must be directly in front on side tree be felled with bough outward so a to form chevaux de frise extending at angle on side of road for fifty yard in advance of gun fifty of men be to remain in road in rear of gun in readiness to man earthwork must russian advance to take by storm while rest be to lie down behind chevaux de frise to open fire upon flank of advancing column few green bough be scattered on road in front of battery lad going along road by russian must advance be pleased to see at distance work be scarcely noticeable just a have finished preparation stanislas with main body arrived be greatly pleased at position boy have constructed gun ammunition wagon have be dragged along by rope to hundred of peasant have harnessed pole now took up position assigned to for attack stanislas principal officer held consultation with midshipman be agreed that russian column must be allowed to approach near to gun before opened fire that doing so must be signal for general attack upon column hour later peasant who have be placed near edge of wood announced that russian column be in sight so far a must judge from observation made from tree top numbered about infantry with battery of artillery be just fair match for stanislaus said men extra count for much superiority of arm will be counterbalanced by advantage of surprise to effect cannon brought against for first time may exercise on mind of soldier presently along straight road black column of enemy must be seen be advancing in heavy mass forty men abreast be preceded at distance of yard by advance guard of men when distant yard from midshipman observed advance guard halt guessed that obstacle of sort other across road have be made out mounted officer rode back from advance guard to main body be there joined by several other mounted men after conversation movement be seen in column mounted officer rode back a did so column divided leaving passage in centre of road there be long pause then lad must see russian gun coming through line halted formed across road half way between main body advance guard unlimbering prepared to open fire upon unknown obstacle in front midshipman have arranged with stanislas a must be difficult for party on flank of russian column to distinguish between sound of enemy gun own white handkerchief must be hoisted on long pole when opened fire chain of men be placed along back in wood to repeat signal down to spot where pole be lying ready for attack russian opened fire over head of advance guard who lay down in road shot for most part struck slope flew overhead very few striking upper part of battery face be alone exposed to fire for five minute russian continued to fire then deceived by absolute silence reigned supposing obstacle be accidental one that insurgent have retired gun be limbered up advance guard again moved forward main column marched on close behind gun whole of men who have be placed behind barricade be armed with musket hidden behind leafy screen rested piece on branch prepared to pour fire into column a advanced be not until advance guard be within fifty yard of that lad who have trained gun to sweep road gave signal silence be broken by roar of two gun loaded to muzzle with grape shot effect be tremendous two lane be literally mown through rank of russian infantry shot flew high doing terrible execution among artillery behind echo have not died away when tremendous fire of musketry be opened by pole hidden behind abattis more than half of advance guard fell under terrible discharge artillery crowded behind fell into confusion russian officer strove by voice example to gather survivor of advance guard together consternation slaughter have caused be heightened by sound of tremendous yell far behind followed by steady roll of musketry showing that column be hotly engaged there also artillery attempted to unlimber to bring gun to bear again confusion prevailed in crowded spot rendered next to impossible long before must be accomplished iron hail again swept through rank two rattling volley from invisible foe behind flanking abattis again flashed out advance guard be annihilated artillery in confusion general commanding main column pushed men on through frightened horse of artillery opening heavy musketry fire on unseen foe pressed forward to assault conflict now became desperate one midshipman fired gun alternately a fast a must load pole working a steadily coolly a if have be long trained artilleryman several time russian advanced to within twenty yard of defence time shattered by fire of grape shot by storm of bullet from abattis recoiled in vain flung upon tree tried to hew way through in vain officer called upon to gather together carry battery at rush receiving aid from own artillery mingled in throng of infantry be helpless shaken by shout of assailant by battle raging in rear told retreat be menaced russian lost heart began to fall back then retaining only fifty men a guard to battery midshipman ordered rest of defender of abattis to move forward among tree on flank of russian keeping up constant fire until joined main body in attack on russian rear in battery now must see little of what be going forward wood be full of dense smoke whole russian column a fell back be maintaining wild fire at random into bush around though lad must see nothing road in front afforded sure guide for aim ceaselessly gun kept up fire into retreating mass of russian for hour roar of gun continued unabated then a died away triumphant shout of pole told that victory be won that russian column defeated shattered have retired from forest gained open country beyond then defender of battery raised answering cheer to friend in distance exhausted with exertion threw on ground of working gun three have be wounded by rifle bullet have passed through embrasure several of rifleman have fallen shot through head a fired over top of battery while thirty forty lay killed wounded behind abattis after few minute rest party advanced soon joined friend who saluted with loud acclamation victory have be complete one whole of spare ammunition store have fallen into hand of victor upon overpowering rear guard have cut trace carried off horse column have made sturdy resistance at point although desperate onslaught of scythe armed pole have several time broken rank carried slaughter among have yet stood firm be only crushing of head of column subsequent retreat have at last decided day for hundred yard in front of gun ground be covered with russian dead most of artillery horse have fallen two of gun have be carried off field loss of enemy in killed wounded left upon ground amounted to nearly wounded be killed a soon a discovered by infuriated peasant of pole have be put hors de combat delight of insurgent be unbounded be by far most important victory have won have now come into possession of sufficient musket to arm whole body abundant supply of ammunition have in complete battery of artillery with enough horse taken from wagon to give two to gun leave sufficient number for ammunition wagon two midshipman received warmest thanks of polish leader who attributed success entirely to slaughter gun have wrought to disposition taken for defence chapter xix to rescue consultation be held on evening of battle a be custom of polish peasant after success many wished to return for while to home family several plan be proposed among group of officer leader asked young midshipman for opinion dick said that in ignorance of circumstance geography of country must offer none jack on being appealed to said seems to that will never do good if confine yourselves to beating back russian column occasionally then dispersing until again advance opinion be that be absolutely necessary to follow up victory have gained to do something will induce whole country to believe that there be prospect of success have gained very fair victory to day propose that while men be in high spirit russian proportionately depressed take offensive fall upon one of garrison hitherto a say have always contented yourselves with attacking column sent out against russian will be altogether unprepared for attack on in own quarter if fall suddenly at night upon piaski ought to succeed in nearly annihilating there be about men of column whom have fought about in other column marched out against morning fell back when heard of defeat of comrade be probable that pretty nearly whole force in town came out so that altogether there can not be above men if can fall upon at night ought to be able to defeat easily at rate before rally must inflict tremendous damage upon jack proposition be received with acclamation be decided that attack must take place on following night officer therefore went among men appealed to to remain for forty eight hour in order that might annihilate garrison of piaski men assented more readily that abundant supply of bread spirit have be found in captured wagon russian commander having deemed probable that expedition might extend over period of day next morning be instructed in use of russian musket many of peasant being wholly unacquainted with management of fire arm be arranged that peasant must in addition to gun carry scythe favorite weapon for close conflict when night came on be ready for march band be to advance separately under order of own leader be to unite in market place a clock struck one there be three barrack certain proportion be told off for attack of three of gun be hidden in forest other three drawn by four horse accompanied column duty assigned to being to blow in gate of several barrack coarse grass be cut swathed round wheel horse foot be also muffled peasant be clad in sandal there be therefore fear of noise of advance being heard at nine o'clock column set out for town be nine mile distant upon nearing separated so a to enter a arranged in different direction column be preceded at distance of hundred yard by four five men chosen for activity duty being to seize silence watchman might meet in street town seemed absolutely asleep when band of stanislas with for time be three cannon entered few minute before one once lad thought that must hear stifled cry if so attracted attention for street be deserted not single window opened a passed other hand have already arrived in market place when commanded by stanislas reached few word be exchanged by

fire opened upon from window without pausing band broke up into party under chief rushed at entrance leading to staircase then ensued desperate conflict russian taken wholly by surprise appalled by suddenness of attack knowing ferocity with assailant fought in case offered slight resistance leaped by score from window at back preferring risk of death broken limb to awaiting rush of enemy others defended desperately gathering on top of stair barring door resisting foot by foot until man have be cut down absence of officer who be quartered together in different part of barrack proved fatal to defender accustomed to act like machine to move only at command of officer be bewildered at finding under such circumstance without head direction in ten minute after entry have be effected resistance have ceased barrack remained in hand of victorious pole instant that own part of work be done jack archer with band of fifty men who have be told off to act under order proceeded to stable artillery

fain to admit that hardship have gone through be a nothing to have be borne by soldier in crimea during six month have be away from trial discomfort of great storm have be sample of what be to be undergone after inkerman have be plain to general in command that idea of taking sebastopol must be abandoned until spring at utmost must do more than hold position before have be rendered still more difficult by storm in enormous quantity of store warm clothing other necessary have be lost be now too late to think of making road from balaklava to front work have authority in first place dreamt that army must have to pas winter on plateau be of others most necessary consequence of omission be that suffering of troop be terrible while balaklava harbor be crowded with ship full of hut clothing fuel men at front be dying in hundred from wet cold insufficient food between abundance extended almost impassable quagmire in horse bullock sank died in thousand although laden only with weight donkey in ordinary time must carry have strength of regiment in front be sufficient soldier might have be marched down when off duty to balaklava to carry up necessary required so reduced be by over work fatigue that fit for duty have often to spend five night out of seven in trench be physically too exhausted worn out to go down to balaklava for necessary even of most urgent kind many of regiment be almost annihilated large number of fresh troop have come out draft for already there new comer mostly raw lad broke down under strain almost a fast a arrived in spite of number sent out total available strength did not increase one regiment must only muster nine men fit for duty many be reduced to strength of company few survivor of one regiment be sent down to scutari until fresh draft must arrive regiment must be reorganized yet regiment have not be engaged in of battle scarce general of who have commanded division brigade at alma now remained regimental officer have suffered proportionally regiment have won alma still remained before sebastopol constituent have almost entirely changed proportion of who have first landed in crimea still remained there when jack returned be small indeed suffering of french although great have not be nearly so severe a own camp be much nearer to port organization of service be far better more complete a in first place siege work have be equally divided between number at time being nearly same work of men have become increasingly hard a number diminished while of french grew lighter for strength have be trebled by reinforcement from home thus while men be often five night out of seven on duty in cold wet french have five night out of seven in bed gave far greater time to forage for fuel be principally obtained by digging up root of vine brushwood twig above surface having long since be cleared away to dig deep hole under tent to dry clothes to make life comfortable at last strength of english diminished to point that be at length incapable of holding long line of trench be obliged to ask french to relieve did by taking over right of attack measure placed opposite to two russian position of mamelon malakoff battery proved to be key of sebastopol a spring came on matter brightened fast english contractor sent out large body of navvy began to lay down railway from balaklava to front reinforcement poured in health of troop began to improve troop of transport animal from country on mediterranean be landed village of shop set up by enterprising settler be started two mile out of balaklava hut sprang up in direction sort of comfort purchased by subscription of english people when heard of suffering of soldier be landed distributed work of getting up siege gun storing ammunition for re opening of bombardment in earnest went on merrily arrival of turkish troop of nearly sardinian who pitched camp on plain rendered ally secure from attack in direction enabled to concentrate effort on siege so far success have lain wholly with russian for earthwork battery raised armed by ally russian threw up two whereas when army arrived before on th september sebastopol be little more than open town must have be carried by first assault be now fortified place bristling with battery in direction of immense strength constructed upon most scientific principle many of work especially mamelon malakoff tower battery be fortress in with refuge dug deeply in earth where garrison slept secure from heaviest fire of gun surrounded by work on side in trench be russian who be always aggressor sortie after sortie be made throughout winter in russian often obtained possession for time of portion of trench of french along in front of work ground be studded with rifle pit sometimes so close to work that be impossible for man to show head above artilleryman be frequently unable to work gun owing to storm of bullet russian sent through embrasure whenever sign of movement be discerned in desperate fight in darkness in trench lost more men than in of pitched battle of campaign be only dogged courage of soldier devotion of officer enabled to maintain footing in trench before city be supposed to be besieging throughout winter fleet have lain inactive although why must have done so none knew when have in power by attacking russian fort in sea of azof to destroy granary upon besieged depended for supply midshipman however be able to tell jack that have not be altogether idle a fleet have at last on d of may be set in motion have two day before returned from expedition light vessel of english

destroyed russian vessel employed in carrying provision to russian army in crimea besides enormous magazine of corn flour be destroyed at berdiansk genitchi kertch at latter place immense quantity of military naval store also fell into hand have expedition taken place in october instead of may be probable that russian must have be unable to maintain hold of sebastopol portion of fleet have remained in possession of sea of azof thenceforth russian have to depend upon land carriage however mattered comparatively little a country be now firm dry road from russia to crimea be available

again bombardment be to re open next week general expect to carry town by assault though between ourselves have belief that battery will be able to silence enemy gun sufficiently to make assault upon tremendous position possible however a expect to do be probable that will like having officer who can speak russian at front a interpreter must of course be useful suppose must rather stay on board

clean neat before many of officer tent clump of flower brought up from plain have be planted railway be not yet completed quite to front last two mile have to be traversed on foot upon presenting written order to officer in command of naval brigade jack be at once told off to tent with two other midshipman be told that must not for present be placed upon regular duty that must be employed a

to line of d here found that harry have be sent home sick in january that have sailed from england again with draft be expected to arrive in course of few day jack found few of officer still there whom have before known several however be expected shortly back either from england from hospital at scutari greatly relieved to find that brother be alive well jack returned to naval camp where speedily made at home when first mentioned to messmate two lad about own age that have be prisoner in russia statement be received with incredulity when at request proceeded to tell of adventure regarded with admiration a most stupendous liar have ever met be long indeed before statement be in way believed be only when upon occasion of one day dining with officer in command of brigade jack at request related in presence of several officer adventure in russia that statement be really accepted a fact for be agreed that yarn fellow might invent to astonish comrade must not venture upon relating a fact to post captain however be later on on morning after arrival be expectation for be known that bombardment be about to recommence at half past two o'clock roar of gun mortar in british battery over in of french broke silence answered minute two later by of russian gun along whole line of battery day be hot almost without breeze smoke from so vast number of gun hung heavily on hill side nothing must be seen a to effect cannonade be producing be not until next morning that effect of fire be visible face of russian battery be pitted scarred injury of importance have be inflicted upon day fire continued with unabated fury on side of ally russian replying intermittently presently news circulated through camp that assault must be made at six o'clock officer men of duty thronged brow of plateau looking down upon town at half past six body of french troop be observed to leave trench in skirmishing order to make way towards mamelon gun of russian fort roared out already assailant be too close for to have much effect soon great shout from spectator on hill proclaimed that zouaves who always led french attack have gained parapet then from within host of figure surged up against sky curious conflict raged on very summit of work soon however increasing mass of french a streamed up enabled to maintain footing have gained pouring down into fort drove russian from french pouring out in rear twice fresh body of russian reserve coming up attempted to roll back french attack exultant with success pressed forward in spite of fire gun of round tower fort poured upon drove enemy down hill be growing dark now must with difficulty be seen how fight be going fresh mass of french troop poured from advance trench into mamelon there be question that point be decidedly gained still however battle raged around zouaves flushed with success attempted to carry round tower with rush swept up to abattis surrounding russian brought up fresh support whole hill side be alive with flicker of musketry russian gun of battery bearing upon scene of action opened while of right attack be close to french opened fire to aid ally have zouaves be supported be probable that must have carried round tower with rush be not in plan of operation after fighting heroically for time fell back to mamelon fight on british side have be le exciting with sudden rush men have leaped on advance trench driven russian from position in quarry then rapidly turning gabions of trench prepared to hold ground have taken be not to maintain conquest unmolested for soon russian poured down mass of troop to retake night long flash of fire flickered round position six time russian officer led up troop to attack assaulting force be over men out of men thirty five officer be killed wounded have stronger body be detailed there be doubt that redan be near quarry must have be taken for be almost empty of troop men in impetuosity of first assault arrived close to great discontent be felt that measure must not have be taken to follow up success ally own troop felt that great opportunity have be missed owing to want of forethought of general next day there be armistice from one till six to collect bury dead officer men of contending party moved over ground have be scene of conflict chatting freely together exchanging cigar other little article jack who have gone down with commanding officer created slight astonishment among russian by conversing with in own language in answer to question told that have be prisoner among begged to forward note have that morning written to count preskoff at berislav acquainting that have made escape across russian frontier have rejoined army for thought probable that letter have given to count stanislaus to post after left might never have come to hand at six o'clock gun again re opened russian having made good use of time in arming fresh battery to counteract effect of work have carried have indeed hard work in maintaining hold of quarry be commanded by several battery whose position placed outside range of gun loss be very heavy a also be that of french in mamelon be made centre for russian fire on night of th th of british french ship stood in close to sebastopol kept up heavy fire upon town on th be decided by marshal pelissier lord raglan that assault must take place on morning of th of june arrangement be made for attack british force told off for work consisted of detachment of light second third division be divided into three column sir john campbell have charge of left colonel shadforth of right colonel lacy yea of centre column general barnard be directed to take brigade of third division down to ravine near quarry while general eyre moved brigade of same division still farther along order be that in case of assault on redan being successful must attack work on right on french left three column strong under general de salles be to attack three of russian bastion while on right three column of equal force be to attack russian position general d'autemarre assailing gervais battery right flank of malakoff general brunet to fall upon left flank of malakoff little redan from mamelon while general mayrau be to carry russian battery near careening creek thus french be to assault in six column numbering in men with reserve of assaulting column contained only men while be in reserve attack be to commence at day break by mistake column of general mayrau attacked before signal be given in few minute be repulsed with great loss general being mortally wounded four thousand of imperial guard be sent to assistance three rocket being fired a signal assault be made along line russian however have be prepared for what be coming by assault on left reserve be brought up redan be crowded with troop gun be loaded with grape a little english column leaped from trench rushed to assault be received with tremendous fire inevitable result of sending men to attack tremendously strong position held by ten time own strength across ground swept by dozen battery followed handful of british struggled nobly forward broken up into group by irregularity of ground by gap made by enemy fire party of brave men struggled up to very abattis of redan there unsupported powerless be shot down nothing must exceed bravery soldier manifested bravery be in vain three officer in command of column sir john campbell colonel shadforth colonel yea be killed in vain officer strove to lead men to attack there be indeed scarce to lead russian in mockery of foolishness of such attack stood upon parapet asked men why did not come in at last remnant of shattered column be called off upon left brigade under general eyre carried cemetery by sudden attack so hot fire be opened upon that be with difficulty position must be held however be sole success of day french column be repulsed with heavy loss from malakoff although gervais battery be carried must not be maintained naval brigade furnished four party of sixty men to carry scaling ladder wool bag two of party be held in reserve did not advance captain peel be in command be wounded a be mr wood midshipman of hm queen who acted a aide de camp three officer of one detachment be wounded of other one be killed one wounded jack have in morning regretted that be not in order for service when at night loss who bad taken part in have suffered be known must not congratulate that have not be detailed for duty total british loss be twenty two officer men killed seventy eight officer men wounded french lost thirty nine officer killed ninety three wounded men killed taken prisoner about same number wounded so that loss be enormously greater than of french in proportion to number russian admitted loss of killed wounded jack be with many others spectator of scene from cathcart hill must not be imagined that even vague idea of what be passing must be gleaned by looker on redan be point of view immediately opposite be fully mile away in few minute from commencement of fight air be thick with smoke din of battle along so extended front be so continuous overpowering that be impossible to judge by sound of firing how fight be going on at particular point upon night before there be general sanguine feeling a to success of attack many laughing invitation be given to future dinner in hotel of sebastopol great then be disappointment when hour after opening tremendous roll of musketry gradually died away while fire of allied battery angrily opened telling tale that along line ally have be defeated save only for slight success at cemetery eagerly be wounded questioned a carried on stretcher slowly painfully making way upon foot ascended hill in most of regret at defeat anger at incompetence of who have rendered defeat certain predominated over pain of wound be jabers said little irishman be cruel work entirely there be six others captain made way up to lot of high stake stuck in ground before place looked round divil soul be there near must climb over stake if have got over there be deep ditch beyond way of getting in out what must have be good if have when there be about russian inside shouting yelling at top of voice firing away ton of ammunition stopped there five minute may be waiting to see if one else be coming then when four of be killed captain wounded thought time to be laving so lifted up carried in got ugly baste of russian bullet into shoulder a did so ye may call fightin ' be just murder call something like be tale told by score of wounded men be little wonder that sore with defeat disappointment heart sick at loss have be suffered feeling of army found vent in deep grumbling at general who have sent out handful of men to assault fortress next day there be truce to allow of burial of dead collection of wounded who lay thickly on ground between rival trench did not take place however till four in afternoon by time wounded have be lying for thirty hour without water aid greater portion of time exposed to heat of burning sun ten day later lord raglan died be brave soldier honorable man most courteous perfect english gentleman be most certainly not great general be succeeded by general simpson who appears to have be chosen solely because have a lad served in peninsula authority seeming to forget for work upon army be engaged school of war must compare with of crimea that general who have received training there be incomparably fitter for task than others must be two day after repulse at redan jack be delighted by entry of brother into tent harry have of course left england before receipt of jack letter written when have crossed frontier be overwhelmed with delight at news have received ten minute before on arriving at camp that brother be alive be again with

can tell next few day passed quietly on th of july jack rode out with commanding officer who with many others accompanied reconnaissance made by turk french on foraging reconnoitring party towards baidar did not come in contact with russian party still worked steadily at trench french be fortunate in having soft ground before be rapidly pushing advance up towards malakoff position must without difficulty have be seized by ally at commencement be in reality key of russian position gun completely commanded redan position must render that post untenable while whole of south side of sebastopol must lay at mercy in front of english ground be hard stony be next to impossible to advance trench towards redan greater portion of earth indeed have to be carried in sack on men back from point in rear working party be also exposed to cross fire large number of men be killed day on st tremendous storm broke upon camp soldier be now accustomed to such occurrence tent be well secured little

fairly under arm russian have crossed bridge be charging forward aqueduct be nine ten foot wide several foot deep now formed front of french defence ran along on face of hill with very steep slope facing russian in spite of fire of french artillery in front of sardinian artillery swept in flank russian soldier pressed most gallantly forward crossed aqueduct tried to storm height sardinian fire however be too severe after ten minute russian fell back met column advancing at double uniting again rushed forward while forded river two gun crossed by bridge by ford opened upon french infantry rushing breast deep through water began to scale height french met boldly after fierce fight drove down across bridge on left column have attacked french right in spite of sardinian gun ploughed long lane in rank crossed aqueduct scaled height a reached plateau so terrible storm of grape musket ball swept upon that bead of column melted away a surmounted crest fresh men took place of fell when french infantry with mighty cheer rushed upon russian broke ran so great be crowd that must not pas river in time prisoner be taken while french sardinian artillery swept remains of column a retreated with terrible cross fire at bridge however russian made one more effort reserve be brought up again crossed river aqueduct french however be now thoroughly prepared attack be like preceding one beaten

french be nine officer killed fifty three wounded men killed wounded sardinian have two officer killed eight wounded sixty two men killed wounded russian loss be twenty seven officer killed eighty five wounded men killed wounded never be advantage of position more clearly shown for russian lost fifteen time a many killed a ally four time a many wounded although have advantage of surprise on

if must borrow pony mr myers said that must manage for at once went obtained loan of pony from officer who be just going down into battery quarter of hour afterwards having taken precaution to put biscuit cold meat into haversack to fill flask with rum water started rode across plain to sardinian camp lieutenant have obtained news of proposed reconnaissance from officer with whom be acquainted on sardinian staff news however have be kept secret a upon previous occasion so many officer off duty have accompanied reconnaissance a to constitute inconvenience on present occasion secret have be so well kept that only four five pleasure seeker have assembled when column consisting of cavalry started jack accustomed only to flat plain of southern western russia be delighted with beauty of valley through now rode be beautifully wooded here there tartar village nestled among tree have long since be deserted by inhabitant have be looted by successive party of friend foe of everything portable presently turned out of valley have first passed through followed road over slope into valley similar to first for hour rode on then distance ahead of column heard report of shot cossack have got sight of mr myers said will soon learn if russian have troop in neighborhood presently scattered fire be opened from wall of country house standing embowered in tree on eminence near what appeared to be mouth of valley officer in command of party dismounted one of squadron sent men up in skirmishing order against house two other squadron trotted down valley rest remained in reserve sharp musketry conflict went on for short time around chateau then sardinian made rush shout of triumph cessation of musketry proclaimed victory at same moment soldier rode back from cavalry have gone up valley to say that strong body of enemy horse be approaching across plain order be given for general advance cavalry trotted down valley to join party in advance now mr archer lieutenant myers said best thing for to do will be to ride forward to house up there see attacking party be coming back to horse ought to have good view over plain will see fight between sardinian enemy besides may pick up loot soon reached house tying up horse entered be fine chateau handsomely furnished short a be time that sardinian have held possession have already tumbled everything into confusion in search for plunder table couch have be upset closet chiffonier burst open with butt end of sword with discharge of pistol into lock looking glass have be smashed valuable vas lay in fragment on floor bottle of wine whose neck have be hastily knocked off stood on table in courtyard be sign of strife three four cossack two sardinian horseman lay dead will go out to terrace in front of house mr myers said from that ought to have view over country owing however to tree grew around be obliged to advance yard so from house before must see plain then half mile out saw blue mass of sardinian cavalry advancing by squadron still farther two body of russian horse nearly equal in strength to italian be seen there be movement among sardinian horse formed into two body dashed at russian there be cloud of dust sword must be seen flashing in sun confused melee for minute two then russian broke rode across plain pursued by sardinian very pretty charge mr myers said now will go in look at house will be fully hour before return again went in wandered from room to room place have evidently be tenanted until quite lately article of woman work lay upon table canary bird be singing in cage fire burnt in kitchen meal be evidently in course of preparation when first alarm have be given officer wandered from room to room collected number of little trifle to take home a remembrance small picture of greek saint such a be found in russian house little bronze statuette two three small handsomely bound book couple of curious old plate jack took possession a present for elder sister of small work box beautifully fitted up having made two bundle of plunder prepared to go out again to see if sardinian be returning when jack looking out of window uttered exclamation of surprise alarm one of thick fog be so common in black sea on surrounding coast have suddenly rolled down upon be difficult to see five yard from window jack exclamation be echoed by mr myers be nice business latter exclaimed have better find pony make way down into valley at once seeing how thick fog have come on sardinian may not return here at so saying hurried to spot where have tied up pony leading by rein descended into valley fog be getting thicker thicker mr myers said can not see three yard before must listen for a pas then join although be by mean impossible that may be received with shot hour passed grew more more anxious half hour still sound be heard think can possibly have passed without seeing mr archer valley be quarter of mile wide must be sure to hear trampling of horse jingling of sabre yes sir be sure have not passed since got here may possibly have seen fog coming on have ridden rapidly back passed before came down may have gone round by mouth of valley parallel to left to cross into one be just what have be thinking mr myers said what do think have better do be quite impossible that can find way back through fog a quite impossible sir jack said if be to move from where be must lose idea of bearing in three minute must be a likely to go into plain a up valley be most awkward position mr myers said anxiously now mr archer have have sort of experience of kind before tell frankly what think be best thing to be done have be thinking over sir for last half hour jack said appears to that best thing to do must be for to find way up to house again ca well miss that a came straight down hill will bring back two of cossack cloak lance then have better move about till come on clump of tree make ourselves a comfortable there a can fog last a know sometimes for two three day when get clear whether be to day to morrow will look out see whether there be of enemy about of course a know way can come back in fog if see of must put on cossack cloak take lance boldly ride off be always galloping about in pair over country so that will attract attention if catch lieutenant said will be liable to be shot a spy suppose will sir jack answered must rather run risk of being shot a spy than certainty of being caught a naval officer imprisoned till war be over well mr archer certainly can suggest nothing better lieutenant said will go up then get cloak speak of leaving pony with lieutenant jack made way up hill fortunately in descent have followed small track worn by person going to from chateau from valley have therefore little difficulty in finding house paused when reached courtyard for heard voice in chateau listening attentively discovered that be russian doubt of party who have be driven thence by sardinian who have upon retirement of latter ridden straight back from plain fortunately fog be so thick that there be probability whatever of movement being discovered therefore proceeded to strip off two of long coat reaching almost down to heel form distinctive cossack dress from dead men took possession also of cap bandolier for cartridge worn over one shoulder of carbine lance then retraced step down hill to companion leading pony wandered aimlessly through fog for considerable time before came to tree if will hold horse sir jack said will just look round see if be small wood will lose before have gone yard so when hear whistle please whistle back not loud for there may be enemy close by for aught know thought heard voice just now searching about jack found that clump of tree extended for little distance returning to lieutenant entered wood moved little way among tree so a to be out of sight if fog lifted suddenly then loosened saddle girth gathered stick lit fire using cossack coat for rug began to discus meal have brought with if russian really advance again get between balaklava see how on earth be to pas through mr myers said sir think must jack answered must propose that make wide sweep round so a to come down upon shore distance away a know boat from ship often land at of deserted place along there in search of loot so that ought to be able to be taken off if when be riding come upon russian troop suddenly so that can not move away in other direction without exciting suspicion must put good face on russian be good enough to pas muster a cossack have to do be to avoid of fellow for must detect at once did not belong to well mr archer take thing very coolly hope will get out of scrape have got into if have be by must have ridden up surrendered to first russian saw must have be best way sir have not be for poor beggar having be killed up above there for in naval dress must not have hoped to have escaped a be if have luck will soon be back at balaklava again chapter xxiv fortunate storm fog seemed to get thicker thicker a day went on at nightfall when became evident that move must be made before morning gave biscuit to of pony cut grass laid before then wrapping in cossack cloak to keep off damp fog be soon asleep at day break fog be still thick a sun rose gradually dispersed be shortly able to see up valley found that in wandering in mist must have moved partly in circle for be still little more than quarter of mile from point where have left to ascend to chateau round must see many soldier moving about looking up valley perceived line of horse picqueted by village few hundred yard away be voice thought heard doubt when first came here jack said be lucky found tree for if have wandered about little longer might have stumbled into middle of now sir have better finish biscuit put aside for breakfast be off be quite evident direct way to camp be close to saddling up horse putting on cossack black sheepskin cap long coat taking lance carbine latter of be carried across saddle before mounted pony rode off quitting wood at point that formed screen between cavalry in distance until have gone well down valley be unnoticed at rate unchallenged by party at chateau issuing from valley rode out into open country far out in plain saw several russian moving about judged that be occupied in searching who have fallen in cavalry fight of preceding day did not approach turning to right trotted briskly along skirting foot of hill passed through two three tartar village whose inhabitant scarcely glanced at so accustomed be to sight of small party of cossack riding hither thither in one stood just at mouth of valley have determined to enter a road running up seemed to indicate that led to place perhaps upon sea shore found several russian soldier loitering about lieutenant myers must have checked pony jack rode unhesitatingly forward officer came out of one of cottage news asked none jack said enemy horse came out yesterday through baida valley beat back again where be going russian asked down towards sea jack answered to pick up straggler who land to plunder whole sotina be coming down will be here presently so saying with wave of hand resumed way up valley lieutenant myers having ridden on lest question must be addressed to road mounted steadily after hour riding crossed brow found at head of valley opening before between cliff at end must see sea must scarcely restrain shout of joy quickening speed rode rapidly down valley presently perceived before small village lying on sea shore to left of stood large chateau half hidden among tree do think be safe to ride in mr myers asked most of village have be found deserted sir jack said by fellow when landed be afraid be beyond point to come for must think must be twenty mile from balaklava however there be not likely to be troop here need mind tartar found a expected that village be wholly deserted riding through dismounted at chateau door be fastened walking round perceived sign of life breaking window soon effected entrance found that house be of great size evidently belonged to russian magnate be splendidly furnished that have so far not be visited by party from ship fine picture hung on wall choice piece of statuary be scattered here there table of malachite other rare stone stood about eastern carpet covered floor be in clover now sir jack said if must charter ship must be able to make rich prize a pony can only carry be afraid that valuable be worthless to 'd give whole lot of lieutenant said for good meal at rate be sure to find something for pony in stable behind house be great quantity of forage pony soon have fill officer taking corn of also there be abundance hammered quantity between two flat stone moistening rough flour so obtained with water made two flat cake with baked over wood fire satisfied hunger consultation be held while ate meal be agreed that a place be evidently beyond range of boat from balaklava have better ride along cliff till reached village where a must find from state of house party be in habit of coming after couple of hour stay to give horse time to rest again saddled up took road along coast after riding two mile along edge of cliff simultaneously checked horse a upon mounting slight rise saw before tent of considerable party of russian soldier a have paused moment head came above level be unobserved turning rode back to chateau have quitted where having made pony comfortable prepared to pas night there be plenty of luxurious bed slept profoundly night in morning went down to sea not vestige of boat be to be seen began to question whether must not be possible to make small raft to paddle along foot of cliff need not trouble about now lieutenant myers said for unless be mistaken be going to have regular black sea gale in hour two wind be freshening fast cloud banking up lieutenant be not mistaken in hour wind be blowing in furious gust sea breaking heavily in little bay having nothing to do sat under shelter of rock watched progress of gale wind be blowing dead along shore grew fiercer fiercer three hour passed then lieutenant myers leaped to foot see said there be boat coming round point be so driving before gale be ship boat rag of sail be set must see figure on board be making in here lieutenant exclaimed let run down signal to to beach at level spot just in front of village doubt be ship boat came out to picnic at one of village near balaklava have be blown along coast have be unable to effect landing boat head be now turned towards shore sail lowered oar got out so high be sea already that spectator feared moment must be swamped be well handled once in little bay water grew smoother soon made way to spot where officer be standing latter be astonished when men leaped out instantly without word rushed at in moment be levelled to ground by blow of stretcher when recovered from shock astonishment found sailor grouped round hallo jack exclaimed in astonishment mr simmonds be that what on earth be knocking about like for why jack archer exclaimed officer addressed where on earth did come from what be masquerading a cossack for saw here of course took for enemy thought be up at

work abattis have be torn to piece by cannonade men did not wait for ladder leapt into ditch scrambled up on other side russian within ran back opened fire from traverse work in rear a english troop entered halted to fire upon enemy instead of advancing upon consequence be that russian who be rapidly reinforced be soon able to open tremendous concentrated fire upon mass of men in angle pressed

in time have lost more men than at inkerman loss be officer men killed officer men wounded have regiment engaged be composed of same material a who won height of alma result might have be different although even in case be questionable whether small force told off for assault must have finally maintained against mass russian brought up against composed a be of young troop many being lad sent off to front few week after being recruited success of such attack so managed be well nigh impossible from first be gloomy evening in british camp be defeated while french be victorious fact too that

taking place that must not resist entreaty especially a must hing for brother who be lying in quiet half dreamy state delight of english army at fall of south side of sebastopol be greatly tempered by knowledge that be due to capture of malakoff by french own share in attack having terminated by defeat feeling have be excited by fact that guard highlander who have taken part in trench work during winter who be in high state of efficiency must have be kept in reserve while boy battalion bore whole brunt of attack found angry expression among men day allied army remained quiescent be useless to attempt to occupy burning town troop might have be injured by explosion took place from time to time of store of powder zouaves however own sailor made way down in considerable number returned laden with loot from house have so far escaped conflagration happily success of french own failure did not create feeling of unpleasantness between troop of two nation a remnant of french regiment engaged

bayonet among dust told of coming of troop who be hurrying in direction to prevent landing odessa be however clearly at mercy considerable controversy took place at time a to whether ally must not have captured being defended by battery ranked a fortified town must have be clearly justified in destroying in putting town under heavy contribution wealthy city must readily have paid however be for
