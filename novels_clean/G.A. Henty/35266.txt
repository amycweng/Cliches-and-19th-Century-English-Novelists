than hour then got up to go went down garden with stopped at gate to kiss again before got in to have doubt intense astonishment of powdered footman who be holding carriage door open who must have

fielding must not obtain from went away greatly mystified rather anxious james fielding have shrewd suspicion of how robert gregory have met end knew anticipation of fortune have under mr harmer will knew for robert have spoken to of of effort have be made to find will have read in paper account of burglary at harmer place that one of robber be supposed to have be wounded when therefore heard of robert death that have resulted from accident without particular of how where being given idea have struck that have fallen in attempt to recover will all thought forgotten for many year now came back to must not help fancying that in way sophy new resolution be connected with same end however be use guessing on subject be evident that time alone must show for sophy must tell nothing next day james fielding paid l in to sophy account week afterwards went down into leicestershire to fetch bride chapter iv odd wooing have not much society at putney be not much lady society putney be too near to london for people to call upon new comer so only acquaintance made be wife sister of metropolitan men who resided there there be only four five of be only that number of married men gave a much quiet evening visiting a cared for be very sociable very frequently met at other house to tea then after little music gentleman sat down to whist while talked looked on be great place for whist polly be fond of played harry said very fairly for girl often played when be wanted when harry brought in two friend with took by turn to play double rubber in summer be constantly case for then putney be full of metropolitan men who took up quarter there for rowing season went up to business by morning train came down in quite strong body for rowing in evening increased a number be by who lived in other part of london have to return again same evening finer looking set of men must hardly be found men with straight active figure fresh healthy complexion not noisy yet full of fun life be almost in business of kind in city merchant stock exchange men solicitor men in government other office harry be very particular who brought home with certainly polly opinion mine a far a little season in town have qualified to judge be that be a pleasant gentlemanly set of men a must be found there be harry said of course few men in club who be not quite so presentable be to be expected in large body of men harry came down twice week through summer to go out in club eight generally walked little way along towing path on evening to see come along with measured stroke steady swing in time from hearing so much talk about got to know how nearly man in club rowed be more especially when club race be coming on three four eight have entered that matter be discussed with greatest interest harry always entered for have taken to rowing too late ever to become finished oar be considered very useful man in middle of boat what excitement felt about believe lady of club if may call so be at least a much interested a men discussed chance of boat quite scientifically laid bet of kid glove with other upon result first great excitement be evening when harry came back from club on night of choosing crew with list how eagerly looked over how glad must be to see that have griffin for stroke thompson for seven host in a eye ran down face must fall greatly when saw that have also big hamper who be notorious never pulled weight along long black who in be enough to well must not use harry word though be very expressive enough to spoil crew got among during fortnight be practising for race pretty miss planter must generally call in for evening a lived nearer to water than did must walk through cricket field to towing path watch different boat coming down over course in time became quite judge of rowing must tell pretty nearly must be most likely to win by regularity of stroke steadiness of swing with did last half mile down to bridge for a harry said crew must swing when be fresh boat kept form after going over course might be pretty well relied upon to win race miss planter be better judge than be for brother be life soul guiding spirit of club rupert planter be tall wiry man rather loosely put together with rolling uncouth walk on shore one must have singled out a man of unusual strength a practised gymnast put into boat muscle seemed to stiffen into steel a tore oar through water saw before most finished a well a perhaps most plucky oarsman in world rupert planter life be passed when not at business asleep in boat thought energy be devoted to promotion of aquatic art in general of metropolitan rowing club in particular whole time be at disposal trouble be grudged by in endeavour to maintain in proud position of first rowing club in england be rather despot in way little fond of carrying thing with high hand anything like shirking be greeted with force of denunciation sometimes rather astonished new member one minded what said for knew that only spoke a did for good of club be wonderful influence have over how much better boat went when be steering if be on bank eight came along pulling heavily against tide moment voice be heard with sharp now lift up boy way in tired crew straightened up lay out to work be almost magical on day of race went in steamer club hired to accompany great be interest excitement know anything prettier than to see four eight dash off together at word go oar dipping together amidst burst of shout encouragement from friend in accompanying steamer breathless excitement lest a close nearer to other in effort to draw over to middlesex shore there must be foul then thrill of pleasure triumph with see boat wish to win slowly inch by inch draw out from among others even must boat first lead not be favourite still give up hope continue to wave handkerchief to watch fresh effort until perhaps towards hammersmith boat stroke by stroke slowly gain on leader till be nearly abreast then with desperate spurt amidst wild cheering from steamer snatch victory in last quarter of mile oh be glorious exercise if ever wished man be certainly that might be able to row in boat race polly must get even more excited than did remember on one two occasion of particularly hard race came home with handkerchief glove literally torn into shred quite unconsciously to herself in excitement felt in watching varying chance of boat harry pulled in on occasion of general interest such a university contest race for championship used to go up to club room out into long balcony looking over river be very interesting to see river crowded with steamer excited crowd on towing path to hear burst of cheering broke out when started be only start saw not even always that for steamer often got in way so on whole enjoyed club race far more than great contest on quiet afternoon when tide be favourable there be racing on harry must come down early perhaps bring friend round with take club skiff row up to richmond very pleasant be lying back in boat with gentle gliding motion through still water listening to regular plash of oar then when reached richmond to get out stroll up into park look out on wonderfully beautiful view over rich wooded country towards windsor with winding river pretty mansion country seat on bank then when tide turned must start again floating down lazily with current not getting back to boat house until be growing quite dark mist be beginning to curl up from still river have now be two year at putney in time polly have many admirer indeed think one must help loving must have given slightest encouragement have married almost one of harry friend heart be evidently quite untouched at present did not seem to be at anxious to change name among harry friend be generally understood that be engaged wished to be so a made position more pleasant by putting quite at ease with by preventing possibility of unfortunate mistake being made besides be better able to chaperone polly in winter season a have said be much quieter than in summer for then rowing men almost went away to london till spring twice week at rate went in of evening to planter one of other resident family came in to saturday be club day then harry went out on water when weather be fine in evening to club room where boxed fenced played whist till twelve o'clock be not till have be there two year that came to know one of harry friend have never brought home before yet have heard more of than of almost man in club be charley horton merchant with very good business in city not that one must have taken for merchant indeed for anything connected with business in way be man of about thirty of middle height very strongly built with large pair of whisker ruddy complexion clear honest eye big voice hearty laugh harry have often spoken of a one of most popular men in club when have asked why did not bring in harry have said oh charley ca stand woman be not that dislike absolutely say doe not understand can never think of anything to say to man who once met at party report that stood at door evening looked a afraid of speaking to woman a if have never seen one before in life one day however when harry came down early with intention of taking up river charley happened to come down in same carriage with harry told what be going to do asked to take oar after great difficulty only under promise that must pull bow so a to be a far out of way of conversation a possible charley consented to come harry came home to fetch while friend went round to club room to dress met at boat house when saw coming do believe that if must by possibility have got away must have done so there be escape harry introduced to murmured something vague then went off to help to get boat down think that ever remember polly in such wild humour a be on afternoon kept up string of question talk whole time be on water believe on purpose to put mr horton out a be going up with tide there be occasion to pull hard rower have excuse for not talking polly commenced attack directly boat have pushed off believe waited for lest victim must escape do know mr horton have be wishing to make acquaintance for ever so long harry have so often spoken about that seem to know quite well charley horton coloured up like girl murmured something about mutual pleasure be sure be obliged to hold face down while thought that harry who be pulling stroke have therefore back to charley horton must have laughed out loud however restrained shook head admonishingly at polly who however paid not slightest attention to with perfectly innocent unconscious look continued to talk sometimes addressing harry sometimes friend always question requiring rather long answer explanation do believe that for own sake charley horton must willingly have jumped overboard swam ashore at time during trip up coming back again be more merciful confined question chiefly to boating matter on charley be able to answer pretty fluently be more at ease leaned forward asked harry to invite friend round nodded said nothing about till got out of boat then asked suppose be not going up to town charley till late train no answered not till well then harry said may a well come round with be going to have dinner tea charley opened eye with expression of absolute alarm much obliged said ca anyhow be quite impossible why mr horton said quietly said be not going up to town till late so there can be surely nothing to prevent coming in to come old fellow harry laughed there ca be reason why wo come so say more about come well know that there be particular reason charley said in tone of extreme depression evidently quite unable at moment to invent excuse well ashleigh will come be right harry said want to speak to one at room so will go round with may a well go on girl get tea ready a went home talked quite seriously to polly told be really very surprised at polly must by mean allow be wrong insisted that have only be very polite chatty be to certain extent true be quite unable to extract promise from that must be more merciful presently two gentleman came in harry told afterwards have not gone round with friend must never have come a be have endeavoured to persuade harry to tell that have received urgent message calling to town harry refused to do pointed out that if did must not believe that must have to call apologize next time came down so charley with great discontent came round be for time evidently very uncomfortable a evening went on became more at ease although be ridiculous to hear difference between loud jovial tone when spoke to harry shy disconnected way of speaking when answered question be charley horton first visit to be by mean last after came with harry not often at first a became more intimate much more frequently sometimes even when harry did not bring in a got to know found that woman be not such terrible being after became comparatively at ease certainly polly did not help to make so for teazed put out of countenance most unmercifully consequence be that although before very long got to talk to almost in same way did to harry be always shy awkward when addressed wondered myself that came at for polly plagued sadly in spite of what must say to even expressed surprised to harry harry laughed said do know agnes be firmly of opinion that charley be rather smitten with polly what nonsense said greatly amused at idea be not in earnest harry be be indeed agnes said capital husband must make too why dear harry polly must a soon think of marrying man in moon a charley horton why must marry almost one liked doe nothing make fun of told polly what harry have said a very great joke polly laughed too coloured little said what ridiculous nonsense agnes altogether be not so amused at idea a have thought must be after watched closely at last came to conclusion that harry be right charley really be serious about about polly must not tell at be just a teazing a ever with must not see least change in manner can not enter into at length will never bring story of mine to end must therefore be very brief with a have be with part of history be funny courtship never till be settled felt quite certain that be courtship at never heard charley pay compliment say anything such a people in condition do never at least once be not at usual way of doing have be talking about race polly said that must like to steer one of boat when charley came out in loud way by jove miss ashleigh if did there must be occasion to say 'eyes in boat harry laughed heartily polly got up made very deep curtsey poor charley be so completely astonished at that must not say word that evening took leave very shortly be only to harry that must confide anything at last told that be only waiting for opportunity to ask polly that for life of must not imagine what must say to however suppose did manage somehow for one day polly told that be settled that be going to marry charley horton be very pleased for although charley be not bit man must have thought polly must have chosen still be sure from what have heard seen of that be really good fellow must make extremely happy how charley managed to summon up courage enough to propose to never found out for although several time asked polly always laughed must never tell word about at first wanted to wait until percy came back from india for a said did not like to leave alone of course must not hear of have not so much longer now to wait besides charley urged if anything must take harry away from town that of course must come live with so be arranged that must be married in six month now that be settled seemed very strange to yet be very glad that be so for have hoped anxiously that polly must be married to one whom must like very much before be a must have be very loath to have gone away left alone while leaving with husband loved must know in far off home in india that be happy a well a so be heartily glad at engagement with charley horton about time be rather anxious about harry be restless unhappy be time before must make out reason then guessed that whether from idea of polly being married why know not that have fallen in love with planter pretty sister of course harry in present circumstance must not think of marrying knew felt that be one of last men in world to become engaged unless must keep wife said one day well harry suppose will have following polly example next answered so sharply yes nice match must be on l year be certain that there be something of sort in mind happened that one day soon after read in paper prospectus of company to execute extensive engineering work in australia lord holmeskirk name be among director same day went up saw ada husband asked if must procure harry appointment upon kindly said that must do what must ten day later harry received letter offering appointment of resident engineer at salary of l year to begin with l at end of three year harry accepted offer with greatest joy thus in space of month be to lose brother sister say lose because harry must be absolutely gone polly must have other love care must no longer be a have so long be first object in life harry be not to leave for six month yet be arranged that polly must be married immediately before started be to take up abode with husband charley now shyness have worn off improved wonderfully liked more more day with hearty straightforward manner polly manner to be very little changed still delighted in teazing bothering dear old bear a generally called must see now that under fun raillery be very very fond of chapter v terrible tidings now when seemed so fair smooth when thought at last fortune have resolved to make amends for frown with harry looking forward hopefully to new appointment in australia with polly engaged to man whom felt sure must make happy with five half year passed since percy left for india only two half to look forward to felt sure must be happy one spent a have arranged that must be with polly husband now be to come blow must shatter for ever fabric of happiness destroy at once plan have vainly fancied be so fixed settled be end of march polly be to be married in july early in month have received periodical letter from percy be written in usual spirit there be one part of made rather uneasy at time although did not think that must be anything serious be a follows must not fidget dearest about what be going to say now must not say at fact be so notorious have doubt will see allusion account in newspaper will very likely a newspaper often do greatly exaggerate matter have not written to on subject might make very uneasy of native troop be grumbling disaffected seems that one have persuaded that cartridge use be greased with pig fat on purpose to destroy caste however authority be quite awake several of regiment have be disarmed there doubt with severe punishment of of ringleader matter will end scamp be too well treated like men who be too well fed too much petted must find something to grumble at cartridge question be mere pretext must be at once avoided by withdrawing cartridge have be served letting men make for suppose will blow over a thing usually do native mind be certainly good deal disturbed strange rumour be going about country native in general have idea that company raj rule be going to end shortly confess that for part think john company be at likely to give up trifling bit of country in hurry rest of percy letter be written in usual way be very loving tender said that in little more than two year must be thinking of starting for england that a have not fallen in love with native princess yet thought there be chance now of claiming when got back be very long letter longer even than usual long a be how often often have read over since be last ever received from letter be written from place in india then little known in england although have attained terrible celebrity since be dated from lucknow where percy have recently be sent with very good staff appointment regiment being in quite part of india mail brought letter brought a have predicted account of disaffection in bengal army still one thought that be anything very serious did not feel at uneasy for scene where regiment have be mutinous be disarmed be very long distance from place where be stationed next mail brought news of how disaffection be spreading fresh regiment have mutinied have be disbanded next oh what throb of agony sent through england told of rising massacre unutterable horror oh be terrible with what fearful anxiety waited a thousand did in england at dreadful time for arrival of next mail how anxiety grew when post only brought darker darker news tidings at station there be rising massacre one during two month be very very kind to be very quiet for harry brought one in now charley horton be only visitor tried to moderate big hearty voice for sake brought down what cheering news must from city of how people thought must not spread farther that troop must soon get upper hand again tried hard to believe must not feel that only told so to cheer not because believed what said at last one morning harry went up a usual to catch eight o'clock train instead of going by came back in twenty minute after have started a came in at gate saw that have paper in hand felt intuitively that there be bad news in that have come back to tell be alarmed agnes said a came in seeing look of terrible suspense on face there be nothing about percy in paper thank god murmured news went on be only what have almost expected last mail told that be making preparation with man like lawrence to lead there be trust fear for ultimate safety still darling news be undoubtedly bad have risen at garrison have retreated to residency made sortie at first to meet rebel who be marching towards town seems that men got worst of so blew up fort last mail said be fortifying retired into residency appears to be fortified sort of place think can hold out until relief come be terrible news harry gave paper now to look at there be long list of telegram about different station garrison be read be nearly word for word a have told nothing more what must be worse be evident that garrison be terribly weak must never have abandoned post have so carefully fortified probably have suffered dreadfully in sortie percy be sure to have be among have ever got back into lucknow if so must hold out till relief came where be to come from oh what terrible four five day be before mail came in with detail of news what sickening agony of suspense suffered at end of time suspense hope be over day that be expected polly went down to gate to watch if harry returned from station be sure to do if there be news must not stand there with sat indoors watching with heart hardly beating hand grasping tightly arm of chair a if to keep down wild impulse prompted to rush madly down to station to see paper at last polly moved then went up road out of sight knew then that saw harry coming back again that news be in how long oh how long be coming knew owing to little turn of road must not have be more than hundred yard off when caught sight of not fifty when met oh how long be a second passed by after second second seeming age to still did not come heart sank lower lower hope died quite out at last appeared at gate must not see harry face for be bent down polly be a white a death then knew that percy be killed did not hear anything about for time afterwards remember coming in at gate sight of polly face next thing that recollect be be laying on sofa with polly cry softly over dr whitmore standing beside harry be not there for have cried so terribly have be so much in way that doctor have be obliged to send out of room have be for long time in faint so long that have become seriously alarmed have sent servant to fetch doctor even with aid there have be great difficulty in bringing round a soon a recovered sufficiently to be moved harry came in carried up to room polly got into bed be very faint weak still soon dozed off to sleep believe indeed that dr whitmore gave powerful sedative be not till next day be recovered sufficiently to ask question have never be told that percy be dead knew a well a if have spoken saw that knew have not even alluded to subject let see account said at last be strong enough darling polly said anxiously yes can not do harm polly know worst please let see how be polly in silence fetched paper folded down to place gave to be account of disastrous sortie made from lucknow just before siege began in account of retreat of little column back to town during so many noble fellow fell be word among little troop of cavalry composed principally of officer on staff who have found way to lucknow where regiment have mutinied lieutenant desborough of lancer greatly distinguished until heading gallant charge to check pursuing rebel fell have already earlier in day be wounded not so badly a to prevent keeping seat in common with nearly one who fell be impossible from close pursuit of rebel to bring off body two three time read through paragraph then turned round wearily to wall be end then percy be dead there be not even consolation of knowing that have be laid tenderly in quiet churchyard there to wait under burning indian sky till time must come when must again meet never part more now must not even think of so have not even that consolation must not think of a lying anywhere body have fallen into hand of rebel to be hacked mutilated before left to jackal wild dog must not think of at be too horrible oh percy percy next day ada came down to see grieved shocked a be dear girl have thought of of sorrow greater even than hers so have driven down in brougham to see polly left to ourselves ada cried with talked with over dead brother till tear ceased to flow so fast be comforted next day be about house again next polly went to london to buy mourning for not for although have intended to do so must not allow pointed out to that harry must sail in little over three month now that be absolutely necessary that original plan must be carried out that must be married before started showed how inconvenient delay must be for have given notice to give up house at time knew landlord have already found tenant for that therefore there must be nowhere for to be married from consequently that plan must hold good a before intended must be useless expense for to go into mourning polly endeavoured at first to argue that marriage must be postponed finding must not hear of seeing that really must be very inconvenient gave way however when came back from town found that have bought black dress bonnet for herself to wear until marriage charley horton came that evening did not see polly did have long talk with polly told afterwards directly came in have inquired after said well polly can do be to try hard to make poor sister a happy a can loss will in one way be gain polly for must have gone back with husband to india must not have seen for year now will be

brevet rank be grievously displeased if be addressed in other way be now more than seventy five be still brisk lively heart be kindness be short very upright generally dressed in brown plum coloured black silk inclined to bright colour in bonnet rather prided upon taste in dress personally be reverse of vain wore most palpable wig ever saw pair of spectacle with tortoiseshell rim of immense thickness have besides pair of heavy gold double eye glass hung upon chain on state occasion sometimes put on think be merely from little harmless pride in possession for whenever have really to look at anything always pulled out tortoiseshell spectacle not unfrequently tried to put on forgetful that gold spectacle be already fixed on nose mr mapleside lived in pretty little house on terrace overlooking market place when arrived that evening received with almost motherly affection interest must hardly allow to go upstairs to take thing off be sure that must be so terribly fatigued for to three hour journey by rail be undertaking not to be lightly entered upon involving immense risk fatigue old lady have once when girl made journey to london coach have be snowed up have be two day on road still retained vivid remembrance of suffering for last fifty year have never be beyond whitstable ramsgate to one other of place made expedition for fortnight so two year always going in coach a long a coach ran after in friend carriage for railway to be terrible monster nothing must convince that collision catastrophe of sort be not normal state of being expressed gratitude to providence

library principal object of interest in be to search for railway accident a few day pas without mishap of greater le importance being recorded be constantly quoting in support of pet theory be in vain that assured that number of accident be a nothing in proportion to immense number of train ran daily be light in must not look at have argument quite original to herself with always triumphantly confuted anything must urge on opposite side of question now dear must say accident happened by train left york at ten o'clock in morning will be kind enough to look in bradshaw never can understand see by train must have left canterbury to have reached york in time to have gone on by ten o'clock train must get book find that if have gone up to london by four o'clock train evening before then on by night mail to york have slept there for few hour must have gone on by ten o'clock train to accident happened there dear must exclaim triumphantly see have have wonderful escape if have started by four o'clock train on way to scotland must have be very likely killed if remember if have gone by twelve o'clock train day before to bath must have be in dreadful accident at bridge where so many people be killed no dear there be hardly day pass when if have taken place by one of train from here gone on journey to part of england other must not have met with accident other perhaps only run over signalman even must have be very unpleasant to feeling may say what like dear nothing will persuade that have almost daily most providential escape from destruction be mr mapleside great hobby have only one other curious conviction be that population of london be composed almost exclusively of bad character that inhabitant there must expect a ordinary occurrence to have house destroyed by fire column of time afforded immense array of fact in support of theory a one have unfortunately once told that not one in fifty of case before london magistrate be reported argument that case be a nothing in proportion to population carried weight with whatever be absolutely pathetic in description of fire there dear must say four fire on last tuesday night only think agnes what terrible

exchanged letter regularly chapter ix prepared for attempt now have told of joyful news have so wonderfully altered current of life restored to youth happiness must relate incident happened indeed two month prior to in point of time record after because other be so infinitely more important to myself indeed filled heart to exclusion of else yet until received news of percy recovery have almost written resurrection for to be indeed coming back from grave have from time event happened thought great deal about not indeed that attached do attach slightest importance to a far a regard have brought back to mind circumstance connected with series of effort made to find will of mr harmer from six to seven year ago terminated in death of unfortunate robert gregory research so long abandoned have now strangely enough be once again taken in hand time even more methodically determinately than at of former attempt that by very person whose conduct indirectly caused original loss of will sophy gregory be about month after return from visit to london be in parlour alone when hannah came in said that person wished to speak to do know who be hannah miss be servant must say by look did ask for for mr mapleside for miss special very well hannah then show in hannah accordingly ushered visitor into room be woman of apparently three four thirty be paler think than person ever saw not pallor produced by illness although may have have something to do with complete absence of colour such a may be caused by wearing anxiety very great sudden shock eye too have strange unnatural look coupled with unusual paleness gave very strange appearance indeed struck at once that there be something wrong with mind have not hannah closed door a soon a have shown in must certainly have told to remain in room with have not least recollection of having seen face before waited in silence for to address a did not said did understand that wished to speak to name be miss ashleigh then have recollection of asked instant spoke recognized voice be sophy sophy almost cried out yes indeed agnes be sophy be very much shocked at terrible change seven year have made in poor friend what must have suffered what have grief sorrow be to hers have lost loved best in world have painful shameful circumstance in death of lover a there have be in death of husband percy have died honourably in field of battle robert have fallen shot a burglar by woman hand beside be not alone in world have brother harry dear polly ada many kind sympathizing friend sophy be quite alone truly own suffering seemed small in eye when thought of hers be very much moved by pity tenderness for old friend a thought of what have gone through thought rushed through a embraced with almost more than warmth of old affection for for seemed to that sorrow suffered be additional tie between be time before be composed enough to speak rather before be for although have responded to embrace be evidently glad to see be plainly in state of too great tension of mind to find relief a did in tear when came to look at face more quietly be still puzzled by be not so much that be changed aged a there be something seemed to to be quite different to what remembered what be must not for time make out at last exclaimed why sophy have put on black wig dyed eyebrow be quite fair before now be black be only last night did so said quietly did not wish to be recognized down here for very particular reason will tell presently now knew what change in sophy face be must recall saw that alteration in be not really so great a have imagined certainly looked many year older than be be black hair eyebrow gave pale unnatural appearance to face have so struck when first entered room now sophy said tell about where have be living how have be getting on time be plan for future little child too sophy what have become of have not lost have agnes sophy said quietly have not lost jamie be very good dear little fellow have left now for time so must rather talk of something else now will give history of life a nearly a can from time went away from here although sophy have thus volunteered information be little time before must begin sad narrative of early married day yet be not agitated a told seemed rather cold strange think very manner must have repelled other people drew towards have felt so much same be still so quiet old from great loss saw in abstracted air of hers impassive tone in spoke of time when must have suffered so deeply that like have have so great grief that nothing again must ever move from quiet self possession yet fancied afterwards that be not exactly so for be upon point in future that thought energy be centered while mine be buried in past by degree sophy told history from date of elopement up to present time did not at time enter into detail of life have done so in two visit have paid since came down a much of history a be at important in more especially a having reference to own story particularly life in london when first married event prior to robert coming down to try recover will have told at length rest of tale have have to relate very briefly have now written out in chapter arranged with own story a well a must according to date at various event took place so that two story may be read in proper order when sophy have finished tale told that have left boy in london have come down to devote to task have so long have before what be task sophy asked have alluded to several time in course of story what be be resolved agnes sophy said quietly for boy sake for yours to find mr harmer missing will oh sophy said frightened at thought pray give up thought of will have proved curse to have cost one life if not two already have ruined happiness mine oh sophy if still exist let lie where be will do none of good now must find sophy continued quite unmoved have tried together failed sister tried alone without success robert tried died in attempt be turn now if cost too life ought to have tried first of for through sin be that will be lost have not deceived left grandfather must have lived perhaps for year will must have be handed back to lawyer must have be happy lost agnes will find from day when heard how robert died have be one purpose of life will find will will make son rich man yet will atone to a far a can for grief loss have caused have thought over agnes till brain seemed to be on fire with sophy eye looked so strange wild that really thought think still that brain have little turned by long thinking upon subject saw at once that must be worse than useless to endeavour to dissuade from what feel be perfectly hopeless attempt after pause said well sophy tell at least what plan be in way in can give assistance without mixing up in project will do so must tell at once will take active part in because in first place after time have now elapsed question much whether must feel justified in acting even a acted when loss of will be recent event in next place one life have already be lost in search indeed may say two consider have be attempted must be done lastly believe search to be perfectly hopeless in way in can help without taking active part will do so not with hope of finding will for old friendship sake know at present said sophy quietly that require assistance there be one point may be able to inform on depends very much method in will set about work only question have to ask agnes be doe miss harmer confessor live in house with in priest house in village just a before sophy in village one must have thought that must have be far more convenient for to have lived at house miss harmer who hear be just a obstinate at eighty a ever be insists on making change on doing a have always be done ever since sister death maid sleep in room with other servant in room immediately adjoining instead of in servant quarter at end of house a used to do now what else can do to help nothing sophy said what have told be exactly what have hoped wished although be afraid must not be so have be otherwise have arranged other method of going to work one will now try look upon success a nearly certain must not have be carried out unless confessor have lived a before now see that thing be in favour do know agnes have minute detail arranged in mind be for went to italy be necessary must be able to speak language like native can do so wanted to see bishop of ravenna saw so see be getting on already gave laugh made feel quite uncomfortable be so wild strange bishop of ravenna said seem to have heard name before oh remember be man miss harmer telegraphed news of brother death to be agnes be why went to see do know have copied out word in letter that papa wrote to be in way related to will have learnt by heart what be going to do first sophy think one will know be quite sure will not even knowing who be what have done to can hardly see resemblance between face now what be then intend agnes to go a servant to priest sophy a servant must not think of thing there be so many many thing against oh pray give up sophy even supposing that go through without detection what nearer will be to will a servant than a be now argued pleaded argument entreaty have slightest effect upon mind be so entirely fixed upon plan that hardly even paid attention to what said soon after took leave have seen two three time since will say nothing of here more than be still engaged upon hopeless task when give up go out a suppose will eventually to australia will write down particular believe be on point rather out of mind do hope poor thing will not do anything wild get into mischief at time first came down have not heard of percy being alive consequently have really putting aside that knew to be utterly hopeless hardly interest at in search now that be alive must of course for sake like to recover money know might a well wish to come into possession of snug estate in moon good can come of madcap scheme only hope that there may be harm will wait with great anxiety to see if get found out to ascertain what plan proposes to herself for finding out where will be concealed for fancy have idea will enable to do so be certain if seems likely to get into danger must for own sake poor thing take step other to prevent carrying on scheme might end a husband did fatally for chapter x spy in camp be year now since wrote of story time will really finish how little do foresee course of event certainly when last laid down pen little thought that story must have ended a have most of what follows have at time gathered from sophy lip rest from own knowledge of affair sophy gregory did not leave first time when came until be getting dusk a did not wish to arrive at sturry until after dark for single woman with bundle entering that quiet village must be almost certain to attract attention then rose to go submitted to embrace a before in quiet impassive way yet a turned to leave there be strange wistful look in eye a if with felt that have left last of old landmark behind have finally started on strange course have chosen thought be there be sign of wavering hesitation steadily quietly a have said good bye went out down step through gathering darkness by time be past barrack out into bleak country beyond night have fairly fallen wind blew keenly across flat sophy hardly felt have entered upon task at last must have be ordinary event must have attracted attention now presently long straight level road rose suddenly heard heavy water shed wheel working must dimly see black mass of building to right be nearly at sturry now little further on must just see two white foaming stream on left knew now be passing great mill hundred yard be in village there be hardly one about window be glow with bright fire within sophy shivered slightly drew shawl more closely round a hurried on be own bitter memory thought of cutting wind have so chilled last time have passed through village be on night have eloped time before have driven through in pony chaise with two pretty pony sophy passed through village went up hill beyond till reached plantation where have so often met robert gregory lane where dog cart have stood waiting on evening for absorbed a be in future concentrated a energy thought be upon one point must not help being moved by sad remembrance of past night oh how different might life have be have not taken that false step how different oh how different with wailing cry sophy sat down upon stone at corner of lane cried with terrible sorrow over lost life cried a have not cried since husband death long time sat there wept passionately bitterly at first quietly tranquilly afterwards when rose at last went on be with feebler step than before with mind lightened relieved seemed to that great weight be taken from brain have for so many weary month thought of one idea to exclusion of other that brain sorely needed relief that long fit of cry took off deadening strain do believe saved reason eye have softer look afterwards manner be le hard cold noticed change when saw month afterwards told that looked much more like that eye have lost strange look have about answered that knew that be so have at time thought that brain be failing told believed that fit of cry have be mercifully sent a relief to for have felt different woman ever since so sophy rose from heap of stone indeed in body with clearer brighter intellect although search be by mean given up went about in more steady thoughtful if with le fixed cunning method told if at time old strange wild feeling come over shut up in room think over past life be able now to pray god to have pity on to bring wrong right to spare reason for child sake sophy went on until at last came to well remembered east lodge where have lived so long a child not dreaming then that be proper home afterwards a long a lived at harmer place have be in habit of going down at least once week to see foster mother knocked at door without waiting for answer lifted latch went in tall woman of about fifty year old came out from inner room on hearing door open for have not heard sophy gentle knock looked suspiciously for moment at visitor then seeing by attire be that of respectable servant that although have bundle in hand be ordinary tramp asked civilly what may please to want know mammy green sophy said calling by old childish name woman fell back a if struck by blow candle dropped from hand be extinguished then seized sophy arm almost dragged to fire that might see feature more distinctly then a sophy smiled sadly recognized face again with cry of sophy sophy caught in strong arm kissed cried over sophy cried too old woman recovered from unwonted emotion first for sophy be weak exhausted by day excitement foster mother soothed petted a must have done child when sophy be composed again nurse took off bonnet shawl made sit down quietly in great oak settle by fire while put wood on made cheerful blaze then lit candle again laid little round table with tea thing in short time kettle boiled sophy after taking cup of tea felt once more herself be come down to live with again dear nurse asked presently will talk over to

by must become heiress of harmer place that be to end that have begged to write letting know how miss harmer be a in way in intended to attempt to find will be useless for to attempt anything a long a miss harmer be in good health dear old nurse said shaking head well ill will make difference be belief always have be that woman have got stone for heart well ill might a well try to stop one of engine go running along valley a try change what have once resolved upon have idea of changing mind sophy said quietly opinion on subject perfectly agrees with yours be going quite way to work in require help wish to get place of servant to miss harmer confessor proposal so much roused mr green indignation amazement that for long time sophy must not utter word what miss sophy who be lawful mistress of hall to go for servant most of a servant to popish priest what be thinking of servant indeed have thought from way sophy have spoken of what have be doing that have money if not be of consequence have two hundred pound in saving bank have laid by in good time be likely that a long a lasted must let miss sophy go out a servant indeed sophy have to wait patiently till storm be past then explained to nurse that be not because wanted money that did for have abundant supply that be very much obliged to dear old mammy green for offer be not question of money at that be absolutely necessary for recovery of will that must enter priest service nurse for long time obstinately refused to do anything to forward design be only by dint of coaxing argument innumerable indeed by threat if must not assist that must proceed difficult a must be by that at last succeeded in persuading mr green into giving assistance in enterprise at last however gave in consented although under protest that disapproved of that washed hand of whole affair to do what sophy desired of accordingly next day mr green went down into village putting egg chicken into basket under pretence of offering for sale to priest entered into conversation with old servant mentioned to that have friend down from london who have be in service there whose health be very bad who be ordered by doctor to go down into

for at once old woman took leave chuckling inwardly at thought of good bargain have made for miss harmer be not expected now to last many month longer a there be heir property must pas to stranger who be not likely to require service of priest thought probable that successor must not remain long enough in new place even to receive year wage have paid for next morning old servant told master tale have be agreed upon namely that have just heard that relative in distant town be taken seriously ill wished to go live with nurse said that must take very kind of master if must let go at once that
