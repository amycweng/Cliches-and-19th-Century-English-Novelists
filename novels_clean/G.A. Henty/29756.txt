egyptian be eldest son if aught happens to will be king of rebu life be therefore precious one hour later came upon tail of straggler making way to front king stopped chariot sharply reproved of for delay in setting out urged to hasten on to appointed place in two hour king arrived at spot where already forty thousand men be assembled scout who have be sent out reported that although advance guard of egyptian might arrive in hour time main body be distance behind must not be up in time to attack before dark be welcome news for before night rest of force of rebu fully thirty thousand more must have joined king at once set out to examine ground chosen by general for conflict sloped gently down in front to small stream ran through soft marshy ground must oppose formidable obstacle to passage of chariot right rested upon dense wood while village mile half distant from wood be held by left wing causeway led from across marsh have be broken up heavy block of stone be scattered thickly upon to impede passage of chariot archer be placed in front to harass enemy attempting to cross behind be spearmen in readiness to advance aid if pressed chariot be on higher ground in rear ready to dash in join in conflict must enemy succeed in forcing way through marsh visit of inspection be scarcely finished when cloud of dust be seen rising over plain approached rapidly flash of arm must be seen in sun presently vast number of horse be seen approaching in even line be horseman father amuba asked be chariot amuba egyptian like fight on horseback although there may be few small body of horseman with army strength lie in chariot see have halted have perceived rank drawn up in order of battle chariot drew up in perfect line a cloud of dust blew away four line of chariot must be made out ranged at distance of hundred yard apart there be about thousand in line king said be advance guard have learned from fugitive that there be fully fifteen thousand chariot with army be there other place where can pas swamp father not so well a here amuba valley deepens further on passage must be far more difficult than here above beyond wood there be lake of considerable extent beyond that ground be broken unsuited for action of chariot a far a sea besides have come to fight pride of king must not permit of making detour see there be great personage probably king advancing beyond rank to reconnoiter ground chariot be indeed approaching opposite brow of depression there be two figure in by side walked numerous figure who although too far off to be distinguished be judged to be attendant courtier of king sun flashed from side of chariot appeared at distance to be composed of burnished gold great fan carried on wand shaded king from heat of sun drove slowly along edge of brow until reached point opposite wood then turning went other way till reached causeway passed on through village after rode back to line of chariot evidently gave word of command for instantly long line of figure seen above horse disappeared a men stepped off chariot to ground movement took place for hour then there be sudden stir long line broke up wheeled round to right left where took up position in two solid mass main army be at hand king said do see that great cloud ruddy in setting sun be dust raised by advance in hour will be here by time sun will have set assuredly will not attack until morning front line be ordered to remain under arm for time others be told to fall out prepare food for night egyptian army halted about mile distant a soon a be evident that further movement be intended whole of soldier be ordered to fall out line of archer be placed along edge of swamp ere long party of egyptian bowman took up post along opposite crest great fire be lighted number of ox have be driven forward in readiness be slaughtered for food if egyptian can see what be going on king said to son must be filled with fury for worship ox a among chief god be possible father that can believe cattle be god amuba asked in surprise exactly look upon a god son a sacred to god similarly reverence cat ibis many other creature how strange amuba said do not worship a persian do sun a must see be giver of light heat ripens crop give fertility in abundance not so far a know amuba know that have many god who believe give victory over enemy always give victory amuba said since four time have be repulsed in endeavor to invade land perhaps god be more powerful than theirs may be that son so far a can see god give victory to bravest most numerous army be to say interfere at father say that son know little of way of god nation have own a nation overthrow others must be that god be more powerful than others that interfere to save who worship from destruction thing be beyond knowledge have to do part bravely need assuredly not fear bull cat other creature in egyptian trust hour be spent by king leader captain in going about among troop seeing that contingent have arrived well armed in good order notifying to leader of position must take up in morning doing in power to animate encourage soldier when be done king sat down on pile of skin have be prepared for talked long earnestly with son giving advice a to conduct in future if aught must befall in coming fight be heir said a be customary to country throne go down from father to son be to survive for eight ten year must of course succeed must fall to morrow must egyptian overrun land thing may happen otherwise in case great need of people must be military leader who must rouse to prolonged resistance lead again again against egyptian until worn out by perpetual fighting abandon idea of subjecting turn attention to le stubborn minded people for such work be far too young people must look to amusis one of other captain a leader must success crown effort may choose a king in case must say amuba will be far better for to acquiesce in public choice than to struggle against lad like must have prospect of success against victorious general choice of people must only bring ruin death upon mother by opposing can assure that there be nothing so very greatly to be envied in lot of king a one of noble of land position must be far more pleasant here than a king cheerful acquiescence on part to wish will earn good will of people at death of whom may choose for king next choice may fall upon do in power to win good will of whoever may take place of leader at death by setting example of prompt willing obedience to order be easy for ambitious man to remove lad from path safety absolutely demand that will give reason to regard a rival trust that advice may not be needed that may conquer in to morrow fight if be beaten probability that will escape be very small be therefore a well that must be prepared for may happen if find that in spite of following advice leader of people whoever may be be ill disposed toward withdraw to border of country collect a large band a can there be always plenty of restless spirit ready to take part in adventure journey with to far west a so many of people have done before establish there found kingdom none of who have ever gone in direction have returned must therefore have found space to establish for have met with people skilled in war be defeated at least must have found way back so long a tradition have be handed down to tribe from east have poured steadily westward to unknown land band have ever returned father spoke so seriously that amuba lay down night on couch of skin in very different mood to in have ridden out have thought little of mother foreboding have looked upon a certain that rebu must beat egyptian a have done before father tone showed that too felt by mean confident of issue of day a soon a daylight broke rebu stood to arm hour later dense mass of egyptian be seen advancing a soon a reached edge of slope began to descend toward stream king ordered people to advance to edge of swamp to open fire with arrow shower of missile flew through air fell among rank of egyptian footman who have just arrived at edge of swamp so terrible be discharge that egyptian recoiled retreating halfway up slope where must be beyond reach of rebu in turn discharged arrow superiority of egyptian bowman be at once manifest carried very powerful bow standing sideways drew to ear just a english archer did at crecy therefore shot arrow vastly greater distance than did opponent who be accustomed to draw bow only to breast score of rebu fell at first discharge a storm of arrow continued finding powerless to damage egyptian at distance retired halfway up side of slope now from behind line of egyptian archer column of men advanced hundred abreast carrying great object be evident be about to prepare wide causeway across marsh by chariot must pas again rebu advanced to edge of swamp poured in shower of arrow egyptian covering with bundle of fagot carried suffered little harm while rebu be mown down by arrow of egyptian archer shooting calmly steadily beyond range of missile a soon a front rank of egyptian column reached edge of swampy ground men of front line laid down fagot in close row then retired in interval between comrade behind rank a arrived at edge did same many fell beneath arrow of rebu operation went on steadily fagot being laid down two deep a ground became more marshy rebu saw with feeling approaching dismay gradual steady advance of causeway two hundred yard wide across swamp king bravest captain alighting from chariot went down among footman urged to stand firm pointing out that yard causeway advanced arrow inflicted more fatal damage among men who be forming entreaty however be vain ground facing causeway be already thickly incumbered with dead hail of egyptian arrow be so fast deadly that even bravest shrank from withstanding at last even leader ceased to urge king gave order for to fall back beyond range of egyptian arrow change be made in formation of troop best most disciplined band be placed facing causeway so a to receive charge of egyptian chariot two front line be of spearmen while on higher ground behind be placed archer whose order be to shoot at horse to pay heed to in chariot then came chariot four hundred in number behind again be deep line of spearmen on right left extending to wood village be main body of army who be to oppose egyptian footman advancing across swamp completion of last portion of causeway cost egyptian heavily for while be exposed to arrow of rebu archer be now beyond range of egyptian on opposite crest at last work be completed just a be finished workman have retired king leaped from chariot leading body of hundred men carrying blazing brand dashed down slope a soon a be seen egyptian archer ran forward storm of arrow be poured into little band two third of fell ere reached causeway others applied torch to fagot egyptian footman rushed across to extinguish flame while rebu poured down to repel desperate fight ensued bravery of rebu prevailed egyptian be driven back attack however have answered purpose for in struggle fagot have be trodden deeper into mire fire be extinguished rebu now went back to first position waited attack be powerless to avert be upward of hour before began then long line of egyptian footman opened chariot be seen fifty abreast then with mighty shout whole army advanced down slope rebu replied with warcry at full speed egyptian chariot dashed down declivity to causeway be signal for rebu archer to draw bow in instant confusion be spread among first line of chariot horse wounded by missile plunged madly many stepping between fagot fell for moment advance be checked egyptian footman entering swamp waist deep opened such terrible fire with arrow that front line of rebu be forced to fall back aim of archer became wild uncertain in vain king endeavored to steady while be doing so first of egyptian chariot have already made way across causeway behind others poured on in unbroken column then through broken line of spearmen rebu chariot dashed down upon followed by host of spearmen king object be to arrest first onslaught of egyptian to overwhelm leader prevent mass behind from emerging from crowded causeway shock be terrible horse chariot rolled over in wild confusion javelin be hurled bow twanged shout of combatant cry of wounded a fell beneath foot of struggling horse created terrible din light active rebu footman mingled in fray diving under belly of egyptian horse inflicting vital stab with long knife engaging in hand to hand conflict with dismounted egyptian amuba have charged down with rest of chariot be stationed in second line immediately behind father charioteer mindful of order have received strove in spite of angry order of lad to keep chariot stationary horse accustomed to maneuver in line be not to be restrained in spite of driver effort charged down slope with rest amuba who have hunted lion leopard retained coolness discharged arrow among egyptian with steady aim for time contest be doubtful egyptian chariot crowded on causeway be unable to move forward in many place weight forced fagot so deep in mire that vehicle be immovable meanwhile along swamp on side terrible contest be going on egyptian covered by fire of arrow succeeded in making way across swamp here be met by rebu spearmen fight raged along whole line then two thousand chosen men bodyguard of egyptian king made way across swamp close to causeway while at same time there be movement among densely packed vehicle tremendous impulse be given to from behind be pressed off into swamp be overthrown trampled under foot be swept forward on to firm ground beyond thus mass of heaviest chariot drawn by most powerful horse forced way across causeway over obstacle in midst be king of egypt great thotmes weight impetus of mass of horse chariot pressed before up hill gave to chariot came on behind room to open to right left king bodyguard shook solid formation of rebu spearmen with thick flight of arrow chariot then dashed in among rebu fought with valor of race egyptian who first charged among fell pierced with arrow while horse be stabbed in innumerable place a stream of chariot poured over without check charged in section upon bursting way through mass of footman by force fury with charged infantry became broken up into group fighting doggedly desperately at moment officer in command of rebu horse thousand strong charged down upon egyptian chariot drove back toward swamp for time restored conflict break have occurred between rebu center two flank have enabled egyptian bodyguard to thrust through to fall upon rebu chariot spearmen who be still maintaining desperate conflict rebu king have throughout fought in front line of men inspiriting with voice valor many time when chariot be so jammed in mass that movement be impossible leaped to ground making way through throng slew many of occupant of egyptian chariot effort of captain be unavailing weight of attack be irresistible solid phalanx of egyptian chariot pressed onward rebu be forced steadily back chariot enormously outnumbered be destroyed rather than defeated horse fell pierced by terrible rain of arrow wave of egyptian passed over king looking round in chariot saw that be lost here that only hope be to gain one other of mass of infantry on flank to lead off field in solid order a turned to give order shaft sent by bowman in chariot few yard away struck in eye fell back dead in chariot chapter ii siege of city amuba saw father fall leaping from chariot strove to make way through mingled mass of footman chariot to spot jethro followed close behind too have caught sight of falling figure knew what amuba did not that rebu have lost king be not forgetful of charge have be laid on lad be for moment beyond control too be filled with fury at fall of king determined if possible to save body reached amuba side just in time to interpose shield between boy egyptian archer in chariot be passing arrow pierced shield arm held jethro paused instant broke off shaft at shield seizing point be projecting two inch beyond flesh pulled arrow through wound be moment work short a be almost cost amuba life for archer leaning forward dropped end of bow over lad head trick common among egyptian archer in moment dragged to ground while comrade in chariot raised spear to dispatch jethro sprang forward with shout of rage with blow of sword struck off head of spear a be descending then shortening sword sprang into chariot ran man holding bow through body grappled with spearman struggle be short one leaving sword in body of archer jethro drew dagger speedily dispatched foe then jumped down lifting amuba who be insensible from sharp jerk of bowstring upon throat violence of fall carried back to chariot with greatest difficulty managed to draw out of heat of conflict be for moment raging more fiercely than before rebu who have seen fall of king have dashed forward to rescue body to avenge death cleared space round a be impossible to extricate chariot carried body through chaos of plunging horse broken chariot fiercely struggling men to rear then be placed in chariot driver started with at full speed for city jethro on emerging from crowd paused for moment to look round saw at once that battle be lost center be utterly broken mass of egyptian who have crossed swamp be pressing heavily on flank of rebu footman who be still opposing firm stand to attacking in front for moment passage of egyptian chariot be arrested so choked be causeway with chariot horse be imbedded in mire have sunk between fagot that further passage be impossible large body of footman be now forming fresh causeway by side of other must soon be completed for be now working undisturbed by opposition jethro saw that a soon a be done egyptian host must sweep across fall upon rear of rebu jethro ran up to two mounted men badly wounded who have like made way out of fight see said in quarter of hour new causeway will be completed egyptian will pour over in case resistance will be impossible will be lost do one of ride to flank tell captain that king be dead that there be none to give order here that only chance to save troop be to retreat at full speed keeping good order to city horseman rode off immediately for jethro a king own charioteer be man of impatience after dispatching messenger returned to chariot at once drove off be now recovering rough motion of vehicle a dashed along at full speed aroused what be jethro what have happened battle be lost prince be conveying back to city have have rough fall narrow escape of life can do more fighting even if fighting be of good be not king father amuba said struggling to foot what of did not see fall know naught of for certain jethro replied there be terrible fight raging a have to carry out must take share in besides have arrow through left arm if have be moment later must have gone through body instead now if mind taking rein will bandage up have not have time to think about yet be bleeding fast begin to feel faint be indeed true jethro have called amuba attention to wound principally for sake of diverting thought for moment from fear for father a amuba drove looked back plain behind be covered with mass of fugitive see that be lost said mournfully how be that be not pursued will be pursued before long jethro answered fancy that few of egyptian chariot first passed be in condition to follow most of have lost horse driver number be broken to piece in melee be making fresh causeway when be completed who cross will take up pursuit a for footman have small chance of catching rebu surely men ought to retreat in good order jethro scattered a be will be slaughtered in thousand by egyptian chariot must not oppose much resistance to anyhow jethro replied on plain footman can not withstand chariot charge a be many will doubtless fall will scatter to right left number will reach hill in safety will take refuge in wood jungle while many will outrun chariot new causeway be narrow few only can cross abreast thus though many of men will be overtaken killed trust that greater part will escape let draw up here for short time jethro see there be several chariot horseman behind a be with main body of fugitive be doubtless friend let join proceed in body to town must not like to be first to enter with news of defeat be right prince a horse be good need not fear being overtaken can therefore wait few minute score of chariot presently came up halted on seeing amuba one of contained amusis chief captain of army leaped from chariot when saw amuba advanced to prince said why do delay rejoice at seeing that have escaped in battle for marked bravely fighting in midst let beg to hasten on few minute host of egyptian chariot will be upon be ready to proceed amusis since have come have news of father king have be sorely wounded general said be carried off out of battle come prince must hasten on presence will be sorely needed in city must get in readiness for defense before egyptian arrive chariot again started reached city without seeing anything of egyptian who did not indeed arrive before wall until hour later having be delayed by slaughter of fugitive a party entered town found confusion terror prevailing arrival of body of king be first intimation of disaster have be followed by several horseman chariot who have spread news of defeat of army cry of woman filled air in grief terror ran wildly here there sat at door with face hidden by hand wailing loudly others tore garment behaved a if demented on way to palace met troop who have be left behind to guard city moving down stern silent to take place on wall during drive amusis who have driven in amuba chariot have broken to boy news that father be dead amuba be prepared for loud lamentation of woman met a entered royal inclosure will see mother said to amusis then will come down with to wall will take part may assign in defense be to experience valor must now trust will do can prince wall be strong if a hope greater part of army find way back trust may be able to defend successfully against egyptian host assure royal mother of deep sympathy for in sorrow of devotion to personally general now drove off amuba entered royal dwelling in principal apartment body of king be laid upon couch in middle of room queen stood beside in silent grief while attendant raised loud cry wrung hand filled air with lamentation mingled with praise of character bravery of king amuba advanced to mother side turned threw arm round thank god son that be restored to what loss what terrible loss be ours be indeed mother better father ever lived than mine pray mother lay aside grief for awhile will have time to weep mourn for afterward have need of courage in few hour egyptian host will be before wall arm will be needed for defense be going down to take place among men to do what can to encourage confusion in city be terrible none know whether have lost husband father cry lamentation of woman can not dispirit dishearten men think mother that might do much if must be sure that father in resting place with god must far rather see devoting to safety of people than to lamentation here what must have do must say mother mount chariot drive through street of town bid woman follow example of queen defer lamentation for fallen until foe have be repelled bid do part in defense of city there be work for stone to be carried to wall food to be cooked for fighting men hide to be prepared in readiness to be carried to rampart where attack be hottest to shield soldier from arrow in other task can find employment in thus working for defense of town woman must find distraction from sorrow anxiety advice be wise amuba will follow order chariot to be brought down maiden will come with see two trumpeter be in readiness to precede will insure attention silence word will be heard a pas along how did escape from conflict faithful jethro bore off mother too must have fallen now with permission will go to wall do so amuba may god preserve must partake of food before go for will need strength son amuba hastily ate food be placed before in apartment drank goblet of wine then hurried down to wall scene be heart rending one over plain be scattered group of men hurrying toward city while among dashed egyptian chariot overthrowing slaying not without resistance rebu be well disciplined a chariot thundered up little group gathered together shield overlapping shield spear projecting while within circle shot arrow whirled stone from sling horse wounded by arrow often refused to obey driver rushed headlong across plain others charged up only to fall pierced with spear while chariot be often empty of occupant before broke into phalanx thus although many fell many succeeded in gaining gate of town number of men available for defense have already largely increased when amuba reached wall although egyptian chariot came up in great number night fell without appearance of main body of egyptian army after darkness set in great number of rebu troop who have escaped to hill made way into town men of contingent furnished by other rebu city naturally made way direct to home before morning six thousand men left behind to guard city when army set out have be swelled to four time number although be little more than force have marched out to battle return of so large number of fugitive caused great abatement of panic misery have prevailed woman whose husband son have returned rejoiced over whom have regarded a lost while whose friend have not yet returned gained hope from narrative of fresh comer that loved one might also have survived must ere long make way back example of queen have already done much to restore confidence knew affection existed between king woman felt that if must lay aside deep sorrow set such example of calmness courage at time behooved others to set aside anxiety to do best for defense of town amusis gave order that who have returned from battle must rest for night in home troop who have remained in city keeping guard upon wall in morning however collected at trumpet call be formed up according to company battalion to belonged of of have borne brunt of combat there be handful of survivor while of others greater portion be present weak battalion be joined to strong fresh officer be appointed to take place of who be missing arm be examined deficiency made good from public store ten thousand men be set aside a reserve to be brought up to point most threatened while to rest be allotted portion of wall be to occupy a soon a morning broke woman recommenced work have be interrupted by night making way to wall in long train carrying basket of stone on head disused house be pulled down for sake of stone timber party of woman with rope dragging latter to wall in readiness to be hurled down upon head of enemy even child joined in work carrying small basket of earth to portion of wall amusis have ordered to be strengthened position of city have be chosen with view to defense stood on plateau of rock raised fifty foot above plain caspian washed eastern face on other three side high wall composed of earth roughly faced with stone ran along at edge of plateau above at distance of fifty yard apart rose tower entire circuit of wall be about three mile since foundation by grandfather of late king town have never be taken although several time besieged rebu have strong hope that here when chariot of egyptian be no longer to be feared must oppose successful resistance to effort of enemy at egyptian army be seen advancing confident a defender of city felt must not resist feeling of apprehension at enormous force be seen upon plain egyptian army be over three hundred thousand strong moved in regular order according to arm nationality of men here be nubian sardinian etruscan oscan dauni maxyes kahaka race from iberia body of other mercenary from tribe people with whom egyptian have dealing sardinian bore round shield three four spear javelin long straight dagger helmet surmounted by spike with ball at top etruscan carried shield instead of straight dagger be armed with heavy curved chopping knife headdress resembled somewhat in shape now worn by armenian dauni be greek in character of arm carrying round shield single spear short straight sword helmet of shape of cone egyptian be divided according to arm there be regiment of archer who carried for close combat slightly curved stick of heavy wood other regiment of archer carried hatchet heavy infantry bore egyptian shield be about three foot long be widest at upper part where be semicircular while bottom be cut off straight shield have bos near upper part regiment carried in addition to spear heavy mace others ax helmet fitted closely to head most of wore metal tassel hanging from top helmet be for most part made of thick material quilted padded be preferred to metal being protection from heat of sun company carried own standard be of religious character represented animal sacred to god sacred boat emblematic device name of king queen be in metal be raised at end of spear stave standard bearer be officer of approved valor behind army followed enormous baggage train a soon a have arrived on ground tent of king principal officer be pitched what host jethro said to amuba who after having arm dressed on arrival at palace have accompanied young prince to wall seems nation rather than army wonder now that be defeated yesterday that so long held ground that so many escaped from battle be wonderful truly jethro look at long line of chariot moving in a regular order a footman be well for that will now be forced to be inactive a to others although be countless in number can not do much against wall tower that can erect upon plain will place on level with here rock be so steep that be only here there that can be climbed must seem impossible for to take prince must not be too confident know that many town believed impregnable have be captured by egyptian must be prepared for most daring enterprise gate have be already fastened so great thickness of rock piled against that be now strongest part of wall part of road leading up to be formed of timber have be burned can not now reach gate except by climbing a at other point have provision enough to last for well nigh year for harvest have be brought in from whole district round together with many thousand of cattle of well there be abundance yes heard preparation be being made jethro doubt not that if can resist first onslaught of egyptian can hold out far longer than can for difficulty of victualing so huge army will be immense in what way do think will attack for part see method offer hope of success can not tell know to to people around city seem impregnable egyptian be skilled in device of war have laid siege to captured great number of city be doubtless full of plan expedient of know nothing however to morrow morning will show something nothing will be attempted to day general have first to inspect wall see where assault be to be delivered army will be given day rest at least before being called upon to assault position in afternoon cortege of chariot made circuit of wall from shore of sea round great plateau to sea again keeping just beyond range of arrow if have few of archer here jethro said egyptian king must not be so overbold in venturing so near be wonderful how strongly shoot arrow have fully double range of ours power be sufficient to carry through strongest shield even when strengthened with metal have not seen must have thought impossible that living men bigger stronger than must have sent arrow with such power stand in different attitude to of archer though shaft be fully foot longer than ours draw to head regarded a good bowman till met egyptian now feel a child might do when watching man performing feat of strength of have not even imagined possibility in evening great council met included principal officer of army priest royal councilors leading men in state after discussion be determined that in present crisis be best to postpone taking step to appoint successor to late king that so long a siege lasted amusis must be endowed with absolute power in order that there must be loss of time for necessity of consulting one amuba be present with mother at council though of took active part in at commencement announcement be made in name that be willing to abide by council must decide that indeed mother son desired that while terrible danger hung over state supreme power must be placed in hand of whomsoever general voice might select a person best fitted to take command in such extremity night body of king be consumed on great funeral pile under ordinary occasion ceremony must have taken place on narrow promontory jutting out into sea about five mile from city here previous monarch have be consumed in sight of multitude of people have be buried beneath great mound of earth priest have long ago pronounced place most sacred in kingdom have declared that anger of god must fall upon who ventured to set foot upon holy ground be impossible for present to lay ash of king by side of of forefather ceremony be therefore conducted within royal inclosure only officiating priest wife son of deceased being present when be over ash be collected be placed in casket be destined when better time returned to be laid in sight of whole people in sacred inclosure on promontory early next morning trumpet of guard on wall called troop to arm a soon a amuba reached post saw egyptian army marching against city when arrived within bowshot archer who formed front line opened fire upon defender on wall arrow however for most part fell short while of besieged rained down upon with effect be therefore withdrawn short distance contracting rank vast number of footman poured through in irregular order ran forward to foot of rock where be sheltered from arrow of on wall what can be going to do now amuba exclaimed laying aside bow jethro shook head be working with plan said will see before very long listen even above din caused by so vast multitude sharp metallic sound be presently heard like of innumerable hammer striking on steel surely amuba exclaimed can never be thinking of quarrying rock away be too great task even be whole people of egypt here certainly be not that jethro agreed yet can not think what else can be intention be nigh hour before mystery be solved then at blast of trumpet sounded at post where egyptian king have placed taken up along whole of line great number of head appeared along edge of rock at foot of wall egyptian have be employed in driving spike in crevice of rock standing on first so driven then inserted others three foot higher so have proceeded until number of men have climbed up face of rock let down rope ladder have be hauled up steepest place great number of rope be hung down to assist who followed in ascent men who first showed over brow be followed by stream of others until ledge be in most case few foot wide be crowded with soldier ladder be now hauled up placed against wall egyptian swarmed up in great number rebu be prepared for assault storm of stone beam of wood arrow javelin other missile rained down on egyptian many of ladder in spite of number of men upon be thrown back by defender fell with crash over edge of rock to plain below here there egyptian gained footing on wall before rebu have recovered from first surprise at daring manner of attack so soon a rallied attacked egyptian with such fury that in case latter be slain fighting be thrown over embattlements for several hour egyptian continued effort after losing vast number of men without obtaining success be recalled by sound of trumpet have not be very serious jethro amuba said wiping perspiration from forehead for have be encouraging men by assisting in lifting casting over massive stone beam of wood be not difficult to repulse under such condition jethro said manner of attack be surprise indeed to have fought with greatest bravery will see that next time will have benefited by lesson that will have new device to cope with now that have once found way to scale rock may expect little rest fight be not renewed until evening when just a darkness fell large number of egyptian again ascended rock a before rebu poured missile down upon time only sufficient number have climbed up to be able to stand along close to foot of wall where be to great extent sheltered from missile from above night be dark one night long rebu continued to shower down missile upon invisible foe of whose continued presence be assured by sound from time to time be heard when daylight enabled defender to see what be going on at foot of wall raised shout of surprise dismay during night egyptian have hoisted up by rope quantity of timber brought with for construction of shelter for who be engaged on siege operation timber be cut prepared for fitting together be easily jointed even in dark thus then when besieger looked over saw forty fifty of shelter erected against foot of wall be so formed that sloped down like pent house be thickly covered with hide besieged soon found that so solid be construction that beam great stone dropped upon simply bounded off leaped down into plain ladder fastened together have be fixed by egyptian from of shelter to plain below so that men at work must be relieved reinforced a occasion required in vain besieged showered down missile in vain poured over caldron of boiling oil have prepared in readiness strength of beam defied first hide lapping over other prevented second from penetrating to below truly be terrible foe prince jethro said told that might expect new plan device did not think that very day after siege began must find that have overcome difficulty of natural defense must have established in safety at foot of wall what be to be done men working in shelter will speedily dislodge stone facing wall will then without difficulty dig through earthwork behind matter be serious jethro agreed a yet there be reason to alarm greater portion of troop will be assembled behind wall must egyptian gain way through must pour in at opening a can be only reinforced slowly must speedily hurl over edge of cliff be not that fear what be that do fear jethro fear prince because know what be have to fear be a child in struggle of kind a opposed to egyptian already have wholly overthrown calculation be just because know what will do next that be afraid must be a plain to a be to that if dig through wall will rush in overpower perhaps intend to work right left to undermine wall until large portion of tumble over breach be made jethro shook head must destroy egyptian shelter bury workman even did manage to retire before wall fell must gain nothing by in fact wish that ourselves must tumble wall over for in case heap of earth stone must rise from very edge of rock a egyptian must only climb up in small number at time must destroy without difficulty see now that builder made mistake in surrounding city with high wall must have be best to have built mere breastwork at very edge of cliff round here come amusis will hear what opinion of matter be amusis looked flushed anxious although when saw prince assumed expression of carelessness egyptian be going to burrow through wall said when do will drive like rat out of hole do not think so jethro know jethro said gravely if dig through wall will certainly a say drive out of hole can not believe that be what be going to do what do think be going to do amusis asked roughly have idea amusis wish that have be quite sure that have taken trouble for nothing chapter iii captive so confident be rebu that if egyptian dug through wall even threw down by undermining must repel assault that took little heed to hut established at foot of wall except that strong body of men be stationed behind wall half of whom be always to be under arm in readiness to repel egyptian must burrow through confidence proved ruin egyptian be thoroughly accustomed to mining operation be fully aware that be to pierce wall rebu must at once overwhelm small working party therefore after penetrating considerable distance into embankment drove right left making excavation of considerable size roof being supported by beam plank hauled up at night number of employed in work be increased a fast a there be room for while rebu thought that there be at most dozen men in of sheltered place there be at end of twenty four hour fully two hundred men at work in heart of embankment at point egyptian king have ordered chief of engineer to have everything in readiness for capture of city by end of third day night number of workman increased while excavation be carried in further further pick be used in work earth being cut away with wide dagger absolute silence be enjoined among worker be thus enabled to extend excavation close to surface without defender having idea of proximity distance that be from inner face be ascertained by boring through at night time with spear by end of third day excavation have be carried so far that there be foot so of earth remaining being kept from moving on pressure from outside by lining of board supported by beam thus at twenty point egyptian be in readiness to burst through among unsuspecting defender a soon a be dark preparation for assault began great number of staging of vast length have be prepared together with immense number of broad lofty ladder last be brought forward noiselessly to foot of cliff great number of egyptian mounted before alarm be given by on wall by time excavation be crowded with men egyptian army now advanced with shout to assault great stage be brought forward by labor of thousand of men placed against cliff besieged have now rushed to defend wall volley of missile of sort be poured down upon egyptian a strove to mount ladder stage one thought of possible danger from little shelter lying at foot of wall din be so great that work of digging through remaining wall of earth be unheard troop who have be specially told off to watch point have joined comrade on wall none marked stream of dark figure presently began to pour out from embankment at twenty different point at last besieged whose hope be rising a egyptian appeared to falter under shower of missile poured down be startled by sound of trumpet in rear sound be answered instantly from score of point rushing with cry of dismay to back of rampart saw dark body of footman drawn up in regular order rain of arrow be opened upon rebu without moment hesitation rushed down to attack foe who have gained footing scarce knew how in fortress of egyptian company be four hundred strong composed of picked troop for time easily beat off irregular attack of rebu amusis other leader of rebu strove to get men into solid order for so alone must hope to break phalanx of egyptian confusion be too great in meantime egyptian outside have taken advantage of diversion created by attack within poured up ladder staging in vast number dragging up ladder after planted against wall others poured through by passage have be dug a soon a be numerous enough ascended embankment from behind fell upon rebu still defending wall never did tribesman fight with greater bravery completeness of surprise number of egyptian who have established in rear constant pushing in of reinforcement through over wall rendered impossible for to retrieve fortune in confusion darkness be unable to distinguish friend from foe various battalion company be hopelessly mixed together order of leader officer be unheard in din upon egyptian side everything have be carefully planned one of company first entered have made way quietly along foot of wall be not noticed until suddenly threw upon defender of one of gate a soon a have obtained possession of great fire be lighted large body of egyptian troop headed by engineer carrying beam plank advanced gap across roadway be bridged over egyptian poured in at gate before rebu must dislodge party have taken possession of moment added to confusion of scene to rebu seemed a if foe be springing from very earth upon despairing of regaining ground have be lost began to break away make for home for water face of city only one be open to for egyptian be now pressing forward from three other face of town boat lying along sand be quickly crowded with fugitive pushed off from shore who arrived later found mean of escape gone threw down arm made way to home others ran back to meet egyptian die fighting be hour before conflict ceased for egyptian too be confused with darkness many desperate fight took place between different battalion before discovered be friend light be gained by firing number of house lying nearest to wall a soon a egyptian advanced beyond arc of light be fiercely attacked by rebu at last trumpet sounded order for troop to remain in position occupied until daylight a soon a morning broke vast crowd of woman be seen advancing from center of town a neared egyptian threw on ground with loud cry for mercy there be pause then egyptian officer advanced bade score of woman follow to presence of king thotmes have entered with troop who made way into city by gate yielding to entreaty of officer that must not expose to be killed in confusion perhaps by arrow shot by own soldier have retired to plain have just returned to take part in occupation of city rebu woman be led to over ground thickly covered with dead fully defender of city have fallen while loss of egyptian have be almost a large woman threw on face before great monarch implored mercy for child remnant of men of city thotmes be well satisfied have captured city be regarded a impregnable have crushed people who have inflicted defeat upon predecessor have added to own glory to renown of egyptian arm disposition of egyptian be lenient human sacrifice be unknown to religion appear at time to have slain in cold blood captive taken in war human life be held at far higher value in egypt than among other nation of antiquity whole teaching of law tended to create disposition toward mercy interpreter translated to king word of woman have resistance ceased king asked have men laid down arm woman exclaimed that there be not now armed man in city weapon having be collected during night placed in pile in open space in front of entrance to palace then give to life king said graciously when fight with coward have little mercy upon for men who be not brave be unfit to live when fight with men treat a men rebu be valiant people a well might jackal fight with lion a rebu oppose to might of egypt fought bravely in field have bravely defended wall therefore grant life to in city men woman child where be king died in battle four day since woman replied where be queen drank poison last night preferring to join husband than to survive capture of city thotmes have now ordered whole of inhabitant to be taken out to plain kept there under guard town be then methodically searched everything of value brought together king set aside certain portion of golden vessel for service of temple chose for after presenting others to general ordered rest to be divided among troop then ordered hundred captive fifty young men fifty maiden of highest rank to be selected to be taken to egypt a slave then fixed tribute rebu be in future to pay army then evacuated city inhabitant be permitted to return next day messenger arrived from other rebu town fall of capital have be believed to be impregnable after so short siege have struck terror into mind of messenger brought offer of submission to king with promise to pay tribute that might lay upon king well satisfied with success anxious to return to egypt from have be absent nearly two year replied graciously to various deputation informing that have already fixed tribute that nation be to pay annually ordered contribution to be sent in at once by city in proportion to size in few day required sum partly in money partly in vessel of gold embroidered robe other article of value be brought in when full amount have be received camp be struck army started on long march back to egypt officer of high rank being left a governor of newly captured province with ten thousand men a garrison amuba be one of fifty selected a slave amusis have escaped in confusion a have many others jethro be also one of selected band amuba be for time careless of what befell news of death of mother have met a after fighting to last returned to palace have be terrible blow following a did so closely upon loss of father overthrow of nation mother have left message for although a life have longer charm for preferred death to humiliation of being carried prisoner to egypt trusted that must bear misfortune have fallen on people with submission patience be young there be saying what future have in store for will doubtless son be word of message be carried away captive into egypt may yet escape day rejoin people may meet with lot in may find contentment even happiness there at rate last word to be bear patiently may befall remember always that father be king of rebu station in life may be try to be worthy of rank to be born there be greater happiness on throne than in cottage men make own happiness man may be respected even though only slave may god of country preside over protect always message be delivered by old woman who have be with queen since birth struck down with grief a amuba be at mother death yet acknowledged to that even loss be le hard to bear than knowledge that who have be so loved honored by people must undergo humiliation of being dragged slave in train of conquering egyptian be however so prostrate with grief that obeyed with indifference order to leave city be scarcely moved when egyptian officer appointed to make selection chose a one of party be to be taken a slave to egypt prostrate a be however felt to be satisfaction comfort when found that jethro be also of party set aside be selfish jethro said for to feel glad that too be to be dragged away a slave will be great comfort to have with know almost others of party to none will be able to talk of father mother home here a must to whom have known so long be not sorry have be chosen jethro said for have family tie now that rebu be conquered people must have little satisfaction in life here when get to egypt will probably be separated there be march of month duration before during time may at least be together since then being with be a say prince comfort to be well content have be chosen thought hard thing when wife died few week after marriage now rejoice that be so that can leave without one heart being wrung at departure prince perhaps of chosen will feel least misery at fate have befallen most of here be leaving wife child behind of youngest be still unmarried have father mother from whom will be separated therefore let not bemoan lot for might have be worse life in egypt may not be wholly unbearable be just what dear mother said jethro amuba replied repeating message queen have sent dear mistress be right jethro said may find happiness in egypt a elsewhere now let try to cheer up companion for in cheering will forget own misfortune jethro amuba went among rest of captive most of whom be prostrated with grief did best to rouse from stupor egyptian have seen that rebu be men in field amuba said to of let see that can also bear misfortune like men grieving will not mitigate lot nay will add to burden if egyptian see that bear fate manfully will have far more compassion upon than if see that bemoan remember have long toilsome journey before will need strength after hardship of lot be a nothing to of woman yonder be accustomed to exercise toil journey can support a well a egyptian will be terrible to delicate in nature a be let therefore set example of courage patience let bear a men whose suffering be unmerited who have be conquered not disgraced who be prepared to defy fate not to succumb to amuba word have great effect upon captive regarded with respect a son of late king a one who must have be king have not misfortune befallen calmness manly speech encouraged to strive against grief to look fate more hopefully in face a long a army remained in camp hand of captive be tied behind when march be begun be relieved of bond be placed in center of egyptian regiment be long tedious journey on way train of captive be very largely increased by who have be taken in earlier conquest of army who have be left in charge of troop told off to various province brought into subjection by egyptian until army passed through on homeward march provision have be everywhere collected to supply on progress a distance traversed day be small captive suffered little until entered upon passage of desert tract between southern point of syria mouth of nile here although vast quantity of water be carried in train of army supply given to captive be extremely small a sun blazed down with tremendous heat be half suffocated by dust rose in cloud under foot of vast body of men suffering be very severe rebu captive have gained respect of troop who escorted by manly bearing absence of manifestation of grief be betrayed by most of other captive regiment be composed of libyan mercenary hardy active men inured alike to heat fatigue during three month march have occupied amuba jethro indeed most of captive have acquired knowledge of egyptian language jethro have from first impressed upon young prince great advantage must be to in first place must divert thought from dwelling upon past in second must make lot more bearable in egypt must remember said that will be slave master be not patient with slave give order if order be not understood so much worse for slave will add to value therefore obtain for better treatment if be able to converse in tongue amuba be thankful indeed when gray monotony of desert be succeeded by bright verdure of plain of egypt a entered land order in have marched be changed long line of captive followed immediately after chariot of king of be laden with portion of spoil taken from native country amuba bore on head large golden vase have be used in ceremony of temple jethro carried rich helmet armor have belonged to king first city entered amuba be astonished at massive splendor of building at sign of comfort wealth everywhere met eye street be thronged with people who bending to ground shouted acclamation a king passed along who gazed with interest surprise at long procession of captive representing various nation who have be subjected to arm most of be surprised at temple with long avenue of sphinx gigantic figure representing god row of massive pillar majesty grandeur of edifice how be built jethro exclaimed over again how be massive stone placed in order how did drag huge figure across plain what tool must have used to carve out of solid granite be afraid amuba jethro said grimly for lad have positively forbidden to address longer a prince saying that such title addressed to slave be better than mockery be likely to learn to cost before long how manage marvel for marvel assuredly be must have taken strength of thousand of men to have transported even one of strange figure although people may have aided in work may be sure slave bore brunt of what be meaning of figure jethro surely neither in country in other be there creature with face of woman body of lion great wing such a have too have face of men body of bull while others have head like bird body like of men assuredly there can be such creature amuba wonder that people so enlightened wise a egyptian must choose such strange figure for god can only suppose that figure represent attribute rather than god do see human head may represent intelligence body of lion bull strength power wing of bird swiftness know that be so seems to that be possible that may be something of sort can not allow god be powerful since give victory over other people doubt will learn more of of many other thing in time journey be continued for three week be cause of constant surprise to captive extraordinary fertility of land especially struck cultivation among rebu be of very primitive description abundance variety of crop everywhere met eye seemed to absolutely marvelous irrigation be not wholly unknown to rebu be carried on to considerable extent in persia enormous work for purpose in massive embankment of river network of canal ditch order method everywhere apparent filled with surprise admiration many of city temple greatly surpassed in magnificence splendor have first met with amuba wonder reached climax when arrived at memphis till lately capital of egypt wealth content of city astonished captive most of be surprised when saw enormous bulk of pyramid rising few mile distant from town learned that be of tomb of king country have now altered in character on left range of steep hill approached river a march proceeded similar though not so lofty hill be seen on right at last after fortnight traveling shout of joy from army proclaimed that thebe capital of egypt goal of long weary march be in view thebe stood on side of nile on eastern bank largest portion of population be gathered part of city be inhabited principally by poorer class there be too large population on libyan side of nile house being densely packed near bank of river behind be number of temple palace while tomb of king queen be excavated in valley further back whose precipitous side be honeycombed with rock sepulcher of wealthy a dwelling house be low vast pile of temple palace public building rose above presented most striking appearance to approaching city lay in great natural amphitheater hill on side narrowing toward river above below march of royal army from memphis have be on western bank of river be great libyan suburb with palace temple that be approaching a neared city enormous multitude poured out to welcome king returning army shout of enthusiasm be raised sound of trumpet other musical instrument filled air religious procession from great temple moved with steady course through dense crowd separated at once to allow of passage of figure of god of priest attendant bearing emblem indeed jethro amuba exclaimed with enthusiasm be almost worth while being made slave if be only to witness glorious scene what wonderful people be what knowledge power magnificence why father palace must be regarded a mere hut in thebe temple of thought so much be pygmy by side of immense edifice be true enough amuba say that too be not filled with admiration yet know rebu several time drove back force man for man be more than match for soldier people be taller than by head have not so much luxury did want must make people effeminate perhaps so amuba assented must remember be not so very long ago that be people living in tent wandering at will in search of pasture have not think become effeminate because have settled down built town one can say that egyptian be not brave certainly be not for to say so though agree with physically be not equal see how people stare point at jethro must think have never seen race like ours with blue eye fair hair though even among there be varying shade of darkness noble upper class be lighter in hue than common people surprise of egyptian be indeed great at complexion of captive decoration of wall have handed down in painting still remain blue eye fair hair of rebu rejoicing upon return of king went on for several day at end of time captive be distributed by royal order be given to general who have most distinguished many be assigned to priest while great bulk be sent to labor upon public work rebu captive whose singular complexion fairness caused to be regarded with special interest be distributed among special favorite of king many of girl be assigned to queen royal princess others to wife of priest general who formed council of king men be for most part given to priest for service about temple to great delight amuba found that jethro be among eight captive who be assigned to service of priest of one of great temple be scarcely effect of chance for captive be drawn up in line number assigned to temple be marched off together in order that there might be picking choosing of captive that might be divided impartially between various temple a jethro always placed by amuba side naturally happened that fell to same destination on reaching temple little band of captive be again drawn up high priest ameres grave distinguished looking man walked along line scrutinizing beckoned to amuba to step forward henceforth said be servant behave well will be well treated again walked down line amuba saw that be going to choose threw on knee before will lord pardon boldness said may implore to choose yonder man who stood next beside have be friend from childhood covered with shield in battle have be father to since have lost own implore lord separate now will find willing to labor at whatsoever may give to do priest listened gravely will be a wish said be duty of man to give pleasure to around if lie in power a friend be man of thews sinew have frank honest face will assuredly suit a well a do therefore follow to house other captive saluted amuba a jethro turned to follow priest observed action said to lad be person of consequence among people that thus at parting salute rather than comrade who be older than be son of who be king amuba said fell in action with troop have not city be taken nation subdued by egyptian must have inherited throne be so priest said truly change fortune of life be strange wonder being son of king be not specially kept by thotmes think that knew not amuba said knew not custom fellow captive thought that possibly might be put to death be known be son of king therefore abstained from outward mark of respect indeed must to one who be slave like have be ridiculous perhaps be best so priest said thoughtfully must not have be injured for slay captive taken in war still maybe life will be easier to bear a servant of priest than in household of king have better however mention to one rank have borne for might be reported to king then might be sent for to palace unless indeed must rather be spectator of pomp gayety of court than servant in quiet household must far rather remain with lord amuba said eagerly have already shown kindness of heart by granting request choosing comrade jethro a fellow slave feel already that lot will be far happier one than have ventured to hope judge not hastily by appearance priest said at same time here in egypt slave be not treated a be among wild people of nubia desert there be law for who kill slave be punished a if took life of egyptian however think can say that life will not be hard one have intelligence a be shown by fact that have so rapidly acquired sufficient knowledge of tongue to speak intelligibly can too speak language asked jethro can speak little jethro said not nearly so well a amuba lip be too old to fashion strange tongue a rapidly a can younger one speak sufficiently well to understand priest said doubtless will in time acquire tongue perfectly be house priest entered imposing gateway on side of stretched long lofty wall at distance of fifty yard from gate stood large dwelling compared to royal abode amuba have be brought up in be miserable hut inclosed within wall be space of ground three hundred yard square be laid out a garden avenue of fruit tree ran round portion be laid out a vineyard while separated from rest by avenue of palm tree be vegetable garden in front of house be large piece of water in floated gayly painted boat aquatic plant of kind bordered edge graceful palm grouped foliage over broad flat leaf of lily floated on surface while white flower amuba have seen carried in religious procession by large number of people of upper rank heard be called lotus rose above two captive be struck with surprise admiration at beauty of scene forgot for moment that be slave a looked round at vegetation more beautiful than have ever beheld smile passed over countenance of priest perfect happiness be for man said yet methinks that may in time learn at least contentment here chapter iv easy servitude just a priest finished speaking lad of about same age a amuba appeared at portico of house ran down to father oh father exclaimed have brought two of strange captive home saw in procession marveled greatly at color of hair eye mysa particularly noticed lad whose hair be almost color of gold a usual chebron tongue outruns discretion youth understands enough egyptian to know what be saying be not courteous to speak of person characteristic to face lad flushed through olive cheek pardon said courteously to amuba did not think for moment one who have newly arrived among understood language apologize amuba replied with smile doubtless appearance be strange to indeed even among people of lydia persia there be few whose hair eye be a fair a ours even have said that did not like appearance must not have felt hurt for people think like to be accustomed in case be good of to say that regret what said people generally think that captive have feeling chebron apology be right father said among politeness be rule egyptian be taught to be considerate to people be just a easy to be polite a to be rude men be served better for love than for fear be to stay here father chebron asked have only brought for to day be to stay here son have chosen from set aside for temple selected younger because be about age be good for man to have one near who have be brought up with be attached to who although circumstance may not have made equal in condition can yet be comrade friend such hope will find in amuba for such tell be name have said whom circumstance have placed in inferior position for after circumstance be everything youth in own country held position even higher than do here for be son of king since father fell in battle must now be king of people have not be subjected to therefore chebron bear always in mind that although misfortune have placed captive among be in birth superior treat a must wish to be treated did fall captive into hand of hostile nation will gladly treat a friend young egyptian said frankly to amuba although be so different from in race can see in face that be true loyal besides added be sure that father must not have bade so trust have not read character be certain that will be fit friend for father be good amuba replied know how hard be lot of captive taken in war for rebu have many slave whom took in various expedition be prepared to suffer can judge then how grateful feel to god that have placed in hand so different from have looked for swear to chebron that will find faithful devoted to so too will find friend here who in difficulty must be far more able to render service than must be one of bravest warrior drove chariot in great battle fought with people saved life several time must need service of strong brave man jethro will be able to aid have be in battle chebron asked in surprise be first time have ever fought with men amuba said have often hunted lion be almost a terrible enemy a soldier be young to go to battle father naturally wished to take place early among fighting men of nation by way chebron ameres said must warn mention to one rank that amuba held in own country be known might be taken away from to serve in palace people who be taken captive with said nothing a to rank fearing ill might befall be known be therefore supposed that be of same rank a other captive who be men of noble birth among rebu therefore tell one not even mother sister mysa if there be secret to be kept fewer who know better while conversation have be going on amuba have be narrowly examining lad who have promised to treat a friend like father be fairer in complexion than majority of egyptian lighter hue being indeed almost universal among upper class be much shorter slighter than young rebu carried well have already in manner something of calm dignity that distinguished egyptian born to high rank be disfigured a amuba thought by custom general throughout egypt of having head smoothly shaven except one lock fell down over left ear a amuba afterward learned be distinguishing sign of youth must be shaved off when attained man estate married entered upon profession at present head be bare when went out wore close fitting cap with orifice through lock of hair passed out fell down to shoulder have not yet taken to custom general among upper middle class of wearing wig general shaving of head have to amuba most unpleasant effect until became accustomed to be adopted doubtless by egyptian for purpose of coolness cleanliness amuba thought that must rather spend amount of pain in keeping hair free from dust than go about in fantastic complicated wig that egyptian wore priest now led within house on passing through entrance entered large hall along side ran row of massive column supporting

went out fishing on nile when thus out together distinction of rank be altogether laid aside when in line be necessarily more marked a chebron must not take amuba with to house of many friend relative

conversion into wine to extract juice grape be heaped in large flat vat above rope be suspended dozen barefooted slave entered vat trod out grape using rope to lift in order that might drop with greater force upon fruit amuba have learned from chebron that although be going to enter priesthood a almost necessary preliminary for state employment be not intended to rise to upper rank of priesthood to become state official elder brother will doubt day succeed father a high priest of osiris told amuba know that father doe not think that be clever be not necessary to be very clever to serve in temple thought that of course too must come to high rank in priesthood for a know almost post be hereditary though brother a elder must be high priest must be one of chief priest also have not much taste that way rejoiced much when one day saying so to father replied at once that must not urge to devote life to priesthood for there be many other office of state must be open to in must serve country be useful to people almost post in service of state be indeed held by member of priestly family furnish governor to province not infrequently general to army said 'be by disposition fitted to spend life in ministering in temple be doubtless high honor happiness to do so for others more active life wider field of usefulness be more suitable engineer be wanted for canal irrigation work judge be required to make law respected obeyed diplomatist to deal with foreign nation governor for many people over whom rule therefore son if feel longing to spend life in service of temple by mean turn mind to study will fit to be officer of state be assured that can obtain for from king post in will be able to make first essay so if deserving rise to high advancement there be few priest during reign of thotmes iii who stood higher in opinion of egyptian people than ameres piety learning rendered distinguished among fellow be high priest in temple of osiris be one of most trusted of councilors of king have by heart law of sacred book be adept in inmost mystery of religion wealth be large used nobly lived in certain pomp state be necessary for position spent tithe of revenue rest distributed among needy if nile rose to higher level than usual spread ruin destruction among cultivator ameres be ready to assist distressed if rise of river be deficient always set example of remitting rent of tenant of broad land be ready to lend money without interest to tenant of harder more necessitous landlord yet among high priesthood ameres be regarded with suspicion even dislike be whispered among learned pious a be opinion of high priest be not in accordance with general sentiment of priesthood although performed punctiliously numerous duty of office took part in sacrifice procession of god yet lacked reverence for entertained notion widely at variance with of fellow ameres be in fact one of men who refuse to be bound by thought opinion of others to whom be necessity to bring own judgment to bear on question presented to father who have be high priest before for great office of egypt be for most part hereditary while have be delighted at thirst for knowledge enthusiasm for study in son have be frequently shocked at freedom with expressed opinion a step by step be initiated into sacred mystery already at introduction to priesthood ameres have mastered all there be to learn in geometry astronomy be skillful architect be deeply versed in history of nation have already be employed a supervisor in construction of canal irrigation work on property belonging to temple in respect father have reason to be proud of success have attained estimation in be held by fellow be only latitude allowed in consideration of religious question alarmed distressed father egyptian be most conservative of people for thousand of year change took place in constitution manner custom habit be fixed belief of egyptian that in respect country be superior to other law custom have approached perfection from highest to lowest be equally bound by king be more independent than peasant hour of rising manner in day must be employed very quantity quality of food must eat be rigidly dictated by custom be surrounded from youth by young men of own age son of priest chosen for virtue piety thus be freed from influence of evil adviser even have so wished have mean power of oppressing subject whose right privilege be a strictly defined a own in country then where man followed profession of father where from time immemorial everything have proceeded on precisely same line fact ameres son of high priest of osiris destined to succeed to dignity must entertain opinion differing even in slightest from held by leader of priesthood be sufficient to cause to be regarded with marked disfavor among be indeed only because piety benevolence be a remarkable a learning knowledge of science that be enabled at father death to succeed to office without opposition indeed even at time priest of higher grade must have opposed election ameres be a popular with lower class of priesthood a with people at large suffrage must have swamped of opponent multitude have indeed never heard so much a whisper against orthodoxy of high priest of osiris saw ever foremost in sacrifice procession knew that be indefatigable in service in temple that spare time be devoted to work of benevolence general utility a bent devoutly a passed through street little dreamed that high priest of osiris be regarded by chief brother a dangerous innovator yet be on one subject only that differed widely from order versed a be in innermost mystery have learned true meaning of religion of be one of chief minister be aware that osiris isi six other great god innumerable divinity whom egyptian worshiped under guise of deity with head of animal be in god at mere attribute of power wisdom goodness anger of one great god god so mighty that name be unknown that be only when of attribute be given individuality worshiped a god that must be understood by finite sense of man be known to ameres few who like have be admitted to inmost mystery of egyptian religion rest of population in egypt worshiped in truth in faith animal headed god animal sacred to yet a to animal there be consensus of opinion in one nome division of kingdom crocodile be sacred in be regarded with dislike ichneumon be supposed to be destroyer be deified in one goat be worshiped in eaten for food so be throughout whole of list of sacred animal be regarded with reverence indifference according to god who be looked upon a special tutelary deity of nome be opinion of ameres that knowledge confined only to initiated must be more widely disseminated without wishing to extend at present to ignorant mass of peasantry laborer thought that educated intelligent class of egypt must be admitted to understanding of real nature of god worshiped inner truth of religion be willing to admit that process must be gradual that must be necessary to enlarge gradually circle of initiated proposal be nevertheless received with dismay horror by colleague asserted that to allow others besides higher priesthood to become aware of deep mystery of religion must be attended with terrible consequence in first place must shake entirely respect reverence in priesthood be held must annihilate influence temple must be deserted losing faith now so steadfastly held in god people must soon cease to have religion at there be people urged on face of earth so moral so contented so happy so easily ruled a egyptian what must be did destroy belief launch upon sea of doubt speculation no longer must look up to who have so long be guide teacher whom regard a possessing knowledge wisdom infinitely beyond theirs must accuse of having deceived in blind fury destroy alike god minister idea of such thing be horrible ameres be silenced though not convinced felt indeed that there be much truth in view entertained of matter terrible consequence must almost certainly follow discovery by people that for thousand of year have be led by priest to worship a god who be god at saw that evil must arise from general enlightenment of people must outweigh benefit that must derive from discovery system have a colleague said worked well fact that people worshiped a actual deity imaginary being who be really representative of attribute of infinite god must not be said to have done actual harm at rate alone unaided must hing only with general consent of higher priesthood must circle of initiated be widened movement on part alone must simply bring upon disgrace death therefore after unburdening in council composed only of higher initiate held peace went on quiet tenor of way enlightened a be felt that did wrong to preside at sacrifice take part in service of god be worshiping not animal headed idol attribute personified felt pity for ignorant multitude who laid offering upon shrine yet felt that must shatter happiness instead of adding to be to know that deity worshiped be myth allowed wife daughter to join with priestess in service at temple in heart acknowledged that there be much in contention of who argued that spread of knowledge of inner mystery must not conduce to happiness of who received indeed must have shrunk from disturbing mind of wife daughter by informing that pious ministration in temple be offered to non existent god that sacred animal tended be in way more sacred than others save in be recognized shadow of attribute of unknown god eldest son be saw not of disposition to be troubled with problem gave so much subject for thought care must conduct service consciously well must bear respectable part when on accession to high priesthood became one of councilors of monarch have common sense imagination knowledge of inmost mystery must not disturb mind in slightest degree be improbable that even thought must ever cross mind that terrible deception practiced by enlightened upon whole people be anything right proper ameres saw however that chebron be altogether differently constituted be very intelligent be possessed of ardent thirst for knowledge of kind have also father habit of looking at matter from point of view of thinking for manner in ameres have superintended study taught to work with understanding to convince that rule precept be true before proceeding to next have developed thinking power altogether ameres saw that doubt filled own mind a to honesty even expediency of keeping whole people in darkness error must probably be felt with even greater force by chebron have determined therefore that lad must not work up through grade of priesthood to upper rank must after rising high enough to fit for official employment turn attention to one other of great department of state chapter v in lower egypt be going on journey ameres said to son few day after return from farm will take with chebron for be going to view progress of fresh canal be being made on estate in goshen officer who be superintending have doubt whether when sluice be opened will altogether fulfill purpose fear that mistake must have be made in level have already taught theory of work be well that must gain practical experience in for there be more useful honorable profession than of carrying out work by flood of nile be conveyed to thirsty soil thank father must like greatly chebron replied in tone of delight for have never before be far south of thebe may amuba go with yes be thinking of taking high priest said jethro can also go for take retinue with did consult own pleasure must far rather travel without state ceremony a functionary of state must conform to custom indeed even in goshen be a well always to travel in sort of state people there be of different race to ourselves although have dwelt long time in land conform to custom still be notoriously stubborn obstinate people there be more trouble in getting public work executed there than in other part of country have heard of father belong to same race a shepherd king who be such bitter tyrant to egypt how be that stayed behind when shepherd be driven out be of same race came not with formed part of conquering army shepherd who a know came from land lying to east of great sea have reigned here for long time when people came be relation of joseph who a have read in history be chief minister of egypt came here a slave be certainly brought from country whence oppressor came say that be not of race that forefather have come into land from country lying far to east know not suffice gained confidence of king became minister ruled wisely a far a king be concerned though people have little reason to bless memory in day be terrible famine say foretold coming that god gave warning of so vast granary be constructed filled to overflowing when famine came people be starving grain be served out in return people have to give up land thus whole tenure of land in country be changed became property of state people remaining a tenant upon land formerly owned then be that state granted large tract to temple others to military order so at present tiller of land pay rent to king temple military order thus be that army can always be kept up in serviceable order dwelling by ten of thousand in city assigned to thus be that royal treasury be always kept full service of temple maintained step have added to power dignity of nation have benefited cultivator by enabling vast work of irrigation to be carried out work must never have be accomplished have land be property of innumerable small holder with own petty interest said father that have not be for good of people have in one respect chebron for have drawn wide chasm between aristocratic class bulk of people who can never own land have stimulus to exertion be wholly ignorant father be peasant nothing more think might be something more chebron under other circumstance however be not question be discussing joseph brought family out of land at east of great sea land be given to in goshen settled there throve multiplied greatly partly because of remembrance of service joseph have rendered to state partly because be kindred people be held in favor a long a shepherd king ruled over when egypt rose shook off yoke have groaned under so long drove shepherd follower out of land people for have now so grown in number a to be in verity people remained behind have be naturally viewed with suspicion by be akin to late oppressor lying a land doe to east must open door to fresh army of invasion happily now that conquest have spread so far power of people eastward of great sea have be completely broken reason for distrust have died out joseph people be still viewed unfavorably prejudice take long to die out among mass manner in people cling together marrying only among keeping apart from give certain foundation for dislike exists personally think feeling be unfounded be industrious hard working though be own somewhat disposed to resist authority there be more difficulty in obtaining quota of men from goshen for execution of public work than from other of province of egypt do differ from in appearance father considerably chebron be somewhat fairer than be nose be more aquiline be physically stronger shave head a do generally let hair on face grow for long time after settlement believe that worshiped own god rather own god have long adopted religion surely must be wrong chebron said nation have god if people forsake own god be not likely that other god must care for a do for own people be difficult question chebron one be best for to leave alone at present will soon enter into lower grade of priesthood although if pas into upper grade will never know greater mystery will yet learn enough to enlighten to extent chebron be too well trained in respect due to parent to ask further question renewed subject with amuba a strolled in garden together afterward wonder how nation found out who be god who specially cared for amuba have idea amuba who have never given subject thought replied be always asking puzzling question chebron well must have be somehow chebron insisted do suppose that one ever saw god if not how do people know one have head of dog of cat what be like be god stronger than others because people offer sacrifice to god ask for help before going to battle be beaten be victorious win to day lose to morrow be that god be stronger one day than that care to help people sometimes why do not prevent temple from being burned image from being thrown down be very strange be very strange chebron be not long ago asking jethro nearly same question must give answer why do not ask father be one of wisest of egyptian have asked father will not answer chebron said thoughtfully think sometimes that be because have asked question that doe not wish to become high priest did not mean anything disrespectful to god somehow when want to know thing will not answer think look sadly a if be sorry at heart that must not tell want to know have ever asked brother neco oh neco be different chebron said with accent almost of disdain neco get into passion threatens with sort of thing can see know more about than do for have bewildered look in face when ask thing once twice have put hand to ear fairly run away a if be saying something altogether profane impious against god on following day high priest party started for goshen first portion of journey be performed by water craft be large one with pavilion of carved wood on deck two mast with great sail of many color cunningly worked together person of consequence traveling in way be generally accompanied by at least two three musician playing on harp trumpet pipe for egyptian be passionately fond of music feast be thought complete without band to discourse soft music while be going on instrument be of most varied kind stringed instrument predominated varied in size from tiny instrument resembling zither to harp much larger than used in modern time in addition to have trumpet of many form reed instrument cymbal drum last named long narrow in shape ameres however although not averse to music after evening meal be of too practical character to care for at other time considered that be too often excuse for doing nothing thinking of nothing therefore dispensed with except on state occasion a floated down river explained to son various object passed told manner in fisherman in high boat made of wooden plank bound together by rush in smaller craft shaped like punt formed entirely of papyrus bound together with band of same plant caught fish pointed out entrance to various canal explained working of gate admitted water gave history of various temple town village named many waterfowl basking on surface of river told of habit how be captured by fowler pointed out great tomb to told by whom be built largest son be monument of pride folly greatest of pyramid be built by king who thought must immortalize so terrible be labor that construction inflicted upon people that caused to be execrated be never laid in mausoleum have built for see custom of judging king after death be not without advantage after king be dead people be gathered together question be put to have dead monarch ruled well if reply with assenting shout be buried in fitting tomb have probably prepared for successor raise to if answer be that have reigned ill sacred rite in honor be omitted mausoleum have raised stand empty forever there be few indeed of king who have thus merited execration of people for a rule careful manner in be brought up surrounded by youth chosen for piety learning fact that like meanest of subject be bound to respect law of land act a sufficient check upon there be doubt that knowledge that after death must be judged by people exercise wholesome restraint even upon most reckless long to see pyramid chebron said be built of brick stone for have be told that surface be so smooth shiny that look a if cut from single piece be built of vast block of stone of employed labor of many hundred of men to transport from quarry where be cut be work of slave of people at large vast number of slave captured in war labored at priest replied numerous a be be wholly insufficient for work well nigh people of egypt be forced to leave home to labor at so great be burden distress that even now builder of pyramid be never spoken of save with curse rightly so for what might not have be done with same labor usefully employed why number of canal in country might have be doubled fertility of soil vastly increased vast tract might have be reclaimed from marsh willow lake produce of land might have be doubled what splendid temple might have be raised chebron said enthusiastically doubtless son priest said quietly after slight pause though be meet right that temple of god will be worthy of still a hold that god love egypt rejoice in prosperity of people think that might have preferred so vast improvement a work speak of must have effected in condition of people even to raising of long avenue of sphinx gorgeous temple in own honor yes one must think so chebron said thoughtfully yet father be always taught that highest duty be to pay honor to god that in way can money be so well spent a in raising fresh temple adding to beauty of exist highest duty be assuredly to pay honor to god chebron how honor can be paid most acceptably be deeper question be great deal too young to enter upon will be time enough for to do year hence there do see that temple standing on right bank of river be where stop for night messenger will have prepared for coming will be in readiness for a approached temple saw number of people gathered on great stone step reaching down to water edge strain of music be heard on landing ameres be greeted with greatest respect by priest bowing to ground while of inferior order knelt with face to earth did not raise until have passed on a soon a entered temple procession be formed priest bearing sacred vessel symbol of god walked before to altar band of unseen musician struck up processional air priestess maiden also carrying offering emblem followed ameres naturally took principal part in sacrifice at altar cutting throat of victim making offering of part specially set aside for god after ceremony be concluded procession moved in order a far a house of chief priest here again saluted ameres who entered followed by son attendant banquet be already in readiness to ameres sat down with principal priest while chebron be conducted to apartment prepared for where food from high table be served to amuba rest of suit of high priest be served in apartment a soon a chebron have finished joined amuba let slip away said feasting will go on for hour then there will be music far on into night father will be heartily tired of for love plain food think that priest must eat none other still a must not be polite for guest to remark upon viand set before know that will go through have heard say that be one of greatest trial of position that whenever travel people seem to think that feast must be prepared for whereas know must rather sit down to dish of boiled lentil water than have richest dish set before be going to be like journey amuba asked oh know that way down river will rest at temple for did father not do so priest must regard a slight then leave boat journey in chariot bullock cart when reach goshen will live in little house father have have constructed for where will have more fuss ceremony than do at own farm then will be occupied with affair of estate in work of irrigation although will be with when journey about a be to begin to learn duty of superintendent expect will have plenty of time for amusement sport strolled for hour two on bank of river for moon be shining brightly many boat be passing up down latter drifted with stream for wind be so light that sail be scarce filled former kept close to bank be either propelled by long pole towed by party of men on bank when returned to house listened for time to music then retired to room amuba lay down upon soft couch made of layer of bulrush covered with thick woollen cloth rested head on pillow of bulrush jethro have bound up for for neither of rebu have learned to adopt egyptian fashion of using stool for pillow stool be long somewhat curved in middle to fit neck for common people be roughly made of wood smoothed where head came head stool of wealthy be constructed of ebony cedar other scarce wood beautifully inlaid with ivory amuba have made several trial of head stool have not once succeeded in going to sleep with one under head hour sufficing to cause such aching of neck that be glad to take to pillow of rush to be accustomed indeed to sleep upon stool pillow be necessary to lie upon side with arm so placed a to raise head to exact level of stool a amuba have be accustomed to throw down sleep on back other position in first lay for be generally thoroughly tired either in hunting by exercise of arm found cramped fixed position necessary for sleeping with hard stool absolutely intolerable for week journey down river continued then arrived at memphis where remained for day ameres passed time in ceremonial visit in taking part in sacrifice in temple chebron amuba visited temple public building one day went out to inspect great pyramid attended by jethro surpasses anything have seen jethro said a stood at foot of great pyramid of cheops what wonderful structure what frightful waste of human labor be marvelous indeed amuba said what wealth power monarch must have have to raise colossal pile thought said chebron that king be bound by law a well a other people if so how must king have exacted such terrible toil labor from subject a must have cost king must be bound by law chebron replied there be so powerful haughty that tyrannize over people cheops be one of father have be telling that ground down people to build wonderful tomb for have reward for at funeral have to be judged by public voice public condemned a bad tyrannous king therefore be not allowed to be buried in great tomb that have built for know not where remains rest huge pyramid stand a eternal monument of failure of human ambition greatest costliest tomb in world without occupant save theliene one of queen be buried here in chamber near destined for king people did well jethro said heartily must have done better still have risen against cut off head directly understood labor be setting to do on leaving memphis one more day journey be made by water next morning party started by land ameres rode in chariot be similar in form to used for war except that side be much higher forming sort of deep open box against standing in must rest body amuba chebron traveled in wagon drawn by two ox rest of party went on foot at end of two day arrived at destination house be small one compared to great mansion near thebe be built on similar plan high wall surrounded inclosure of quarter of acre in center stood house with one large apartment for general purpose small bedchamber

game have become well nigh extinct while a for fowling there be none of to be have in upper egypt while here in marsh bird abound superintendent promised that suitable men must be forthcoming one of caste for in egypt men always followed occupation of father branch of trade be occupied by men forming distinct caste who married only in own caste worked just a father have done before did not dream of change elevation thus fowler knew nothing about catching fish fisherman of fowling however knew something about hunting for slaying of hyena carried off young lamb kid from village great river horse came out devastated field be part of business of villager country where now be be for most part well cultivated watered by canal be filled when nile be high day journey to north lay lake menzaleh great willow lagoon stretched away to great sea from be separated only by narrow bank of sand canal of nile reached nearly to edge of when river rose above usual height threatened to inundate country beyond usual limit to injure instead of benefiting cultivator great gate at end of canal must be opened water find way into lagoon there be too connection between of lower arm of nile lake so that water although salt be le so than of sea lake be abode of innumerable waterfowl of kind swarmed also with fish lake formed fringe along whole of northern coast of egypt be from swampy land near mouth of nile that greater portion of fowl fish formed important item in food of egyptian be drawn to southeast lay chain of lake whose water be more salt than of sea be said that in olden time have be connected by water with great sea to north southern sea even now when south wind blew strong water of southern sea be driven up gulf with force salt water flowed into lake timsah so called because swarmed with crocodile will be busy for day to begin with ameres said to son on evening of arrival will therefore be good opportunity for to see something of various branch of sport be to be enjoyed in part of egypt steward will place men at disposal can take with amuba jethro will see that there be slave to carry provision tent for will be necessary for much of sport that rise early not improbably may have to sleep close at hand in morning chebron have interview with steward who told that have arranged plan for expedition will find little about here lord said beyond such game a must obtain near thebe day journey to north will be near margin of lake there will get sport of kind can at will fish in water snare waterfowl hunt great river horse in swamp chase hyena in low bush on sandhills have ordered to be in readiness in hour slave with provision will be ready to start hunter of part of country will be of little use to so have ordered one of chief men to accompany will see that when arrive obtain men skilled in sport acquainted with locality habit of wild creature there lord father said must probably be away for week that on return must from time to time have day hunting in part thought that a time will be more occupied then be better that must make distant expedition to begin with hour later twenty slave drew up before house carrying on head provision tent other necessary horse be provided for chebron decided that must walk with amuba there be advantage in going on horse said when have to move at pace of footman possibly may find something to shoot on way leader of party upon hearing chebron decision told that doubtless when left cultivated country extended few mile further north game must be found six dog accompanied four of be powerful animal kept for chase of more formidable beast hyena lion for although there be lion in flat country abounded in broken ground at foot of hill to south other two be much more lightly built be capable of

than be accustomed to at thebe where hill inclosed plain on city be built cut off much of air seemed to reflect sun ray down upon that walk be pleasant one chebron amuba carrying bow walked along chatting gayly at head of party jethro rabah foreman came next then followed two slave leading dog in leash ready to be slipped at moment notice while carrier followed in rear occasionally passed through scattered village where woman came to door to look at stranger where generally offering of milk fruit be made to men be for most part at work in field be stout looking race stronger more bony than own people chebron remarked to leader of party be stubborn to deal with replied till ground well pay portion of produce without grumbling when extra labor be asked of there be sure to be trouble be easier to manage thousand egyptian peasant than hundred of israelite if forced labor be required for public service be always necessary to bring down troop before can obtain indeed be hardly treated fairly have suffered much arrived in egypt during reign of usertuen have land allotted to during reign of king other successor of dynasty be held in favor multiplied greatly when theban dynasty succeeded that of memphis king finding foreign people settled here seeing that be related by origin to shepherd tribe who at various time have threatened country from east have even conquered portion of occupied for long period regarded with hostility have treated rather a prisoner of war than a portion of people many burden have be laid upon have have to give far more than fair share of labor toward public work making of brick erection of royal tomb pyramid be strange that shave head a do people chebron said amuba laughed jethro be different with chebron replied labor get dust of soil in hair besides do keep cut quite short still think must be more comfortable if followed fashion be matter of habit amuba replied to when first came here sight of poorer people going about with head shaven be quite repulsive a for comfort surely one own hair must be more comfortable than great wig that of better class wear keep off sun chebron said when one be out of door be seldom worn in house then when one come in one can wash off dust can wash dust out of hair amuba said still do think that israelite wear hair inconveniently long yet long plait that woman wear down back be certainly graceful woman be fair comely chebron shook head may be fair amuba must think must make very troublesome wife lack altogether subdued submissive look of woman must must say have opinion of own not be submissive to lord be that not so rabah woman like men have spirit fire foreman answered have much voice in domestic matter know that have more than with can certainly use tongue for at time when soldier have be here to take away gang of men for public work have have more trouble with than with men latter be sullen know that must submit woman gather at little distance scream curse abuse at

in hollow be patch of cultivated ground rabah now ordered slave leading two fleet dog to keep close up be in readiness to slip may see deer at time now said abound in sandy desert form shelter yet be within easy distance of field where when such vegetation a be here fails can go for food few minute later deer started from clump of bush dog be instantly let slip started in pursuit hurry on hundred yard take position on mound rabah exclaimed to chebron while at same time signaled to slave behind to stop dog know duty will see will presently drive stag within shot chebron called amuba to follow ran forward by time reached mound stag be far away with dog laboring in pursuit at present seemed to have gained little if at upon be soon hidden from sight among sandhills in spite of assurance of rabah lad have doubt whether dog must ever drive quarry back to spot where be standing be full quarter of hour before pursuer pursued came in sight again pace have greatly fallen off for one of dog be twenty yard behind stag other be out on flank at about same distance away be evidently aiding in turning toward spot where boy be standing will shoot together chebron said will come within fifty yard of waited until stag be abreast of dog on flank have now fallen back to side of companion a if to leave stag clear for arrow of hunter lad fired together just a stag be abreast be running faster than have allowed for arrow flew behind uttered exclamation of disappointment before deer have run twenty yard gave sudden leap into air fell over jethro have crept up taken post behind bush to left of clump in readiness to shoot must others miss arrow have brought stag to ground well done jethro amuba shouted be so long since be out hunting seem to have lost skill matter not since have brought down dog stood quiet beside deer be struggling on ground being too well trained to interfere with jethro ran out cut throat others be soon standing beside be of specie smaller than to deer of europe belong with two long straight horn will make useful addition to fare to night rabah said although perhaps of other sort be better eating do dog never pull down by amuba asked very seldom two be particularly fleet doubt whether must have caught deer can run for long time although will let dog gain upon can leave if choose still have known couple run down deer when must not succeed in driving within bowshot know very well ought not to do so for of course deer be of use for food unless animal be properly killed blood allowed to escape several other stag be startled escaped dog being too fatigued with first run to be able to keep up with other dog be therefore unloosed allowed to range about country started several hyena of killed others brought to bay until lad ran up dispatched with arrow while others took to flight in sufficient time got safely away for hyena unless overtaken just at start can run long swiftly tire out heavy dog such a party have with after walking fifteen mile lad stopped suddenly on brow of sandhill in front of be wide expanse of water bordered by band of vegetation long rush aquatic plant formed band by water edge while here there hut with patch of cultivated ground dotted country be at end of journey rabah said hut be chiefly inhabited by fowler fisherman will encamp at foot of mound be better for not to go too near margin of water for air be not salubrious to unaccustomed to best hunting ground lie few mile to left for there when river be high flood come down through valley be at time wet marshy there may expect to find game of kind in abundance chapter vi fowling fishing tent be made of light cloth intended to keep off night dew rather than to afford warmth be soon pitched fire be lighted with fuel have be brought with in order to save time in searching for rabah went off to search for fish fowl returned in hour with peasant carrying four duck several fine fish will do now said with stag larder be complete everything meat have brought with chebron although have kept on bravely be fatigued with walk be glad to throw down on sand enjoy prospect to be new one for have never before seen so wide expanse of water when on top of hill have made out faint dark line in distance rabah told be bank of sand separated lake from great sea now from present position be invisible nothing wide expanse of water stretching away until seemed to touch sky met view here there be dotted with dark patch be rabah told clump of waterfowl in willow water near margin be quarter of mile away must see vast number of wading bird white crane white black ibis while number of other waterfowl looking like black speck moved about briskly among sometimes with loud cry number must rise on wing make off in straight line across water circle round settle again when found that alarm be groundless be lovely be not exclaimed to amuba who be standing beside leaning on bow looking over water amuba did not reply immediately chebron looking up saw that there be tear on cheek what be amuba asked anxiously be nothing chebron sight of wide water take thought homeward city stood on sea like not so large a say be great sea be looking at far too large for eye to see across be just such view a looked upon daily from wall of palace save that shore be higher maybe will see again day amuba chebron said gently amuba shook head fear chance be small indeed chebron jethro have talked over hundred of time on route hither have determined that if fell into hand of harsh master must at hazard try day to make escape journey be long must lie through country subject to egypt people of land to be passed over speak language strange to must be well nigh impossible to make journey in safety still must have tried a be be well contented with lot must be mad indeed to forsake on slender chance of finding way back to land of rebu where indeed even if reached might not be well received for who know what king may now be reigning there if must get away be sure of arriving there safely must exchange comfort of civilized country like egypt for life such a have described to among own people there can be doubt chebron that life here be far more luxurious that be far more civilized than rebu by side of palace house be hut be ignorant even of reading writing pile of rush for bed rough table stool constitute furniture perhaps after one be not really happier for thing have may have more enjoyment have greater care suppose man love own country best think that can love ours a much a do in first place have be settled there few generation large number of people constantly moving west either by joining with one of people who push past from far east beside wherever went must take country with build house like left behind live by chase fishing in one place a while egyptian must nowhere find country like egypt suppose be people more than country familiar language familiar face way grant freely that egyptian be far greater people than more powerful more learned master of many art owner of many comfort luxury yet one longs sometimes for one free life among rebu one thing be amuba be prince there be not here have be common man born to labor to toil to fight at bidding of king might perhaps find that life even of egyptian peasant be easier more pleasant than yours be may be amuba said thoughtfully yet think that very poorest among be far freer more independent than richest of egyptian peasant did not grovel on ground when king passed along be open to if be braver than fellow to rise in rank must fish hunt till ground fashion arm a chose life be not tied down by usage custom be man poor one perhaps half savage one if will be man while egyptian peasant free a may be in name be very slave of law custom see that meal be ready have grand appetite so have amuba be almost worth while walking long way for sake of appetite one get at end meal be excellent one one of slave who have be brought be adept at cooking fish bird venison be alike excellent for once vegetable formed so large portion of ordinary egyptian repast be neglected what be going to do to morrow rabah chebron asked after meal be concluded have arranged for to morrow if such be pleasure lord that will go fowling boat will take along lake to point about three mile off where best sport be to be have then when day be over will carry on eight mile to place spoke to of where good sport be to be obtained will meet on landing there will have everything in readiness for will do well chebron said amuba jethro will of course come with a soon a be daylight rabah led chebron down to lake lad with amuba jethro entered boat be constructed of rush covered with pitch drew only two three inch of water two men with long pole be already in boat be fowler by profession skilled in various device by waterfowl be captured have during night be preparing boat for expedition by fastening rush round lower end of dipped into water upper end be six foot above rush be so thickly placed together a to form impenetrable screen boat be square at stern here only be there opening few inch wide in rush to enable boatman standing there to propel boat with pole one of men took station here other at bow where peered through little opening between rush directed comrade in stern a to course must take in bottom of boat lay two cat who knowing that part be presently to come watched be being done with air of intelligent interest basket well stored with provision jar of wine be placed on board boat then pushed noiselessly off parting reed with finger peeping out boy saw that boat be not making out into deeper part of lake be skirting edge keeping only few yard out from band of rush at margin do keep distance way chebron asked man with pole man nodded a long a be close to rush waterfowl notice approach while be to push out into middle might take alarm although often do capture in way in case get to windward of flock want to reach then drift down slowly upon will get more sport now by keeping close in bird be numerous will soon be at work in five minute man at bow motioned passenger that be approaching flock of waterfowl of took up bow arrow stood in readiness while man in stern used pole even more quickly silently than before presently at signal from comrade ceased poling round boat there be slight sound low contented quackings fluttering of wing a bird raised shook water from back parting rush in front of two lad jethro peeped through be right in middle of flock of wildfowl who be feeding without thought of danger from clump of rush in midst arrow be already in notch rush be parted little further three shaft be loosed twang of bow startled duck stopping feeding gazed at rush with head on one side three more arrow glanced out time one of bird aimed at be wounded only uttering cry of pain terror flapped along surface of water illustration c of b fowling with throwing stick page instantly with wild cry of alarm whole flock arose before have fairly settled in flight two more fell pierced with arrow cat have be standing on alert a cry of alarm be given leaped overboard from stern proceeded to pick up dead duck among be included that have at first flown away for have dropped in water about fifty yard from boat dozen time same scene be repeated until three score duck goose lay in bottom of boat by time party have have enough of sport have indeed lost greater part of arrow a failed to strike bird aimed at went far down into deep mud at bottom must not be recovered now let men show skill with throwing stick chebron said will see will do better with than with arrow men at once turned boat head toward patch of rush growing from willow water hundred yard out in lake number of duck goose be feeding round whole rush be in movement from swimming feeding among for plant be just at time in seed bird be too much occupied to mark approach of fresh clump of rush men have removed screen from side of boat furthest from bird now stood in readiness holding dozen stick about two foot long made of curved crooked wood when close to bird boat be swung round at once with deafening cry bird rose a did so men with great rapidity hurled stick one after among last being directed at bird feeding among rush be not able to rise a rapidly a companion lad be astonished at effect produced by simple missile so closely packed be bird stick after striking one whirled twisted among others one missile frequently bringing down three four bird cat be in instant at work flapping noise be prodigious for although many of bird be killed outright others struck in wing leg be slightly injured made off along surface of water others succeeded in getting up flying away greater part be either killed by cat knocked on head by pole of two fowler altogether twenty seven bird be added to store in boat put arrow to shame altogether amuba chebron said have always heard that fowler on lake be very skilled with throwing stick of theirs must not have believed possible that two men must in so short space have effected slaughter then have idea of enormous quantity of bird on lake jethro be examining stick a well a duck have be retrieved by cat be curious thing said to amuba be thinking before men used that straight stick must be much better be wondering why chose curved wood have doubt now shape have something to do with see a men threw gave strong spinning motion seems secret of action be wonderful to see how whirled about among fowl striking one on head on leg on wing until happened to hit one plump on body seemed to stop be sure one of stick kept eye fixed on must have knocked down six bird will practice with thing if ever get back home will teach use to people there be almost a many waterfowl on sea a there be here have seen almost black with down at southern end where be bordered by swamp reed covered marsh how do catch there jethro chebron asked net in decoy sometimes wade out among with head hidden among floating bough so get near enough to seize by leg pull under water in way man will catch score of before comrade be wiser catch same way here one of fowler who have be listening remarked weave little bower just large enough for head shoulder to go into leave three four of floating about for day near spot where mean to work wild fowl get accustomed to after that can easily go among capture number must think fowling must be good trade chebron said be good enough at time man replied duck be not here year long legged bird be always to be found here in number duck be uncertain so be goose at certain time in year leave altogether say go across great sea to north others that go far south into nubia then even when be here be uncertain sometimes be thick here then again there be scarce one to be seen hear be swarming on lake further to west of course wading bird be of use for food so see when duck goose be scarce have hard time of then again even when have got boat load have long way to take to market when weather be hot may get spoiled before can sell price be so low in part when flock be here that be hard to lay by enough money to keep family during slack time if great city thebe memphis lay near to must be different must consume must catch must get better price unless under very favorable circumstance there be hope of fowl keeping good during long passage up river to thebe in fact be not for decoy must starve in of course take alive send in basket to thebe in way get fair price for what sort of decoy do use jethro asked many kind man replied sometimes arch over rush tie together at top so a to form long passage over little channel among rush then strew corn over water place near entrance duck be trained to swim about outside until flock come near then enter passage feeding others follow there be sort of door can push aside easily a pas up can not open on return be sort of decoy use in country jethro said way fowler went on be to choose spot where rush form thick screen twenty yard deep along bank then light net two three hundred foot long be pegged down on to shore behind thrown over top of rush reaching to within foot two of water here be rolled up so that when be shaken out will go down into water then two men stand among rush at end of net while go out far on to lake in boat when see flock of duck swimming near shore pole boat toward not so rapidly a to frighten into taking flight enough so to attract attention cause uneasiness go backward forward gradually approaching shore of course managing so a to drive toward point where net be when be opposite close in faster duck swim in among rush directly be in men at end of net shake down rolled up part then whole flock be prisoner after that fowler have only to enter rush take a try to fly upward be stopped by net with luck two three catch can be made in day thousand duck sometimes double that number can be captured then be put into flat basket just high enough for to stand in with head out through opening at top so put on board boat taken up nile yes have often seen basket taken out of boat chebron said thought how cruel be to pack so closely how do feed for must often be fortnight on way trader who have bought of other fowler wait until have got enough together to freight large craft for must not pay to work upon small scale accompanies up river feed regularly with little ball made of moistened flour just in same way that do at establishment in upper egypt where raise fowl stuff for market if boat be large one be taking up forty fifty thousand fowl of course take two three boy to help for be light matter to feed number must have little water a well a meal seems strange to here where fowl be so abundant that people must raise feed just a if be bullock suppose be true be quite true chebron replied amuba went to one of great breeding farm two three month ago there be two sort one where hatch other where fat one went to embraced branch be unusual from hatching place collector go round to people who keep fowl for mile round bring in egg beside buy from others at greater distance egg be placed on sand laid on floor of low chamber be heated by mean of flue from fire underneath requires great care to keep temperature exactly right of course men who pas life at work can regulate exactly know by feel just what be heat at egg must be kept there be eight ten such chamber in place visited so that two three day one other of hatch out be ready for fresh egg to be put down people who send egg come in at proper time receive number of chicken in proportion to egg have sent one chicken being given for two egg hatchers give more le what remain over be payment for work so see have to be very careful about hatching if can hatch ninety chicken out of hundred egg pay very well if owing to heat being too great too little only twenty thirty out of hundred be raised have to make good loss of course always put in great many of egg have bought be thus able to give right number to customer even if egg have not turned out well that remain after proper number have be given to farmer breeder sell to to others being part of business to bring up chicken fattening business be quite different at place there be long row of little box piled up on other into wall five foot high door of of box have hole in through fowl can put head with little sort of shutter close down on fowl be placed in box then attendant go around two together one carry basket filled with little ball of meal other lift shutter a fowl put head out catch by neck make open beak with other hand push ball of meal down throat be so skillful that operation take scarce moment then go on to next so on down long row until have fed last of under charge then begin again afresh why do keep in dark fowler asked told that did because in dark be not restless slept time between meal then time flap be lifted think be daylight pop out head at once to see in about ten day get quite fat plump be ready for market seems wonderful deal of trouble fowler said suppose a have fine market close at hand can get good price pay seems more reasonable to than hatching business why must not let fowl hatch own egg be more than can imagine fowl will lay vastly greater number of egg than will hatch chebron said well fed fowl must lay two hundred fifty egg in year left to herself will not hatch more than two brood of fifteen egg in thus see a pay peasant much better to rear fowl than to sell egg be to profit to send egg to hatching place so to get hundred twenty five chicken year instead of thirty suppose doe fowler agreed here be lord at end of journey there be point where be to land servant who hired be standing there in readiness for hope that be satisfied with day sport chebron said have be greatly pleased in few minute boat reached landing place where rabah be awaiting one of fowler carrying dozen of finest fowl have killed accompanied to spot rabah have chosen for encampment like last stood at foot of sandhills few hundred yard from lake be place where be going to hunt near here be chebron first question lord be two mile away in accordance with order last night have arranged for to fish to morrow in afternoon will move tent mile nearer to country where will hunt be best not to go too close for near edge of great swamp air be unhealthy to who be not accustomed to long to get at hunting chebron said be better a say to have day fishing first for work must seem tame after excitement of hunting river horse will be glad of dinner a soon a can get for although have done justice to food put on board be quite ready again twelve hour of fresh air from sea give one appetite of hyena everything be already in readiness lord thought better not to wait for game brought home will do well to morrow so purchased fish fowl from peasant a have seen boat for last two three hour be able to calculate time of arrival thus have everything in readiness dinner be similar to on previous day except that hare took place of venison change for better a hare be delicacy much appreciated by egyptian following day be spent in fishing for purpose long net be used method be precisely similar to in use in modern time one end of net be fastened to shore net being coiled up in boat be rowed out into lake fisherman paying out net a went circuit be then made back to shore where men seized two end of net hauled to land capturing fish inclosed within sweep after seeing two three haul made lad went with jethro on board boat be provided by fisherman with long two pronged spear boat be then quietly rowed along edge of rush where water be deeper than usual be however so clear that must see to bottom with spear struck at fish swimming there at first be uniformly unsuccessful a be ignorant that allowance must be made for diffraction be puzzled at finding that spear instead of going straight down at fish struck at seemed to bend off at angle at water edge fisherman however explained to that allowance must be made for allowance being greater greater distance fish be from boat that be only when lay precisely under that must strike directly at even after being instructed in matter succeeded poorly presently laid down spear contented with watching boatman who rarely failed in striking bringing up prey aimed at presently attention be attracted to four boat containing from six to eight men two have come from direction when neared other volley of abuse be exchanged between occupant what be about chebron asked a two fisherman laid by spear with face full of excitement turned round to watch boat boat come from two village lord between at present there be feud arising out of fishing net be carried away sent regular challenge to other few day since a be custom here champion be going to fight out see number of men on one side be equal to on other boat be about same size amuba jethro looked on with great interest for have seen painted on wall representation of fight between boatman be of common occurrence egyptian being very combative race fierce feud being often carried on for long time between neighboring village men be armed with pole ten foot in length about inch half in diameter favorite weapon on occasion of kind boat have now come in close contact furious battle at once commenced clattering of stick heavy thud of blow shout of combatant creating clamor caused waterfowl within circle of mile to fly screaming away across lake men used heavy weapon with considerable ability greater part of blow being warded off many however took effect of combatant being knocked into water others fell prostrate in boat while dropped long stave after disabling blow on arm be marvelous that kill other jethro said surely shaving of head amuba have always struck a being very peculiar have us for must tend to thicken skull for surely head of other men must have borne such blow without being crushed like water jar that there be certainly ground for jethro supposition be proved by fact that herodotus long afterward writing of desperate conflict between villager of egypt asserted that skull be thicker than of other people most of men who fell into water scrambled back into boat renewed fight sank immediately be seen no more at last when fully men on side have be put hors de combat four five having be killed drowned boat separated advantage resting with party still shouting defiance jeer at other men poled in direction of respective village be such desperate fight a common chebron asked fisherman yes there be often quarrel one of replied quietly resuming fishing a if nothing out of ordinary way have taken place if be water side village champion fight in boat a have seen if not equal party meet at spot halfway between village decide on foot sometimes fight with short stick hand being protected by basket hilt while on left arm piece of wood extending from elbow to tip of finger be fastened on by strap serving a shield more usually fight with long pole call neboot be fine weapon jethro said guard head with admirably sliding hand far apart if be back again amuba must like to organize regiment of men armed with weapon must need that part used a guard must be covered with light iron to prevent sword ax from cutting through with addition must make splendid weapon footman armed with sword shield must find hard indeed to repel assault by drawback must be amuba observed that man must require so much room to wield weapon that must stand far apart must be opposed to three four swordsman in enemy line be true amuba have certainly hit upon weak point in use of such weapon for single combat fighting of broken rank must be grand when get back to thebe if can find peasant who can instruct in use of neboots will certainly learn ought to make fine player one of fisherman said looking at jethro powerful figure must not like crack on head from neboot in hand sun be getting low have best be moving to point where be to disembark have have capital day rabah chebron said when reached new encampment hope that rest will turn out a successful think can promise that will lord have be making inquiry among villager find that swamp in river bed abounds with hippopotamus how do hunt on foot lord there be enough water in river bed for flat boat made of bundle of rush to pas up while in many place be deep pool in animal lie during heat of day be ferocious animal amuba asked have never yet seen one for though say that be common in upper nile a well a found in swamp like at mouth there be none anywhere in neighborhood of thebe suppose that there be too much traffic for that be afraid of showing in such water there must be food for rabah said be found only in swamp like in place on upper nile where river be willow bordered with aquatic plant on whose root principally live be timid creature be found only in little frequented place when struck generally try to make escape for although occasionally will rush with enormous mouth open at boat tear in piece kill hunter very seldom happens a rule try only to fly must be cowardly beast jethro said scornfully must rather hunt animal be ever so small will make fight for life however will see upon following morning started for scene of action exclamation of surprise broke from simultaneously when on ascending sandhill saw before plain mile wide extending at foot be covered with rush other aquatic plant extended south a far a eye must see for one month in year rabah said be river for eleven be little more than swamp though willower boat can make way up many mile little water always find way down from nile from canal be one of few place of northern egypt where river horse be still found none be allowed to hunt unless be of sufficient rank to obtain permission of governor of province steward wrote for obtained a soon a knew by letter from father that be accompanying must desire to have sport be there crocodile there amuba asked many rabah replied although few be now found in lake people here be not like of theban zone who hold in high respect here regard a dangerous enemy kill without mercy chapter vii hippopotamus crocodile guided by rabah party now descended to edge of swamp here in willow water lay three boat rather raft constructed of bundle of bulrush be turned up in front so a to form sort of swan necked bow in outline be exactly similar to iron of modern skate upon stood native with pole for pushing raft along three four spear be of unusual shape lad examined with curiosity have broad short blade be loosely attached to shaft so that when animal be struck shaft must drop out leaving head imbedded in flesh to head be attached cord be wound up on spindle passing through handle raft look a if must carry three chebron said will do so at push man replied be better with two only will stop onshore with permission chebron jethro said see there be number of men here with rope suppose have something to do with business will accompany rope be for hauling beast ashore after have struck well will go help pull can do share at must be of use on one of little raft indeed think that weight must bury under water have be out morning lord boatman said addressing chebron have found out that there be river horse lying in pool mile up river think be large one will give good sport chebron amuba now took place on two raft men laying down spear taking pole pushed off from shore noiselessly made way among rush sometimes channel be so narrow that reed almost brushed raft on side then opened out into wide pool here water deepened so much that pole must scarce bottom not word be spoken a men have warned that slightest noise must scare hippopotamus cause to sink to bottom of pool where must be difficult to capture after hour poling reached pool larger than that have hitherto passed extending on one side almost to bank of river man on raft now signed to chebron to take up one of spear lad shook head motioned to to undertake attack for felt ignorant a be of habit of animal must be folly for to engage in such adventure man nodded for have indeed be doubting a to course affair must take for needed thrust with very powerful arm to drive spear through thick hide of hippopotamus amuba imitated chebron example preferring to be spectator instead of actor in unknown sport for three four minute boat lay motionless then blowing sound be heard boatman pointed to what seemed to boy two lump of black mud projecting inch two above water near margin of rush must not have believed that formed part of animal that slight ripple widening out on glassy water showed that there have be movement at spot indicated with noiseless push chebron hunter sent boat in direction then handed end of pole to chebron signing to to push boat back when gave signal when within ten yard of two little black patch there be sudden movement widened into enormous head huge beast rose to foot startled at discovery have just made that men be close at hand in instant hunter hurled spear with force tough a be animal sharp head cut way through with roar beast plunged into rush shaft of spear falling out of socket a did so strong cord ran out rapidly from reel held by hunter presently strain ceased have laid down again in shelter hunter said will now follow give second spear pushing rush aside boat be forced along until again caught sight of hippopotamus be standing up to belly in water be going to charge chebron asked grasping spear there be little chance of must do so upset boat throw among rush lie there with only face above water will divert attention come back get into boat when have made off spear be thrown with good effect there be roar great splash chebron thought that animal be upon turned off dashed back to pool where have be first lying thought be what must do hunter said always seek shelter in bottom of deep pool here see water be not deep enough to cover boat again followed hippopotamus amuba be still on raft on pool what have become of chebron asked a passed beyond rush have sunk to bottom of pool amuba replied gave start can tell heard bursting through rush then rushed out with mouth open mouth like cavern then just a thought be going to charge turned off sank to bottom of pool how long will lie there chebron asked hunter long time if be left to be going to stir up so saying directed boat toward rush nearest to bank pushed boat through oh here be jethro chebron said seeing rebu men have accompanied standing on bank what have happened chebron have killed one of heard sort of roar great splashing have not killed there be two spear head sticking into hunter handed cord to men told to pull steadily not hard enough to break cord then took from end of rope carried poled back into pool cord be not strong enough to pull great beast to shore be chebron asked oh must not move by pulling on cause spear head to give pain get uneasy rise to surface in anger then see throw noose over head can pull upon in two three minute animal head appeared above water instant did so hunter threw noose aim be correct with jerk tightened round neck now pull shouted peasant pulled gradually hippopotamus be drawn toward bank although struggling to swim in opposite direction a soon however a reached willow water foot touched ground threw whole weight upon rope peasant be thrown to ground rope dragged through finger a hippopotamus again made way to bottom of pool peasant regained foot pulled on rope cord again hippopotamus rose be dragged to willow only to break away again for eight ten time happened be getting tired now hunter said next time time after will get on shore will land then attack with spear arrow hippopotamus be indeed exhausted allowed to be dragged ashore at next effort without opposition a soon a did so be attacked with spear by hunter jethro boy latter found that be unable to drive weapon through thick skin betook to bow arrow hunter however knew point at skin be thinnest drove spear deep into animal just behind fore leg while boy shot arrow at mouth noose have be thrown over head a issued from water peasant pulling on rope prevented from charging three four more thrust be given from hunter then one of spear touched vital part hippopotamus sank on knee rolled over dead peasant sent up shout of joy for flesh of hippopotamus be by mean bad eating here be store of food sufficient for whole neighborhood will search for lord hunter asked chebron think have have enough of there be fun in killing animal have not spirit to defend do think amuba quite agree with chebron one might almost a well slaughter cow what be that exclaimed suddenly a loud scream be heard at short distance away be woman voice chebron darted off in full speed in direction of sound closely followed by amuba jethro ran about hundred yard along bank when saw cause of outcry immense crocodile be making way toward river dragging along with figure of woman in spite of reverence for crocodile chebron did not hesitate moment rushing forward smote crocodile on nose with strength with shaft of spear crocodile dropped victim turned upon assailant jethro amuba be close behind also attacked crocodile seeing accession of enemy now set out for river snapping jaw together mind tail one of hunter exclaimed running up warning be too late for next moment amuba received tremendous blow sent to ground hunter at same moment plunged spear into animal through soft skin at back of leg jethro followed example on other side animal checked flight turning round round lashed with tail in direction keep clear of hunter shouted be mortally wounded will need more blow in fact crocodile have received death wound movement became more languid ceased to lash tail though still snapped at nearest to gradually action also ceased head sank be dead jethro a soon a have delivered blow ran to amuba be hurt asked anxiously think so amuba gasped brute have knocked breath out of body be better than if have hit in leg for think must have broken have done so how be woman be dead have not have time to see jethro replied let help to foot let see if of rib be broken will see about afterward amuba on getting up declared that did not think be seriously hurt although unable for time to stand upright expect be only bruised jethro be certainly tremendous whack gave expect will not be able to take part in sporting for next few day crocodile be worth dozen hippopotamus there be courage about now walked across to chebron who be stooping over figure of crocodile victim why be girl amuba exclaimed be older than sister chebron do think be dead chebron asked in hushed tone think have only fainted jethro replied here shouted to one of peasant who be gathered round crocodile one of run down to water bring up gourdful think be dead amuba said seemed to that crocodile have seized by leg must carry somewhere jethro said get woman to attend to will see if there be hut near sprang up to top of rising ground looked round there be cottage close at hand said a returned dare say belongs there bidding two of peasant run to fetch woman lifted up slight figure carried up slope two lad following on turning round foot of sandhill saw cottage lying nestled behind be neater better kept than majority of hut of peasant wall of baked clay have be whitewashed be half covered with bright flower patch of carefully cultivated ground lay around jethro entered cottage on settle at further end man be sitting be apparently of great age hair long beard be snowy white what be exclaimed a jethro entered have god of father again smitten in old age taken from pet lamb heard cry limb have lost power must not rise to come to aid trust that child be not severely injured jethro said have just killed hippopotamus when heard scream running up found great crocodile dragging to river soon made drop trust that be not severely hurt beast seemed to to have seized by leg have sent to fetch woman doubtless will be here immediately ah here be water laid girl down upon couch in corner of room taking gourd from peasant who brought sprinkled water on face while amuba by direction rubbed hand be minute before opened eye just a did so two woman entered hut leaving girl to care jethro boy left cottage trust that little maid be not greatly hurt amuba said by dress seems to that be israelite though thought have left land behind on other side of desert still dress resembles of woman saw in village a passed be well for doe so for wear more thicker garment than egyptian peasant woman brute teeth may not have torn severely in few minute one of woman came out told that maid have now recovered that be almost unhurt crocodile seems to have seized by garment rather than flesh although teeth have bruised skin be unbroken grandfather must fain thank for service have rendered re entered cottage girl be sitting on ground at grandfather foot holding one of hand in hers while with other be stroking head a entered woman seeing that service be no longer required left cottage who be to whom owe life of grandchild old man asked be chebron son of ameres high priest of temple of osiris at thebe be friend amuba jethro two of rebu nation who be brought to egypt now live in father household be servant amuba said though be good enough to call friend 't be strange old man said that son of priest of osiris must thus come to gladden last few hour of one who have always withstood egyptian god yet have crocodile carried off ruth might have be better for seeing ere sun have risen set many time will be alone in world girl uttered little cry rising on knee threw arm round old man neck must be so ruth have lived hundred ten year in land of heathen course be run be not for sake must be glad that be so for life have be sorrow bitterness call grandchild be in truth daughter of grandchild who stood between have passed away before left alone together trust in god of abraham will raise up protector for chebron who have learned something of tradition of israelite dwelling in egypt saw by old man word that jethro surmise be correct that belonged to race be israelite said gently how be that be not dwelling among people instead of alone among stranger left thirty year back when ruth mother be tottering child must not suffer to dwell in peace among drove out because testified against because testified against chebron repeated in surprise yes father be already old man when be born be one of few who still clung to faith of father taught that there be one god god of abraham of isaac of jacob that other god be image of wood stone to faith clung though after awhile alone of people held to belief others have forgotten god worshiped god of egyptian when must speak to treated word a raving a casting dishonor on god served son went with rest daughter learned true faith from lip clung to taught daughter after ten year ago when too lay dying sent ruth by messenger to praying to bring up in faith of father saying that though knew be of great age doubted not that when time came god must raise up protector for child so for ten year have dwelt here together tilling watering ground living on fruit by sale of basket that weave exchange for fish with neighbor child worship god of father have grown thriven here for ten year heart be heavy at thought that hour be numbered that see way after that ruth will return to people who will assuredly in time wean from faith never grandfather girl said firmly may beat persecute will never deny god be hard people israelite old man said shaking head be stubborn must need prevail against one so tender however matter be in hand of god who will again reveal in due time to people who have forgotten amuba looking at girl thought that have more power of resistance than old man gave credit for face be of same style of beauty a of of young woman have seen in village of israelite of higher finer type face be almost oval with soft black hair delicately marked eyebrow running almost in straight line below forehead eye be large soft with long lash veiling there be firmness about lip chin that spoke of determined will gave strength to declaration never there be silence moment then chebron said almost timidly father although high priest of osiris be not bigot in religion be wise learned view thing temperately a friend here can tell know of religion for have heard say that when first came into land israelite worshiped one god only have sister who be of about same age a ruth be gentle kind be sure that if ask father will take grandchild into household to be friend companion to mysa be certain that must never try to shake religion must let worship a chooses old man looked fixedly at chebron speech be pleasant kind young sir voice have honest ring few year back must have said must rather maiden be dead than handmaid in house of egyptian a death approach see thing differently may be that must be better there than among who once having known true god have forgotten taken to worship of idol have always prayed believed that god must raise up protector for ruth seems to now that way have be brought hither in latter day of life be answer to prayer ruth child have heard offer be for to decide will go with young egyptian lord serve sister a handmaiden will return to village of people ruth have risen to foot now be looking earnestly at chebron then eye turned to face of amuba jethro then slowly went back again to chebron believe god have chosen for said at last have sent here not only to save life to be protector to face be honest good if father of youth will receive will when leave go be handmaid of daughter be well old man said now be ready to depart for prayer have be heard may god deal with yours egyptian even a deal with child may be so chebron replied reverently can tell jethro said to old man that in household in egypt must daughter be happier than in of ameres be lord master of amuba yet a see son treat not a servant a friend ameres be one of kindest of men a to daughter mysa whose special attendant be must lay down life to shield from harm grandchild must not be in better hand a to religion although ameres have often questioned amuba respecting god of people have never once shown slightest desire that must abandon for of egypt now chebron said will leave for doubtless excitement have wearied ruth need rest quiet after fright be encamped mile away near lake will come see to morrow not word be spoken for time after left house then chebron said really must almost seem a if what that old man said be true that god have sent there that protector might be found for daughter be certainly strange that must happen to be within sound of voice when be seized by crocodile be able to rescue just in time needed see first that must be there then that crocodile must seize at moment lastly that must be just in time to save being dragged into river crocodile might have carried away ten thousand time without one being within reach to save chance be enormously against one who did save being in position to offer suitable home at grandfather death be certainly strange think that father will have objection to take amuba asked oh may say that doe not want more servant in house be sure that when see will be pleased to have companion for mysa if be mother know most likely must say when hears that have be settled will not trouble one way other about will write father letter telling about send off one of slave with at once can get back to morrow will gladden old man heart to know that be arranged wish to tell father too of trouble what trouble amuba asked in surprise have told nothing about anything troubling do not understand amuba be in trouble because struck crocodile be impious action yet what must do amuba repressed inclination to smile must hing else chebron for there be time to mince matter be going too fast for to explain to that be doing wrong in carrying off girl therefore took only mean in power of stopping besides blow dealt did injury whatever be jethro hunter who killed have not delayed flight must not have done so be true enough chebron in case must have reached water with burden devoured at leisure unless think that life be of much more importance than hers can not see that have anything to reproach with understand amuba chebron said pettishly of course think that life of ordinary animal be of a much importance a of human being crocodile be sacred misfortune fall upon who injure then in case chebron misfortune must fall very heavily on inhabitant of district where crocodile be killed wherever be found have not heard that pestilence famine visit part of egypt with more frequency than do district where crocodile be venerated chebron made answer what amuba said be doubtless true upon other hand have always be taught that crocodile be sacred if so must not account for impunity with creature be destroyed in other part of egypt be of puzzle that so constantly met with after long pause replied may seem to be a say see amuba there be god specially worshiped in one district others in in district that god specially protects must naturally be indignant be animal sacred to to be slain while might pay heed to doings in part in be little concerned in case chebron can clearly set mind at rest let allow that be wrong to kill crocodile in district in be sacred where god be concerned about welfare that evil consequence can follow slaying of in district in be not sacred where god a say feel little interest in hope be so amuba that a crocodile be not sacred animal here harm may come from striking one though must give much have not be obliged to do so hope that father will regard matter in same light have doubt that will do so chebron especially a agreed that did real harm to beast be not strange jethro amuba said when chebron have gone into tent wise learned people like egyptian must be so silly regarding animal be strange amuba be hard to keep from laughing to hear so gravely arguing question with chebron if people held same belief must not be surprised a almost animal worshiped in one of district be hated slain in that without evil consequence arising one must have thought that must not see for folly of belief what be going to do to morrow think that be settled have have one day at of sport rabah said that to morrow must either go out see new mode of fishing accompany fowler watch catching bird in clap net go out into desert hunt ibex chebron did not decide suppose when have finished letter will hear what intends to do after chebron have finished letter be long one called rabah asked to dispatch at once by fleetest footed of slave will get there said before father retires to rest if doe not reply at once will probably answer in morning at rate man ought to be back before midday at dinner amuba asked chebron whether have decided what must do next day might go look at men with clap net chebron answered have several sort in use take number of pigeon other bird think that will be enough for to morrow have have four day hard work quiet day will be pleasant if find time go slowly can take boat across lake look at great sea beyond sandhills divide lake from beside hope will get father answer must like further talk with old israelite be interesting to learn about religion that forefather believed in in seems that grandchild be now last who have faith will suit very well to have quiet day chebron for in case think must have accompanied rib be sore from whack crocodile gave with tail doubt whether will be able to walk to morrow indeed next morning amuba be so stiff sore that be unable to rise from couch soon after breakfast messenger returned bringing letter from ameres be a follows seems to chebron mysa have occasion for further attendant a story of old israelite daughter interest girl be of mysa age might be pleasant companion for have objection to entering household must have liked to talk with old man to have heard from more about religion that joseph people brought to egypt be recorded in of scroll that people be monotheist although have many time questioned israelite have professed to be acquainted with religion that of egypt if have further opportunity find out a much a can from old man upon subject assure from that daughter will be kindly treated in household that attempt will be made to turn from religion professes a to adventure with crocodile think that conscience need trouble must certainly be unfortunate to meet in upper egypt crocodile carrying off peasant be not called upon to give opinion a to what must be proper course to pursue under circumstance a be at present in district where crocodile instead of being respected be held in detestation a people with must probably have overtaken slain even without intervention think that need trouble about knock that gave across snout have found in position did must probably have taken same course with respect to girl have best give instruction that when old man dy will travel by boat to thebe arrived there will find difficulty in learning be house on presenting there will be well received will write at once to mysa telling that have found little israelite handmaiden a special attendant must girl arrive before return be at once to assume position must not do for to come here be grandfather to die before leave for home in first place must be in way in second feature dress must proclaim to be israelite people in village passed through might detain insist on remaining with must arrive here fact of departing with might be made subject of complaint israelite must not improbably declare have carried off young woman of tribe a slave therefore in respect be better that must proceed up river to thebe a be poor have best leave sum of money with to pay for passage by boat for support during voyage find that will have finished with steward earlier than have expected will be starting in about three day to inspect canal lay out plan for fresh one therefore if by time have have enough sport to satisfy have best journey back father have consented chebron said

what father say about religion be ever searcher after truth must fain must hear from lip repeat to that can tell relating to god whom worship will with gladness young lord story be easily told for be simple not like of religion with many deity chebron took seat upon pile of rush prepared to listen to old man story of god of israelite chapter viii conspiracy in temple for two day longer party lingered by side of lake fishing fowling then returned across desert to headquarters of ameres two month be spent in examining canal water course seeing that dyke be strengthened where needed that gate channel be in good repair level be taken for construction of several fresh branch must considerably extend margin of cultivation native be called upon to furnish supply of labor for formation quota be not furnished without considerable grumbling on part of israelite although ameres announced that payment must be given for work at last having seen that everything be in train ameres left one of subordinate to carry out work then started with son for thebe fortnight after return home be informed that young female who said name be ruth wished to see bade servant conduct to at same time summon chebron from study lad arrived first a ruth entered presented to father welcome child to house high priest said suppose by coming that old man great grandfather of whom son have spoken to be more died month since lord ruth replied be two week before must find passage in boat coming chebron tell mysa to come here ameres said lad at once fetched mysa who have already heard that israelite

tell child to be kind considerate with know what must suffer be to be placed among stranger how lonely must be at first will be little strange to way will soon make at home hope will try make happy mysa replied looking at new companion although girl be about same age ruth looked elder of two mysa be still little more than child full of fun life ruth be broken down by death of grandfather by journey have made in case must have looked older than mysa difference being in manner rather than in face figure ruth have long have many responsibility on shoulder there be care nursing of old man cultivation of garden on livelihood depended exchange of product for other article preparation of meal grandfather have be in habit of talking to a grown up person there be expression of thoughtfulness gravity in eye mysa on contrary be still happy child who have never known necessity for work exertion life have be like summer day free from care anxiety naturally then felt a looked at ruth that be graver more serious personage than have expected to see think will like said when examination be finished when know other little better hope will like because a father say be to be together be sure will ruth replied looking admiringly at mysa bright face have never have anything to do with girl of own age will find clumsy at first will do best to please for father brother have be very good to there take away mysa have told mother about coming want to go on with reading ameres said show garden animal where be to sleep give in charge of old male who will see that have that want get suitable garment be requisite before many day be over ruth became quite at home in new abode position be pleasant one be at once companion attendant to mysa accompanying in walk under escort of jethro playing with in garden helping to feed animal amusing when preferred to sit quiet by telling about life near lake by great sea about fowling fishing there especially about river course close to cottage with hippopotamus crocodile ruth brightened up greatly in new surroundings to be marvelous beautiful soon caught something of cheerfulness of young mistress laughter of two girl be often heard rising from mysa inclosure at further end of quiet garden shortly after return from visit to lower important event took place chebron being initiated into lowest grade of priesthood duty at first be slight for aspirant to higher order who be with scarce exception son of superior priesthood be not expected to perform of drudgery belonged properly to work of lower class of order be necessary to ascend step by step until arrived at grade beyond study intelligence alone led to promotion progress be rapid be expected only to take part in such service ceremony of temple a required attendance of attached to duty therefore interfered little with study ordinary mode of life be almost a much at home a before must now however enter temple at hour have access to inner court chamber apartment where sacred animal be kept other place where none priest be permitted to enter availed of privilege chiefly of evening great court be open to sky chebron loved to roam through in bright moonlight when be deserted by crowd of worshiper be still silent at time massive column majestic architecture strange figure of god exercised influence upon imagination be wanting in daytime upon altar before chief god fire ever burned in light of flickering flame face assumed life expression now then priest in white linen robe moved through deserted court for most part chebron have undisturbed possession be free to meditate without interruption found that mind be then attuned to pitch of reverence devotion to god that failed to attain when sun be blazing down upon marble floor court be alive with worshiper then strive a must must not enter a wanted into spirit of scene when walked in solemn procession carrying sacred vessel one of sacred emblem doubt whether there must be anything in common between graven image god represented must occur to must wonder whether god be really gratified by procession whether felt real pleasure in carrying about of sacred vessel emblem offering of flower be shocked at own doubt did best to banish from mind at time seemed to that heavy punishment must fall upon for permitting to reason on matter so far beyond comprehension now rejoiced at what before be inclined to regret that father have decided against devoting whole life to service of temple sometimes thought of speaking to father confessing to that mind be troubled with doubt thought of horror with confession must be received deterred from doing so even to amuba be silent on subject for amuba thought must not understand friend believed firmly in god of own country accepted fact that egyptian deity be a powerful for good evil to egyptian a be own to rebu indeed fact that egyptian be so great powerful prevailed over other nation be be inclined to think due to superior power of god majesty of temple splendor of procession devoutness with people worshiped god alike impressed although strangeness of image struck a singular be ready to admit that god might take shape pleased thus then chebron must look for sympathy from shrank from opening mind to nevertheless sometimes took amuba with in visit to temple door at time stood open must enter who chose have in inner court met with of priest amuba must have passed unnoticed a being one of attendant of temple in company with chebron few word be exchanged between lad during ramble for awful grandeur of silent temple weird aspect in moonlight affected amuba a strongly a did chebron at time wondered to whether if ever returned home be to introduce worship of terrible god of egypt must extend protection to rebu near house of ameres stood that of ptylus priest who occupied position in temple of osiris next in dignity to of high priest between two priest there be little cordiality for differed alike in disposition manner of thought ptylus be narrow bigoted in religion precise in observance of ceremonial austere haughty in manner professing to despise learning beyond relating to religion secretly devoured with jealousy at esteem in ameres be held by court reputation a one of first engineer astronomer statesman of egypt have be one of fiercest in opposition raised to innovation proposed by ameres have at time exerted to utmost to excite feeling against a must render necessary for to resign position in temple disappointment have be intense when owing in slight degree to influence of king who regarded ameres with too much trust affection to allow to be shaken in confidence even by what held to be erroneous view of high priest of osiris intrigue came to nothing have ever since kept unceasing watch upon conduct of colleague without however being able to find slightest pretense for complaint against for ameres be visionary having failed in obtaining favorable decision a to view entertained have not striven against tide knowing that by doing so must only involve family in ruin disgrace without forwarding in smallest degree opinion held be thus a exact a ever in ministration in temple differing only from other performer of sacred rite inasmuch a while offered sacrifice to osiris in heart dedicated offering to great god of whom osiris be feeble type image certain amount of intimacy be kept up between two family although there be more liking between wife of two priest than between husband be of similar disposition be fond of show gayety be ambitious although in society exhibited to perfection somewhat gentle indolent manner be considered to mark high breeding among woman of egypt slave of knew to cost that in own home bearing be very different in entertainment feast there be constant rivalry between although wife of high priest considered nothing short of insolence that wife of one inferior to husband rank must venture to compete with while upon other hand little air of calm superiority rival assumed when visiting excited deepest indignation bitterness in heart of wife of ptylus too be aware of enmity that husband bore to ameres did best to second by shaking head affecting air of mystery whenever name be mentioned leaving friend to suppose that did choose must tell terrible tale to disadvantage ameres on part have never alluded at home either to view concerning religion to difference of opinion with colleague there be little in common between wife allowed liberty to do a chose to give frequent entertainment to female friend to spend money a liked so long a own mode of life be not interfered with kept in own hand too regulation of study of chebron mysa one day when be in study wife entered looked up with expression of remonstrance for be understood thing that when occupied with book be on account to be disturbed except upon business of importance must not mind disturbing for once ameres important thing have happened nicotis wife of ptylus have be here afternoon what do think be bearer of proposal from husband that son plexo must marry mysa ameres uttered exclamation of surprise anger be child at present thing be ridiculous not so much child ameres after be nearer fifteen than fourteen betrothal often take place year earlier have be thinking for time of talking matter over with for be fully time that thought of future ameres be silent what wife said be perfectly true mysa have reached age at egyptian maiden be generally betrothed came upon however a unpleasant surprise have regarded mysa a still child affection be centered in chebron for eldest son who resembled mother in spirit have little affection sympathy very well said at last in tone of irritation very unusual to if mysa have reached age when must begin to think whom be to marry will think of there be occasion whatever for haste a to plexo have marked often when have be here with chebron like disposition be arrogant overbearing at same time willow foolish such be not kind of youth to whom will give mysa answer did not quite satisfy wife agreed with in objecting to proposed alliance on entirely different ground have looked forward to mysa making brilliant match must add to own consequence standing on ceremonial occasion a wife of high priest priestess of osiris be present at court banquet abstemious taste habit of ameres prevented from taking part desired in other festivity considered that be mysa to marry great general perhaps even one of prince of blood must then be able to take position in society to aspired considered indeed that ought to fill a wife of ameres high priest of osiris one of most trusted counselor of king such result must certainly not flow from mysa marriage to son of one of le rank in temple than husband far inferior in public estimation being content however that husband objected to match on other ground abstained from pressing own view of subject being perfectly aware that be one with ameres must by mean sympathize therefore only said be glad that object to match ameres be quite in accord with in opinion of son of ptylus what reason will give nicotis for declining connection true one of course ameres said in surprise what other reason must there be in respect to position objection must arise upon of wealth be only son although ptylus may not have so large income a myself for have have much state employment can certainly afford to place son in at least a good position a can expect for mysa be to decline proposal without giving reason ptylus must have good ground for offense suppose amense will be pleased at fault being found with son that can not help parent can not expect others to see offspring with same eye that do must certainly feel offense be to propose for wife for chebron to receive a answer that lacked of virtue parent required in husband for daughter might consider that chebron have virtue if thought otherwise why must be offended be not everyone who see matter a do ameres one like having child slighted still if be wish must tell nicotis that have personal objection to son of course will do so put light amense be not have personal objection to certainly like fact have nothing to do with decision might like very much yet consider that must not make mysa good husband on other hand might dislike personally yet feel must safely intrust mysa happiness to will say then to nicotis that from what have seen of plexo from what have learned of character doe not appear to that union between mysa must be likely to conduce to happiness that therefore decline altogether to enter into negotiation for bringing about of such marriage amense be well pleased for felt that message given in husband name must be great rebuff for rival must far more than counterbalance many triumph have gained over by recital of number of banquet entertainment in have taken part have amense be present when nicotis informed ptylus of refusal of proposal for hand of mysa might have felt that even satisfaction of mortifying rival may be dearly purchased know woman ptylus can picture to yourself air of insolence with declined proposal wished at moment have be peasant wife instead of lady of quality must have given cause to regret insolence for long time a be be a much a must do to restrain to smile say that perhaps after young people be not a well suited for other a must be wished that have only yielded to wish of plexo having in mind alliance must in respect be more advantageous of course replied that be glad to hear must not know be lying for lotus flower be holding in hand trembled with rage devoured be say against plexo personally that objection be made ptylus said gloomily so seemed to say of course must not tell that have set mind on daughter marrying one of royal prince though be like enough that such be thought for woman be pushing ambitious enough for anything only said in formal sort of way that while alliance between two family must naturally be most agreeable to husband be of opinion that disposition of young people be wholly dissimilar that feared union must not be for happiness of that having perhaps peculiar idea a to necessity for husband wife being of one mind in matter thought better that idea must be abandoned have mind to tell ameres did not seem to have acted upon idea in own case for everyone know that amense have not thought in common that go way go let beware ptylus said will learn that be not to be insulted with impunity ameres whom people regard a so holy be at heart despiser of god have not be favorite of thotmes must ere now have be disgraced degraded must be high priest in place for son neco be too young for such dignity be ascending in scale year that father life hold office will come more more to be looked upon a natural successor few more year chance will be extinguished then nicotis said decidedly ameres must not hold office for many more year have talked matter over over again have always promised that day must be wife of high priest that plexo must stand first in succession of office be high time that carried promise into effect be time nicotis man have too long insulted god by ministering at service when in heart be false to will be so no longer last insult to decides have agreed to proposal must have laid aside own claim with influence must have secured plexo a son in law must succeed rather than willow brained fool neco have refused offer must bear consequence have be too patient will be so no longer will act have strong party among upper priesthood who have long be of opinion that ameres be disgrace to caste danger to religion will join heart soul for feel with that position a high priest be outrage to god ask question nicotis be assured that promise will be kept will be high priest plexo will marry child fancy for doing so will not only strengthen position render own succession secure by silencing who might at death seek to bring back succession to neco be well ptylus have long wondered that be content to be lorded over by ameres if can aid in way be sure will do so by way amense invited to banquet be about to give next week will accept invitation certainly must not show that be in way offended at what have passed a far a ameres be concerned matter not for man have so good opinion of that nothing must persuade that have enemy must not do in view of what have resolved upon other must entertain slightest suspicion that there exists ill feeling between great preparation be made by amense for banquet on following week for have resolved that must completely eclipse entertainment of nicotis ameres have a usual left everything in hand spared expense for day two previous large supply of food arrived from farm from market in city early on morning of entertainment host of professional cook arrived to prepare dinner head cook superintended labor meat consisted of beef goose ibex gazelle oryx for although large flock of

bread pastry former being made in form of roll sprinkled at top with carraway other seed confectionary be made of fruit other ingredient mixed with dough be formed by skillful workman into various artistic shape such a recumbent ox vas temple other form besides meat there be abundance of most delicate kind of fish when hour of noon approached ameres amense took seat on two chair at upper end of chief apartment a guest arrived came up to to receive welcome when have arrived woman took place on chair at one side of hall men on other then servant brought in table piled up with dish containing viand in case filled with fruit decorated with flower ranged down center of room cup of wine be then handed round to guest lotus flower presented to to hold in hand garland of flower placed round neck

being cut up by attendant into small piece guest helping from dish with aid of piece of bread held between finger vegetable formed large part of meal meat being mixed with to serve a flavoring for in so hot climate vegetable diet be far more healthy than one composed principally of meat while meal be proceeding party of female musician seated on ground in one corner of room played sang banquet lasted for long time number of dish served being very large when be half over figure of mummy of about three foot in length be brought round presented to guest in succession a reminder of uncertainty of existence a present be accustomed to ceremony have little effect sound of conversation laughter although checked for moment broke out again a soon a figure be removed wine of many kind be served during dinner woman a well a men partaking of when be concluded servant brought round golden basin with perfumed water napkin guest removed from finger gravy even with daintiest care in feeding must

went through variety of performance juggler showed feat of dexterity with ball other trick while musician of various nationality played in turn upon instrument in use in own country time attendant moved about among guest serving with wine keeping supplied with fresh flower bard recited ode in honor of glory of king thotmes be not until late in evening that entertainment came to end have gone off splendidly amense said to ameres when be over last guest have be helped away by servant for there be many who be unable to walk steadily unaided nothing must have be better will be talk of whole town must see nicotis be devoured by envy vexation do think great credit be due to ameres for have really done nothing toward preparation be perfectly willing that must have credit amense ameres said wearily be glad that be satisfied to whole thing be tedious tiresome to degree superabundance of food too lavish use of wine posture antic of actor dancer be simply disgusting however if everyone else be pleased of course be content be most unsatisfactory husband woman ever have amense said angrily do believe must be perfectly happy shut up in study with roll of manuscript life without seeing human being save black slave to bring in bread fruit water twice day think must dear ameres replied calmly at rate must prefer vastly to such waste of time that in form to so disagreeable a have have to endure to day chapter ix startling event be day later that chebron amuba again paid visit to temple by moonlight be well nigh month since have be there for save when moon be up darkness gloom of court lighted only by lamp of altar be so great that place offered attraction amuba free from superstition influenced companion must have gone with have proposed although too felt influence of darkness dim weird figure of god seen faintly by light burned at foot to chebron more imaginative easily affected there be something absolutely terrible in gloomy darkness nothing must have induced to wander in silent court save when moon threw light upon on entering one of inner court found massive door in wall standing ajar where doe lead to amuba asked know have never seen open before think must have be left unclosed by accident will see where lead to opening saw in front of flight of stair in thickness of wall lead up to roof chebron said in surprise knew not there be stair to roof for when repair be needed workman mount by ladder let go up chebron will be curious to look down upon court yes must be careful amuba for did below catch sight of might spread alarm need only stay there minute two amuba urged there be so few about that be not likely to be seen for if walk noiselessly none be likely to cast eye so far upward so saying amuba led way up stair chebron somewhat reluctantly followed felt way a went after mounting for considerable distance found that stair ended in narrow passage at end of be opening scarce three foot high just wide enough for man to pas through evidently opened into outer air a sufficient light passed through to enable to see where be standing amuba crept out through opening at end beyond be ledge foot wide beyond rose dome six foot high eight ten foot along ledge come on chebron there be plenty of room for of said looking backward chebron at once joined where can be amuba asked there be sky overhead be twenty foot from top of wall where ledge end just before get to side of stone seems to go straight down chebron looked round must be head of one of statue said after pause what curious place wonder what can have be made for see there be hole here just in front of be opening of six inch in diameter in stone amuba pushed hand down seems to go long way down said be narrowing removing arm looked down hole there be opening at other end said small narrow slit must have be made to enable one standing here to see down though think must see much through so small hole must think chebron if be really top of head of one of great figure slit must be where lip be think so chebron agreed that be probable in case amuba went on must say that hole must be made to allow priest to give answer through mouth of image to supplication made to have heard that image sometimes gave answer to worshiper perhaps be secret of chebron be silent idea be painful one to for if be so be evident that trickery be practiced think have better go said at last have done wrong in coming up here let peep over side first amuba said seems to that can hear voice below projection of head prevented seeing anything beyond returning put foot in hole raised sufficiently to get on top of stone be here so much flattened that there be risk of falling off leaning forward looked over edge a amuba have guessed must be case found on head of principal idol in temple gathered

overthrow openly for have support of king effort have be made have not in way shaken position therefore must die will be easy to put out of way there be plenty of small chamber recess might be induced to enter on pretext other then be slain without difficulty body taken away by night thrown into of disused catacomb must be nine day wonder when be missed one must ever learn truth of disappearance be ready to kill with own hand must regard deed a one most pleasing to god therefore if be ready to undertake other arrangement two of will join in seeing that deed be carried out without noise outcry will take matter in hand hate with air of holiness pretended love for people besides good of religion requires that will die there be chorus of approbation from others leave to determine time place speaker went on excuse on will lead to doom who will not be actually engaged with in business must be in precinct of place see that one come way make excuse other must cry by chance be heard must afterward set on foot sort of rumor to account for action can settle nothing to night there be occasion for haste on third night hence will again gather here chebron touched amuba two crept back to where have be standing on ledge villain be planning murder in very temple chebron said will give fright applying mouth to orifice cried beware sacrilegious wretch plot will fail ruin fall upon come on chebron amuba exclaimed pulling garment of fellow may know secret of statue in case will kill without mercy if find here passing through opening groped way to top of stair hurried down a fast a must in darkness issued out from door hear footstep amuba exclaimed a did so run for life chebron just a left court heard noise of angry voice hurried footstep close by at full speed ran through several court apartment have better hide amuba will be use trying to do will guard entrance gate give alarm set priest on duty in temple in search come along quickly can not be sure that be who spoke to will probably wait until one have ascended stair to see that one be lurking there think be safe for moment there be good hiding place think have better walk straight to entrance chebron presence here be natural enough post at gate must let pas out without suspicion will try find hiding place certainly will not do amuba be not going to run away leave in scrape especially a be who got into by rashness be there place where workman be engaged on wall amuba asked suddenly yes in third court on right after entering chebron replied be repainting figure on upper part of wall be watching at work yesterday then in case there must be ladder with might get away safely let make for court at once tread noiselessly if hear footstep approaching hide in shadow behind statue listen be giving alarm know that number must be altogether insufficient to search great temple thoroughly shout be indeed heard lad pressed on toward court chebron have spoken of temple now be echoing with sound for priest on duty who have be asleep a usual when not engaged in attending to light have now be roused by one of number who ran in told sacrilegious person have made way into temple here be place chebron said stopping at foot of wall here two three long light ladder be standing of reached part of distance only up wall top of one must be seen against skyline mount chebron there be time to loose may be here at moment chebron mounted followed closely by companion just a gained top of wall several men carrying torch ran into court began to search along side lying in shadow just a amuba joined chebron one of searcher caught sight of with shout ran toward ladder pull chebron amuba exclaimed a tried to haul up ladder chebron at once assisted foot of ladder be already many foot above ground before men reached height of wall be fifty foot light a be construction of ladder be a much a lad must do to pull up to top wall be fully twelve foot in thickness a soon a ladder be up amuba said keep away from edge chebron be possible that in bright moonlight may be recognized must be going on at once will tie short ladder together be after directly way will go toward outer wall a far a possible from gate bring ladder along taking upon shoulder hurried along critical a position be amuba must not help remarking on singularity of scene massive wall be topped with white cement stretched like broad ribbon crossing recrossing other in regular parallelogram on black ground five minute running took to outer wall ladder be again lowered descended then stood at foot for moment to listen everything be still silent be lucky did not think of sending men to watch outside wall when first caught sight of must have be captured expect thought of nothing getting down other ladder fastening together let make straight out get well away from temple then will return to house at leisure have better get out of sight if can before pursuer find top of ladder then a will have idea in direction have gone will give up chase after hour walking reached home on way have discussed whether not chebron must tell ameres what have taken place have agreed that must be best to be silent father must not like to know that have discovered secret of image chebron if be not for must say have best have told see that must do good now know who men be who be plotting whom be plotting against one thing be pretty certain will not try to carry out plan now for can not tell how much of conversation be overheard fear of discovery will put end for present to scheme of theirs chebron agreed with amuba view be decided to say nothing about affair unless circumstance occurred might alter intention entered house quietly reached apartment without disturbing of inmate on following morning one of priest of temple arrived at early hour demanded to see ameres have evil tidings to give lord said son neco have morning be killed neco killed ameres repeated be ala too true lord left house where life with two other priest short distance from gate of temple at usual hour be turn to offer sacrifice at dawn must have be still dark when left house a did not arrive at proper time messenger be sent to fetch found lying dead few pace from own door stabbed to heart ameres waved hand to signify that must be alone sat down half stunned by sudden shock between eldest son there be great affection neco be of cold formal disposition although ameres must in own house have gladly relaxed in case a have done in of chebron rigid respect deference demanded by egyptian custom on part of son toward father neco have never responded to advance have be punctilious in observance practiced at time except when absolutely commanded to do so have never taken seat in father presence have never addressed unless spoken to have made appearance only at stated time to pay respect to when dismissed have gladly hurried away to priest who acted a tutor a grew up gap have widened instead of closing ameres saw with regret that mind be narrow understanding willow that in matter of religion be bigoted while at same time perceived that extreme zeal in service of temple absorption in ceremonial observance of kind be due in slight degree to ambition that be endeavoring to obtain reputation for distinguished piety with view to succeeding day to office of high priest guessed that eagerness with neco embraced first opportunity of withdrawing from home joining two other young priest in establishment be due to desire to disassociate from father thus to make unspoken protest against latitude of opinion have raised up party hostile to ameres although living so close be very seldom that have after once leaving house again entered generally choosing time when father be absent so paying visit only to mother still news of sudden death be great shock ameres sat without moving for minute until sudden outburst of cry in house betokened that messenger have told tidings to servant that have carried to mistress ameres at once went to wife apartment endeavored to console wholly without success amense be frantic with grief although much addicted to pleasure of world have highest respect for religion ardor of neco in discharge of religious duty have be source of pride gratification to not only be pleasant to hear son spoken of a one of most rising of young priesthood saw that must make way rapidly must ere long become recognized successor to father office chebron mysa bore news of brother death with much more resignation for last three year have scarcely seen even when living at home there have be nothing in common between be indeed more awed by suddenness of death than grieved at loss when left ameres went at once to house of neco to make further inquiry into matter there must learn nothing must afford clew neco have be late at temple have not returned until long after rest of household be in bed none have seen before left in morning sound of struggle cry for help have be heard death have apparently be instantaneous have be stabbed in back by one who have probably be lurking close to door awaiting coming out general opinion there in temple be that must have fallen victim to feeling of revenge on part of attendant in building who on report have undergone disgrace punishment for fault of carelessness inattention in service in care of sacred animal a score of attendant have at one time other be so reported by neco for be constantly on lookout for small irregularity be impossible to fix crime on one more than magistrate who arrived soon after ameres to investigate matter called whole of who must be suspected of harboring ill will against neco to be brought before questioned a to doings during night stoutly asserted that have be in bed at time of murder nothing occurred to throw suspicion upon one more than a soon a investigation be concluded ameres ordered corpse to be brought to own house illustration c of b amense mysa bewail death of neco page covered by white cloth be placed on sort of sledge be drawn by six of attendant of temple ameres chebron followed behind after came procession of priest when arrived at house amense mysa with hair unbound falling around received body uttering loud cry of lamentation in be joined by woman of house be carried into inner apartment there until evening loud wailing be kept up many female relative friend coming in joining in outcry late in evening body be taken out placed upon sledge followed by male relative friend by attendant slave of house be carried to establishment of chigron embalmer during forty day occupied by process strictest mourning be observed in house meat wheaten bread be eaten wine served at table even luxury of bath be abandoned male shaved eyebrow sound of loud lamentation on part of woman echoed through house at end of time mummy be brought back in great state placed in room be in large egyptian house set apart for reception of dead mummy case be placed upright against wall here sacrifice similar to offered at temple be made ameres number of priest of rank of decorated with leopard skin took part of service incense libation be offered amense mysa be present at ceremony wailed with hair in disorder over shoulder dust sprinkled on head oil be poured over head of mummy after ceremony be over amense mysa embraced mummied body bathing foot with tear uttering expression of grief praise of deceased in evening feast be held in honor of dead on occasion sign of grief be laid aside joyful aspect of departure of dead to happy existence prevailed large number of friend relative be present guest be anointed decked with flower a be usual at party after meal mummy be drawn through room in token that spirit be still present among amense must fain have kept mummy for time in house a be often practice ameres preferred that funeral must take place at once three day later procession assembled started from house first came servant bearing table laden with fruit cake flower vas of ointment wine young goose in crate for sacrifice chair wooden table napkin other thing then came others carrying small closet containing image of god also carried dagger bow sandal fan bore napkin upon shoulder then came table with offering chariot drawn by pair of horse charioteer driving a walked behind chariot then came bearer of sacred boat mysterious eye of horus god of stability others carried small image of blue pottery representing deceased under form of osiris bird emblematic of soul then eight woman of class of paid mourner came along beating breast throwing dust upon head uttering loud lamentation ameres clad in leopard skin having in hand censer vase of libation accompanied by attendant bearing various implement used in service followed by number of priest also clad in leopard skin now came along immediately behind followed consecrated boat placed upon sledge containing mummy case in large exterior case covered with painting be drawn by four ox seven men in boat amense mysa be seated sledge be decked with flower be followed by chebron other relative friend of deceased beating breast lamenting loudly when arrived at sacred lake be large piece of artificial water coffin be taken from small boat in have be conveyed placed in bari consecrated boat of dead be gorgeously painted boat with lofty cabin amense mysa chebron took place here be towed by large boat with sail oar member of procession then took place in other richly decorated sailing boat crossed lake together procession be then reformed went in same order to tomb here mummy case be placed on slab prepared for sacrifice with libation incense offered door of tomb be then closed not fastened a sacrificial service must be held there periodically for many year procession then returned on foot to house during time certain clew have be obtained a to author of murder upon going up to temple on day of neco death chebron found sort of rumor current affair of previous night have be greatly magnified be generally believed that strong party of men have entered temple with intention of carrying off sacred vessel that have be disturbed just a be going to break into subterranean apartment where be kept have then fled to ladder escaped over wall before sufficient force must be collected to detain be generally supposed that affair be in way connected with death of neco upon chebron return with news amuba agreed that be necessary to inform ameres at once of doings on previous night after evening meal be over ameres called chebron into study have heard aught in temple chebron a to strange affair took place there last night can not see how can have connection with brother death still be strange have heard who first discovered thief last night say that be though what must be doing there at hour know not four five others be named by priest a having aroused curiously not one of be in temple to day have received letter from ptylus saying that have be suddenly called to visit relation living on seashore near mouth of nile others sent similar excuse have sent to house appear to have left at early hour morning be most strange for none notified to yesterday that have occasion to be absent what can be motive in thus running away when naturally must obtain praise honor for having saved vessel of temple have heard anything must seem to throw light upon subject have heard nothing father can tell much must have spoken to first thing morning have not be for news about neco chebron then related to ameres how amuba have night before visited temple ascended stair behind image of god overheard plot to murder unknown person be extraordinary tale chebron ameres said when have brought story to conclusion certainly must have be slain have be overtaken how door led to staircase came to be open can not imagine place be only used on very rare occasion when be deemed absolutely necessary that must influence in one direction course of event can only suppose that when last used be now month since door must have be carelessly fastened that only now opened of still be minor matter be fortunate that be who made discovery a to conspiracy say overheard be much more serious to mind sudden absence of ptylus others must seem to show that be conscious of guilt presence in temple so late be in singular a say can not know how much of conversation be overheard against whom plot be directed can form idea though doubtless be personage of high importance think father chebron said hesitatingly that plot must have be to murder neco be what amuba thought when talked over afternoon think so ameres said after pause be hardly likely that four five person must plot together to carry out murder of one in position must be one of far greater importance neco may not have be liked be certainly held in esteem by priest in temple see father chebron said that ptylus be ambitious man may have hoped at time other to become high priest neco must have stood in way for a office be hereditary if eldest son be fitted to undertake neco must almost certainly be selected be true chebron have reason to credit ptylus with such wickedness beside must hardly take other people into confidence did entertain such scheme moreover knowing that be overheard last night although can not tell how much may have be gathered by listener must assuredly not have carried plan into execution besides a say plan be arrived at after whole temple be disturbed must hardly have met afterward arranged fresh scheme of murder if be killed by must have be that suspected that be one of who overheard figure be not unlike yours may probably have obtained glimpse of on wall have noticed priest attire be in temple late probably left just before be discovered believing then that be overheard thinking that one of listener be neco decided for own safety to remove of course be mere assumption that ptylus be one of overheard last night absence to day be only thing have against that alone be wholly insufficient to enable to move in matter whole affair be terrible mystery be assured will do best to unravel at present in case can hing ptylus four priest who be absent will doubtless return when find that accusation be laid against will suppose that other person who overheard whoever be be either afraid to come forward perhaps heard only few word be ignorant of identity of speaker indeed must be bold man who must venture to prefer so terrible accusation against five of priest of temple blame in matter for must not have foreseen event have happened be will of god that must have learned what have learned perhaps intend day that will be instrument for bringing guilty to justice a to conspiracy no doubt a say plot against whomsoever be directed will be abandoned for will never be sure a to how much be known of what passed between whether who overheard may not be waiting for commission of crown to denounce in meantime will on account renew visit to temple enter at time except when called upon to do so by duty very day after neco funeral mysa mother be thrown into flutter of excitement by message arrived from bubastes month before sacred cat of great temple there cat held in a high honor in lower egypt a bull apis in thebaid have fallen sick in spite of care attendance lavished upon have died task of finding successor be important arduous one like bull of apis be necessary not only that cat must be distinguished for size beauty that must bear certain marking without particular marking cat must be elevated to sacred post even if remained vacant for year therefore a soon a cat be dead party of priest set out from bubastes to visit city of egypt in search of successor whole country be agitated with question of sacred cat at town visited list be brought to priest of cat from size shape color must be considered a candidate for office a soon a one of party of priest have reached thebe amense have sent to description of mysa great cat paucis hitherto amense have evinced no interest whatever in daughter pet seldom going out into garden except to sit under shade of tree near fountain for short time in afternoon when sun have lost power in paucis indeed have taken slight interest because in first place be only becoming that mistress of house must busy a to welfare of animal deemed so sacred in second because who saw paucis agreed that be remarkable alike in size beauty presence of such creature in house be in source of pride dignity thus then lost time in sending message to priest inviting to call visit inspect cat although a rule competitor for post of sacred cat of bubastes be brought in basket by owner for inspection priest be willing enough to pay visit in person to wife of so important man a high priest of osiris amense received with much honor presented mysa to a owner of cat accompanied priest in visit to home of mysa pet report be most favorable have since left bubastes seen cat approaching paucis in size beauty although marking be not precisely correct yet approximated very closely to standard must say no more than because decision must not be made until return of party of searcher to bubastes report must then be compared unless one animal appeared exactly to suit requirement visit must be made by high priest of temple to three four of cat most highly reported upon if found one of worthy of honor must be selected for vacant position if none of came up to lofty standard post must remain unfilled for year two when might be hoped that among rising generation of cat worthy successor to departed one might be found for must continue search in thebe neighborhood a claimant must be examined assured amense that thought most improbable that cat equal to paucis must be found month have passed be not until week after funeral of neco that message arrived saying that report concerning paucis by priest who have visited thebe be so much more favorable than given by of other searcher of animal have seen that have be decided by high priest that alone be worthy of honor messenger stated that in course of fortnight deputation consisting of high priest several leading functionary of temple with retinue of lower clergy attendant must set out from bubastes by water in order to receive sacred cat to conduct with due ceremony to shrine of bubastes mysa be delighted at honor have befallen cat privately be le fond of paucis than of of le stately cat for paucis from time grew up have none of playfulness of tribe deported with placid dignity must do honor to new position rendered le amusing to mysa than humbler more active companion amense be vastly gratified at news be considered highest honor must befall egyptian for one of animal to be chosen to fill chief post in one of temple next in dignity to apis be sacred cat of great goddess known a baste bubastes pasht a soon a news be known friend acquaintance of family flocked in to offer congratulation so many visit be paid to mysa inclosure even tranquility of paucis be disturbed by succession of admirer amense declaring that felt responsible for animal being in perfect health when priest arrived for permitted only caller whom particularly desired to honor to pay visit of inspection to chapter x cat of bubastes for several day upon paying morning visit to bird other pet in inclosure in garden chebron mysa have observed unusual timidity among wildfowl instead of advancing to meet with demonstration of welcome remained close among reed even ibis did not respond at once to call must have be alarmed at something chebron said third morning bird of prey must have be swooping down upon see here there be several feather scattered about of be stained with blood look at pretty drake be brought to by merchant in trade with far east mate be missing may be hawk creature of weasel tribe at rate must try to put stop to be third morning that have noticed change in behavior of bird doubtless three of have be carried off amuba will watch to morrow with bow arrow see if can not put end to marauder if go on will lose pet upon following morning chebron amuba went down to inclosure soon after daybreak concealing in shrub waited for appearance of intruder duck be splashing about in pond evidently forgetful of fright of day before a soon a sun be up dog came out of house threw down on spot where ray must fall upon while cat sat cleaned on ledge behind lattice for be only allowed to run about in inclosure when one be there to prevent interference with bird for hour there be sign of enemy then one of bird gave sudden cry of alarm there be sudden flutter a rushed to shelter among reed before last must get within cover dark object shot down from above there be frightened cry violent flapping a large hawk suddenly seized one of waterfowl struck to ground in instant watcher rose to foot a hawk rose with prey in talon shot arrow almost simultaneously amuba arrow struck hawk between wing creature fell dead still clutching prey chebron arrow be equally well aimed struck twig deflected course flew wide of mark amuba gave shout of triumph leaped out from among bush paused turned a exclamation of alarm broke from chebron to astonishment saw look of horror on companion face bow be still outstretched stood a if petrified what be matter chebron amuba exclaimed what have happened have deadly snake bit what be chebron do not see chebron said in low voice see nothing amuba replied looking round at same time putting arrow into bowstring ready to repel attack of dangerous creature where be can see nothing arrow glanced off twig entered there saw one of cat fall must have killed two year before amuba must have laughed at horror chebron face expressed at accident of shooting cat have be long enough in egypt to know how serious be consequence of such act better by far that chebron arrow have lodged in heart of man in case explanation of manner in accident have occurred compensation to relative of slain expiatory offering at one of temple must have be deemed sufficient to purge from offense to kill cat even by accident be most unpardonable offense egyptian must commit offender must assuredly be torn to piece by mob knowing realized at once terrible import of chebron word for moment felt almost a much stunned a chebron quickly recovered presence of mind there be only one thing to be done chebron must dig hole bury at once will run fetch hoe throwing down bow arrow ran to little shed at other end of garden where implement be kept bidding careless good morning to men who be already at work there soon rejoined chebron who have not moved from spot from have shot unlucky arrow do think be best amuba think have better go tell father think so chebron upon other matter must be right at once to confer with a high priest must be fearful burden to place upon shoulder must be duty at once to denounce did keep secret matter be ever found out must involve in danger let therefore bear brunt of by dare not go in chebron said in awestruck tone be too terrible oh will manage amuba said lightly know to cat be cat nothing more must just a soon bury one a rascally hawk have be cause of mischief so saying crossed open space entering thick bush beyond cat house dug deep hole then went into house although having belief whatever in sacredness of one animal more than have yet be long enough among egyptian to feel sensation akin to awe a entered saw lying upon ground largest of cat pierced through by chebron arrow drawing out shaft lifted animal putting under garment went out again entering bush buried in hole have dug leveled soil carefully over scattered few dead leaf on top there one must notice that said to when have finished be awfully unlucky be that cat of others then went in carefully erased mark of blood upon floor brought out shaft took down to pond carefully washed blood from then returned to chebron be latter asked a approached did not say more amuba understood be sorry to say be replied be horribly unlucky for one of others might not have be missed there be hoping that now chebron seemed paralyzed at news come chebron amuba said will not do to give way to fear must brave out will leave door of cat house open when be missed will be thought that have escaped wandered away at rate there be reason why suspicion must fall upon if do put bold face upon matter must not let look betray if worst come to worst find that suspicion be entertained must get out of way there will be plenty of time to think of that have got to do now be to try look a if nothing have happened how can chebron said in broken tone to a say be only cat to be creature sacred above others have slain be ten thousand time worse than if have killed man cat be cat amuba repeated can understand what feel about though to mind be ridiculous there be thousand of cat in thebe let choose one for temple grant danger of what have happened know that if be found out there be hope for have nothing to do with chebron said there be reason why must take risk with be in matter chebron twig might just a well have turned arrow from course a yours went to kill hawk together have shot cat be terrible business there be doubt make difference whatever whether think cat be only cat if people of thebe considered be god if be found out be certain death will need wit to save life unless pluck up courage look little more like may a well go at once say have happened take consequence only if value life do mine so if mean to let look betray say so stop here for few hour till get good start will tell father chebron said suddenly abide by what say if think duty to denounce so be in case will run risk mind running risk chebron be quite ready to share peril with will tell father chebron repeated abide by what say be sure can never face out by that look will betray have committed most terrible crime egyptian can commit dare not keep such secret to myself very well chebron will not try to dissuade will go see jethro of course to a to shooting of cat be matter not worth second thought will understand consequence if fly will accompany mind speaking to must trust life to a to chebron nodded moved away toward house for pity sake chebron amuba exclaimed walk like if men at work get sight of can not see that something strange have happened will be recalled against when creature be missed chebron made effort to walk with usual gait amuba stood watching for minute then turned away with gesture of impatience chebron be clever learned in many thing think that lack courage egyptian seem to have iron in composition when pinch come chebron walk a if bone have turned to jelly of course be in horrible scrape still if must face out with sense pluck must be easier for however think that be more idea that have committed act of horrible sacrilege than fear of death weighs down if be not so serious matter one must almost laugh at one being crushed to earth because have accidentally killed cat upon entering house chebron made way to room where father be engaged in study dropping heavy curtain over door behind advanced few pace then fell on knee touched ground with forehead chebron ameres exclaimed laying down roll of papyrus on be engaged rising to foot what be son why do thus kneel before in attitude of supplication rise tell have happened chebron raised head still continued on knee ameres be startled at expression of son face look of health life have gone from color beneath bronze skin have faded away drop of perspiration stood on forehead lip be parched drawn what be son ameres repeated now thoroughly alarmed have forfeited life father worse have offended god beyond forgiveness morning went with amuba with bow arrow to shoot hawk have for time be slaying waterfowl came down shot together amuba killed hawk arrow struck tree flew wide of mark entering cat house killed paucis who be chosen only two day to take place of sacred cat in temple of bubastes exclamation of horror broke from high priest recoiled pace from son unhappy boy said life be indeed forfeited king must not save son from fury of populace have perpetrated deed be not life be thinking of father chebron said first of horrible sacrilege then that alone can not bear consequence of must fall upon mother sister for even to be related to one who have committed crime be terrible disgrace ameres walked up down room several time before spoke a to share of consequence chebron must bear a best can said at last in calmer tone than have before used be of must first think be terrible affair yet a say be accident be guiltless of intentional sacrilege plea will be a nothing death be punishment for slaying cat one have slain having be chosen to succeed cat of bubastes be of others one most sacred question be what be to be done must fly instantly though fear that flight will be vain for a soon a news be known will spread from one end of egypt to other man hand will be against even by time discovery may have be made will hardly be father for amuba have buried cat among bush have left door of house open so that may be supposed for time that have wandered away proposed to to fly with at once for declares that be determined to share fate since be concerned in attempt to kill hawk in of course be wrong for be not who have done thing amuba have done rightly ameres said have at least time to reflect want to fly father of what good will life be to with awful sin upon head wonder that suffer to remain moment in presence that cast out a wretch who have mortally offended god ameres waved hand impatiently be not troubling now chebron view thing in same way a most men must be that have to fly for life will tell more suffice for blame still le regard with great thing for to think of at present be a to best step to be taken be to fly now might get several day start might even get out of country before alarm be spread upon other hand disappearance must at once be connected with of cat a soon a became known that be missing whereas if stay here quietly be possible that one will connect in way with fact that cat be gone that something have happened to will speedily be guessed for cat doe not stray away far from place where have be bred up besides cat of such size appearance be remarkable be anywhere in neighborhood must speedily be noticed now go join amuba in room remain there for morning a usual will give order that instructor be told that will not want to day a be not well will see presently when have thought matter fully out determined what have best be done keep up brave heart boy danger may yet pas over chebron retired overwhelmed with surprise at kindness with father have spoken to when have expected that must be so filled with horror at terrible act of sacrilege that must not have suffered to remain in house for moment after tale be told yet have seemed to think chiefly of danger to life to be little affected by what to chebron be by far most terrible part of affair religious aspect of deed on entering room where pursued study found jethro a well a amuba there be sorry for young master jethro said a entered of course to idea of fuss being made over accidental killing of cat be ridiculous know how view danger in have placed only came in here with amuba to say that can rely upon that if decide on flight be ready at once to accompany thanks jethro chebron replied must fly will indeed be comfort to have with a well a amuba who have already promised to go with at present nothing be determined have seen father told everything will decide for then will not denounce amuba said thought that must not have spoken so kindly that be amazed did not seem possible to that egyptian must have heard of such dreadful occurrence without feeling horror destation of person who did even be own son still more must one expect from man who like father be high priest to god father be wise a well a learned man jethro said know that god can not be altogether offended at affair for fate not slayer be responsible real slayer of cat be twig turned arrow see that be more to blame anything like so much to blame a be hawk at whom shot however be consolation to chebron who threw down on couch in state of complete prostration seemed to that even must terrible thing be hidden must denounce bear penalty how must exist with knowledge that be under ban of god life must be curse rather than gift under such circumstance physically chebron be not coward have not toughness of mental fibre enables men to bear almost unmoved misfortune must crush others to ground a to comforting assurance of amuba jethro failed to give slightest consolation loved amuba a brother in other matter opinion must have weighed greatly with amuba knew nothing of god of egypt must not feel in slightest terrible nature of act of sacrilege therefore on point opinion must have weight jethro amuba said told be going to escort mysa one day other to very top of hill in order that must thence look down upon whole city put into head to go morning at least persuade to go into city if go into garden will at once notice that cat be lost whereas if can keep away for day will give so much more time if ameres decides that have best fly might on return find that have gone must do so jethro will tell route have taken arrange for point at can join must certainly wish to go with for must know that experience strong arm must be above thing needful then will go at once jethro agreed there be two three excursion have be wanting to make think can promise that will go on one of to day if say anything about wanting to go to see pet before starting can say that have be there morning seen after mean to fly chebron said starting up unless be that father command to do so rather thousand world stay here meet fate jethro must have spoken amuba signed to to go at once crossing room took chebron hand be hot feverish there be patch of color in cheek let talk about chebron said have put matter in father hand may be sure that will decide wisely therefore burden be off shoulder for present must have better counselor in egypt fact that hold so high sacred office will add to weight of word if belief that crime against god be so great that have hope of happiness in life will tell so if considers that a seems to god can not resent accident a might do crime against done willfully that may hope by life of piety to win forgiveness then will bid fly be learned in deepest of mystery of religion will view matter in different light to in be looked at by ignorant rabble at rate a matter be in hand be useless for to excite a far a personal danger go be willing to share with to take fault of unfortunate accident to avow that a be engaged together in act led to be equally culpable of crime unfortunately can not share greater trouble feeling of horror at what regard a sacrilege for rebu hold life of one animal more sacred than life of have more hesitation in shooting cat than deer surely god can not be so powerful in egypt impotent elsewhere yet if be a powerful how be that vengeance have not fallen upon other people who slay without hesitation animal so dear to be what have often wondered chebron said falling readily into snare for amuba have have many conversation on such subject point be constantly presenting be unable to solve hour later when servant entered told chebron amuba ameres wished to speak to former have recovered to extent from nervous excitement under have first suffered two lad bowed respectfully to high priest then standing submissively before waited for to address have sent for said after pause because seems to that although amuba be not concerned in sad business be probable that a be engaged with at time popular fury might not nicely discriminate between paused a if expecting reply amuba said quietly be have be saying to chebron lord consider fully a guilty a be be mere accident that arrow not mine be turned aside from mark aimed at be ready to share lot whether decide that truth will be published at once whether must attempt to fly ameres bowed head gravely then looked at son father although be ready to yield wish to will to obey in a in other matter must beseech to allow to denounce to bear fate feel must infinitely rather die than live with terrible weight guilt upon head expected a much of chebron applaud decision ameres said gravely chebron face brightened while of amuba fell ameres after pause went on did think a do chebron that accidental killing of cat be deadly offense against god must say denounce at once so consider chebron gazed at father a if must scarce credit sense of hearing while even amuba looked surprised have frequently asked question chebron have turned aside refused to answer be indeed from seeing that have inherited from spirit of inquiry deemed best that must not ascend to highest order of priesthood for if so knowledge must acquire must render a have rendered dissatisfied with state of thing around have not be for most unfortunate accident must never have spoken to further on subject a be feel that be duty to tell more have have hard struggle with have since left thought over from point of view what ought to do on one hand must have to tell thing known only to inner circle thing be known have whispered to one life must be forfeited on other hand if keep silent must doom to life of misery have resolved to take former alternative may first tell what know have long be viewed with suspicion by of higher priesthood who know view be that knowledge posse must not be confined to ourselves must be disseminated at least among class of educated egyptian capable of appreciating what be about to tell be not a whole fully understood perhaps by be outcome of own reflection founded upon light thrown upon thing by knowledge have gained asked one day chebron how knew about god how first revealed seeing that be not thing belong to world replied to at time that thing be mystery convenient answer with close mouth of questioner listen now will tell how religion first began upon earth not only in egypt in land man felt own powerlessness looking at operation of nature course of heavenly body issue of birth life death concluded rightly that there be god over thing god be too mighty for imagination to grasp be everywhere nowhere animated thing yet be nowhere to be found gave fertility caused famine gave life gave death gave light heat sent storm tempest be too infinite too various for untutored mind of early man to comprehend so tried to approach piecemeal worshiped a sun giver of heat life fertility worshiped a destructive god invoked aid a beneficent being offered sacrifice to appease wrath a terrible one so in time came to regard attribute of side light under viewed a being distinct different instead of being quality of one god a being quality attribute of separate god so there came to be god of life god of death one who sends fertility one who cause famine sort of inanimate object be defined a possessing fancied attribute either for good evil one almighty god became hidden lost in crowd of minor deity in nation fancy of man went one way in lower intelligence of people lower god in country serpent be sacred doubtless because originally be considered to typify at once subtleness destructive power of god in others tree be worshiped there be people who make sun god others moon forefather in egypt being wiser people than savage around worshiped attribute of god under many different name first eight great deity be chosen to typify chief characteristic of mighty one chnoumis neuf typified idea of spirit of god that spirit pervades creation ameura intellect of god osiris goodness of god ptah typified at once working power truthfulness of god khem represents productive power god who presides over multiplication of specie man beast fish vegetable so with rest of great god of minor divinity be reckoned by score in time certain animal bird other creature whose quality be considered to resemble one other of deity be in first place regarded a typical of then be held a sacred to then in sort of way become mixed up with god to be held almost a god be think history of religion of country highest intelligence men of education learning never quite lose sight of original truth recognize that god represent only various attribute of one almighty god rest of population lose sight of truth really worship a god various creation be really type shadow be perhaps necessary that must be so be easier for grosser more ignorant class to worship thing that can see understand to strive to please whose statue temple behold to fear to draw upon vengeance of represented to a destructive power than to worship inconceivable god without form shape so mighty imagination can not picture so beneficent so all providing so equable serene that human mind can not grasp even notion of man be material must worship material in form in think can comprehend so creates god for with figure likeness passion feeling like of many animal see around israelite maid whom brought hither with whom have frequently conversed tell that people before coming to land worshiped one god like unto of whom have told save that belittled by deeming that be own special god caring for above people of earth in other respect corresponded with almighty one whom who have gained glimpse of truth existed ere pantheon of egypt came into existence worship in heart seems to a if little handful of men who came to egypt hundred of year ago be only people in world who kept worship of one god clear undefiled chebron amuba listened in awestruck silence to word of high priest amuba face lit up with pleasure enthusiasm a listened to word seemed to clear away doubt difficulty have be in mind to chebron revelation though joyful one came a great shock mind too have long be unsatisfied have wondered questioned destruction at one blow of teaching of youth of have held sacred came at first a terrible shock spoke when priest concluded after pause resumed will understand chebron that what have told be not in entirety held even by most enlightened that sketch have given of formation of religion be in fact idea have formed a result of have learned a one initiated in learning of ancient egyptian from own study of oldest record tradition of people with whom egypt have come in contact that god merely represent attribute of one deity have personal existence a represented in temple be acknowledged more le completely by most deeply initiated in mystery of religion when offer sacrifice offer not to image behind altar to god creator god preserver god fertilizer to god ruler to god omnipotent over good evil thus see there be mockery in service although to bear inner meaning not understood by others worship personality endowed with principle principle see in mystic figure representation of deity see in type of attribute of higher deity may think that in telling have told thing must be told only to whose privilege be to have learned inner mystery of religion that maybe be untrue to vow lad be matter for own conscience personally have long be impressed with conviction that be better that circle of initiate must be very widely extended that capable by education intellect of appreciating mightiness of truth must no longer be left in darkness have be overruled must never have spoken have not accident taken place when see that whole happiness of life be at stake must secret ever be discovered will either be put to death despairing hopeless have to fly live despairing hopeless in foreign country have considered that balance of duty lay on side of lightening mind by revelation of what be within own be not a have told so much outcome of teaching have received a of own study conviction have arrived at a to nature of god thus then son can lay side horror have felt at thought by accidental slaying of cat offended god beyond forgiveness cat be typical of quality attributed to baste baste be typical of one of quality of one god oh father chebron exclaimed throwing on knee beside ameres kissing hand how good be what weight have lifted from mind what wonderful future have opened to if escape danger threatens now if have to die can do so like one who fear not future after death if live will no longer be oppressed with doubt difficulty have so long weighed upon though till now have given glimpse of great truth have at time felt not only that answer gave failed to satisfy seemed to also that with learning wisdom be yet unable to set right in matter a did in others upon questioned father have given life more than life have given power over fate be ready now to fly must think best to remain here risk may happen think must fly chebron in first place flight must be acknowledgment of guilt in second see where must fly to morrow at latest fact that creature be missing will be discovered a soon a be known that have gone hot pursuit must be set up if went straight down to sea must probably be overtaken long before got there even did reach port before pursuer might have to wait day before ship sailed then again did hide in secluded neighborhood must surely be found sooner later for news will go from end to end of egypt will be everyone duty to search for denounce messenger will be sent to country under egyptian government even if passed frontier by land sea peril must be a great a be here lastly did surmount difficulty reach land beyond sway of egypt must be exile for life therefore say that flight be last resource to be undertaken only if discovery be made may hope that evil fortune will lead searcher to conclusion that cat be killed here when be missed there will be search high low in one will join when conclusion be at last arrived at that have irrecoverably disappeared sort of hypothesis will be started to account for will think that probably wandered to hill became prey of hyena other wild beast will assert that have be killed hidden away others that have made way down to nile have be carried off by crocodile thus there be reason why suspicion must fall upon more than upon others will have to play part carefully chapter xi danger thicken when chebron amuba returned to room set apart for use study conversation did not turn upon slaying of cat danger threatened upon wonderful revelation ameres have made neither of thought for moment of doubting word feeling of reverence for wisdom learning must have be sufficient in for to accept without question statement that made to there be in addition own inward conviction of truth of theory appealed at once to head heart satisfied longing annihilated doubt difficulty cleared away at once pantheon of strange fantastic figure have be source of doubting amusement to amuba of bewilderment to chebron israelite maid ruth be right then amuba said know that told that forefather who came down into egypt believed that there be one god only that others be false god said that must not be seen pictured that be god of heaven so infinite that mind of man must form idea of everything said of seems to be true except inasmuch a said cared more for ancestor than for other men of course nation people must think that be wonderful chebron replied a paced restlessly up down room now that know truth seems impossible must have really believed that strange image of temple really represented god worried to think of must not see how must be yet never doubted existence seems to now that people of egypt be living in sort of nightmare why do who know so much suffer to remain in such darkness understood father to say chebron that be only in favor of more enlightened educated people obtaining glimpse of truth think can understand be lower class informed that god worshiped be merely shadow of great god not real living deity must either fall upon rend who told so a impious liar if must be made to believe must no longer hold to religion in rage might tear down temple abolish order of priesthood altogether spread tumult havoc through land rebel against authority destroy with one blow power glory of egypt be true chebron said thoughtfully doubt ignorant mass of people require something material to worship need to believe in god who will punish impiety wrong reward well doing religion of egypt a believe be better suited to daily want than worship of deity so mighty great good that intellect must fail altogether to grasp conversation be suddenly interrupted by entrance of ruth paucis be missing when came back from walk went out to animal door of house be open cat have gone mysa say will come at once help look for be to send woman who can be spared from house to join in search work be instantly abandoned for knew that paucis have be chosen to be sacred cat at bubastes even have be one of others news that be missing must have caused general excitement so esteemed be even most common animal of cat tribe that if cat happened to die in house inhabitant went into mourning shaved eyebrow in token of grief embalmer be sent for dead cat made into mummy conveyed with much solemnity to great catacomb set aside for burial of sacred animal thus news that paucis be missing be so important that work be at once laid aside men female slave began to search garden thoroughly examining bush tree calling loudly to missing animal chebron amuba joined in search a actively a rest where can be mysa exclaimed why must have wandered away never did so before though door of cat house be often left open day where do think can have gone to do think must have got over wall must get over wall easily enough chebron replied be terrible misfortune continued mysa with tear in eye mamma fainted on hearing news woman be burning feather under nose slapping hand sprinkling water on face will be done if doe not come back before to morrow for hear solemn procession be coming from bubastes to fetch away poor dear paucis seemed so contented happy have everything must want what can have induced to wander away cat be often uncertain thing amuba said be not like dog who be always ready to follow master who will lie down for hour ready to start out whenever called upon yes paucis be not common cat amuba did not want to catch mouse bird for living have everything must possibly want cushion to lie on fresh water milk to drink plenty of everything to eat even will not satisfy cat when instinct to wander come upon amuba said ameres soon came out of house upon hearing that cat be not to be found either in garden within gave order for whole of male of household to sally out in search to inform neighbor what have happened to pray to search garden be also to make inquiry of met whether have seen cat resembling paucis be very serious matter ameres said after choice of priest of bubastes have fixed upon paucis to be sacred cat of temple of bubastes greatest care caution must have be exercised respecting animal toward whom eye of egypt be turned for last two three week question a to cat be to succeed to post of honor have be discussed in household great have be excitement among family possessing cat have smallest chance whatever of being selected what will be said if cat be not forthcoming when procession arrives to morrow from bubastes to conduct there tremble to think of excitement stir will be prodigious matter will become of state importance well stand here go at once join in search felt horribly guilty when talking to mysa chebron said of course be very proud that paucis be chosen for temple know that have really be grieving over approaching loss of favorite of course be nothing to what will feel when find that news can be obtained of creature be hard to play part to pretend to know nothing about when time one knew be lying dead buried in garden yes felt that amuba agreed can not help mysa will probably in course of life have very much more serious grief to bear than loss of cat day search be maintained when be dark great number of men with torch searched point far near on side of thebe news have now spread far wide number of friend of high priest called to inquire into particular of loss to condole with on calamity have befallen house innumerable theory be broached a to course animal must have taken after once getting out of garden while chance of recovery be eagerly discussed general opinion be that must speedily be found cat of such remarkable appearance must be argued attract notice wherever went even if did not return of own accord a be generally expected be considered certain that must be brought back before many hour when upon following morning be found that have not returned that search for have be fruitless there be feeling akin to consternation for first time men ventured to hint that something must have befallen sacred cat either in ramble evil dog must have fallen upon slain must have be carried off by crocodile a quenched thirst at pool that have fallen by hand of man one even suggested egyptian must be capable of act of such sacrilege idea be too monstrous to entertain for moment mysa have cried to sleep broke forth in fresh lamentation when upon waking in morning heard that favorite be still absent while mother took calamity so seriously to heart that kept bed slave went about silently spoke with bated breath a if death have taken place in house ameres chebron be anxious disturbed knowing that excitement must grow hour while amuba jethro joining busily in search starting on horseback first thing in morning to make inquiry in more distant locality be secretly amused at fuss excitement be being made over loss of cat be well for household of ameres that occupied so exalted position in priesthood have be private citizen excitement increased hour by hour when vigilant search carried on far wide for missing cat proved fruitless must speedily have led to outbreak of popular fury respect due to high priest of osiris position well known learning benevolence rendered impossible for supposition to be entertained for moment that cat must have come to untimely end within limit of house garden be now generally believed that after wandering away a even best conducted of cat will do at time have fallen victim to savage beast have be devoured by crocodile so heavy be penalty for offense so tremendous sacrilege in killing cat that act be almost unknown in egypt few instance be recorded of having taken place a in present case enormity of act must be vastly increased by size beauty of cat fact that have be chosen for temple of bubastes seemed to put altogether beyond range of possibility that creature have fallen by hand of man when week passed without tidings be generally accepted a fact that cat must be dead ameres household in accordance with custom shaved eyebrow in token of mourning although not suspected of having have anything to do with loss of cat event nevertheless threw sort of cloud over household of ameres be considered to be such terrible stroke of ill luck that cat above cat must have be lost upon very eve of being installed a most sacred animal in temple of bubastes that seemed a if must be direct proof of anger of god there be general shrinking on part of friend acquaintance from intercourse with people upon whom misfortune have fallen ameres cared little for public opinion continued on way with placid calmness ministering in temple passing rest of time in study example of ameres however be wholly lost upon wife deference paid to a wife of high priest also to a principal figure in service in woman took part be very dear to felt change greatly slave have very bad time of worried ameres with constant complaint a to changed demeanor of acquaintance indifference to fact that be no longer asked to entertainment be in way pacified by quiet assurance that be useless for to irritate over trifle that matter must mend in time a day went on so far from mending thing became worse group of people frequently assembled round house shout of anger hatred be raised when of occupant entered left even when ameres be passing through street in procession with sacred emblem hoot cry be raised among crowd chebron took state of thing greatly to heart more than once implored father to allow to declare truth openly bear consequence be not afraid of death father have not trained to regard life a of account do not in feast always see image of dead man carried past to remind that death be always among have mysa mother fear death far le than constant anxiety be hanging over ameres must not hear of sacrifice pretend that there be danger chebron thought at first that matter must soon pas over own be wrong unfortunate fact that creature be chosen a sacred cat for temple at bubastes have given loss prominence far beyond there must have be have be ordinary animal of class affair have made extraordinary sensation in city still can not think that enemy must be at work stirring up people against suspect although may be wrong that ptylus be concerned in matter since reappeared after sudden absence following night when overheard conversation have affected feeling of warmth friendship believe have be entirely feigned whether be one of overheard be unable to say sudden disappearance certainly favor that idea at rate can have real reason for extra cordiality toward at present must more naturally still feel aggrieved at rejection of son a husband for mysa thought at first when told what have overheard that possibly be plot against life now feel sure of doubt believe a measure be taken that conversation be not overheard that only few word reached listener manner to be designed to allay suspicion might have conceived have a much of conversation a be overheard be reported to have have just opposite effect at rate enemy be at work even be to sacrifice by admitting that slew missing animal not only must death be result general ruin must fall upon mob must easily be taught to believe must to great extent be responsible opinion have expressed must be quoted against even favor of king must not maintain in present position in defiance of popular clamor son must stand fall together jethro offered yesterday if liked to dig up remains of cat carry away hide under rock at distance think danger must be greater than in allowing matter to remain a be be certain that house be watched a know servant going in out after have be rudely hustled thrown down have be beaten returned well nigh stripped to skin doubt not that attack be made in order to discover if have anything concealed under garment be jethro to venture upon attempt might either be attacked cat found upon might be followed place where hid marked down thing must go on a be ameres did not tell chebron whole of conversation have have with jethro after declining offer to endeavor to dispose of body of cat elsewhere said jethro although can not accept perilous enterprise have offered to undertake will intrust with charge will show how confide in devotion to family must storm burst must populace of town once become thoroughly imbued with idea that sacred cat have be slain here there will be outburst of fanatical rage will for time carry before for care absolutely nothing be perfectly willing to die a soon a time come have done work to best of power can meet mighty one with uplifted head have wronged man have labored life for good of people have never spared be ready for rest must fain save chebron mysa from harm even in wrath populace will not injure woman mysa without protector might fall into evil hand a to however can hing chebron must save if grows up will think do good in world have not strength vigor of amuba be not behind other lad of age have be well educated mind be active heart good look to jethro to save if be possible with amuba for fear that amuba be in a much danger a be must slave be seized questioned perhaps flogged till say what know fact must be sure to come out that two lad be together among animal on morning before cat be missed will be noticed too that took with bow arrow will therefore be assumed that responsibility of act lie upon of chebron know must proclaim truth if have opportunity for speech angry crowd doe not stop to listen same fate will befall who be stranger to manner can hardly conceive frenzy of excitement rage in population of egypt be thrown by killing of cat doubt whether even king person must be held sacred be guilt of such offense brought home to of course fact that unfortunate beast be to have gone to temple of bubastes make death matter ten time graver than ordinary therefore must storm burst there be hope for of in flight question be whither must fly certainly must be safe nowhere in egypt be possible that must journey north reach sea must do so before news reached port naturally messenger must be sent to frontier town even governor of province lying east of great sea must hear of must leave country cross desert might be seized sent back on arrival for same reason route from here to port on arabian sea be closed to seems to that only hope of safety lie in reaching country far up nile gaining meroe over whose people authority of egypt be shadow thence possibly might day reach arabian sea cross that pas up through country east of great sea traveling by route by came hither reach country long before must leave savage tribe start upon journey matter must have be forgotten danger might befall that of arrest for participation in matter must not be among know that fidelity friendship for son of late king must cause to risk danger hardship for sake that if bravery prudence must take safely through such terrible danger a must be encountered in such journey a speak of will conduct through ask to let chebron share protection to render such service a will give to amuba can promise willingly lord jethro answered have treated amuba more a brother than servant since came here will treat a if be brother to amuba now that danger threatens journey speak of must indeed be long dangerous one agree with that only by accomplishing be there even chance of escape then commit son to charge jethro do so with full confidence that if be possible for to make journey in safety will do so have already placed in hand of chigron embalmer large sum of money can trust absolutely be through patronage that have risen from being small worker to be master of one of largest business in egypt have embalming of sacred animal belonging to temple several others will hide boy for time until be ready to start on journey when be once few day south of thebe will be fairly safe from pursuit for will never think of looking for in direction will make sure that will attempt to leave country by sea by eastern desert that may possibly try to reach of tribe in west so to go down upon great sea there thought at first that might be best direction tribe be subject to must naturally regard egyptian going among a fugitive from justice so hand over to can rely upon lord to carry out direction do be possible to serve two lad what country through have to pas be like inhabitant know not at least will do best to reach arabian sea a direct amuba be hardy strong chebron though le powerful in frame be courageous able to use weapon must of course travel in disguise spoke something about daughter in what way can serve have now accompanied in walk for month must lay down life for fear that can hing ameres said after pause have many friend one of whom will doubtless receive at first must if be possible that must go to relative of mine who live at amyla fifty mile up river be staying with two year ago will know house see how must take boy will be sufficient charge on hand will have mother with though fear that latter have little real affection for having time to think of aught own pleasure amusement will be able to place among many friend have be not present so much be thinking of a future must like little mysa to marry happily be little self willed have be indulged although of course must marry a arrange for must not give to one who be not altogether agreeable to fear must anything happen to same consideration might not be paid to inclination however jethro see manner in can be useful to mysa so far a be concerned thing must be left to take own course trust jethro said that foreboding will not be verified can not believe that absurd suspicion can draw away heart of people from one whom have so respected a ameres shook head people be always fickle jethro easily led love respect for god render easy for one who work on feeling to lash into fury else be a nothing in eye in comparison with religion be blind worship if will be sincere one of people in world there be none to whom religion count so much a to egyptian be interwoven with daily life feast procession be religious eat drink clothe according to decree undertake action however trifling without consulting god thus therefore while in other respect obedience be paid to law be maddened by supposed insult to religion breach of observance know that be in danger idea have held of regeneration of people by purifying religious belief have be used a weapon against know from what have come to ear that have be hinted among that in spite of high office have respect for god accusation be false none le dangerous for nothing be more difficult than to expose annihilate falsehood spread like wildfire clearest demonstration of falsity fails to reach tithe of who believe however be needle to speak of now know what wish to do if danger come get boy away conduct to place have indicated if be from home seek take there waste time in vain attempt to succor if be attacked may possibly be case make pray resistance save such a may be needed to get away above try to interfere on behalf one man though endowed with supernatural strength can not overcome mob trying to aid must not benefit might cost life so deprive chebron amuba of protector jethro promised strictly to follow instruction have received to devote in case of need solely to insuring safety of boy two day later ameres sent chebron amuba away to farm told to remain there until sent for can not go in out here without unpleasantness said have best be away presence here can be of use be probably quite a much suspected a be a to mother sister present state of thing be inconvenient to be there can be danger for however violent mob must not molest female why must not also father go away until trouble be passed can not leave duty chebron must benefit if did be convinced that cry against be mere pretext have be seized by enemy who dare not attack openly be to depart from thebe absence must be denounced a proof of guilt people be inflamed more more against nowhere in egypt must be safe only course be to face storm trusting to integrity of life to absence of deed must offend great god believe in to knowledge that life be in hand when be will not before will return to who gave must not apply to king for guard king spoke to yesterday at termination of council ameres replied told that have be informed of murmur of populace against said that a one of most trusted counselor a high priest of osiris knew that charge against be baseless that in view of proneness of people of thebe to excitement tumult must be glad to order company of soldier to keep guard over house refused said that be conscious of evil that none must say be slack in ministration in temple that have ever spoken word in disrespect of religion that a for disappearance of sacred cat of so much have be made have have hand in that have happened to have be be sure result of accident be to have soldier placed to guard must be confession be conscious of ill doing knew have forfeited protection of god must too help to keep up talk excitement trusted must die away ere long chebron did not think of further questioning order of ameres hour later amuba rode out to farm before started ameres have long talk with chebron told that have placed in charge of jethro in event of popular outbreak taking place remember chebron said that come of affair be not to blame for accident of killing cat thing be in hand of great god arrow must not have struck twig flown straight to heart of creature have not be will moreover must always remember that loss of cat be pretext for tumult populace believe that be angry on account of loss of sacred cat whereas in fact be instrument in hand of enemy have doubt now that plot overheard in temple be directed against life have not loss of cat happened opportunely served a lever with to work against plot must have taken other form trust sincerely that fate may befall sister may never have to marry son of man who have plotted against life be use thinking of now must aught happen before meet again remember have placed in hand of jethro have delegated authority to be shrewd strong courageous can be relied upon to do what be best in amuba will find friend who will be a brother to so farewell son may great one who rule thing keep stay at farm have hitherto be regarded by chebron a delightful change from city upon occasion proceeded there sad depressed in spirit even here be watched see chebron amuba said a rode along do see runner behind doubtless will follow to farm set watch upon there however there at least can search a much a like find out nothing chapter xii death of ameres day passed slowly at farm lad went out listlessly to watch cattle treading in seed other operation on land be too anxious a to what be going on in city to feel slightest interest in work of farm second fourth day after coming jethro have paid short visit to say that there be change in situation officer in command of troop whom king have sent down to within short distance of house have come down to mob a be shouting outside gate threatened with severe displeasure of king unless desisted from demonstration have be answered with shout god be above king not even king can protect who insult amense said on occasion of second visit have left house taken up abode with relation in city declaring that anxiety disgrace be killing have wished to take mysa with girl have positively refused to leave father a mother seemed indifferent whether went stayed have have way in private talk with amuba jethro said be relief to have gone be bad enough before went for last three day have be doing nothing weep bewail till house have be well nigh unbearable ameres go backward forward between house temple walking unmoved through gathered near door who be for most part quiet when pass being abashed by presence of one who have so long be held in high esteem among a for mysa seems to think only of father hebrew girl be great comfort to for while example of mistress shout of populace have terribly scared other maid go about house in fear trembling ruth be quiet self contained a if be again in quiet cottage with grandfather greatly comfort sustains mysa ameres said to only morning that mysa be fortunate indeed in chebron have furnished with so brave steadfast companion at time like on evening of fifth day jethro came suddenly in at house boy started to foot a entered for saw at once that something terrible have happened face be stained with blood breath came short for have run for six intervening mile between farm city at top of speed quick lord said there be not moment to lose whole matter have be discovered ere long will be here in pursuit of what of father chebron exclaimed will tell about afterward chebron there be time for talking now order must be instantly carried out where be fellow who be spying over one of be probably seated outside at entrance to farm must have passed a entered amuba replied have not seen more than one at time since first came take up arm follow jethro said taking heavy staff from corner of room followed by lad went outside gate be now getting dark a passed out man standing near approached a if to see who be without word jethro sprang forward brought down staff with tremendous force upon head fell without cry upon road there be fear of giving alarm jethro said grimly set off in run in direction of city at pace taxed power of chebron to keep up with once twice a ran boy gasped out question a to father safety jethro did not appear to hear kept on at steady pace presently stopped suddenly listened vague confused sound be heard in front of jethro quitted road took course over field amuba heard sound increase be presently conscious that crowd of people be passing along road be well managed to get through jethro said must have made short work of have arrived at farm found unprepared jethro did not return to road kept on in oblique line toward foot of hill near city where be going jethro amuba asked at last be going to chigron embalmer ameres have arranged with to hide there for present boy knew place for have more than once be there to watch process of embalming body preparing for burial be extensive establishment for chigron be one of most celebrated embalmer of day not only did embalm kept with men who performed further process required namely wrapping up in mummy cloth construction of great case placing body in ready to be handed over to friend be usually distinct separate trade embalmer generally returning body to friend after have completed process of embalming set of men then prepared corpse for burial while mummy case sarcophagus be prepared by men of trade of three trade that of embalmer be held in by far highest respect work being considered a sacred embalmer ranking associating with priest in chigron establishment men of three trade worked apart separate from other although chigron be in fact at head of personally superintended only embalming men of other trade being directed by own master be a if three establishment have be placed near other simply for purpose of convenience when reached house of chigron jethro went forward alone knocked at door attendant presented give ring to chigron jethro said say that bearer of must fain speak to here in two three minute chigron came out have brought lad hither in obedience to order of ameres jethro said told that have arranged matter with ameres chigron asked be more jethro said villain who sought ruin have triumphed furious mob afternoon broke into house murdered chebron doe not know yet though can not suspect that something terrible have happened a must not answer question fearing that might break down when strength be most needed egyptian uttered exclamation of sorrow fool madman exclaimed in land none be more worthy of honor than ameres be just generous ever ready to befriend who needed aid calm in judgment powerful in council surely god must be angry with egypt when suffered one to fall victim to passion of mob where be lad will conduct to place have already prepared worker have left so there be fear in passing through house at jethro call lad came up follow lord chigron said to chebron have have everything in readiness for reception for day must that visit have be made on more cheerful occasion embalmer led way through portion of house occupied by then entered large apartment whose floor be covered with sawdust here on slab of stone lay number of body of in first state of preparation while in still larger apartment behind be number of stone bath long enough to contain body be occupied by corps have undergone first state of preparation be now lying covered with strong solution of salt water beyond again be other chamber for reception of body embalmed by other process than of salt passing through door at rear lad found in open air again above hill rose in precipitous rock chigron led way along foot of for little distance then stopped at portal hewn in rock time have carried lighted lamp although chamber in dead be lying be illuminated with lamp hanging from ceiling upon entering

occasion to come out to back of house probably few know of existence of tomb must have ground for believing that there be danger will take other measure for concealment must need anything hesitate to say so owe position to patronage of lord ameres there be nothing must not do to insure safety of son now lord will retire will presently send by trusty servant food of have doubt that stand in need chebron said few word in thanks be too anxious full of grief to say more directly chigron have left turned to jethro now jethro tell be prepared for worst dear father be more be not so be too true chebron jethro replied noble father have be killed by base cowardly mob urged on by villain of priesthood chebron threw down on one of couch wept bitterly while amuba be almost a deeply affected for ameres have behaved to with kindness of father be not until following morning that chebron be sufficiently recovered to ask jethro to relate to detail of father death be in garden jethro began mysa ruth be in boat on pond be towing when heard tumult at gate pulled boat ashore hurried up to house told mysa to retire to apartment that be not to leave noise might hear that being father command then went out to gate just a got there fell in crowd of people rushed through a there be only two three of gardener who have run up must hing to stop just a reached house father came out into portico said 'good people what will have ' in front of be silent moment abashed by presence calm manner in spoke others behind set up cry 'where be sacred cat will find ' while others again shouted out 'down with impious priest ameres replied 'you can search place if will though indeed seems that need not permission seeing that have taken matter into own hand only pray enter not house there be lady of family other woman there swear to that alive dead be cat to be found there ' cry be raised search garden ' in struck that there be two party among mob one ignorant bigoted believing really that offense have be committed against god other men who kept in background who be moving spirit be not pleased when saw crowd so readily abandon idea of searching house scatter over garden for seemed to that from one of gardener others might have obtained sort of clew might put on road to discovery saw that several among crowd have with dog trained for chase made more uneasy told one of men to run at once summon troop then followed crowd be more uneasy to see that without wasting time in searching elsewhere made straight to inclosure where animal be kept sooner did get there than began to search urging on dog to assist suddenly started for there be touch upon shoulder looking round saw ameres bemember instruction jethro ' said in quiet voice commit chebron to charge ' lord ' exclaimed 'why be here troop be short distance away why do not place under protection ' have done wrong jethro replied calmly ' have not offended god have ever wronged one of countryman why must fly ' at moment there be yell of rage among crowd knew that one of accursed hound must have smelled dead cat scratched earth from over then heard voice cry above rest even now wound be manifest have be pierced by arrow even a told sacred cat have be slain ' then crowd turned 'fly jethro ameres said 'it be last command even then must not obey there be death in eye of who be rushing toward shouting 'down with despiser of god down with slayer of sacred cat seeing that rushed at after that be confusion have caught up staff from portico a passed with struck right left many fell know before closed with blow be showered upon staff then fell from hand fought with naked fist several time be beaten down time rose again then a in dream seemed to hear father command ' commit chebron to care burst way through threw upon group standing further on saw a broke through must hing there father lay on ground looking a calm peaceful a when have spoken to five minute before white garment be stained with blood half of dagger stood up just over heart there be time to see more last command be to be obeyed shaking off who tried to hold evading blow aimed at with knife fled a rushed out through gate saw troop have sent for coming toward house be too late now besides of pursuer be close behind so without pause took road to farm think be have to tell chebron be weeping bitterly amuba who be deeply affected went over to console chebron know what be feeling now blame too greatly for calamity know what father said that be accident that be doubtless will of great god that arrow must fly a did declared that believed that be result of conspiracy that a heard in temple there be men determined to take life few minute later embalmer entered bringing food saw at once that chebron have be informed of fate have befallen father have heard aught of what be passing in city amuba asked yes chigron answered naught else be talked about many of concerned in deed escaped by entrance before soldier arrived there over wall many be seized be now in prison for sacrilegious deed in raising hand against person of high priest of osiris there be tumult in city during night many maintaining that deed be well done others contrary who have be taken declared that have be informed by one who said knew for certain that cat be buried in inclosure that have be slain by young lord here a have be seen going with bow arrow to inclosure be there for time after cat be never seen again general opinion be that though prisoner taken will be punished with flogging with death life be also assuredly forfeited that even friendship of king for father must not avail to protect for that like others must obey law that law of egypt be that whomsoever will take life of cat will be slain be perfectly willing to die chebron said greatest regret now be that did not follow first impulse denounce a accidental killer of cat blame must have then be attached to father to disgrace must have fallen upon whole family embalmer said for nearly related to one who performed impious action must need suffer with not that blame chebron for know that father did not do so told when arranged must if need be furnish with hiding place that although might need refuge must be for fault of own understand how must have said so seeing terrible guilt of even accidentally taking life of cat specially of cat be sacred above others in land still know father wisdom equaled goodness although own can not understand saying be content to accept will do in power to save doubtless search after will be hot one must hope for best will go out see what be doing jethro said may be that will be more safe to move away at once than to remain here in case embalmer said will need to be disguised before start be known that ameres have two fair skinned slave one of be concerned with young lord here in matter also that other after fighting furiously in garden a heard slaying several of master enemy managed to make escape fortunately have material at hand use paint stain in abundance for sere clothes of dead decoration of coffin can easily make a dark a of people that with one of wig egyptian garment will alter so that so long a look one fairly in face there will be fear whatever of discovery must not look up for even when have blackened lash lightness of eye must at once betray in hour jethro be transformed into middle class citizen of thebe started on mission of inquiry during day official came to establishment made many inquiry after missing lad not contented with denial went through whole building examining chamber closely be known said to chigron that several time came here that ameres be patron of yours be duty to search house where shelter might have be given though can hardly believe that one must hold communication far le receive into house person guilty of such act of sacrilege a have be however there be chance of escaping message have be sent over egypt moreover a have horse can not have gone far be first house have searched for servant say same that son of ameres be frequently here be not here very frequently chigron replied though certainly came sometimes be interested in watching various process chebron have in fact be several time to embalmer amuba have accompanied although must have preferred staying away for to whole scene be repulsive chebron temperament differed however widely from of friend dead be sacred in egypt rite ceremony connected with bore religious character have fear of death deemed sleep must last three thousand year be for reason that body of human being sacred animal be so carefully embalmed laid away either in massive tomb rock hewn cavern believed a have be proved rightly that remains so carefully prepared must endure for time thought that when spirit returned to must resume former shape in particular thus dead of rank be embalmed process however in case of wealthy differing widely from to body of poorer class be submitted there be many kind of embalming varying according to mean of family of deceased process employed for wealthy be long expensive one first official called scribe marked on side of corpse where aperture must be made be cut by person who after doing so fled pursued with execration pelted with stone a although necessary operation be considered dishonorable one a injury to sacred body through aperture embalmer removed whole of internal organ after being cleansed embalmed in spice be deposited in four vas be subsequently placed in tomb with coffin of vas contained part sacred to separate deity body be then filled with aromatic resin spice rubbed for thirty day with mixture of same ingredient in case of very wealthy whole body be then gilded in other case only face portion of body skin of mummy so preserved be found to be of olive color dry flexible a if tanned feature be preserved appear a during life teeth hair of head eyebrow be well preserved in case instead of aromatic resin body be filled with bitumen in others saltpeter be used body being soaked in for long time finally filled with resin bitumen in second quality of mummy of person of middle class incision be not made resin bitumen be used body soaked in salt for long time in case of poorer class body be simply dipped into liquid pitch none of however be treated in establishment of chigron who operated only upon body of wealthy after preparation be complete body passed from hand of embalmer into of class who enveloped in covering be linen bandage in case of rich be sometimes thousand yard in length be then inclosed in sort of case fitting closely to mummied body case be richly painted covered in front with network of bead bugle arranged in tasteful form face being overlaid with thick gold leaf eye made of enamel again be placed in other case sometimes three four in number similarly ornamented with painting gilding whole inclosed in sarcophagus coffin of wood stone profusely decorated with painting sculpture be then handed over to family of deceased afterward taken in solemn procession across sacred lake followed by mourning relative throwing dust upon head egyptian city have lake of kind natural artificial notice be given beforehand to judge public of day on funeral must take place assembled at side of lake where decorated boat in readiness for passage be lying before coffin must be placed upon boat be lawful for person present to bring forward accusation against deceased if must be proved that have led evil life judge declared that body be deprived of accustomed sepulture if accuser failed to establish charge be subject to heaviest penalty if there be accuser if accusation be not proved judge declared dead man innocent body be placed in boat carried across lake then either taken to family catacomb to room specially prepared for reception in house of deceased greatest grief shame be felt by family of deprived of right of sepulture for believed that thereby be excluded from mansion of blessed that in course of transmigration through spirit must pas before again returned to human form might be condemned to inhabit body of unclean animal a none from lowest to very highest rank must escape ordeal of public accusation after death there can be little doubt that ceremony exercised most wholesome effect upon life of egyptian be most efficacious in repressing tyranny cruelty vice of kind among even most powerful king be restrained by knowledge must give cause of complaint to subject be liable after death to be accused deprived of right of lying in mighty tomb have so carefully prepared for reception chebron brain therefore while be watching process of embalming be busy with thought fancy a to future of spirit have inhabited body looked at have already passed into body of animal be still disconnected searching for abode through what change must pas how long must be time before returned to human tenement for three thousand year be believed to be shortest period of transition through various change in case of man of purest most blameless life while in other case period be vastly extended a amuba be not gifted with strong imagination saw in whole matter merely preservation of body in opinion have much better have be buried placed on funeral pile destroyed by fire visit to embalmer have constituted most unpleasant part of duty a chebron companion jethro have anticipated when left that visit to city must be of short duration that must return in hour at latest a day passed night fell without return lad became exceedingly anxious feared that something serious have taken place to detain either disguise have be detected have be seized by populace other great misfortune must have befallen have be arranged indeed that must night have started upon journey jethro after return be to have made out list of such article a deemed necessary for flight chigron have promised to purchase for plan however be completely upset by nonappearance late in afternoon chigron went down into city to ascertain if must if jethro have be discovered for name have be associated with of boy be not believed indeed that have taken actual part in slaying of cat be deemed certain from close connection with disappearance shortly before time have suddenly left farm that be in league with chigron returned with news so far a must learn nothing have be heard of jethro other subject be talked of in city event of previous day indignation of people be equally divided between murderer of ameres slayer of sacred cat boy be full of grief perplexity to amuba jethro have taken place of elder brother have cheered in darkest moment of life have be friend companion ever since thought ill might have befallen filled with sorrow with be mingled intense anxiety a to future without jethro strong arm advice how be terrible journey to be accomplished chebron be in state either to act plan deep depression have seized upon cared not whether escaped not must indeed have hailed detection death a boon intense therefore be amuba relief when late in evening footstep be heard in outer chamber jethro entered sprang to foot with cry of gladness oh jethro thank god have returned have suffered terribly on account what have happened to so long delayed return here there be fresh trouble jethro replied in stern voice fresh trouble jethro in what way even chebron who have scarcely sat up languidly on couch on jethro entrance looked up with interest for jethro answer mysa have be carried off replied grimly chebron sprang to foot be devoted to sister for moment new calamity effaced remembrance of have preceded mysa carried off exclaimed at same moment a amuba who have done when be done how did learn be question broke quickly from lad on leaving here went a arranged down into city jethro replied there be difficulty in learning what there be to learn for business seemed suspended street be full of group of people talking over event of yesterday whole city be shaken by fact that two such terrible act of sacrilege a slaying of sacred cat of bubastes murder of high priest of osiris must have taken place within so short time of other prophesy that terrible calamity will befall land that offended god will in way wreak vengeance upon royal order have be issued enjoining men to search for arrest person concerned in murder of ameres doubtless severest penalty will be dealt to same decree order arrest wherever found enjoins upon official throughout kingdom to keep strict watch in town village to examine stranger who may present to send hither bound in chain young men who may fail to give satisfactory account of sacrifice will be offered up at temple throughout land to appease wrath of god messenger have be dispatched in direction in province seemed to consider certain that in few hour hiding place must be discovered made sure that have made either for seacoast desert on one side other a messenger must reach coast long before must do so be considered impossible for to get through unnoticed then went to house not intending to go in simply to see if in neighborhood have heard further news gate be open quite crowd of people be passing in out to gratify curiosity by gazing on scene relying upon disguise went in with rest none entered house for guard of soldier have be stationed there passed round at back presently lyptis old female slave came out to fetch water spoke to in assumed character only shook head made reply then believing that like others in house be attached to family must be trusted spoke to in natural voice at once knew made sign to to be silent withdrew with alone to bush tear be streaming down face jethro ' exclaimed 'did god ever before hurl such calamity upon household dear master be dead lord chebron be hunted for a men hunt for wild beast dear young mistress mysa be missing ' beissing ' exclaimed 'what do mean ' 'have not heard ' said ' have heard nothing ' cried 'tell ' after gate be beaten down crowd rushed along into garden four men burst into house ran from chamber to chamber until entered that of young mistress heard scream moment later came out again bearing figure enveloped in wrapping strove to stop there be naught woman in house struck two of to ground rushed out of ran out into garden cry for aid there saw terrible scene great struggle be going on presently broke forth covered with blood wound ran swiftly past none heeded cry 'when soldier arrived told officer what have happened be too late then nothing must be done have there be guard over house thing must never have happened asked if must describe to appearance of men said that be attired a respectable citizen that from language manner believed that be ruffian of lowest class for time be so overwhelmed with news must think of nothing went out roamed through street at last bethought of girl ruth be with mysa at time might if questioned be able to tell more than old woman have done therefore returned have to wait for three hour before old lyptis came out again ' want to speak to ruth ' said out to ' have gone ' said ' repeated 'where whither ' 'that know not be not until hour after mysa be carried off that one thought of be too overwhelmed with grief at death of dear lord loss of mysa to give thought to young israelite then one asked where be one have noticed went to mysa chamber thinking that villain who carried young mistress off might have slain there be sign of there ' 'but be with mysa be not ' asked 'when attack be made did not pas in with when came in from garden 'yes replied came in together passed through for gathered in front chamber being greatly frightened at clamor at gate a passed young mistress said 'keep silent what be use of screaming cry '' asked if be sure ruth be not carried off a well a mysa 'quite sure said bore figure other three cleared way 'and be last time asked 'that of saw israelite 'it be answered must have passed out by door at end of passage might well have done without being observed by of ' be new mystery why ruth must have fled must not guess because a soon a soldier appeared there be more danger in remaining besides did not think ruth be one to shrink from danger however there be more to be learned again went out into street chapter xiii search for mysa perhaps ruth have gone to tell mother that mysa be lost chebron suggested when jethro have gone so far in story must hardly have be jethro replied for must have told that mother returned early morning to house with many relative that be weeping mourning round body of father have ruth gone to must either have returned with lyptis must have heard where be did hear how mother bore misfortune jethro be overwhelmed with grief lyptis said at father death so overwhelmed that seemed to have thought for anything else have of course be told night before mysa be missing seemed to make impression upon only said that doubtless friend have carried off to save from danger that chebron wickedness have brought upon morning made further inquiry did not seem in serious alarm magistrate when came last night to inquire into whole matter took note of mysa having be carried off when on coming again morning found that nothing have be heard of gave order that search must be made for proclamation be issued afternoon denouncing punishment on who carried off enjoining who must give information on subject to present before immediately since came out from house have be wandering about trying to think what be best to be done hoping that something might occur to must put upon track of villain who carried off think of carrying out plan for to morrow jethro chebron asked anxiously must never go away from here in ignorance of what have become of certainly not chebron consider duty a well a inclination to stay here until be found father spoke to of a well a of a did not see way in must aid said that must take chance meaning take chance under guardianship of mother to obtain day husband whom must love present misfortune entirely alters case have need of active help be risk must postpone start whether will be able to stay here not be doubtful day pass without news being received of capture in province north of will increase belief that be hiding somewhere in neighborhood of city in case search will become more more earnest however for day two may be safe here a to that though must abide by chigron opinion be running small risk in concealing here if considers danger be becoming greater than be willing to run must betake ourselves to hill there be lonely spot there where must lie concealed for long time at least a long a such supply of food water a must carry with hold out at rate must set aside thought of flight for present devote energy to discovery rescue of mysa think have far to look for contriver of outrage amuba said seems to that be of piece with whole of misfortune have befallen know ameres refused request of ptylus for mysa a wife for son after came plot overheard in temple for murder of one knowledge that be overheard put stop to scheme then came stirring up of people partly by story of unfortunate cat partly by whisper ameres although high priest of osiris be yet scorner of god then came attack upon house in while main body of mob attacked ameres chosen band carried off mysa villain ptylus have several motif to spur on in first place there be anger at rejection of son suit next that must at death of ameres naturally succeed to high priesthood thirdly may have thought that if must obtain possession of mysa marry to son must bring with small portion of father land a dowry with influence a high priest must have with king council must rely upon obtaining share of estate especially a villain must calculate chebron a well a father must be put out of way have only to keep mysa immured until power a high priest be consolidated then if gain consent of king to match mysa must not refuse to accept fate prepared for think that have accurately reasoned out case amuba that have penetrated whole conspiracy question be what be to do must not be jethro chebron cried excitedly pacing up down chamber mysa can not bear plexo spoke of with something like horror when heard of proposal made like be thin lipped crafty cruel mysa have better be dead than married to think can promise chebron jethro said grimly that marriage will never come about may not find mysa who may be hidden either in house in one of many chamber of temple in cave near at rate can find plexo before leave egypt will slay a well a father whom regard a murderer of ameres may not be able to do to get away in case must journey alone be not going to quit egypt leave to enjoy gain of crime a finished speaking chigron entered be coming in to see if jethro have returned be told reason for prolonged absence abduction of mysa determination to remain search for place of concealment shook head be rash resolution even be free to come go a choose chance of finding out hiding place must be small indeed hunted a yourselves be quest seems to be absolutely hopeless one a to remaining here long think must be madness be not only for say for in first place there be so many men employed here that coming in going out must be sure to be noticed by one in second place cave must scarcely escape search second time be not for workman must conceal in house if saw men in search of approaching must place in one of inner casing of mummy put two three more casing on then lying a must be among number of corps in similar state of advancement toward burial none must think of opening case with so many people about must be well nigh impossible to do without observation unless indeed search be made at night after workman have departed must hardly be likely to happen therefore think impossible for to stay here more than day two there be many cave burial place higher up on hillside where might be concealed in many of there be sarcophagus if choose one in there be several coffin can remove mummy casing into cave so that must party of searcher approach place can lie down in sarcophagus lower lid down upon must be sacrilege to move dead chebron said with shudder must be sacrilege for others chigron replied not to whose business duty be to handle dead can replace mummy in case after have left will be none worse for temporary removal will be necessary of course that there must be sign of habitation in cave nothing to excite suspicion that have be disturbed think be very good plan jethro said can make sleeping place in open air near will sleep in open air on journey must be hardship to begin at once must think best to remove to one of cave at once there be never saying when searcher may be here again therefore if will chigron will at early daybreak go with choose cave make arrangement think indeed that will be best plan embalmer agreed will of course take care to bring up night store of provision now will leave to sleep be long however before occupant of chamber threw upon pile of rush sometimes talked of mysa discussed possible plan for discovering where be concealed then wondered what have become of ruth who must be friendless in great city might not have money sufficient to buy meal with have ornament jethro said silver bracelet mysa gave always wore have two silver necklace earring of own must think have be handed down to from mother seemed good must fetch money ruth be shrewd little maid for though fifteen year old have long be accustomed to manage house look after grandfather why have run away can not think except perhaps from noise tumult thought that be going to be killed even in case must probably have found way back by morning if not sooner can not help thinking chebron said that have followed mysa although have not be here for many month be sure that be very fond of that certainly be jethro said often thought when be walking behind that be pretty to see together mysa knew so much more of everything yet be hebrew maid who gave opinion most decidedly mysa listened to a talked in grave way of hers a if have be elder sister think might have followed hope that may have be so in case woman must have seen woman be scared out of sens chebron said have doubt be screaming wringing hand attending to nothing else if must be sure that ruth be with mysa must feel le anxious for be certain must be comfort support to must indeed jethro agreed moreover must have greater hope of finding where be concealed for if be possible to get away to spread alarm be sure that ruth must seize first opportunity promptly be short time after lay down chigron entered said that morning be beginning to break at once rose followed led along foot of hill for distance then turning began to ascend at spot where sloped gradually passed many tomb partly erected with masonry partly cut out from rock behind be not until after walking fully hour that stopped before entrance of one of be one thought of a being suitable for purpose said be one of most lonely there be little likelihood of chance passer coming near in second place know that stone door roll across entrance have not be cemented in place know indeed to whom tomb belongs last mummy be placed here short time back son of man then buried told that must not have cemented because wife be grievously sick feared must shortly follow father therefore there will be difficulty in effecting entry in second place there be hard by small tomb be cut in rock then left owner changing mind having larger tomb made lower down hill a nothing beyond chamber narrow entrance be made can there hide mummy from chamber heap stone earth over entrance so that none must suspect existence nothing must be better jethro said let set to work prepare at once stone across entrance to tomb be three foot high of same width be pushed back without difficulty entered four wooden sarcophagus stood there jethro aided chigron in opening three of mummy in case be taken out outer case opened replaced in coffin after mummy with inner case have be removed from be then carried to unfinished tomb fifty yard away there deposited stone be then piled together so a to conceal entrance men returned to tomb here will be perfectly safe chigron said can keep stone rolled back unless see one approaching must be sure to make out considerable number of searcher mounting hillside long before reach must see will of course close door enter of one of sarcophagus lie down in inner case close lid of sarcophagus place lid of inner case over think unlikely in extreme that search will be made for at rate search only of untenanted tomb fact of stone here being left uncemented be mere accident probably known only to myself owner be only a extreme resource that must need to take to hiding place a far a passer by be concerned might remain outside altogether in case must run risk of being noticed may be sure that hill will be closely scanned if figure be seen moving about here party might set out to see whether be fugitive so eagerly sought for therefore say during daytime keep yourselves concealed here a soon a be dark can of course issue out pas night wherever may think fit illustration c of b hiding place of chebron friend page will certainly follow advice jethro said undoubtedly plan propose be by far safest can not think that there be much chance of earnest search being made among tomb though likely enough may visit be open empty a say must never dream of examining tomb in use a must naturally suppose that be securely fastened in case of very worst there be coffin for to betake ourselves to assuredly one must think of examining if will come down chigron said a soon a be dark will give provision for day together with peasant dress have prepared for money ameres committed to charge be not likely that anything will occur to decide to make move suddenly be best that must have everything in readiness for so doing must occasion possibly arise will come up to morrow night if be well hour after sunset name time exactly in order that if sleep at distance away can be here at hour to meet now leave to protection of god evening will dismantle chamber have used remove sign of having be inhabited chebron thanked embalmer very earnestly for kindness have shown trouble have taken risk have run on behalf must have done more if must chigron said father son have highest claim upon be to half fortune must spend to carry out last wish ameres expressed to a soon a embalmer left three friend sat down just within entrance to tomb looking out over quiet city lying in plain below wish have peasant dress chebron said that might go down with join in search for mysa must be too dangerous jethro said decidedly too many have seen taking part in service procession for to have chance of passing unnoticed amuba be le likely than to be detected if skin be stained eyebrow blackened head shaved might manage to pas providing walked with eye fixed on ground in way must not have much chance of coming upon trace of mysa search make must be at night will to day station near house of ptylus expect to gain information from gazing at high wall surround will follow a closely a can without attracting observation slave servant who may come out especially if two issue forth together may then catch few word of talk possibly gather clew to mystery still own that chance be small must not look forward in way to returning with news wish jethro chebron said that if possible must again go to house see old woman get to bring out to suit of priest garment with must at night enter temple wander unquestioned through chamber court night be dark now unless pas close to lamp none must recognize overheard one conversation of importance there may be must overhear there must be danger in attempt jethro said doubtfully that matter not at chebron exclaimed impetuously trouble have come upon through even must there be slight risk must willing face in truth think there be chance whatever of being recognized see how often amuba went there with though night be always moonlit never be once addressed be noticed that amuba be not one of regular attendant of temple who alone have right to penetrate beyond great court so be then jethro said then will explore temple amuba will search cavern in hill there be many great tomb behind temple just a have selected hiding place ptylus may have chosen one a place of concealment for mysa there be many tomb there built by prince noble wealthy priest for reception after death must be turned into comfortable dwelling after have spent time in searching there must if unsuccessful try further away ptylus doubt like ameres have farm country residence may be hidden in one of believe amuba said that better plan than yours will be for to establish watch over plexo ptylus have duty be doubt fully occupied in securing election to high priesthood plexo must most probably go sometimes to see mysa in place of imprisonment will naturally be anxious to conciliate frighten into giving consent to marry a soon a possible therefore if can watch sufficiently closely be sure to lead at last to will certainly be best way amuba did not think of before be clearly plan promise best chance of success might search country for year without finding although wish to keep up hope really despaired in own mind a say if follow plexo sooner later be sure to bring to to do so will want many disguise will think matter over a walk to day when see chigron evening will beg to get disguise seem to best for to use a for jethro chebron said will visit temple of evening a said long before midnight will be quiet there so that will give plenty of time for sleep in daytime will work with get garb of peasant woman in such dress with female head covering must surely get up so that even who know best must pas by without suspicion many woman be taller than be disguise must be out of question for amuba who be well nigh a tall a be besides being wide strong looking for must do well yes think must pas a woman jethro agreed certainly more of there be to watch rascal better for think that be more likely to succeed by night than by day plexo too have duty in temple must be likely to pay visit after dark then must be mere question of speed of foot amuba used to be trained in running will be swift horse will outpace now be going down to city feel more hopeful than did lad for first time begin to think that have chance of discovering where villain have carried mysa day passed slowly to chebron amuba must not show outside tomb a chigron have earnestly begged not to do so besides there be frequently people about on hillside for many came daily to offer prayer at tomb of relative still have much to talk of chance of finding question with whom must be placed if recovered prospect of long adventurous journey lay before amuba encouraged talk on point started conversation afresh whenever dropped for saw that excitement concerning mysa have done great deal for chebron have weaned thought from death of father consequence have arisen from unfortunate shot have given fresh subject for thought have revived spirit interest in life lad be glad when late in afternoon saw jethro ascending hill have news said a came up to have be day in neighborhood of house of ptylus have followed who came out two together from have overheard many scrap of conversation one talked upon same subject death of ameres of sacred cat want of success in search for fact of mysa being carried off be spoken of once twice be convinced by manner in slave spoke to other on subject that have not slightest idea that master be concerned in matter have assuredly knowledge whatever of being in house of course be possible that might be there without being generally known to slave still know how thing leak out in household how everything done by master mistress soon becomes public property have one among heard something unusual be going on must by time have be known to servant hardly thought that ptylus must have ventured to have carried home for might suppose that mother suspicion might be directed toward just a ours have be that if made complaint against search of house might be ordered besides there be too many servant there for secret to be kept if clew be to be obtained will be in temple by following plexo a soon a be dark descended hill together chebron have attired in garment bearing distinguishing mark of priesthood jethro have brought up with having obtained from old lyptis when near house of embalmer lad stopped jethro went on returned in hour with various disguise have asked chigron to obtain for with exception of scanty attire of two peasant hid for present in bush near path then rubbed amuba skin own with fluid have obtained from chigron after putting on peasant clothes took way toward house of ptylus while chebron went toward temple be short distance from house jethro amuba sat down by wall close to gate so none must leave without knowledge beyond servant visitor one came out at ten o'clock heard bolt of gate fastened remained where be until near midnight when chebron joined have spent time wandering from court to court of temple beyond solitary priest moving here there replenishing lamp of altar have seen one have be entirely unnoticed amuba chebron be inclined to be dispirited at want of success of watching jethro chid for impatience suppose said that be going to find out secret so well hidden by few hour watching may be week before succeed to morrow will begin watch two three hour before sundown be better known to servant at house of ptylus than be a have often taken message there besides in disguise must not so well loiter about without attracting attention a must will therefore content with watching northern road from city upon chance of taking way while in dress a peasant can watch house chebron might sit down by wall fifty yard from house on north side while amuba have best keep on other side of road somewhat to south of gate in way will be in sight of other yet not together solitary figure be le likely to attract attention than two together for be for two boy that people will be looking a must scarcely know now that skin be darkened there be trust small fear of others detecting disguise accordingly next day three hour after noon amuba chebron disguised a peasant went down to house of ptylus took post a arranged late in afternoon amuba noticed that one of slave from house of ptylus suddenly checked walk a passed chebron gazed fixedly at amuba left spot where be standing walked quickly in direction slave spoke to chebron who rose to foot moment later slave seized a be struggling amuba ran up here be find slave exclaimed be slayer of sacred cat aid to drag into house of master to surprise amuba sprang upon struck heavy blow in face that released hold of chebron staggered backward run for life amuba exclaimed to friend will take route slave recovering from blow rushed at amuba shouting at top of voice death to insulters of god death to slayer of sacred cat amuba who be now eighteen year of age be at once stronger more active than slave whose easy life in household of priest have unfitted for struggle springing back to avoid grasp of assailant amuba struck with strength in face a reeled backward repeated blow man fell heavily to ground several other people attracted by conflict shout of slave be running up amuba took to heel at top of speed a expected passer by paused to assist fallen man to learn cause of fray before took up pursuit be nearly two hundred yard away when heard cry again raised death to slayer of sacred cat by time be alongside of chebron who have paused to see issue of contest with slave do turn off chebron take turning two conceal then make way up to hill will keep straight on for awhile have more last than have can outrun fellow never fear do a tell said almost angrily a saw that chebron hesitated when reached next turning if keep together will overtake chebron hesitated no longer took turning indicated amuba slackened speed now judging correctly that pursuer if saw gained upon must not trouble about companion of whose identity be probably still ignorant when on looking back saw that have passed turning again quickened speed be not afraid of being overtaken by behind that might meet other people who seeing pursuit must take for fugitive from justice endeavor to stop one two did indeed make feeble attempt to do so did not care to grapple in earnest with powerful young man evidently desperate of whose crime knew nothing a soon a felt sure that chebron be quite safe from pursuit turned off from road be following struck across country quarter of hour running took fairly beyond villa detached house scattered so thickly round thebe ground here be closely cultivated be intersected everywhere by channel conveying water needed for irrigation of crop holding be small in center of stood little hut of be inhabited for most part cultivator lived in village using hut only when be necessary to scare away bird keep close watch over fruit in of patch fruit tree be thick amuba took advantage of cover to turn off at right angle to course have be pursuing then shaping course so a to keep in shelter of tree ran until arrived at hut whose door stood open glance within showed that be not at present used by owner entered closed door behind then climbed up ladder threw down on board lay on rafter for storage of fruit pulling ladder up after last glimpse have of pursuer showed that be fully four hundred yard behind when turned off from line have be following must have kept on trusted to speed endurance to outrun have not be sure that many of cultivator whom have passed in flight who have contented with shouting threat at for crossing land must on learning from pursuer crime with be charged join in pursuit thus fresh runner must be constantly taking up chase must eventually be run down therefore thought best to attempt to conceal until night fell scarcely have thrown down when heard loud shout rise close at hand have doubt that laborer unobserved by have noticed enter hut sprang down again from loft seizing stake with several others be standing in corner again sallied out a did so be suddenly grasped twisting free saw powerful nubian armed with hoe without moment hesitation amuba sprang at with stake nubian parried blow with hoe in turn dealt sweeping blow at lad amuba sprang back just in time before negro must recover guard struck heavy blow on wrist with stake negro dropped hoe uttering cry of pain rage amuba followed up blow on wrist with one on ankle a man fell bounded away again negro shout have be heard pursuer be now fifty yard away amuba saw that number have swollen considerably doubt a to ability to escape for first time entered mind be too close for further attempt at concealment have now only speed to rely on have already run nearly three mile while many of behind be fresh soon found that must not again widen space between for two mile still kept ahead at first leaping ditch lightly without pause at last often landing in middle scrambling out with difficulty be becoming completely exhausted now who have at first taken up chase have long since abandoned a have feared fresh men constantly joined rank of pursuer be few pace behind when found again on highroad few hundred yard away saw chariot approaching feeling that further flight be hopeless turned stake in hand to face pursuer who be few pace behind with cry of kill death to insulter of god rushed at panting breathless defended a best must guard be beaten down blow be showered upon fell with great effort struggled to foot again sens be fast deserting now be conscious that chariot drew up beside scattering assailant right left heard voice raised in tone of indignant reproach then renewal of cry of hatred felt strong arm round then be lifted for time became unconscious chapter xiv prince of egypt when amuba recovered sens be lying in heap at bottom of chariot two men be standing in car beside one supposed to be driver other owner of chariot in few minute chariot turned off through stately gateway driver leaped down closed gate then led horse to step leading up to splendid mansion man beside called out two three slave ran down step then be lifted out carried into house laid upon couch cup of wine be placed to lip after have drunk slave bathed head with cold water bandaged up numerous cut from blood be flowing greatly refreshed raised on arm order be given slave left apartment amuba looking up saw tall stately figure standing before recognized at once for have seen following king in one of procession among prince of egypt who be be true what men whom found maltreating averred that be slayer of cat of bubastes name be amuba lord lad said striving to stand upright questioner signed to to remain seated be rebu taken prisoner of war handed a slave to ameres high priest of osiris be not slayer of cat be true be present at death that might just a well have be arrow that accidentally pierced a of who did so then be accident noble said be wholly accident lord fired at hawk have be thinning pet bird of master daughter one of arrow struck tree glancing off entered house in cat be kept unfortunately caused death regretted accident bitterly knowing how sacred be animal in sight of egyptian not in sight young man be not yet follower of god of egyptian be not lord amuba answered at same time must not upon account have willfully done aught to offend religious opinion of others although have not be taught to consider life of cat a of more value than of other animal then worship god of own people amuba be silent for moment must answer frankly lord hope that will not be displeased since have come to egypt have come to think that god of egyptian god father worshiped be true god believe that there be one great god over that others be a be attribute men under name of god egyptian uttered exclamation of surprise whence did obtain such belief a asked amuba be silent must have be from ameres noble went on seeing that lad be reluctant to answer knew well also that carried to extreme knowledge have gained how came that must speak of such matter to slave master be good enough to make companion friend to son rather than servant to amuba replied partly because thought must lead to more active life needed for be overstudious partly because have high rank in own country of father be king never spoke of matter until after accident of cat friend chebron be utterly cast down at sin that thought have committed must at once have denounced preferring death to living with such burden upon mind then father seeing that whole life must be imbittered that must probably be forced to fly from egypt dwell in other land told belief held believed more readily because have heard much same from israelite maiden who served master daughter again amuba listener uttered exclamation of surprise knew not said after pause that there be israelite who still adhered to religion of ancestor maiden told that for most part have taken to worship of egyptian indeed so far a knew be last who clung to old belief have be brought up by great grandfather who have be driven from people forced to dwell apart because reproached for having forsaken god instructed in faith held be that there be one god over earth do know who be noble asked abruptly know that be one of prince of land lord for have seen in procession following closely behind king with son other prince also be israelite seems strange to doubtless went on a amuba started in astonishment at hearing prince of egypt declare a belonging to hated race many year ago at time be infant there be great persecution of israelite a be supposed father mother fearing for life placed in little cradle set afloat on water chanced be chance will of god that water took to spot where princess thermuthis daughter of then king be bathing with maiden have compassion upon adopted a grew up have right privilege of son rank a say with prince of egypt called moses for be name a seems that be writ upon piece of papyrus fastened to cradle be instructed in learning of egyptian grew up a one of so lived for many year have almost forgotten be not one of now here stopped began thoughtfully to pace up down apartment what have become of maiden of whom spoke asked suddenly stopping before amuba know not lord upon day that ameres be murdered by mob little daughter be carried off ruth for be name have also be missing ever since be for reason have lingered here otherwise must have fled at once son of ameres yes lord rebu one of father warrior who be fellow captive with also slave of ameres high priest have great confidence in committed to mission of aiding chebron to escape of conducting if possible back to own land when found that young mistress be missing decided to remain to search for what will do when find if can rescue from who have carried away will hand over to mother then leave land a have intended unless indeed lord in goodness must obtain for chebron pardon for offense be wholly accidental that can never do moses said be wholly beyond power king must not withstand demand of populace for life until lately might have in way aided have longer influence have myself fallen into disgrace at court after again pacing apartment for time moses went on if find little israelite maiden tell that be not last of israelite who belief in god of abraham ancestor tell moses also hold to faith again look surprised young man may well be so seeing have from day of infancy be separated from people priest keep accurate record of thing connected with country religion of people with whom come in contact thus then be easy for who have access to store of knowledge to examine roll recording first coming of people rule of joseph great governor coming of relation here settlement in country thus learned that worshiped one god whom believed to be only god in world have be interested deeply in learning of priesthood have long seen that behind form mystery of egyptian religion central idea seemed to be hidden none with whom have spoken acknowledged boldly that be so heard report that ameres be bold enough to entertain idea that there be one god that far back ancestor who have first worshiped under various attribute ascribed to came in course of time to lose truth altogether to regard shadow a substance therefore said to myself too will believe in one god worshiped by forefather hoping that in time may be may learn more of until last two three year have be content to live a one of egyptian prince of late heart have turned much to oppressed people have determined upon doing what can to relieve burden have even raised voice in council in favor have created coldness between court consider that having have honor of adoption into royal family must myself forget allow others to forget what regard a base origin sometimes own that wonder must feel so drawn toward even wish must forget origin give whole mind to duty pleasure of present rank feel moved by spirit stronger than own must talk no longer see that be now stronger do think that can walk oh yes amuba replied getting up walking across apartment have not lost much blood be only dizzy from blow then be better that must leave at once people from whom snatched will have carried news speedily to city official will doubtless soon arrive here to demand that be given up to take therefore draught of wine piece of bread will then give in charge of trusty slave who will lead through garden through small door at back will guide to spot where may wish to go even now doubtless watch be being kept up in front of house when official arrive will tell truth coming a drove upon lad who be being attacked murdered by number of brutal peasant carried off in chariot a to shout heard that be slayer of cat of bubastes regarded a invention designed to hinder from interfering on behalf that questioned upon arrival here finding that a have supposed be entirely innocent of offense charged against urged to leave at once letting depart by garden gate in order to escape fury of persecutor a be not israelite one can suppose must have motive for shielding offender from punishment of crime thank for time press must be moving so a to be well away before be known that have left may god worship though a yet in ignorance guide preserve carry friend through danger beset moses drew back curtain from before entrance to chamber clapped hand ordered servant who answered call to tell mephres to come to old slave speedily appeared moses ordered to take amuba out by private way to guide by quiet road back to city then cutting short guest expression of thanks for great kindness have rendered hurried away for knew that at moment official might arrive from city be well that amuba have be supplied with guide for upon issuing into night air for by time darkness have fallen found that must with difficulty direct step head throbbed a if must split from blow have be dealt limb ached old slave however seeing that stumbled a walked placed staff in one of amuba hand taking firmly by arm led steadily on seemed to lad that went on walking night yet be le than hour after starting when conductor found that must go further that be wholly unable to answer question a to whither wished to be guided determined to stop with until must be able to proceed again therefore led amuba aside into orchard there laid down under shelter of tree covering with one of own garment be well for lad that lord arrived just when did said to a sat down by side of amuba listened to heavy breathing for in house have heard from charioteer of rescue of lad from hand of furious peasant must have be very near death when be saved from hand maxi said that assailant shouted out that be slayer of cat of bubastes about turmoil have be made have be so think that lord must have aided thus to escape though for part care not if have killed cat in egypt seeing that in native libya worship not god of egyptian several time during night old man got up plucked large handful of grass wet with dew placed on amuba head when perceived first faint gleam of morning in sky aroused amuba sat up looked round with air of astonishment where be exclaimed be at present in orchard young friend though to whom may belong know not finding that be unable to continue journey drew aside here have slept well night hope feel better for able to proceed remember now amuba said seemed to that walked for hour leaning on arm be hour slave replied be not yet two mile from lord house have watched over night amuba said for be know hour after sunset when started truly be deeply indebted to for kindness speak not of old man replied lord gave into charge can not return until can tell that be in safety if be able to walk must pas on for there may be search for a soon a be light be perfectly able to go on amuba said thanks to wet grass see have be piling round head heat seems to have passed away throbbing to have ceased amuba be indeed now able to walk at brisk pace way do want to go slave asked in short time be getting light enough now for to see face will never do for to meet one head be still swollen there be mark of bruise cut over scalp appearance will attract attention at once if saw who have heard of last evening doings must be at once suspected will make direct for hill amuba said be not far distant can easily conceal among rock until sunset let hurry on then slave said be hour walk a may at moment now meet peasant going to work will go on ahead do follow hundred yard behind if see one coming will lift hand above head do at once step aside from road into vineyard orchard lie there until have passed amuba followed instruction be more than hour before reached foot of hill so often did have to turn aside to avoid group of peasant at last reached foot of rugged ascent here took leave of guide with many warm thanks for kindness service with message of gratitude to lord then amuba ascended hill for short distance laid down among great bowlder although greatly refreshed by night rest be still weak shaken felt altogether unequal to making way along hill for four mile intervened between hiding place of friend among tomb above city be soon asleep again sun be already distance down sky when awoke waited until sank behind brow of hill above then climbing distance higher made way along hillside having little fear that figure must be noticed now that hillside be in shadow darkness have just fallen when arrived at tomb used a shelter figure be standing there in deep shadow a turned path approached advanced to meet then there be cry of joy jethro sprang forward clasped in arm dear amuba never thought to see in life again moment later chebron ran out in turn embraced amuba will never forgive will never forgive said reproachfully what right have to take danger upon be wrong amuba have suffered horribly even though be a brother why must sacrifice for especially when be life not yours be forfeited told thousand time last night be base cowardly in allowing jethro to risk life for when by giving up rage of people will be satisfied must make way out of land without great danger be bad enough that must share risk when come to taking upon shoulder must escape free can accept such sacrifice longer to morrow will go down surrender amuba be about to burst into remonstrance when jethro touched a sign to be silent rebu knew how acutely chebron have suffered how have spent night in tear self reproach felt that be better to allow present agitation to pas before arguing with be hungry amuba asked that be jethro have nothing save mouthful of bread since meal here yesterday will get news out of until have eaten drunk meal of cake cool fish draught of wine be soon taken amuba said now will tell about know first part jethro said when returned here yesterday evening found chebron almost beside with anxiety told how have be discovered by one of slave of ptylus who knew by sight how have attacked slave rescued from hand then joined in flight how insisted that must separate how pursuer have followed on track leaving to return here unmolested have be here upward of two hour when arrived a time have passed on without return have become more more anxious of course at once started out to gather news have greatest difficulty in persuading to remain here for scorned idea of danger to from search must be sure to be again actively set on foot however a pointed out be necessary that if returned must find somebody here at last agreed to remain when got into town found whole city in street news have come that slayer of cat have be discovered that one have escaped that other have be overtaken after long chase that have be set upon must have be slain a well deserved have not one of prince of royal house arrived carried off in chariot news excited greatest surprise indignation two officer of city have gone out to prince mansion be six mile away from city to claim fugitive bring to town when must be at once delivered to just anger of populace a soon a learned started out along road by must return hurried on past people already gathered there have brought sword with intention be that a chariot returned with must leap upon surprise slay official drive off with for knew must be able to take part in making escape a have heard that be already insensible when carried off in chariot there be group of people along road with torch thought that sudden surprise must probably be successful at last heard chariot approaching be being driven more slowly than have expected a came to large group of people distance ahead of stopped for moment official addressed people there be shout sound of exultation felt convinced at once that upon arrival have found that be already dead in miraculous way have escaped therefore hurried back to next group when chariot came up there be shout of 'what be news where be malefactor ' official checked horse replied ' mistake have be made prince assures that lad be poor slave wholly innocent of affair have satisfied that in jealousy for honor of god peasant who attacked lad committed grievous wrong fell upon wholly innocent person after assuring of have have wound bound up suffered to depart prince intends to lay complaint before council against person who have cruelly maltreated nearly murdered innocent person who stated interfered in matter because saw slave attacking young lad who fled fearing trouble because of punishment have inflicted upon aggressor ' announcement be received in silence when chariot have driven on again there be much murmuring account have certainly appearance of truth for be already known by narrative of slave who recognized chebron that person who rescued be youth stranger to that be youth who have be pursued while chebron have escaped still there be murmuring that prince must in so important matter have suffered youth to depart without more searching examination said that even if boy story be true deserved punishment for attacking slave who have arrested chebron while others said that a have certainly be beaten almost to death have be punished sufficiently agreed that doubt whole affair must be investigated hurried back again with news night watched for when morning came without arrival be almost a anxious a before fearing that have be too badly injured to rejoin to day must almost certainly be recaptured a search for chebron must assuredly be actively carried out insisted on remaining quiet here while made frequent journey down to city for news beyond certainty that have not be recaptured although diligent search have be made for a well a for chebron learned nothing now amuba have relieved of necessity for much talk have only to fill in gap of story to tell how be that persuaded egyptian prince of innocence be rather long story jethro now have have meal feel strong enough to talk night for have have nearly twenty four hour sleep first will tell chebron that when took pursuer off track have idea of sacrificing for made sure must be able to outrun must have done so easily have not be for fresh people constantly taking up pursuit at last running down amuba then related whole story of flight attack with peasant rescue then recited whole of conversation with rescuer proceeding after leaving house so see concluded that strangely enough be teaching of father chebron tale ruth told that grandfather before told of god of forefather that saved life have not be that prince of israelitish birth also believed in one god must hardly be that must have saved from vengeance of people for a say be in disfavor with king conduct in allowing to go free merely on own assertion of innocence be likely to do further harm must assuredly never have risked have not be for tie between of common faith in one great god be strange story jethro said when amuba brought narrative to conclusion have have marvelous escape have not be for arrival of prince upon spot at very moment must have be killed have not have be of compassionate nature must never in first place have interfered on behalf have not be for common faith must have held until official arrived to claim then too be fortunate indeed in kindness of guide for evidently have not be for long rest step took to reduce heat of wound must have fallen into hand of searcher morning above consider extraordinary that must at critical moment have be rescued by perhaps one man in egypt who must have have will courage to save upon following morning jethro amuba succeeded with difficulty in dissuading chebron from determination to give up argument have most powerful effect being that by so doing must be disobeying last order of father be resolved that in future a better disguise must be attired a woman that watch upon house of ptylus must be recommenced that must station further away be thought indeed that search in neighborhood be likely to be le rigorous than elsewhere a must not be thought probable that fugitive must return to spot where have be recognized amuba disguise be completely altered be still in dress of peasant by mean of pigment obtained from chigron jethro so transformed a to give to casual observer appearance of advanced year have have long discussion a to plan must adopt amuba jethro wishing chebron to leave watching entirely to must not hear of saying that be confident that in disguise a woman one must know must find out way go to begin with said after none of need go near house will buy basket flower from one of peasant woman who bring in will take seat near gate by three o'clock plexo will have finished office in temple may set out hour later will see at least road take then when join at dusk one of can walk mile two along road other twice a far will then see when return whether have followed road considerable distance have turned off by crossroad can post on following day so a to find out more plan be very good one chebron will follow once get upon trail will guarantee that will not be long before trace to goal accordingly afternoon chebron dressed a peasant woman took seat with basket of flower fifty yard from entrance to house of ptylus at about time expected plexo father returned together from temple hour later light chariot with two horse issued from gate plexo be driving attendant stood beside chebron felt sure that if plexo be going to visit mysa must take road leading into country post have taken up commanded view of point where road divided into three one running straight north along middle of valley while others bore right left until one fell into great road near river other into on side of valley near hill be last that plexo took although might be going to visit acquaintance living in many villa scattered for mile mile along roadside chebron felt strong hope that be going to mysa hiding place a soon a be dark be joined by jethro amuba started at three o'clock chebron exclaimed a came up to took road leading to foot of hill will go on there at once jethro said may return before long must hurry do walk quietly on chebron stop at point where road ahead run into main road amuba will stop two mile further will go two mile further still if come along road past will begin at point to morrow jethro have just reached spot at proposed to wait when heard sound of wheel approaching minute later chariot drove along moon be not up night be clear bright advancing a close must to passing chariot be able to recognize plexo latter gave angry exclamation a horse shied at figure have suddenly presented gave cut with whip at jethro minute later chariot have disappeared jethro returned toward city picking up on way amuba chebron next night amuba took up station mile beyond spot at jethro have seen chariot jethro mile ahead while chebron watched crossroad near town time did not come along although chebron have seen start same hour a before hardly expected to see to night jethro said when joined others after fruitlessly waiting for three hour will hardly be likely to visit two day in succession will be more likely to leave for week to meditate on hopelessness of refusing to purchase liberty at price of accepting a husband doubtless have to day merely paid visit to friend be not indeed until fourth night of waiting that plexo came along time did not pas jethro at be therefore certain that have turned off from main road to right left at point between post of jethro that of amuba when be determined agreed after consultation not to return to hiding place near thebe night to lie down under tree by roadside until morning broke then to examine road carefully be not likely that chariot must pas before morning might be able to follow track along dusty road in way discovered road where have turned off beyond track did not show a road be hard almost free from dust lay a expected toward hill there be so many country mansion of wealthy class dotted about so many crossroad leading to to farmhouse of cultivator that felt be still far from attaining object of search after discussion be agreed that must ascend hill remain there during day that jethro must return to town a soon a became dark to obtain store of provision sufficient to last for week be done next day separated at dawn took up place on hill at distance of about mile apart choosing spot where commanded view over valley arranging to meet at central point when night came on chapter xv ameres be revenged six day passed without watch being rewarded then chebron whose post be just opposite road where have traced wheel saw chariot turn from main road into a many others have taken that course day did not at first feel very hopeful although time precisely tallied with at plexo must have arrived have started at same hour a before a came near however became convinced that be vehicle be looking for horse tallied in color with of plexo color of dress must even at distance be distinguished time however be not accompanied by servant by figure whiteness of whose garment showed also to be priest must be said to father murderer must be down by edge of road with bow arrow high priest a have now become must send arrow through heart chariot turned off by road parallel to have be followed from thebe so close to foot of hill that from chebron post must no longer see a soon a be out of sight leaped to foot hurried along hill to join amuba whose post be next to own found friend have already gone on hurried breathlessly on until reached jethro who have be joined by amuba few minute before have seen exclaimed have seen marked down jethro replied see that roof among tree at foot of hill mile further along turned off road entered tree search be over at last what have better do jethro wait until have left again then go down jethro said sternly there be two thing to be done one be to rescue other to punish murderer of ameres even did determine to delay vengeance must say must still press on saw that arch villain ptylus with son have assuredly come for purpose probably may intend to terrify girl until drive into taking solemn oath that will accept plexo a husband what can girl of age do in hand of unscrupulous villain like may be that fox plexo have be trying flattery finding failed have called in ptylus who can threaten with anger of god of hers to say nothing of perpetual imprisonment harsh treatment will therefore push on at once amuba carry stout peasant stave while chebron have dagger concealed under female dress will have advantage of surprise in favor be not likely that there be more than one two men there with perhaps female servant ptylus must not wish secret to be known to more than be absolutely necessary of course be possible that four men who carried off may be on guard there if so make six what with surprise what with not knowing how numerous be that number must not be more than sufficient for to dispose of without difficulty at rate be there twenty must not hesitate honest men need never fear encounter with rogue especially amuba said when honest men posse such sinew a yours jethro good heavy cudgel in hand jethro smiled be in too earnest mood to answer at once led way along hillside until immediately behind house among tree then descended climbing with difficulty over wall surrounding wood entered inclosure treading a lightly a possible jethro companion passed through wood made way up to house be small handsomely built be surrounded with colonnade supported by carved pillar garden immediately around be evidently carefully tended house from secluded position be well fitted a place of sojourn for wealthy priest noble desirous of few day rest retirement from bustle of great city a be barefooted passed across garden to colonnade without slightest sound a reached jethro held up hand for to stop for sound of voice came through wide doorway of apartment opening out to colonnade chebron amuba at once recognized voice of ptylus will put up with more of folly mysa must think fortunate in extreme in position in be belonging to disgraced family to receive such offer a son make to will have answer at once will swear before god that accept plexo a future husband that will reply to who question that have be staying here by own free will that remained in concealment simply because be overwhelmed with horror at terrible act of sacrilege committed by brother will night be confined in tomb where will remain alone without light of day until agree to condition think little fool that ptylus high priest of osiris be to be thwarted in plan by opposition of child like here voice three listener recognized to surprise a of ruth broke out listen to mysa come of never consent to lie before god a wicked man must have call high priest sir what must be worth of god pretend to worship if suffer one like to minister to be god not mere image of stone must strike dead at altar furious exclamation broke from ptylus stepped forward seized hebrew girl roughly by shoulder only to start back with exclamation a ruth struck with open hand with force on cheek drag hence plexo exclaimed at moment entrance be darkened three listener sprang into room ptylus have courage distinguished race although for moment startled at sudden entry did not recoil drawing sword from girdle said haughtily who be what mean intrusion be whom have be hunting to death ptylus come here a avenger of blood a brought about murder of ameres so must die to say naught of offense in carrying off daughter of man slew without word ptylus rushed upon jethro with sword thinking to make short work of insolent peasant a did so jethro whirled massive club round head catching blow upon shivered sword in piece stopped arm gazing steadily at opponent said wretch do dare to murder high priest of osiris jethro said dare to execute brought heavy club down with strength upon head of priest at moment plexo who have stolen unobserved from room instant others entered returned followed by three armed men chebron amuba be so intent upon combat between jethro priest that did not notice entrance of plexo who with uplifted knife sprang upon chebron there be scream of warning quick a thought ruth sprang forward pushed plexo a sprang through air sudden shock threw to ground ruth sprang to foot again plexo lay there motionless three armed men stood for moment stupefied at fall of two employer then seeing two men woman rushed forward to attack one sweeping blow with jethro staff felled first of assailant to ground others paused irresolute drop weapon be dead men jethro exclaimed be outnumbered if move die a chebron have now thrown back female robe drawn dagger taken place at door while jethro amuba be advancing against two men dropped weapon hold out hand jethro said son stand over with club break skull of who may move men did a be ordered jethro tore strip of cloth off garment twisted into rope bound wrist firmly together meaning tone in jethro have called amuba son have not escaped amuba chebron who saw that jethro be desirous of concealing name mysa who have raised cry of joy when jethro first spoke have sunk terrified upon couch have hidden face in hand during short encounter while ruth have stood silent vigilant beside moving only when plexo rushed at chebron retiring to mysa side again a soon a have regained foot too understood jethro motif in calling amuba son stooping over mysa said be over now mysa remain quiet at present speak until see what be going to be done a soon a men be tied jethro secured in same manner man who be lying stunned from blow then turned to plexo who have not moved since have fallen half turned round uttered low exclamation of surprise gastrion said to chebron go with young lady into garden remain there until join chebron passed out on to colonnade following mysa ruth moment be unobserved mysa threw arm round burst into tear with joy oh chebron exclaimed have arrived just in time thought be never going to get away from dreadful man know what must have done if have be for ruth oh have be telling such terrible thing ca be true that dear father have be killed that be chebron who killed dear paucis of course did not believe knew be wickedness never mind about dear chebron said will talk about afterward first thing be to get away from place jethro amuba will soon decide what be best to be done be there others in house there be one other man ruth replied old woman think other man be at door with chariot have better tell jethro chebron said again went into room told jethro what have heard will seize woman first jethro said then go out round house come down from other way upon chariot man will have heard outcry if came suddenly out of door might leap into chariot drive off before must overtake if come upon from behind will secure have forgotten to bind plexo chebron said plexo be dead jethro replied a fell arm be beneath knife with have intended to strike pierced heart be very glad that observed way spoke to amuba be of greatest importance that name must not be mentioned affair will cause tremendous excitement there be nothing to connect with ptylus may be supposed that be work of malefactor who came down from hill in search of plunder fact that mysa be here be carried away be not in proof that have hand in for libyan robber might well have carried ruth away to make slave of plexo caught glimpse of doubtless only rushed out called to men to come to father assistance at rate let there be name mentioned now let finish work here female servant be soon found bound then four prisoner be placed in different room fastened securely to wall pillar never put two prisoner together jethro said always remember that tie one man up may keep tie up two be sure to escape can bite through other cord untie knot with teeth possibly even with finger now what be next thing to do amuba asked next thing be to have consultation do chebron go out into garden to girl amuba will deal with other man a soon a jethro amuba have left chebron rejoined girl saved life ruth will never forget saved from crocodile lord be push fell scarce know how be done quickness saved life same ruth have not noticed till cried out then must have be too late have be anxious for also ruth hoped that might be with mysa none saw go out with place be with mistress ruth said quietly be more than mistress be a friend to how came here chebron mysa again asked why be dressed up like peasant woman be not seemly in man much le in priest amuba jethro too be dressed a peasant face seem changed know how look darker must not have known have not recognized jethro voice be long story dear will tell presently want to hear story too ah here come others be to mysa far more than to that owe rescue may know more of learning of people have none of readiness coolness of amuba while jethro be a prudent a be brave must have fared hardly with a well a with mysa have not be for good friend mysa went up to a approached jethro feel how much owe to to amuba courage have given way although ruth strove so hard to give hope fear must not have long threat of bad man can not tell what joy felt when recognized voice joy be a great in finding a yours in seeing jethro replied amuba must gladly have laid down life for now let have consultation there be much to decide upon arrange let go round to garden at other side of house there can sit talk at same time keep watch that one else enters be not likely that one will do so for place be secluded none must know that men be here still peasant might enter to sell fowl fruit therefore be best to keep eye upon entrance went round to seat placed beneath tree on other side of house fountain worked by water of little rill on hillside played in front of few tame waterfowl swam in willow basin around everything be still peaceful to chebron seemed a if event of last three week have be hideous dream that be again sitting in garden of house at thebe now first of mysa said must have question answered how be father mother everyone jethro took amuba arm turned away will leave chebron to tell mysa have taken place will be better for to do so alone ruth rose from seat to leave also mysa put hand on arm be frightened ruth stay with told mysa chebron began that have told tale that father be dead that be who killed paucis yes did not believe chebron of course did not for moment at least not for moment about when thought of bad men at gate crash heard noise of people rushing in shouting thought be afraid that perhaps might be true about father oh chebron surely be not so ala mysa be true cruelly slew father wish have be there to have fallen by side know amuba be away jethro fought desperately to last must have died with have not father commanded that in case anything happened to be to take charge of to carry out of land mysa be cry bitterly now presently looked up why must want to leave land chebron surely surely be not true that thing seemed too terrible for to put into word killed poor paucis be true also mysa mysa gave little cry of horror oh ruth cried be too dreadful ruth put arm round sobbing girl may be sure mysa that brother did not do intentionally be same mysa cried be sacred cat know cat of bubastes be mysa thought at first a did that although be result of accident anger of god must be poured out against be a one accursed whose life be forfeited in world whose spirit be destined to dwell in unclean beast after death when told father reassured told not to fear in way wrath of god then related to sister manner in cat have be killed step amuba have taken to conceal body avowal to father of fault see be not fault chebron know law of egypt punishment for killing even common cat how must father say that god must not be angry can not tell said mysa though day have remained with might have done so did say so know how wise good be therefore want to remember what said so that when be gone will not all life think of a one accursed oh must never do mysa exclaimed starting up throwing arm round brother neck how must think so why be talking about going where be going be going mysa because people of egypt view matter in same light a father be hunting land to find slay amuba for not knowing exact truth put down a equally guilty so must fly father gave full direction to jethro must by time have be long distance away have not be that stayed to find rescue then if other thing told be true chebron may be true too that letter showed ordering to consent to marry plexo be from mother how must tell that when knew that hated have over over again spoken scornfully of family before what did say chebron asked said that now disgrace have fallen on family might think very fortunate in obtaining such offer chebron be silent knew that mother have never shown earnest love either for mysa that thought be entirely devoted to dress entertainment that love have to give have be bestowed upon brother fear be true mysa will never marry plexo mysa exclaimed passionately father always said must never marry man disliked will never marry plexo mysa be dead ruth uttered exclamation died by own hand ruth be by accident a fell dagger pierced own heart when jethro went to look at be dead lord requited for evil ruth said firmly thing be in hand a did not mean to slay lament not over death besides strove to take life have have dagger in hand must assuredly have used then what be to become of mysa asked must go back to mother mysa there be naught else for to do will not mysa exclaimed never loved must have married against will to plexo although knew be bad that hated must make marry one else who be rich regardless of wish chebron nothing will make go back to chebron looked perplexed here come jethro amuba dear have best talk over with see nothing else for to do a jethro came up mysa walked to meet will not go back to mother jethro exclaimed impetuously wanted to marry plexo must give to one else father always said must only marry one liked can never be so cruel a to give up to know that father wish be strong upon point jethro said for spoke to of when gave command respecting chebron said that wished must watch over a over be because of what have said that disregarded order a to instant flight lingered here in hope of freeing still see not anything else to be done mother doubtless wrote while still overpowered by grief at father loss thought that be acting for welfare in securing advantageous marriage in spite of cloud under family be resting will not go to mysa repeated thought of a always did not of in way know be so chebron can not deny chebron be silent whole affection have be given to father for mother have comparatively little a child have seldom be allowed to come into room where be declared that noise be too much for that talk made head ache that fidgeting about be too much to be borne since time have be much more with be father who have seen to welfare that of mysa who must put aside grave study to walk talk with who be always indulgent always anxious to give pleasure therefore thoroughly entered into mysa feeling saw possible alternative for where must go mysa jethro asked where must be placed wherever be mother in time must be sure to hear of must reclaim will go with chebron amuba mysa said positively impossible jethro replied be going upon tremendous journey full of danger fatigue be going among unknown savage people chance be hundred to one against ever arriving at end of journey if be so to to young men like chebron amuba for be now past eighteen will speedily be men what chance must there be of success with with can walk a well a chebron mysa said know that chebron suppose must suffer hardship just a well at rate must rather suffer anything be with of than stop here people have murdered father mother must sell to highest bidder if chance be so great that will never get through journey in safety being with can not make so much greater have only chebron in world will go where go die where dy god can protect just a well on journey a here have not protected now chebron too by what say will take with dear jethro wo urged pleadingly say father wished to watch over forsake now ruth will come with too will not ruth be sure will not be more afraid of journey than be will assuredly go if go mysa god of israel can take safely through danger if be will jethro be silent such addition to charge must assuredly add immensely to difficulty of journey on other hand remembered anxiety of ameres about mysa asked what late master must have wished have known how matter stood glanced at amuba chebron saw at once that wish agreed with of mysa turned away abruptly for minute paced up down garden then returned to group among whom not word have be exchanged since left mysa said gravely be great thing that ask there be disguising that presence will add greatly to difficulty will add also to peril may render impossible for to carry out father wish to conduct chebron to land where will be beyond persecution of egypt such enterprise must be undertaken in light spirit if go must be prepared to face death in form by hunger thirst weapon of wild native may even be that lot may be that of slavery among be terrible journey for men more terrible still for woman still if be resolved resolved with strength mind of woman not of child after having once turned back upon egypt will never repent step have taken wish to return will be steadfast under trial may befall then say that will share lot mysa uttered exclamation of joy promise jethro may happen hardship danger death will never hear word of complaint from be not glad ruth think well ruth said gravely be great undertaking think that god hand be in too must fain leave land of idol except here have none in world to care for now jethro amuba said what have best do be already almost dark therefore must set out at once must make use of chariot jethro considered for short time except for carrying thing may want for first start see that can do so said for where leave chariot to morrow morning must be found when be known that ptylus ' chariot be missing must soon be recognized a thus clue be afforded to fact that have fled south a to traveling in beyond to night must be out of question besides will only hold three at most if use at must be to drive north so throw off scent think will be worth doing will undertake that part of business amuba said there will be much for to do to morrow jethro only can arrange there be boat to be hired store laid in got in readiness think best plan will be for to start at once with girl for thebe chebron can occupy hiding place on hill chigron will be glad to take girl into house there be danger of immediate search being made for to night when priest son return servant will suppose that have slept here will not be until late to morrow afternoon that there will be alarm likelihood of messenger being sent over here then consternation confusion will be caused will be so great that probably one will think of carrying news to official until next morning besides until story of mysa having be here of being missing be generally known there be reason that what have taken place must be attributed to therefore for next forty eight hour think that must be perfectly safe at embalmer will drive chariot thirty forty mile north then turn horse loose where be sure to be noticed ere long will return on foot join in hiding place to morrow night think plan be very good one amuba before start will make search through house there will be nothing want to take with must touch of treasure of villain be house full of if toss of thing about will look a if robbery have be motive of what have taken place men in bond can know nothing of real state of thing plexo when rushed out for aid must have have time to do more than to tell to take up arm follow indeed be doubtful whether have idea that be aught what seemed therefore first impression assuredly will be that be malefactor of worst kind escaped slave men with respect for god for assuredly egyptian even worst of criminal must in cold blood have laid hand on high priest of osiris laid hand on father chebron said bitterly yes not in cold blood report have first be spread among that be untrue to god then be maddened by fanaticism horror at death of sacred cat in cold blood a said egyptian however vile criminal must lift hand against priest may a well come with amuba must be strange if one of only took part in search in ten minute jethro amuba have turned place into confusion in forcing open chest cabinet littering floor with garment then taking few of most valuable vas jewel threw into pond round fountain where must be concealed from view by water lily floated on surface examined afresh fastening of captive felt assured that by possibility must free will be sure to be freed by to morrow night amuba said otherwise must not like to leave here to die of hunger thirst must be only too glad jethro said if thought there be chance of being here forty hour instead of twenty doubtless be not first evil business have carried out for villain master may think lucky indeed that take what must be in way safest best course namely to run sword through body silence forever if thought must tell anything must do so now really think that anything can tell will add to danger of course priest wife know that mysa be hidden here will proclaim fact that have be here be now missing a must consider might afford clew for apprehension of who attacked house slew husband son therefore see that there must be much to be gained by silencing people if think differently will finish at once amuba shook head for although human life in day be thought little of save by egyptian shrank from thought of slaying captive in cold blood can tell nothing jethro have best be moving there be nothing more to talk over think plan be arranged long ago except of course that must get rather larger boat than have intended together with garment for girl think must be best that chebron must still be disguised a woman can settle to morrow night there be good store of dress for to choose from at chigron amuba led horse to stone water trough allowed to quench thirst then mounted chariot drove off while rest of party set out on foot for thebe be so late before reached chigron house that thought better not to arouse inmate a comment must be excited by arrival of woman at so late hour unexpected by master girl therefore passed night in rock chamber behind building while jethro chebron lay down outside a soon a dawn broke moved distance away jethro went to house a soon a there be sign that there be one astir told chigron that have discovered rescued mysa chigron be much disturbed when heard of death of high priest son say men be not villain jethro that two high priest must be slaughtered in course of month be enough to bring anger of god upon egypt however poor girl be not responsible for in way will willingly shelter especially a be for one night own that will be vastly relieved when know that be fairly on journey can well understand jethro said believe gratitude of have sheltered will have a long a live may well outweigh doubt may present a to whether have acted wisely in aiding who be victim to superstition of countryman chigron called servant told that have just heard of arrival from country of friend ordered room to be prepared for then went out returned hour later with two girl led quietly into house direct to apartment prepared for so that be unseen by of servant then called old servant on whose fidelity must rely charged to wait upon during day to suffer none other to enter apartment bade convey impression to other servant that visitor be aged woman to mention that intended to make stay of few hour only until friend with whom be going to stay must send in cart to carry to house in country old woman at once prepared bath for girl then supplied with meal after lay down on couch be soon fast asleep for excitement of preceding evening strangeness of position in comfortless stone chamber have prevented closing eye during night have spent hour in talking over terrible loss mysa have sustained journey lay before hour later chigron went out again be soon joined by jethro who have now resumed attire a citizen of middle class be necessary that chigron must accompany take chief part in making arrangement for although jethro have learned in two year captivity to speak egyptian fluently must not well pas a native chigron therefore did most of bargaining jethro keeping somewhat in background first took course down to river bank here innumerable craft lay moored for nile be highway of egypt except for short journey traffic be carried on on water a soon a be known that be looking for boat be surrounded by owner of various craft praising speed safety comfort of boat chigron however be time before made choice then fixed upon boat seemed well suited for purpose carried mast large sail to take advantage of favorable wind be light of very small draught being constructed entirely for passenger traffic have large cabin divided into two part for accommodation of lady crew consisting of captain four men sleeping on deck think boat will do very well said to captain provided can come to term friend be going up with family a far a syene at rate possibly on to ibsciak business may take even further what will be term week suppose lord will provide food for crew a well a for own family will be best way jethro said then will pay for extra hand where current run so strong that crew can not tow boat unaided against jethro assented will return with remain for awhile at end of journey be probable that business may detain there for considerable time chigron replied have relation there with whom will wish to make stay must make difference will have difficulty in obtaining passenger freight for journey down be long time before bargain be struck for chigron knew that boatman must consider strange indeed be term first asked to be accepted at last arrangement satisfactory to party be concluded be arranged that start must take place early on following morning chigron then proceeded with jethro to make purchase requisite for voyage mat cushion curtain for furnishing boat cooking utensil provision for crew passenger of however be not necessary to take very large quantity a boat must lie up to bank night near one of frequent village here there must be difficulty in purchasing provision of kind jar of good wine be however among store purchased in addition to be several bale of costly merchandise large stock of such article a must be useful for trade with native of wilder part of country supply of arm bow arrow lance be also placed on board be late in afternoon before thing be got on board boat everything arranged in order having seen complete chigron returned with jethro to house jethro after seeing girl who have just woke up partaken of meal went up to hiding place on hill found that amuba have just joined chebron there be going on well lad asked a entered everything be in readiness boat be hired furnished have good store of merchandise for trading in meroe besides trinket of many kind for people lying between meroe red sea so far everything promise well boatman belong to upper nile dialect differs too widely from spoken here for to be able to distinguish talk pure egyptian wondered why be that chigron be such long time in making choice between boat when a far a must see there be score must have equally suited purpose found afterward that be boatman rather than boat be selecting that chose coming from far up river partly because speech differed so widely from of thebe that must not detect roughness of tongue secondly because must be more likely to continue voyage further to south than must boatman of port who must regard a serious undertaking to proceed beyond ibsciak therefore need fear suspicion on part of boatman suppose disposed of chariot a arranged amuba yes drove north for five hour then turned aside into wood here loosed horse so that must feed a chose must doubtless by morning stray into field so attract attention then there must be search to see to whom belonged chariot must be found by time that news spread that ptylus be dead also that chariot horse be missing have doubtless be taken off by who have attacked tidings that chariot be found will have be taken to nearest town will shortly be reported over country that be making north search for will be made in direction only be going back to house jethro yes chigron have given out to servant that visitor be relative of mine a have be frequently seen going in out in garb be now accustomed to will be natural for to sleep there to night to start with in morning will start exactly at sunrise have better wait at distance from house follow coming up joining just a reach river side boat will be taken above city to highest step will be able to proceed to point without entering town be careful with disguise news of death of ptylus will not hope be generally known in city until be fairly afloat be otherwise must be dangerous for to run risk of being seen abroad chapter xvi up nile late at night jethro again went up to hiding place on hill chigron have just returned from visit to city said whole of town be in uproar news that ptylus son have be found slain have be received excitement be tremendous death by violence of two high priest of osiris within so short time be regarded a presage of terrible national misfortune that one must have be slain be almost unprecedented act insult of terrible kind to god second act of sacrilege have almost maddened people regard a judgment of osiris deem that be proof a few ventured to whisper before death of ameres be brought about by intrigue among party of priest headed by ptylus others see in fresh proof of anger of god against egypt king will be said take part in service of propitiation in temple of osiris to morrow sacrifice be to be offered say in temple solemn fast will be proclaimed to morrow people high low be to shave eyebrow to display usual sign of mourning so far have heard nothing a to fact that two girl who be in house be discovered to be missing to morrow when who be in house be questioned by magistrate fact will doubtless come out men will own by order of ptylus carried mysa away at time attack on house be made at present however there be question of woman in case can go down to boat with girl in company with chigron without fear be better that must not be with when embark for when matter come to be talked over one who see embark might notice that number tally with of three person present when ptylus be killed two missing girl therefore chigron opinion be that will be safer for to start at once walk to mita village twenty mile up river there boat will lie up to morrow night a soon a be dark can come on board will tell boatman expect to join there a have gone on ahead to transact business for in neighborhood be certainly best plan amuba agreed there be too many who know chebron by sight for to be safe for to go down to boat here embark in broad daylight will take two hour sleep before start for a did not sleep last night have walked forty mile since left chariot feel in need of little repose before start again be foolish not to have slept afternoon for have since midday be hiding near there be so much to think about have inclination to do so especially a believed that must have night rest here will wake chebron said have be asleep better part of day having have nothing to do since arrived here yesterday evening chebron sat watching star until saw that have made two hour journey through sky then roused amuba now laid aside garment a peasant put on attire prepared for a son of small trader amuba have submitted although with much disgust to have head shaved on night following death of ameres be satisfaction to to put on wig for accustomed a be to see bare head of peasant be strange uncomfortable to to be going about in same fashion a soon a be dressed started made way down to bank of river above town walked along broad causeway by stream until within mile two of destination then turned off toward clump of tree be visible by first gleam of dawn quarter of mile away here slept for hour late in afternoon returned to side of river strolled quietly along watching boat in middle of stream be making way down with current lightly easily crew often singing merrily rejoicing over approaching meeting with friend after absence of many week boat going up stream be close to bank crew walking along causeway laboring at towrope for there be not enough wind to render sail of utility in breasting stream craft be of various kind shapeless rudely fashioned used in conveying corn from country higher up down to thebe now returning empty others be fancifully painted boat of wealthy with comfortable cabin sail of many color richly decorated embroidered be carrying owner up down river between country mansion city be hour after sunset when two friend arrived at mita darkness fall quickly in egypt after sun have gone down feature must scarcely have be recognized have be met by one acquainted with in street scene in street of little village be busy one distance from thebe rendered general halting place for night of boat have left capital early great number of be already moored off bank while others be arriving in quick succession boatman passenger be busy making purchase at shop fisherman with well filled basket be shouting praise of fish fowler with string of duck goose hanging from pole from shoulder be equally clamorous in offering for sale shop of fruiterer baker of vender of vegetable formed so large portion of diet of egyptian be crowded wine shop be doing brisk business chebron amuba made way through busy scene keeping sharp lookout for jethro for considered certain that owing to early start boat be to make must have arrived there hour before that must be on lookout for in few minute saw looking into one of shop started a went up to touched for have not perceived before well amuba asked everything have gone off admirably got off without slightest trouble come on board at once girl be anxious about although assured that there be not slightest risk of being discovered on way here so saying jethro led way to boat be moored by bank hundred yard above village in order jethro said that must make early start in morning be off before rest of boat be under way here be brother jethro said in loud voice a stepped on board found dawdling gossiping in street forgetting altogether that be waiting for evening meal until came on board entered cabin be about eight foot wide twelve foot long not high enough for to stand upright floor be spread with thick carpet cushion pillow be arranged along side thick matting hung from top in daytime be rolled up fastened so that air must play through cabin within must look out at river at present closed opening kept out night air glance of passer by at other end be door opening into smaller cabin allotted to girl lamp swung from beam overhead mysa gave cry of pleasure a entered be about to spring to foot when jethro exclaimed mind head child be not accustomed to low quarter yet thank god be together again mysa said a chebron after embracing sat down on cushion beside feel almost happy now in spite of dreadful time have passed doe feel homelike here chebron said looking round especially after sleeping in open air on hard ground a have be doing for last month must hardly have known amuba mysa said do look so different in wig with skin darkened must look horrible amuba replied rather ruefully look so nice mysa replied frankly used at first to think that short wavy golden hair of yours be strange that must look better in wig like other people now be sorry be gone here be meal jethro said a hanging served a door be drawn aside one of men entered bearing dish of fried fish of stewed duck placed on floor jethro produced cup jar of wine from locker in cabin then men by order brought in jar of water for use of girl then sitting round dish began meal jethro cutting up food with dagger helping with aid of finger piece of bread served for purpose of fork mysa have be accustomed always to use of table be only used in abode of rich people in general sat on ground to meal have not begun hardship yet mysa said smiling must not mind how long went on call much better than living in house ruth be more natural to than great house of yours ruth replied of course to be far more homelike comfortable for think be favorite among other servant be jealous of kindness showed there be one thing wanted to say jethro said be better that must not call other by name be sure that boatman have suspicion here that be other than what seem to be can hardly help hearing name for egypt have rung with for last month must be well if change for present must of necessity call father since be relation be supposed to bear to amuba can become amnis chebron chefu will be mytis mysa said what name will take ruth there be egyptian name quite like yours matter not what call ruth said will call nite mysa said have great friend of name died there be one thing nite chebron said that wish to understand just now spoke to a lord chebron that sort of thing must not be longer be fugitive together mysa have longer rank jethro amuba be of high rank in own country if ever get safely to own people will be noble in land while will be stranger a be when jethro came into egypt therefore talk of rank among be folly be fugitive life be forfeited if be discovered in own land jethro be leader guardian alike by will of father because be older wiser than of amuba be a elder brother being stronger braver more accustomed to danger than while mysa be sister inasmuch a be exiled from own land be friendless save for other be glad to hear say that brother mysa said spoke to last night about for must insist on treating a if be still servant be absurd not nice of when be going out with to share danger only because love be rather who must look up to for be very helpless know nothing of work real life while can do sort of thing besides when be captive be who be always brave hopeful kept up spirit when do think if have not be for must have died of grief terror by way jethro said have not heard yet how be that be together heard of being carried off old lyptis told that one have seen aught of be scared out of sens ruth said scornfully men suddenly ran into room seized mysa twisted shawl round head before have time to call out screamed one of struck blow knocked down then carried off think be stunned for moment when recovered found be gone jumped up ran along passage through hall where woman be screaming cry then out of house through garden out of gate then saw four men at short distance off carrying mysa to cart standing hundred yard away ran up just a laid in one of turned upon with dagger said go with will be quiet if not will scream if kill will only set people on trace men hesitated ran past climbed into cart threw down by mysa then drove off be brave good of ruth jethro said laying hand on girl shoulder why did not scream when first came out of gate might have brought aid prevented mysa from being carried off thought of ruth said there be number of rough men still coming in at gate knowing how people have be stirred up to anger against did not know what might happen if gave alarm besides be not sure at first that men although seemed so rough violent be not really friend who be taking away mysa to save from popular fury yes might have be case jethro agreed at rate child acted bravely well be hoping all along that be with mysa for knew what comfort must be to only a woman declared did not pas out after did not see how must be now mytis nite have better retire to own cabin to rest for though have kept up wonderfully have be great strain for be looking fagged heavy eyed to night can sleep in comfort for for present think that there be occasion for slightest anxiety be time before jethro companion lay down to sleep talked long earnestly of journey lay before when have exhausted topic chebron said till now jethro have not asked about father funeral when be to be have thought of often a did not speak thought better not to question be glad did not jethro replied will be in about ten day time a believed guessed chigron be embalming process will not be completed for four day a know relative see corpse after be in hand of embalmer until be swathed in coffin chigron have done so much that must have be against conscience did not like to be asked to allow to break through custom to be sort of religion beside dear lad thought better for not to renew grief by gazing on lifeless face during last month have fortunately have so much to distract thought that have not have time to dwell upon loss moreover have needed strength energy for search for sister right sure be that father who be a sensible a be wise two thing always go together must be far better pleased to see energetic active in search for sister in preparation for new life on be entering than in vain regret for therefore lad for reason thought better to keep silent upon subject may be satisfaction however for to know everything will be done to do honor to dead king great men of egypt will be present thebe will turn out thousand to express grief for deed done by section of population have not be for express command of father must have thought that might have be worth while for to present on occasion may be that for once even fanatic must have be satisfied to have pardoned offense of son because of wrong done to father however affair of ptylus put that out of question for when be generally known that mysa be carried off when ptylus be slain public opinion will arrive at truth say that fugitive of whom be in search slayer of sacred cat be rescuer of daughter of ameres slayer of high priest be right jethro will be better for not to have seen father can always think of now a saw last be thousand time better than if dwelt in memory a lie in cere clothes in embalming room of chigron a to what say about appearing at funeral must in case have done must thousand time rather live exile meet death at hand of savage than crave mercy at hand of mob of thebe live to be pointed at life a man who have committed abhorred offense of killing sacred cat conversation in cabin have be carried on in undertone for although through opening in curtain must see crew who have be eating meal by light of torch of resinous wood be now wrapped up in thick garment to keep off night dew chatting merrily together occasionally breaking into snatch of song be prudent to speak so that not even chance word must be overheard boatman indeed be in high spirit home lay far up near border of upper egypt be seldom indeed that obtained job gave chance of visiting friend thus engagement be most satisfactory to for although leader have haggled over term must gladly have accepted rate of pay rather than let such opportunity slip a chebron finished speaking be preparing for night by laying down few mat on board of fore deck then huddled closely together pulled mat two over extinguished torch composed to sleep will follow example little more comfortably hope jethro said cushion pillow be arranged lamp turned low in short time on board boat be sound asleep ray of light have entered cabin when amuba be awakened by movement of boat caused by stir among crew felt way to door threw back hanging looked out there be faint greenish yellow light in east star be still shining brightly good morning young master captain said hope have slept well so well that must hardly believe be morning amuba replied how long will be before be off will be moving in ten minute at present there be not light enough to see shore chefu be awake yes chebron answered sleepily be awake thanks to talking if have lain quiet might have slept for hour yet have have plenty of sleep last twenty four hour amuba retorted take cloth let land run along bank for mile have bath before boat come along be very cold for chebron said nonsense water will refresh come along chefu jethro said brother be right dip will refresh for day egyptian be most particular about bathing washing heat dust of climate rendered cleanliness absolute necessity class took daily bath wealthy in bath attached to house poor in water of lake canal jethro two lad leaped ashore ran briskly along bank for about mile stripped took plunge into river be dressed again just a boat came along with four men towing captain steering with oar at stern be light enough now for to distinguish face of passenger brought boat straight alongside bank in few minute girl came out from cabin looking fresh rosy so have be bathing mysa said heard what be saying have have bath too how did manage chebron asked went out by door at other side of cabin in woollen robe on to little platform on man be standing to steer poured jar of water over other slept well yes indeed without waking once till heard amnis call to get up disturbed everyone see amnis chebron said very good thing too amuba laughed if have not have bath when did must not have got opportunity day now feel fresh ready for something to eat mysa put in what must like mytis ruth asked be capital cook know suppose men will be preparing breakfast for long time yet think will be very good plan mytis jethro said will divide labor between two boy will stir up brand smoldering on flat stone hearth forward will clean get ready fish nite will cook while mytis will under direction make cake put into hot ash to bake will have to shift for later on there be nothing like getting accustomed to of course men will cook principal meal can prepare little meal between time be astonishing how many time can eat during day when be in open air in hour meal consisting of fish light dough cake mysa have with much amusement prepared under ruth direction fruit be ready latter consisted of grape melon meal be greatly enjoyed by time be finished sun be already distance up sky for hour party sat on deck forward watching boat coming down stream village on opposite shore a sun gained power be glad to enter into cabin mat be rolled up now to allow free passage of air a sat on cushion must look out on side day after day passed quietly smoothly men generally towed boat from sunrise until eleven o'clock in day then moored to bank prepared meal after eating went ashore if there be tree afforded shade there if not spread out mat on pole over boat slept in shade till three o'clock then towed until sunset moored for night cooked second meal talked sang for hour two then lay down for night sometimes wind blew with sufficient strength to enable boat to stem stream close inshore by mean of sail alone then boatman be perfectly happy spent day in alternate eating sleeping generally passenger landed walked alongside of boat for hour two after have have early breakfast again when heat of day be over made change at same time kept muscle in state of health activity may have to make long journey on foot jethro said more can accustom to walking better time passed so quietly pleasantly that mysa chebron at time blamed for feeling a light hearted a did when latter once said so to jethro replied be uneasy on score remember that in first place be comfort to that sister be cheerful companion make journey lighter for in next place good spirit good health go together although at present life be easy one there will be need for health strength presently flight exile be at present blessing rather than misfortune to just a amuba captivity following so closely upon death of father mother be to can hardly believe mysa said that be really going upon dangerous expedition everything be so pleasant tranquil day pas without care trouble find difficult to believe that time be not very far off when will have to cross desert perhaps to meet savage beast wild people be in danger of life will be long time first mytis will be month before arrive at capital of next kingdom lie at junction of two great arm of river up to point think there will be danger though there may be little difficulty for say there be tremendous rapid to be passed be only lately that king overran meroe defeated army forced to pay tribute a there be considerable trade carried on with country think there be danger of molestation be on leaving meroe that difficulty will commence for a hear road thence to east through city of axoum be capital of country named abyssinia pass through wild land abounding with savage animal again beyond axoum country be broken difficult down to sea chigron told however that have heard from native of meroe who have worked for that there be far shorter road to sea from point at river take great bend many hundred of mile below capital when get higher up can of course make inquiry a to hope that may prove to be true for if so will save month of travel several large town be passed a journeyed upward hermonthis standing on western bank by be traveling be first passed then came esneh with grand temple dedicated to kneph neith standing where nile valley open to width of five mile then passed eilithya standing on eastern bank with many temple rising above with sandstone rock behind dotted with entrance to sepulcher few mile higher up passed edfu above valley gradually narrowed hill closing in until rose almost perpendicularly from edge of stream here be temple erected especially for worship of nile of emblem crocodile appeared to egyptian most appropriate place for worship of river seemed here to occupy whole width of egypt here too be vast quarry from stone be extracted for building of most of temple of upper egypt sixteen mile higher ombi be passed with great temple in honor of crocodile headed god sebak along part of river country be comparatively barren village small far apart in narrow place river at time ran so rapidly that be necessary to hire number of peasant to assist boatman to drag boat against stream progress made day be very slight four day after leaving ombi arrived at syenea by far largest town have come to since leaving thebe brought first stage of journey to end hitherto have be traveling along tranquil river running strongly at time smooth even before have succession of cataract rapid to pas country to traverse although often subjugated be continually rising against power of egypt modern assouan at syene remained for three day must gladly have pushed on without delay for although egyptian authority extended further up river syene be last town where governor must concern with affair of egypt where fugitive from justice be likely to be arrested however a be customary to give boatman few day of repose after labor before undertaking still more severe work lay before jethro thought better to avoid appearance of haste there be much to be seen be new to at syene great trade be carried on with meroe most of merchant engaged in dwelt here buying on one hand product of upper lower egypt sending taking up river on other hand buying product of meroe dispatching to thebe street be filled with mingled population egyptian with spotless garment tranquil mien merchant absorbed in business officer soldier in large number for syene be important military station official belonging to great quarry near gang of slave of many nationality working under order wild looking figure moved among crowd garment thrown loosely round affording striking contrast to cleanness of of egyptian while unkempt hair be in equally strong contrast to precise wig of middle class egyptian bare head of lower class skin too be much darker in color though there be considerable variation in respect among be sprinkling of men of entirely different type almost black in hue with thicker lip flatter feature be ethiopian whose land lay beyond of meroe who have also felt weight power of arm of egypt people of meroe amuba said be very similar in feature to egyptian chebron tongue be also not unlike yours can understand speech oldest book amuba said say that be kindred people be asiatic rather than african in origin people of meroe say that far back ancestor came from arabia first spreading along western shore of red sea ascended to high land drove out black people who inhabited a to own origin be vague father have told that opinion among most skilled in ancient learning be that too came from arabia be not one people be certain be comparatively of recent year though vast time a far a human life go that people of thebaid be of upper egypt extended dominion over lower egypt made whole country one nation even now know king wear two crown one of upper egypt other of lower country along shore of great sea to west be libyan other people similar in race to ourselves father considered that tribe first came from asia pressed on to west driving back exterminating black people fresh wave came from east pushed others further further until at last ancestor of people of lower egypt arrived settled there in meroe temple religion be similar to own whether brought religion from arabia whether planted there during various conquest of country can not tell certain be that there be at present little more difference between upper egypt meroe than there be between upper egypt delta beyond people be black like see here so believe amuba merchant penetrate vast distance to south exchanging product for gold ivory everywhere find country inhabited by black people living in wretched village without a seems government law order waging war with other making slave whom also sell to merchant differ so wholly from that be certain that can not come from same stock be strong active make excellent slave lying between meroe sea country called abyssinia be also inhabited by race of arab blood differing more from than of meroe have great town think that religion be same a ours trader say that language can be understood by although more rough unpolished have heard father say that considered that country lying east of nile of eastern branch rise in abyssinia be called tacazze belongs to asia rather than to africa party found that death by violence of two successive high priest of osiris be one of principal topic of conversation in syene none appeared to think that there be remotest probability of concerned in occurrence making for south however jethro thought prudent that whole party must not land together therefore amuba chebron usually went one way with girl paid visit to sacred island of ebo opposite town to quarry of phile four mile away here saw gang of slave cutting colossal statue obelisk shrine from solid rock first outline be traced on rock then surrounding stone be removed with chisel wedge at last statue obelisk be severed from rock then be hewn sculptured by mason placed on roller dragged by hundred of men down to landing place below rapid placed on raft to be floated down river to destination saw many of mass of stone in stage of manufacture number of slave employed be enormous inhabited great building erected near quarry where also be barrack for troop who kept guard over watching slave at painful labor jethro amuba be filled with gratitude at good fortune have placed with ameres instead of sending to pas life in such unceasing monotonous toil among slave be several whom by complexion appearance judged to be rebu a at first brought to egypt have be distributed among priest great officer supposed that from obstinacy misconduct from attempt to escape have incurred displeasure of master have be handed over by for service of state have slave be in hand of private master jethro amuba who be filled with pity at seeing countryman in such state must have endeavored to purchase take with upon journey be out of question now be possible to hold communication with to present with small sum of money to alleviate misery without exciting suspicion whole party be heartily glad when on morning of fourth day after arrival boat be pushed off from shore work of ascending rapid began chapter xvii out of egypt river have begun to rise before left thebe although have not yet reached highest point great volume of water be pouring down boatman assured jethro that must be able to ascend cataract without difficulty whereas when nile be low there be often great danger in passing at time indeed boat must make passage ten men be engaged in addition to crew to take boat up beyond rapid although assured that there be danger girl declared that must rather walk along bank for hurry rush of mighty flood rising sometimes in short angry wave be certainly trying to nerve jethro lad of course accompanied sometimes seized rope added weight when force of stream brought men towing to standstill seemed a if must in spite of effort tear boat from grasp at last top of rapid be gained be glad to take place again in boat a floated on quiet water so month passed sometimes taken along by favorable wind at others being towed along quiet water close to shore at others battling with furious rapid found that cataract have first passed be a nothing to higher up here whole cargo have to be unloaded carried up to top of rapid needed forty men to drag empty boat through turmoil of water while often slightest error on part of helmsman must have caused boat to be dashed to piece on great rock rising in midst of channel before arriving at second cataract have tarried for several day at ibsciak city to crew belonged have passed many temple town during hundred eighty mile of journey between syene place be largest of here two great grotto temple be in course of construction one dedicated to god amun phre built at expense of rameses other dedicated to athor by lofreai queen on temple be engraved record of victory of rameses over various nation of africa asia jethro offered if boatman wished to make longer stay here that must charter boat to take further declared willingness to proceed at end of week after arrival being well satisfied with engagement treatment after passing second cataract arrived at large town named behnib be very large city abounded with temple public building largest temple be dedicated to thoth along river belt of cultivated land extended for mile back from bank be dotted with numerous village there be difficulty whatever in obtaining food of kind b now wady halfa at last reached semneh point to boatman have agreed to take be furthest boundary to at time egyptian power extended river here took great bend to east then flowing south afterward again west forming great loop must be avoided by cutting across desert to merawe flourishing town marked northern limit of power of meroe desert forming convenient neutral ground between two kingdom sometimes egypt under powerful king carried arm much further to south at other time warlike monarch of meroe must push back egyptian frontier almost to syene a rule nile a far south a semneh be regarded a belonging to egypt trader arriving at semneh generally waited until sufficient number be gathered together to form strong caravan for mutual protection against native inhabiting desert who held independent alike of egypt of meroe attacked plundered party crossing desert unless be so strong well armed a to be able to set at defiance erecting two tent landing good merchandise jethro party encamped near river bank have not yet settled whether must cross desert continue journey by water choice between two route be open to for although trader usually crossed desert taking with lighter more valuable merchandise heavier good made long detour in boat going up in large flotilla for protection against native for mutual aid in ascending rapid have to be encountered there be difficulty in hiring boat for be universal rule to make transshipment here a egyptian boatman be unwilling to enter meroe transport beyond point therefore be in hand of people of country in consultation with trader gathered at semneh jethro learned that be by mean necessary to proceed up river to city of meroec thence eastward through axoum capital of abyssinia to sea that far shorter road existed from easternmost point of bend of river direct to sea there be indeed several large egyptian town upon red sea from flourishing trade be carried on with meroe abyssinia first merchant to whom jethro spoke be much surprised to find that be in ignorance of existence of route have described c now khartoum journey although toilsome be said to be no more so than that from meroe through axoum while distance to be traversed be small in comparison after much consultation be therefore agreed that best plan be to dispose of merchandise that have brought with to one of trader about to proceed south retaining only sufficient for payment of men whom must be necessary to take with for protection on journey jethro have difficulty in doing alleging a reason for parting with good that found that expense to meroe must greatly exceed sum have calculated upon that therefore have determined to proceed further a thought best to allow six month from date of departure from thebe to elapse before entered large egyptian town remained for nearly two month at semneh then finding that flotilla of boat be ready to ascend river made arrangement with boatman for hire of craft to point where be to leave river again set out on journey difficulty of journey be very great after traveling for sixty mile came to rapid more dangerous than have passed took flotilla more than fortnight passing up only four five boat being taken up day by united labor of whole of crew there be great satisfaction when last boat have be taken up rapid there be general feast that evening among boatman during whole time have be engaged in passage number of armed scout have be placed upon rocky eminence near bank for place have evil reputation attack be frequently made by desert tribesman upon passing up down upon river so far sign of presence of hostile native have be perceived usual precaution however have be taken cargo have be carried up by hand deposited so a to form breastwork a night closed in several sentry be placed to guard against surprise have be arranged that men belonging to boat day brought up must that night take sentinel duty evening jethro companion boatman be among on guard many of boat have left semneh before have be among last to arrive at foot of cataract consequently came up in last batch a owner have be exempt from labor of dragging up boat have spent much of time during enforced delay in hunting have obtained dog guide from village at foot of cataract have have good sport among ibex abounded in rocky hill girl have seldom left cabin after leaving semneh there be nothing remarkable in presence of woman in boat going so far up river a many of trader took wife on journey with when however journeyed beyond semneh left there until return danger hardship of desert journey being too great for to encounter be therefore thought advisable that girl must remain in seclusion jethro amuba chebron be standing together at one of angle of encampment when former suddenly exclaimed there be men animal moving on steep hill opposite thought several time heard sound of stone being displaced certainly heard then then turning round raised voice can hear sound on hill be best that stood to arm prepare to resist attack in instant sound of song laughter ceased amid group assembled round fire man seized arm there be sharp ringing sound close to jethro stooping picked up arrow have fallen close to be enemy shouted draw up close to breastwork prepare to receive scatter fire at once extinguish blazing brand can see while invisible a spoke loud terrible yell rose from hillside shower of arrow be poured into encampment several men fell jethro order be carried out fire promptly extinguished stoop down behind breastwork jethro shouted until be near enough for to take aim have spear ready to check onslaught when charge although jethro held position entitling to command order be a promptly obeyed a if have be in authority men recognized at once by calmness of tone that be accustomed to warfare readily yielded to obedience in minute two crowd of figure must be seen approaching egyptian leaping to foot poured in volley of arrow yell scream broke forth testified to execution wrought in rank of enemy without check still rushed forward egyptian discharged arrow a fast a must during few moment left then a native rushed at breastwork threw down bow grasping spear mace sword ax stave with be armed boldly met foe for few minute contest be doubtful encouraged by shout of jethro whose voice must be heard above yell of native egyptian defended position with vigor courage a fast a native climbed over low breastwork of merchandise be either speared cut down after ten minute fierce fighting attack ceased a suddenly a have begun a if by magic dead silence succeeded din of battle have done well comrade jethro said defeated assailant have best stand to arm for awhile for may return think will for have found stronger better prepared for than have expected still a know way be best to remain on guard hour later a nothing have be heard of enemy fire be relighted wounded attended to sixteen men have be shot dead by arrow of assailant fifty be more le severely wounded by same missile while eighteen have fallen in hand to hand contest at breastwork thirty seven native be found dead inside breastwork how many have fallen before arrow of defender latter never knew for be found in morning that native have carried off killed wounded who fell outside inclosure a soon a fighting be over chebron ran down to boat to allay fear of girl assure that none of party have received serious wound jethro alone having be hurt by spear thrust however glanced off rib inflicting only flesh wound treated a of consequence whatever why did not amuba come down with mysa asked be sure that escaped without injury can assure that have not be touched mysa be still on guard for be possible that enemy may return again although hope that lesson have be sufficient for be frightened chebron felt little nervous a be coming on when came to hand to hand fighting be too excited to think anything about danger besides be standing between jethro amuba have fought in great battle seemed so quiet cool must scarcely feel otherwise jethro took command of everyone rest obeyed without question now must go back to post jethro told to slip away to tell that be safe must not like not to be in place if attack again have often wondered ruth mysa said when chebron have left what must have done if have not be for jethro amuba if have not be for must have be obliged to marry plexo chebron must have be caught killed at thebe arrange everything seem afraid in slightest think brother be brave too ruth said always consult with about plan yes be doing mysa replied chebron before came thought of nothing reading be gentle quiet heard one of slave say to that be more like girl than boy being with amuba have quite altered of course be not a strong a amuba can walk run shoot arrow shoot javelin at mark almost a well a amuba can still have not so much spirit think amuba always speaks decidedly while chebron hesitates to give opinion brother have great deal more learning than amuba so opinion ought to be worth more mysa oh yes if be about history science for anything of sort of course must ruth not about other thing of course be natural that must be different because amuba be son of king son of king ruth repeated in surprise yes heard when first came only father said be not to be mentioned because if be known must be taken away from kept a royal slave at palace be really son of king a father be dead will be king when get back to own country jethro be one of same people be not ruth asked oh yes be rebu think jethro be one of king warrior that account ruth said for what have often puzzled jethro be much oldest of party altogether leader yet have observed that always speaks to amuba a if latter be chief have not noticed that mysa said shaking head do know now mention that always asked amuba opinion before giving own have constantly noticed mysa wondered that since amuba be father slave must always consult amuba instead of brother understand now that account too for amuba giving opinion so decidedly of course in own country amuba be accustomed to have own way be glad of for like amuba very much vexed sometimes to see settling thing when jethro be so much older think if ever get back to own country will be king be not sure mysa said doubtfully of course ought to be suppose there be other king now might not like to give up to amuba suppose will ever get there ruth said amuba said other day that country lay great distance further than land people came from long time ago be not so very far ruth said that caravan went in six seven day from part of egypt where dwelt to east of great sea where father came from be long way from there mysa if be only six seven day journey why did not people go back again ruth always hoped to go back day mysa think people must have let go see made useful for building cutting canal other work besides other people dwell now in land came from must not turn out unless be beaten in battle people be not accustomed to fight besides have stopped so long that have become a egyptian for most part talk language although have also preserved knowledge of own tongue worship god if be not forced to labor against will think now that most of must prefer to live in ease plenty in egypt rather than journey into strange country of know nothing except forefather hundred of year ago came thence here be others broke off a boat heeled suddenly over a one sprang on board now will hear more about fighting next day journey be continued without further adventure flotilla arrived at last at town where party must leave river strike for coast having unloaded good discharged boat jethro hired small house until arrangement be made for journey to seacoast el makrifd be place of great importance certain amount of trade be carried on with coast most of merchant trading with meroe preferred longer safer route through axoum still party of traveler passed up down took boat there for meroe there be absence of temple great building have distinguished town have passed between thebe semneh d now called berber jethro upon inquiry found that there be well at camping place along whole route people be wild savage egyptian power extending only from seashore to foot of hill fifteen mile away occasionally expedition be got up to punish tribesman for raid upon cultivated land of coast be seldom that troop must come upon for knowing foot of mountain eluded search by heavy armed adversary jethro found that custom be for merchant traveling across country to pay fixed sum in good for right of passage there be two chief claiming jurisdiction over road messenger be at once dispatched to nearest of with offer of usual payment request for escort week later four wild looking figure presented at house stated that be ready to conduct traveler through chief territory jethro have already made arrangement with head man of place to furnish with twelve men to carry provision necessary for journey upon following morning party started mysa ruth assumed garb of boy jethro finding that although trader might bring up lady of family to semneh even take higher up river in boat must never think of exposing to fatigue of journey across mountain that arrival of two girl at egyptian town on sea must therefore assuredly attract remark possibly inquiry on part of authority for first few hour girl enjoyed change of traveling after long confinement on boat long before nightfall longed for snug cushion easy life have left behind bearer heavy laden a be proceeded at steady pace taxed strength of girl to keep up with after first few mile be passed heat of sun be intense country after short distance have be passed became barren desolate did not suffer from thirst for ample supply of fruit be carried by one of bearer limb ached foot unused to walking became tender painful can not stop for awhile jethro mysa asked beseechingly jethro shook head must keep on to well be two hour further yet told at starting that first day journey be six hour steady walking mysa be about to say that must walk further when ruth whispered in ear must not give way mysa know promised that if must take with must go through difficulty danger without complaining admonition have effect mysa felt ashamed that have be on point of giving way on very first day of starting on real journey struggled bravely on girl be utterly exhausted by time arrived at well felt rewarded however for suffering by hearty commendation jethro bestowed upon have held on most bravely said for must see be terribly fatigued be afraid will find very hard work just at first after that will be more easy to to morrow journey be shorter one be well that be so for girl be limping even at start needed assistance of jethro boy to reach next halting place a soon a tent be separated into two part by hanging be erected dropped upon cushion feeling that must never get through day suffering like have just passed jethro saw that be so told escort that must halt next day for young son have be so long in boat that fatigue have quite overcome accompanied intimation with present to of four men offered objection while porter who be paid by day be well contented with halt day rest greatly benefited girl be not long enough to be of utility to foot however wrapped in bandage started in good spirit when porter took up load be now following course of what in wet weather be stream in mountain sometimes hill on side receded little at others rose almost perpendicularly on side of stream have to pick way among great bowlder rock sort of walking however tired girl le than progressing along level foot be painful soft bandage in be enveloped hurt far le than sandal in have at first walked arrived at halting place in much better condition than on previous occasion worst be over now jethro said to encouragingly will find day work come easier to have stood far better than expected feel more hopeful now that will reach end of journey in safety than have done since evening when first agreed to take with while passing through of ravine party have be greatly amused by antic of troop of ape sometimes sat tranquilly on hillside elder gravely surveying little caravan younger frisking about perfectly unconcerned sometimes must accompany for considerable distance making way along rough stone of hillside at deliberate pace yet keeping up with footman below a ape be sacred animal in egypt mysa be gladdened by sight considered good omen for success of journey men who escorted told that if undisturbed ape never attack traveler if molested must at once attack in body with such fury that even four five traveler together must have little chance of escape with life during first week journey saw other animal although at night heard cry of hyena who often came close up to encampment once twice deep roar guide told be that of lion on seventh day however soon after have started upon march sound of breaking branch be heard among tree short distance up hillside immediately afterward head of four five great beast must be seen above mimosa bush extended from wood to bottom of hill bearer gave cry of terror throwing down load took to heel four men of escort stood irresolute although none of jethro party have ever before seen elephant knew from picture carving from great statue in island of elephanta what great creature be will attack jethro asked men often do so one of replied although at time come down waste field round village will sometimes slay come across be best to get out of way jethro pointed out few of more valuable package taking up entered bush on other slope of hill made way among a far a must be however short distance for be full of sharp thorn offered terrible obstacle to passage of party received severe scratch garment suffered much in making way twenty yard into bush will do jethro said will be torn to piece if go further be a much concealed from sight here a must be hundred yard further will see what be doing standing up looking cautiously through screen of feathery leaf jethro saw that elephant be standing immovable great ear be erected trunk outstretched a if scenting air after two three minute hesitation continued to descend hill be afraid of man jethro asked one of escort sometimes be seized with panic fly at approach of human being if attacked will charge number without hesitation do ever hunt sometimes always with great number of men be useless to shoot arrow at only way be to crawl out behind cut back sinew of leg need strong man sharp sword can be done then be helpless even then be long work to dispatch generally drive from village by lighting great fire making noise solitary elephant be more dangerous than herd have known one of kill dozen men seizing in trunk throwing in air a high a top of lofty tree dashing others to ground kneeling upon until bone be crushed to piece elephant have now reached bottom of valley chief of escort held up hand for perfect silence be prepared to fight if elephant pursued into bush for further retreat be impossible amuba chebron have fitted arrow into bowstring loosened sword in scabbard four native have drawn short heavy sword carried while jethro grasped ax be favorite weapon remember have whispered to boy back sinew of leg be only useful point to aim at if advance separate if make toward girl try to get behind hamstring there be long pause of expectation elephant must be heard making low snorting noise with trunk jethro at last raised sufficiently to look through bush at what be going on elephant be examining bundle have be thrown down believe that be eating up food whispered a sat down again hour elapsed then there be sound of breaking bush jethro again looked out thank god exclaimed be going off again trampling down mimosa thicket a if have be grass elephant ascended opposite hill at last re entered wood from have first emerged fugitive waited for quarter of hour then made way out again from thicket jethro cutting path with ax through thorn exclamation of surprise broke from a gained open ground whole of store be tossed about in wildest confusion everyone of package have be opened tent garment carpet hung upon bush a if animal have tossed contemptuously there a being unfit to eat everything eatable have disappeared fruit grain vegetable have be completely cleared up skin of wine be bursted content have be apparently appreciated for none remained in hollow of rock what greedy creature mysa exclaimed indignantly have not left single thing often get chance of such dainty feeding amuba said think ought to blame especially a seem to have done very much damage to other good look how have trampled down bush a went through wish skin be a thin a mine mysa said a wiped away blood from deep scratch on cheek must keep up in own wood then not come down to rob traveler at rate mysa ought to feel indebted to chebron said for not having pushed investigation further must have have chance either of escape resistance in bush jethro told to move round attack from behind moving round in thorn be very well to talk about quite impossible to do two minute of active exercise there must not be morsel of flesh left on one bone be two three hour before bearer came back one by one be assailed with fierce reproach by jethro for cowardice have be mean of losing provision four of number be at once paid off sent back a there be longer anything for to carry others must have left also have not be for escort who threatened death if did not at once take up burden proceed for jethro have be liberal with store be a indignant a be at sudden stoppage of ration three day later arrived at small village marked commencement of territory of second chief through whose country road ran here escort carrier left place being supplied by native of village there be difficulty in obtaining supply of grain goat milk cheese be poor substitute for store that elephant have devoured be too glad however at having accomplished toilsome journey to murmur at trifle after day halt proceeded on way fortnight travel stood on lower slope of hill saw across wide belt of flat country expanse of sea glistening in sun two more day journey reached egyptian trading station be situated on little peninsula connected with mainland by narrow neck of land across massive wall have be built to repulse attack of wild tribesman who frequently swept down devastated cultivated field up to very wall a soon a entered town jethro be ordered by official to accompany to house of governor taking chebron with left to amuba to arrange for use of small house during stay governor inquiry be limited to state of country behavior of tribesman along road state of well amount of provision obtainable along line of route there be party of arab trader from other side who wish to pas up to carry good to semneh meroe have detained until news must reach from above for if wrong must happen to countryman might probably enough hold responsible for death might lead to quarrel loss of trade since have passed through with so small party there can be fear can arrange with people who brought down a to amount to be paid to chief for free passage inquired jethro reason for making journey over mountain instead of proceeding by nile replied that have received advantageous offer for merchandise have disposed of to trader going up to meroe that a nile have now fallen danger in passing down cataract be considerable thought better to make short land journey to travel by sea to lower egypt especially a be told that native be now friendly that difficulty must be met with on way reason for choosing that route be that might determine whether on next venture must not be more advantageous to bring down merchandise by ship start from seashore for meroe undoubtedly must be better governor said be wiser to sail two day journey down coast then to journey by way of axoum week rest completely recruited strength of girl jethro then engaged passage in trading ship be going to touch at various small port on way north chapter xviii desert journey journey be long one wind be often so light that vessel scarcely moved heat be greater than anything have felt during journey stopped at many small port on arabian side captain trading with native selling to article of egyptian manufacture buying product of country for sale in party have before starting arranged that must land at town lying at head of gulf of same name forming eastern arm of red seae by so doing must avoid passage through lower egypt e now gulf of question have not be decided without long debate by crossing from arsinoef to pelusium must at latter port be able to obtain passage in phoenician trader to port in north of syria there strike across asia minor for caspian jethro be in favor of route because must save girl long arduous journey up through syria however made light of declared readiness to undergo hardship rather than to run risk of whole party being discovered upon landing at arsinoe on journey north when must pas through very country that amuba chebron have visited be inhabited by ruth people f now suez allowed that time have long since passed when authority must be keeping up special watch for a upon entering port scribe must come on board make list of passenger with place of birth vocation for registration in official record must be difficult in extreme to give such answer a must avoid exciting suspicion when vessel reached mouth of long narrow gulf party be struck by grandeur of mountain rose from water edge on left captain told that chief of be known a mount sinai that barren desolate a land looked contained valley where sheep be pastured where wandering tribe found subsistence hint have be given to captain that have intention of cutting short voyage before arriving at arsinoe for must have seemed extraordinary proceeding for trader journeying with family to leave ship at of arabian port while sailing up gulf mysa complained of illness indeed so overpowered be by heat that there be little fiction in complaint upon arriving at aelana jethro have carried on shore hiring house there stayed on shore while ship be in port there be small egyptian garrison in town carried on considerable trade with moab country to east attention however be paid to landing of trader for a country beyond wall of town lay beyond limit of egyptian rule landing departure of person at port be matter of interest to authority two day later jethro went on board again said that young son be so ill that there be chance of being able to proceed on journey that therefore must forfeit passage money paid to arsinoe said that a might be many week before vessel must come along must endeavor to pay way by trading with native therefore wished to purchase from portion of remaining good suitable for purpose a captain saw that must save provision for five person for month six week that voyage must yet last at same time get rid of of surplus cargo assented without question to jethro proposal several bale of good be made up consisting principally of cloth of various texture color of egyptian manufacture trinket selection of arm be landed two day later vessel set sail jethro called upon egyptian commandant by making handsome present at once enlisted aid in enterprise said that a have be detained by illness of son might be long time before vessel came thought of getting rid of rest of merchandise have brought with by trade with people of moab that can do if reach moab egyptian said for trader be everywhere well received journey from here be not without danger be country without master people have fixed abode moving here there according a can find food for animal sometimes among valley of sinai sometimes in desert to east people plunder whom may come across not content with plunder might slay carry away a slave once have passed through a far a moab be safe a must also be if journeyed to west of salt lake into run river jordan there be many tribe there living in city warlike valorous people among whom also must be safe have have many war with not always to advantage between be sort of truce molest army marching along by seacoast do go up among hill to meddle with be people who at one time conquered portion of lower egypt reigned over for many generation until happily rose drove out be journey between salt lake speak of arduous one be by mean difficult except that be best to carry water upon journey for well be few often dry country be flat for whole distance indeed there be tradition that gulf at one time extended a far north a salt lake road therefore though stony rough offer difficulty must advise if determine upon journey to leave son behind be better for to travel than to remain here without jethro said if go up through people speak of to west of lake river must be short journey for after disposing of good to make way down to port on great sea whence may take ship return quickly to pelusium thus arrive home before must find ship to take hence be so egyptian said wind be so uncertain on sea a far a time go might journey by route propose reach egypt more speedily than must do if went on board ship at once danger lie almost entirely in first portion of journey caravan go hence once twice year through moab to palmyra be numerous well armed capable of resisting attack by robber tribesman one left few week ago may be month before start what animal must recommend to take with beyond doubt camel be best be used little in country come down sometimes with caravan from palmyra believe that there be at present in town arab who posse six seven of came down with last caravan be taken ill unable to return with doubtless must make bargain with will send soldier with to house occupies jethro found that man be anxious to return to own country lay on border of medium therefore directly in direction jethro wished to travel be however unwilling to undertake journey except with caravan having intended to wait for next however long time might be sum jethro offered for hire of animal a far a palmyra at last induced to consent to make journey at once bargaining however that party of ten armed men must be hired a escort a far a border of moab highly pleased with result of inquiry jethro returned home told companion arrangement have made have only arranged for journey a far a palmyra said a must have raised suspicion have engaged for whole journey to medium of course will gladly continue arrangement for whole journey have bargained for escort of ten men will take twenty there be ample store of father gold still unexhausted indeed have spent little yet for sale of good when left boat paid expense of journey up nile therefore a seems to be most hazardous part of journey will not stint money in performing in safety have told that will start in week time must not do to leave earlier must not recover too rapidly from illness in meantime will make business to pick out score of good fighting men a escort in egyptian captain be of use recommending men whose family resided in aelana must therefore be hostage for fidelity be necessary for small portion of men to be met with in little town be native tribesman who have encamped at short distance from wall have come in to trade in horse wool of flock for cloth of egypt such men a must have be source of danger rather than of protection by end of week have collected party of twenty men of whom be to provide own horse sum agreed upon for escort be to be paid into hand of egyptian officer who be to hand to on return with document signed by jethro to effect that have faithfully carried out term of agreement jethro found that expense of escort be le than have anticipated for when men found that party must be strong one therefore capable of protecting on journey out on return demanded moderate sum for service when owner of camel learned that have decided positively to pas to east of salt lake advised strongly instead of following valley of aelana to salt lake where must be difficult to obtain water to take road to east of range of hill skirting valley so to proceed through petra shobek karik to hesbon in moab be route followed by caravan village must be found at very short distance there be difficulty about water camel said can go long distance without water must take valley route horse must

on to sundown must accomplish in two day after can travel at ease village lie few mile apart let push on then by mean said jethro can stay day at petra to rest beast let get through desolate dangerous country a soon a can girl have be greatly amused at first at appearance of strange animal be carrying soon found that swinging action be extremely fatiguing must have gladly got down walked jethro however said that must not be for pace of animal deliberate though seemed be yet too great for to keep up with on foot be needful for first two day to push on at full speed sun blazed with tremendous force be reflected from black rock of hill white sand lying between stone everywhere strewed plain along be traveling heat be terrible after traveling for three hour halted for hour jethro managed with pole have be brought to form framework of tent cloth to fasten awning over basket in girl be riding camel have lain down a soon a halted girl stepped into basket before arose gave simultaneous cry a animal rose have prepared for to rise on fore leg when hind quarter suddenly rose in air be almost thrown from basket like creature bit mysa said a moved on who must suppose that be going to get

have brought ample store of cooked provision for own use in short time quiet reigned in camp journey have be hot fatiguing one men wrapping in cloak lay down by spear be soon asleep with exception of four who took post a sentry jethro have agreed with amuba chebron that also must divide night between taking by turn to keep watch men of escort be however of opinion that there be very little probability of attack before morning even have be watched by party among hill must hardly hope to take by surprise for must be sure that must set watch in darkness must not make way down hill without noise besides believe power of evil be potent at night seldom stir out of camp after dark if be attacked at be likely to be just before sunrise jethro have therefore arranged that chebron must keep first watch amuba second that must take charge four hour before daylight night passed without cause for alarm a soon a daylight broke camp be astir ration of water grain be served out to horse hasty meal be made by men just a sun rose cavalcade moved on have journeyed mile when from behind spur of hill running out in plain large party be seen to issue forth there must have be fully hundred of of whom twenty be mounted rest on foot traveler halted have short consultation jethro with one of escort then rode out to meet advancing party waving white cloth in token of amity two of arab rode forward to meet be time before jethro returned to party who be anxiously awaiting termination of colloquy what do say jethro amuba asked a rode up say to begin with ought to have purchased from right of traveling across country said must gladly have paid moderate sum have be aware that such be required that a be not in aelana must not tell that claimed right at same time be ready to make offer of

posse by arab rascal besides a there be twenty three of well armed ought to be able to cut way through at worst girl must mount behind must make circuit so a to avoid footman if horseman ventured to attack must soon give good account of yes must lose seven camel load of good will want for trade a go along jethro said propose that must form camel into square a did last night that two six of men armed with bow arrow will occupy take care of girl while rest of charge arab if can defeat horseman be probable that men on foot will draw off while be doing so of on foot may rush forward attack will take care not to pursue can rely upon coming to assistance a soon a be attacked think be best plan jethro can keep off for time with bow arrow for certainly chebron can bring down man with shot at hundred yard jethro chose six of men who professed to be good archer horse leg be tied animal thrown down just outside square formed by kneeling camel strict instruction be given to girl to lie down saddle bale be arranged outside camel to shield from missile then when be prepared white flag be lowered jethro with fourteen men rode at full gallop against arab trusting to somewhat superior number arab horseman advanced to meet jethro party obeying order to keep in close line together with spear leveled in front of rode right over arab who came up singly without order men horse rolled over together several of former transfixed by spear of horseman jethro called upon men to halt turned upon arab of latter fled toward footman who be running up to assistance be pursued cut down others fought to last silently desperately too be slain a soon a footman approached opened fire with sling stone jethro rallied men formed in line again at head charged arab latter fought steadily giving way for moment closed in round little party of horseman throwing javelin hacking at with sword jethro spurred horse into midst dealing blow right left with heavy ax follower pressed after after hard fighting cut way through opponent again again maneuver be repeated resistance of arab weakening a most of best men have fallen while large shield carried by horseman repelled greater part of missile hurled at minute two arab broke fled from hill leaving over twenty of number on ground in addition to whole of mounted men jethro have now time to look round saw for first time that have not a supposed be engaged with whole of enemy party while fifty of have attacked rest have made direct for camel be now gathered in mass around with shout to men to follow jethro galloped at full speed toward arab with shout flung upon clearing way through with ax be just in time desperate conflict be raging across camel at one point several of arab have broken into square be opposed by amuba chebron one of men while others still held back arab on other side arrival of jethro followed closely by rest of men instantly put stop to conflict arab no longer thought of attacking with cry of dismay started for hill hotly pursued by horseman who followed until reached foot of rock a soon a arab gained fastness again betook to sling horseman fell back to camel jethro have not joined in pursuit a soon a arab fled have leaped from horse be almost too late jethro amuba said be indeed jethro replied thought be engaged with whole of footman in heat of fight did not notice that party have moved off to attack be terribly hurt fear chebron be girl unharmed mysa ruth have risen to foot a soon a attack ceased be safe mysa replied oh how terribly be hurt of jethro too be wounded wound be nothing jethro said let look to of chebron first for chebron have sat down against one of camel be alarmed chebron said faintly think be only loss of blood shield covered body now girl jethro said do

be dead three others severely wounded of jethro party two have fallen have received wound more le severe have not be for shield covered body few must have emerged alive from conflict gave immense advantage over arab who carried such mean of protection owner of camel have escaped unhurt having remained during fight hidden under bale a soon a wound be bandaged drink of wine water have be served out to camel be unbound permitted to rise three of men most seriously wounded being unable to sit on horse be placed on bale carried by camel party again set out be well that be obliged to proceed at pace of camel for several men must scarcely sit horse must not have done so at pace exceeding walk now amuba let hear about fight jethro said have not have time to ask question yet there be naught to tell amuba said saw charge down upon horseman destroy then ride into middle of foot at once party of about thirty strong detached made straight for a soon a came within range of arrow began shot four before reached think chebron did same men with shot poorly think that can have killed more than seven eight between however altogether that accounted for about number there be only about fifteen who got up to hand to hand fight with for bit aided by breastwork kept out at last managed to spring over although be doing best several of have fallen have be wounded must have gone very hard with in minute two if have not come up to rescue now let hear what be doing jethro then described encounter party have have with footman fight well arab said be well for that carried shield for have not done so must have riddled with javelin a see have narrow escape for have dart went through ear be inch two to right must have pierced eye have two three nasty gash with sword on leg think that most of other men came out worse than did be lucky that did not strike at horse suppose wanted so avoided inflicting injury on however have be tough fight be well out of hope will not be called on to use battle ax again until be fighting in rank of rebu chapter xix home at last when neared petra horn be heard to blow people be seen running about among house take for party of arab one of horseman said a have often be through town be known to several person here will if like hurry on tell that be peaceful traveler party halted for few minute then moved slowly forward again by time reached town news that party be trader have spread people be issuing from house be small solidly built of stone be one story high roof be flat with low wall running round house have one door opening externally be very low narrow so that inside must offer determined resistance against entry a town stood on slope of hill roof of lower house be commanded by from above place be capable of offering determined resistance against marauding head man of place met traveler conducted to empty house placed at disposal offered present of fowl date wine news that heavy defeat have be inflicted upon one of wandering band excited satisfaction for interference of plunderer greatly affected prosperity of place a inhabitant be unable to trade with aelana unless going down in very strong party attention be paid to party by inhabitant wound be bathed oil poured into in more serious case boiled herb of medicinal virtue be applied a poultice to wound petra at time be large village after ward rose into place of importance traveler remained here for week at end of time save two be in fit state to continue journey without further adventure journey be continued to moab on arrival here escort be dismissed man receiving present in addition to stipulated rate of pay that be to draw upon return to aelana moab be settled country contained large town population be considerable be gathered in small village of low stone built house similar to in petra inhabitant be ready to trade language be strange to jethro amuba be closely related to spoken by ruth generally acted a interpreter between jethro native after traveling through moab took caravan road across desert to northeast passed through oasis of palmyra large flourishing city then journeyed on euphrates be now in country of assyrian not wishing to attract attention question avoided nineveh other great city kept on way north until reached mountainous country lying between assyria caspian met with many delay upon way be six month after leaving aelana before after passing through portion of persia reached country inhabited by scattered tribe known by general name of medes to whom rebu be related through country thotmes have carried arm most of tribe acknowledged dominion of egypt paid tribute to country egyptian garrison being scattered here there among jethro amuba now felt at home a determined that when reached own country must until found how matter be going on there disguise identity now traveled a persian trader long before reaching persia have disposed of stock of good with started have now supplied with article of persian manufacture thus passed on unquestioned from village to village a trade in region be entirely carried on by persian merchant country having already attained comparatively high amount of civilization while median tribe although settled down into fixed community have a yet little knowledge of art of peace party journeyed in company with persian trader gradually worked way north until arrived at first rebu village have many time debated question of part must here play have agreed that must be better to continue to maintain character a persian trader until have learned exact position of affair in order to be able to keep up disguise have laid in fresh stock of persian good at last large town through passed have jethro be alone must at once have declared must have be received with joy a one who have made way back from captivity in egypt for amuba there must have be danger in being recognized until disposition of occupant of throne be discovered there must indeed have be small chance of being recognized have be alone nearly four year have elapsed since have be carried away captive have grown from boy into powerful young man have jethro be recognized companion identity might have be suspected a be known to have be special mentor companion of young prince a to amuba have desire to occupy throne of rebu desired only to reside quietly in native country large sum ameres have handed over to care of jethro have be much diminished by expense of long journey there be still ample to insure for good position in country where money be not abundant in journey through persia have picked up many of word of language differing from of rebu using in conversation be able to pas well a trader who in previous journey in land have acquired fair knowledge of dialect of people soon learned that egyptian garrison still occupied capital that people groaned under exaction necessary to pay annual tribute that general amusis who have a amuba father expected must do seized throne of rebu after departure of main egyptian army be in close intimacy with egyptian official be in consequence extremely unpopular among people have on accession to power put to death relative of late king who must be considered a rival claimant for throne there must be little doubt did suspect that amuba have returned from egypt must not hesitate to remove from path amuba have several long consultation with jethro a to course repeated to conversation that have have with father on day previous to battle in latter be slain how have warned against ambition of amusis advised rather than risk chance of civil war in endeavoring to assert right to collect body of adherent to seek new home in far west jethro however be strongly of opinion that advice although excellent at time be no longer appropriate to begin with amuba be then boy of sixteen engaged a be in war with people must naturally have preferred having well known skillful general at head to boy whom must not hope must lead successfully in war be now man have have wide experience have acquaintance with manner way of conqueror be on throne must do much for people must promote welfare by encouraging new method of agriculture teaching something of civilization in egypt in second place in four year have elapsed amusis have have time to make unpopular necessity for heavy taxation to raise annual tribute have naturally told against to say nothing of fact that be said to be on friendly term with foreign oppressor therefore chance must be in favor have desire to be king amuba replied want to live in quiet contentment be born to be king prince amuba jethro said be not matter of choice besides be evident that for good of people be necessary that present usurper must be overthrown lawful dynasty restored besides be clear that can not live in peace contentment a say might at moment be recognized life forfeited a to original plan be sure that father must not have advocated under changed circumstance besides think have have fair share of wandering danger moreover suppose must hardly wish to drag mysa with on journey to unknown country where sort of trial struggle must unquestionably be encountered before succeed in founding new settlement suppose said with smile must not propose leaving here to whatever fate might befall fancy from what have seen during last six month that have altogether other intention concerning amuba be silent for time if amusis be supported by egyptian said at last be viewed by a ally must not be able to overthrow without becoming involved in hostility with also be not went on seeing that jethro be about to speak of garrison here that be thinking of power of egypt behind did overthrow amusis defeat egyptian friend must bring upon country fresh war with egypt egypt be a have found very long way off amuba occasionally warlike monarch arises under whom arm be carried vast distance many nation be brought under sway such effort be made rarely lie at extremest limit of power thotmes have gained sufficient glory be absent for year from country at end of long journeying returned home to enjoy fruit of victory be not likely that must again start on so long expedition merely to bring so distant corner of land subject to egypt again under sway land be stripped of wealth there be nothing to reward such vast toil outlay must be required to carry out such expedition may be generation before monarch may arise thirsting like thotmes for glory willing to leave luxury of egypt for course of distant conquest besides egypt have already learned to cost that rebu be not to be overcome bloodlessly that defeat be just a likely a victory to attend arm against therefore think that thought of vengeance of egypt need deter in other respect present occupation by be in favor rather than otherwise for will appear before people not only a rightful king a liberator from hated egyptian yoke be right jethro amuba said after long silence be duty to assert right to restore land to freedom mind be made up now what be advice in matter must journey through land until reach port by sea frequented by persian trader must there leave two girl in charge of family of trader in country there can remain in tranquillity until matter be settled chebron will be sure insist upon sharing fortune long wandering have made man of too have not only strengthened frame hardened constitution have given stability to character be thoughtful prudent advice will always be valuable while of courage have more doubt than have of yours when have once gained kingdom will find in chebron wise counselor one on whom can lean in time of difficulty when have left girl behind will continue journey through land gradually put into communication with such governor of town other person of influence a may learn to be discontented with present state of thing so that when strike blow whole country will declare for at once a travel will gradually collect body of determined men for surprise of capital there must be number of old friend comrade still surviving there must be difficulty in collecting force capable of capturing city by surprise jethro plan be carried out girl placed under care of wife of persian trader in seaport close to frontier of persia others then started upon journey still traveling a persian jethro have little difficulty in discovering sentiment of principal men in town through passed introducing first to a persian trader desirous of protection in traveling through country soon disclosed to own individuality to many of be known either personally by repute informed that have escaped from egypt with amuba led to believe that companion be waiting in persian territory until learned from that country be ripe for appearance for thought best in case to disclose fact that amuba be with lest of with whom communicated must endeavor to gain reward from king by betraying tidings be everywhere received with joy in many case jethro be urged to send at once for amuba to show to people for land must instantly rise on behalf jethro however declared that amuba must bide time for premature disclosure must enable king to call together portion of army have formerly fought under order that with assistance of egyptian might be able to form successful resistance to popular rising intend said if possible to collect small force to seize person of usurper by surprise so paralyze resistance in case there must only be egyptian to deal with must be starved out of fortress long before assistance must reach after visiting most of town jethro companion journeyed through village remote from capital here king authority be lightly felt save when troop arrived once year to gather in tax caution be therefore necessary jethro soon made known began to enlist men to service have difficulty in doing news that attempt be at once to be made to overthrow usurper to free land of egyptian at proper time rightful king must present take command be received with enthusiasm in valley through passed whole of young men enrolled receiving order to remain perfectly quiet to busy in fabricating arm of land have be stripped by egyptian until messenger arrived summoning to meet at rendezvous on appointed day in six week number of enrolled have reached point be considered necessary for enterprise day be fixed on be to assemble among hill few mile distant from town upon appointed day band began to arrive jethro have purchased cattle provision receiving band a arrived formed into company appointed leader great fire be lighted cattle slaughtered chebron aided in arrangement amuba by jethro advice passed day in small tent have be pitched in center of camp by evening whole of contingent have arrived jethro saw with satisfaction spirit animated useful if somewhat rough weapon that have fashioned when have assembled drew up in body after speech excited patriotic feeling to utmost went to tent leading amuba forth presented to a king have in journey through town procured from of principal men arm armor fitted for person of high rank have be lying concealed since conquest by egyptian amuba be accoutered in a appeared at door of tent wild shout of greeting burst from troop breaking rank rushed forward throwing on face round hailed a king promised to follow to death be long time before enthusiasm excitement abated then amuba addressed follower promising deliverance from egyptian yoke from taxation under so long groaned week be spent in establishing order discipline in gathering sentry being placed at distance round camp to prevent stranger entering one leaving to carry news to city in meantime trusted men be sent to town to ascertain exact position of affair there to learn whether garrison have be placed on guard by rumor might have reached town of disaffection in country district returned with intelligence that although report have be received that late king son have escaped captivity in egypt must shortly appear to claim right news have be received with absolute incredulity king egyptian ally scoffing at idea of captive making escape from egypt traversing long intervening distance so complete have be quiet throughout country since egyptian occupation that garrison have ceased to take precaution watch be set gate of city be seldom closed even at night plan be now finally arranged jethro with band of two hundred men be to enter town in daytime going down to next port arriving by sea others entering singly through gate at midnight be to assemble in square round palace be to be suddenly attacked amuba with main body be to approach city late in evening to station near one of gate jethro be before hour named for attack to see whether gate be open unguarded if found that be closed under charge of egyptian guard be to tell off fifty men of command to attack overpower egyptian throw open gate instant heard trumpet be to be signal for attack of palace jethro party be therefore first to start going off in little group to neighboring port others direct to city jethro be last to set out having given instruction to group a started a to behavior entry into city rendezvous at be to assemble also arranged that if at time must hear call upon horn be to be repeated by three four of follower who be provided with similar instrument be to hurry to spot at top of speed one can never tell said when told amuba order have given what may happen believe that man here be devoted to there may always be one traitor in crowd even without careless speech on part of one of quarrel with one of king men with egyptian number of armed men in city might be discovered for others must run up to help comrade broil must grow until be involved other reason might render advisable to strike at earlier hour than arranged can not think so amuba replied must say if anything be to precipitate affair must be most prejudicial with small force must be certain to be overwhelmed by large body of follower whom a have learned king keep in palace to say nothing of egyptian in case not only must lose life must put so thoroughly upon guard that enterprise at night must have little chance of success be true jethro said certainly mean to make slightest variation from plan agreed upon unless be driven to still be a well to be prepared for everything of course know that will hing be rash jethro after being year guide counselor know that must hing to endanger success now that seems almost assured jethro have in fact reason for wishing to be able to collect men suddenly have not mentioned to amuba thought possible that a have said at last moment plot might by mean other be discovered idea be that if be case must instantly gather follower attack palace trusting to surprise to knowledge of building in endeavor to fight way to king abode slay there even if men be afterward surrounded cut to piece usurper once removed jethro have doubt that whole nation must gladly acknowledge amuba who must then have only egyptian garrison to deal with such accident however happened men entered town unnoticed who have come by boat who be for most part native of village along shore remained in lower town near landing place such of a have friend went to house who entered gate sauntered about town singly in pair a weapon be hidden attracted notice having appearance of men who have come in from country round to dispose of produce spoil of chase to exchange for such article a be required at home jethro went at once to house of old friend with whom have already communicated by messenger house be situated on open space facing palace here from time to time received message from sub leader learned that be going on well heard that continual rumor from country of approaching return of son of late king have at last caused anxiety to usurper who have that morning seized thrown into prison several leading men who be known to be personally attached to late king not indeed that believed that amuba must have returned thought possible that impostor might be trading on name several body of men have be dispatched from town to place whence rumor have be received to ascertain what truth there be in to suppress at once sign of revolt against king authority be highly satisfactory news to jethro a in first place showed that king did not dream of danger in capital in second place reduced number of fighting men in palace to number slightly exceeding force at own disposal jethro did not stir abroad until face being so well known in town that might at moment be recognized a soon a be dark went out accompanied by friend went round town found that change have taken place since have last be there egyptian have entirely cleared away hut toward end of rock furthest from sea have there erected large building for use of governor officer troop have run wall across from wall on side entirely separating quarter from rest of town jethro friend informed that erection of building have greatly added to hatred with egyptian be regarded a have be erected with forced labor people being driven in by thousand compelled to work for many month at building jethro learned that a soon a inner wall be completed egyptian have ceased altogether to keep watch at gate of city wall that have for long time kept vigilant guard at gate leading to quarter through new wall for last year however owing to absence of spirit of revolt among rebu to confidence in friendship of king have greatly relaxed vigilance by nine o'clock be quiet in town jethro sent out messenger by road by amuba force must approach to tell that city wall be unguarded that have better enter by gate hour before midnight instead of waiting until heard signal for attack must then move men up close to egyptian wall so a to attack gate when signal be given otherwise egyptian must be put on guard by sound of fighting at palace before must arrive at gate at time have named jethro went to gate by amuba be to enter soon heard faint confused noise minute two later dark mass of men be at path at gate be headed by amuba jethro at once explained to exact position companion placed by side of amuba to act a guide to egyptian wall jethro then returned to rendezvous where men be already drawn up in order midnight be now close at hand quietly band crossed square to gate of palace then jethro gave loud blast of horn in instant party of men armed with heavy ax rushed forward began to hew down gate a thundering noise rose on night air cry of terror shout of officer be heard within royal inclosure then men came hurrying along wall arrow began to fall among assailant by time work of axmen be nearly done in five minute after first blow be struck massive gate fell splintered jethro rushed in at head of band garrison headed by usurper endeavored to stem inrush taken by surprise half armed ignorant of number of assailant must not long withstand determined onslaught of jethro men jethro made way through crowd of fighting men engaged in hand to hand fight with usurper who furious with rage despair at sudden capture of palace fought wildly jethro heavy ax soon terminated conflict by hewing clean through helmet head fall of usurper be for moment unnoticed in darkness confusion jethro shouted to men to hold hand fall back then called upon garrison to surrender telling that amusis have fallen that amuba son of phrase have arrived be now king of rebu war against own people egyptian be only enemy of may know be jethro call upon to join make common cause against egyptian who be even now being attacked by young king garrison be too glad to accept term fear rather than love have attached to amusis be delighted to escape prospect of death have moment before stared in face to swear allegiance to rightful king a jethro ceased therefore shout of long live amuba king of rebu rose from form up in order instantly under captain jethro commanded follow fray have be so short that be ten minute from moment when jethro horn have given signal for attack to when led force now increased to twice former dimension to assistance of amuba when reached wall separated egyptian barrack from rest of town found that amuba have entered without resistance have captured two three building nearest to gate surprising slaying occupant beyond that have made progress egyptian be veteran in warfare after first moment of surprise have recovered coolness with flight of arrow so swept open space between building that rebu must make progress jethro ordered troop who have just joined of whom carried bow arrow to ascend wall open fire upon building occupied by egyptian then with own band joined amuba have gone well said palace be captured amusis slain must hing further to night egyptian be four thousand strong while have number must be madness to risk repulse now will send off messenger at once to governor of town to friend there informing that usurper be slain that be proclaimed king be now besieging egyptian in quarter ordering to march hither at once with man capable of bearing arm in three day will have twenty thousand men here egyptian finding position hopeless will surrender whereas if attack now may be repulsed may be slain in case country left without leader will fall again into slavery amuba whose armor have already be pierced by several arrow who be bleeding freely be with difficulty persuaded by jethro to adopt counsel saw at last that be clearly wisest plan to adopt order be at once issued to men to desist from further assault to content with repelling attack egyptian might make however be too ignorant a to strength of assailant to think of taking offensive until morning side contented with keeping up incessant fire of arrow against opening in building occupied by foe in morning amuba ordered green branch to be elevated on flat terrace of house occupied signal be observed fire of egyptian ceased a soon a did so jethro presented on terrace minute two later egyptian governor appeared on terrace of opposite building not little surprised be to hear addressed in own language in name of king amuba son of king phrase lawful ruler of rebu jethro general summon to surrender usurper amusis be dead whole land have risen against force be overpowering resistance can only result in death of egyptian under order did choose must starve out for know that have more than week provision in magazine there be possibility that assistance can reach messenger must pas watcher in plain must do so nearest force be hundred of mile away be of strength to fight way hither in name of king offer to allow to depart carrying with arm standard king have be in country know how great powerful be nation fain must be on term of friendship with therefore must inflict indignity upon tribute king laid upon land be far more than can pay king will be willing to send year to nearest garrison to frontier tribute of gold precious stone of one fifth value of have be until now wrung from land will do a proof of honor in hold great nation a recognition of power king ordered to say that will give until to morrow morning to reflect over offer if be refused whole garrison will be put to sword so saying jethro descended from terrace leaving egyptian to consider term proposed chapter xx king of rebu offer that amuba have made through jethro be politic one be influenced by two motif in granting delay of twenty four hour before receiving answer in first place felt sure that own force must before conclusion of time be trebled in strength must egyptian refuse must be able to repel effort might make to cut way out until must be at head of such force that must at will storm position a intended beleaguer until starvation forced to surrender in second place thought that egyptian answer if given at once must probably be refusal time for reflection must enable to look position in face to recognize hopelessness on one side must be certain defeat death on other general must lead out command intact without dishonor although have threatened to put garrison to sword in case refused amuba have intention to carry out threat on contrary have determined that even be egyptian forced to surrender by famine must freely grant same term now offered knew proud haughty nature of egyptian that news of massacre of great garrison successful rising of tributary province must excite such deep feeling sooner later army must be dispatched to avenge disaster if however garrison left country with arm standard disgrace must be inflicted upon national arm a tribute however much reduced must still be paid must still regard rebu a under domination reduction of tribute indeed must be almost imperceptible item in revenue of egypt leaving jethro in command of beleaguering force amuba accompanied by chebron who have be by side during fighting small bodyguard went back into town news of coming have already spread inhabitant who have remained in house in terror during to unaccountable tumult of night have now poured out into street great space in front of palace being densely packed with people a amuba approached deafening shout of welcome be raised gate of prison have be thrown open arrested previous day many others of principal captain of father army thronged round greeted a king with difficulty way be cleared to gate of royal inclosure amuba after entering mounted wall addressed few word to people told that in defiance of probability have escaped from captivity in egypt have made way back to native land intent not so much on claiming rightful position there a of freeing from power of oppressor promised that must always respect right usage must endeavor to follow in footstep of father then retired to palace where held council with captain leading men in city order be at once issued for man capable of bearing arm to provide with kind of weapon to assemble at noon in great square list be drawn up of officer of late army still living in town when gathering took place at noon be appointed to form men into company to appoint sub officer to see to state of arm a far a possible to supply deficiency larger proportion than be expected of three thousand men assembled be found to be provided with weapon although nominally arm have be surrendered to egyptian great number of spear arrow head sword ax have be buried shaft have be hastily made for spear bow used for purpose of chase be now brought out to do service a fighting weapon many hundred of spear sword have be found in store at palace when be served out most of men have weapon of sort be at once marched up to egyptian inclosure with bow arrow be placed upon wall rest be massed near gate in readiness to advance to assistance of band within must egyptian make attempt to cut way out in point of number amuba force be now superior to of egyptian be well aware that superior arm discipline of latter must enable to make successful sortie must determine to do so woman of town be ordered to set to work to grind grain served out from magazine in palace to bake bread for fighting men present for expected to arrive by noon latter began to flock in contingent from town arriving in regular order while shepherd villager straggled in irregularly a news reached of event of previous night by evening fully ten thousand men have arrived a egyptian have remained quiet day amuba have hope that have
