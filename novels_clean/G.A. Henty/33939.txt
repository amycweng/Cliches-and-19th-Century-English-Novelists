whole of mr andrew earnings need no longer be devoted now boy mr andrew said on memorable evening want in future when come in to change working clothes before come in here to tea so long a lived in kitchen have let thing go on think there be something in old saying 'company clothes company manner think be good when boy come in must lay aside heavy nailed shoe working clothes certainly such boot clothes be apt to render people clumsy in movement difference of walk observe between men of different class arises very greatly from clumsy heavy boot workingman must wear what doe matter mother george urged for seemed to that must be rather trouble to change clothes day little thing make real difference to man not vital difference george real difference for manner make man know be influence stranger people who only know in connection with business if two men apply together for place chance be strongly in favor of man with best manner getting besides boy think observance of little courtesy of kind make home pleasanter brighter see always change dress before tea be sure prefer sitting down to table tidy neat with fresh collar cuff to taking place in working dress with odds end of thread litter clinging to of course do mother see what mean now certainly will change thing in future mind do bill bill must not have minded in least amount of trouble by must give slightest satisfaction to mr andrew who have now place in affection closely approximating to george occupied during summer month programme for evening be not carried out a arranged for at end of april mr andrew

one read about just same way a wave make when go down go down bill thank ye go down river toss little boat about seem possible that water can toss about so high a doe doe seem extraordinary bill know that be so because there be constantly wreck looking at water doe not seem possible that must rise up into wave large enough to knock one of great steamer in piece day bill not year of course because house be finished next year hope will be able of to go down for trip to sea have seen stuck up can go to margate back for three four shilling though bob grimstone say be regular sea must be enough to

start country might visit george be telling companion port must touch if destination be china absorbed in conversation paid attention to anything else until george gave sudden exclamation good gracious bill why ship be ever so far behind be two mile must think from town must set to work sha be back in time for dinner boy knowledge of navigation of thames be not sufficient to tell to row

make difference whether be duke ship caulker who be father still be right that must know fact a one can say when start on voyage in life what craft may fall aboard before have done may be harry that a intends to stick to merchant service saving of course little time mean to serve on board king ship may rise to be skipper perhaps owner may be boy that a skipper may fall in love with taut craft sailing in convoy have seen such thing before now then fact that might be for aught know son of marquis instead of being that of boatswain might score in favor woman have curious notion though for part ca see that make much difference where keel of craft be laid a long a be sound well built there be who think different well to tell yarn be nigh fourteen year ago be boatswain aboard alert

slip away without ever having rope stay started by shot in alert have be on footstep dozen time have have no more luck than rest of mere name of seamew be sufficient to put one of into passion there be one of ship company from captain down to powder monkey who must have cheerfully given year pay to get alongside seamew alert carried thirty two gun crew be stronger than usual in vessel of size for there be good deal of boat service be considered that at moment jack ' might lay good many hand up down a case may be well one night be at anchor in porto rico first lieutenant have strolled up with

pirate before have finished transferring cargo of prize under own hatch not light be shown a moon be not up hoped to get within gunshot before being seen a pirate seeing craft within sight before sun went down must not suspect that alert must be on trace have to sail close to wind till be round point of island then to run nearly before towards spot where vessel have be seen in two hour from time of starting reckoned that must be getting close to if still remained hove to of sudden two mile ahead point two off starboard bow great flame shot up moment grew grew until must see large ship in

burning merchantman so while spar stood out clear distinct against glare of light must have be invisible to word be passed quickly forward for men to go to quarter gun be double shotted run out then being ready for fight men stripped to waist cutlass boarding pike ready to hand waited with breathless anxiety be already within range of bow chaser a yet there be sign that pirate be conscious of presence boat be now near doubt on board be looking rather in direction than to windward rapidly alert tore through water sail trimmer be ready to take in light canvas at moment notice officer clustered on quarter deck men stood by gun with eye strained at pirate nearer nearer came hope rose higher higher be within mile now when suddenly great movement be seen on board pirate breeze be steady sea quiet loud word of command must be heard shouted a swarm of men ran up rattlins be clear be seen there be further need of concealment captain gave word for bow chaser to open quickly a pirate got canvas spread do think sharp a have be on board alert seamew be even quicker in getting under canvas be scarce quarter of mile from when got fairly under way up to moment not gun have spoken save two bow chaser a captain must not yaw until last moment then round came poured broadside into seamew order have be given to fire high man be on mettle maintop mast of seamew fell snapped at cap peak halyard of mizzen be shot away number of hole be drilled through sail loud cheer broke from men fast a seamew be be sufficiently crippled now to prevent getting away at last be to show whether must fight a well a run must say for did carried twenty gun against thirty two be of far heavier metal after ten minute alert be a much bruised battered a if have be fighting frenchman of equal size for hour however have not be idle a shot have be principally directed against enemy rigging a great object be to cripple so prevent her from getting away be by time mere wreck above although side be scarcely touched whereas two of port have be knocked into one thirty of men have be struck down by shot by splinter pouring last broadside into captain ordered alert to be brought alongside seamew there be need to call upon boarder to be ready man be prepared a vessel came alongside men rushed to assault crew of seamew be a eager to board a be upon very bulwark desperate combat ensued strong a be seamew carried fully a many hand a be fighting with halter round neck be little wonder that fought so well have be in good many fight never did see one like man hacked hewed wielded boarding pike a if whole fight depended upon single exertion gradually men whose place be at gun on starboard side left place joined in fight while on port side continued to pour fire of grape into enemy be near hour before got fair footing on pirate deck then steadily gradually fought way forward be half hour after pirate captain officer have be killed fully crew cut down that rest surrendered

more surprised than when getting there found that be trunk that in sitting up be child about eighteen month old be harry in bottom of trunk be locket with woman likeness in curious indian bangle few

there be a snug comfortable a if have be laying in own cot though by way be squalling a loud a litter of kitten expect have missed breakfast considerably be sitting up be lucky that be backward of age for although by size guessed to be eighteen month be still unable to walk if have be a active a chap of age must have scrambled onto foot doubt capsized boat well brought on board there be great talk a to what be to be done with a be discoverer claimed a lawful prize thought must amuse old woman while be at sea perhaps be comfort to when got laid up in ordinary a indeed have be so that be know harry inquiry be made never heard of ship exactly answered to description see beyond fact that be square rigged ship must say little about ornament found in box seemed to show that have come from east

harm to place look more like men who have belonged to seamew be talking to about than honest english fisherman be curious thing dad that frenchman must be coming backwards forward here wonder that revenue people inquire into suppose that know very much about harry come off on generally arriving at night leaving few hour afterwards hear about thing because everyone know that old peter langley be not chap to put nose into other people business like going on must say consider will end badly however be business of ours lad get brandy cheap in hayling nowhere cheaper must say after be matter

therefore a ran along with light springy tread sound of footstep be deadened a came along by cottage of have be speaking to peter langley heard sound of voice within being curious to see what mysterious frenchman be like harry paused lightly lifted latch of gate entered little garden have intended to peep in at window having satisfied curiosity to be off just a reached door latter opened suddenly harry have only time to draw back behind little porch before two men came out in one harry recognized by voice smuggler black jack other be by halting english evidently foreigner stopped for moment looking out into night tell smuggler said be going to be storm mistake lucy be tight craft have weathered gale when many bigger ship have gone down still like running out into without necessity necezity said frenchman sould have sought zat ze earning of five hundred pound be a urgent necezity a be wanted aye money will be handy enough smuggler said though one doe put one head into noose to

will go round tell boy warned to be in readiness will send straight down to beach in quarter of hour will return for while conversation have be going on harry have be standing against porch side of be filled with latticework over creeper grew have be frightened at importance of secret that be hearing have be rapidly meditating in mind how portant information be about to be conveyed to enemy must be stopped have made up mind that instant smuggler moved out must make way down to village tell tale to dozen men have frenchman seized saw at once that must be difficult for smuggler gang be not men to be attacked with impunity fisher of village must hesitate in taking part in such struggle merely on information of boy however harry saw that be only chance in anxiety to stand close to lattice so hide from view of two men who be standing on little garden path in front pressed too hard against woodwork be rotten with age suddenly with crash gave way with oath smuggler turned round frenchman dashed to spot in instant have collared lad in moment be dragged into room must cut throat mounseer smuggler said with terrible imprecation scoundrel have heard what have said life wo be worth minute

spoken no word from time be grasped felt in instant that life be forfeited be surprised that have not be instantly killed have not raised voice to hallo for knew that cottager be near be sure that attempt to give alarm must insure instant death to struggle must have be useless be unarmed although stout lad be child in grasp of powerful man like smuggler saw too that on instant frenchman have drawn dagger from breast though more quiet than smuggler felt by tone of voice that be a determined a colleague that silence must be secured by death in minute be bound thrown into corner frenchman then took seat near assuring in low tone that must at first movement plant dagger in heart smuggler strolled off to summon crew for quarter of hour silence reigned in cottage be one fool frenchman said at last a if have be thinking matter over one meddlesome fool why want to listen at people door learn zeir secret want to kill what be to do make kill push own head into ze trap zat be ze way wi

later smuggler returned men have gone down to boat said briefly come along mounseer bring tin case with pistol zere be fear zat forget ze tin case frenchman said a to ze pistol zey be not of much use however will take zem thrust into pocket of coat smuggler stooped picked up harry threw onto sail have laid on ground wrapped round then cast over shoulder be not likely to meet anyone on way to boat said must do so be taking mainsail of lucy down to in minute harry heard door slam then felt being carried steadily along weight being a nothing to smuggler not word be spoken between two men on way down to shore presently harry felt by deadened sound of footstep by more uneven motion that be being carried over sandy slope down to edge of sea through canvas must hear loud roar of wave be now breaking violently presently be flung roughly down on sand minute later be lifted by head foot swung into boat not word be spoken a be shoved off through breaker after ten minute hard rowing felt shock knew that be alongside of lucy be hauled up on deck heard few word of command then felt vessel be on way minute two later covering be unloosed cord be cut smuggler said to ca get away now may a well make handy for present give haul on rope lucy be in fact short handed two of six men who composed crew being absent be lugger of twenty five ton burden built something like ordinary fishing boat longer lower be in fact used for fishing when crew be not engaged upon other adventure be remarkably fast craft have more than once showed heel with success when chased by revenue cutter owed immunity from capture however chiefly to appearance a from size build generally passed unsuspected a innocent fisherman storm increased in violence little lugger although good sea boat have difficulty in making way almost in teeth of gale be bound harry gained from word two dropped by captain for mouth of loire off be to be met by chasse maree long before morning coast of england be out of sight lugger be struggling down channel bravely holding way in sou'westerly gale will be zere true to time frenchman asked smuggler aye will do black jack said if wind hold a at present two o'clock in morning be time named if people be a punctual a will be five hundred pound will be gained there be one thing in such gale a be blowing to day none of cruiser who may be off coast be likely to trouble about boat like ours may wonder what be doing at sea be scarcely likely to chase once twice in course of day large vessel be seen in distance harry knew by cut of sail to be english cruiser be however lying to under smallest canvas harry knew that assistance from be out of question towards evening gale moderated sea be still very high during day harry have turned over in mind possible plan by might destroy tin case contained a knew such important document from what have gathered learned that success of great undertaking upon british fleet be about to embark must be marred if paper be to find way into hand of french authority own life regarded a absolutely forfeited for be sure that sooner be fairly on board french chasse maree than must at order of french spy be thrown overboard that life have be so preserved not from feeling of mercy in order that death might be accomplished with le risk to whose safety demanded be determined if opportunity presented to seize little case to leap overboard with french spy never for one moment put down be small tin case with handle at top eight inch long by three inch wide same deep sometimes frenchman put in pocket beyond projected even then took precaution always to keep hand upon during day harry be constantly employed in work on board lugger hauling at rope acting a if be one of regular crew have shared in meal with men beyond curse now then not word have be addressed to by on board night came on wind be still going down sea be very heavy from occasional rift in cloud star must be seen shining brightly once twice moon broke through spread light over angry sea a time went on smuggler became anxious kept keen lookout ahead be past two exclaimed presently to frenchman be nearly off mouth of river when moon shone out just now thought caught sight of vessel coming out believe to windward english cruiser be lying however will get ready lantern next time moon came out vessel be clearly seen smuggler raised lantern above bulwark held there for minute then lowered repeated three time moment later similar signal be made on bow of vessel be smuggler exclaimed exultingly five hundred pound be a good a in pocket a spoke bright flash be seen to windward confound smuggler said that cruiser have caught sight of frenchman however will be on board in plenty of time whether get safe to shore not matter not much to will have done part of work mounseer will give order for payment on london be done friend frenchman said have done work well here be order by time french craft be within distance of quarter of mile running down at great pace under reefed sail will be easy matter to get on board smuggler said for sea be running tremendously will have to throw rope will have to catch mounseer jump overboard suppose dispatch box be water tight boy frenchman asked let throw rope smuggler said can haul on board too wo make much matter whether slip noose round body neck last will be easiest plan perhaps for then if happens not to be alive when pull out must be accident even if anyone chooses to peach ca swear that be purposely done harry be standing near heard word be close to helm at time watched with intense anxiety a chasse maree ran rapidly down to be clear that what have to be done must be done quickly for flash came up from cruiser although in din of wind toss of wave must not be seen where shot have fallen brightness of flash showed that have come up since last shot be discharged chasse maree ran down a came captain stood upon bulwark shouted at top of voice keep steady a run past will throw rope throw two black jack shouted there be two to come on board course taken by chasse maree must bring along at distance of ten yard from side of lugger at moment squall came lugger head turned little towards approaching craft when be just upon harry saw that one chance of escape have come with sudden rush knocked man at helm from footing put tiller up hard lugger paid off instantly black jack with oath turned round sprang at lad leaped beneath uplifted hand sprang at frenchman who be standing with back to snatching tin box from hand leaped overboard momentary a have be hold upon tiller have be sufficient vessel have paid off from wind before helmsman must regain foot black jack must seize tiller lay across course of chasse maree in moment french craft plunged down upon with crash lucy sank under bow went down with on board a harry sank beneath wave heard shout of dismay from on board lucy when came up minute later saw chasse maree plowing way from sign of lucy be to be seen harry be good swimmer fortunately dispatch box grasped be water tight buttoning within jacket felt that kept head easily above water swam a well a must away from spot where lucy have disappeared for knew that if black jack frenchman have escaped being run down must see death be certain not indeed that chance be in case good with natural hopefulness of boyhood clung to life resolved to make fight for a long a possible have not be for dispatch box must have speedily succumbed for in so heavy sea be difficult in extreme to swim however after short time turned back to wind suffered quietly to drift hour passed after hour at last to intense delight morning began to break saw on right low shore of french coast looking round beheld british cruiser have fired at chasse maree be running quietly along coast be evidently on guard at mouth of river sea have now gone down much sun rose bright in almost cloudless sky invigorated by sight of vessel harry at once swam towards be farther out by mile than spot where be swimming be two mile astern of be sailing slowly hoped that by time came along must be able to get within distance whence might be seen fear be that might run back before reached spot where must be nearer to with strength swam steadily out keeping eye fixed steadily on ship still came onward be within mile when be abreast of then raising a high a must from water shouted at top of voice again again splashed with hand to make a much spray commotion a possible in order to attract attention heart almost stood still with joy a heard answering hail moment later saw vessel come round into wind lay there with sail back then boat be lowered five minute later be hauled in sens almost leaving now that time for exertion have passed be not until have be lifted onto deck of viper brandy have be poured down throat that be able to speak a soon a be sufficiently recovered be sent for to captain cabin who be boy whence do come captain asked do belong to chasse maree chased in night officer spoke in french supposing harry have fallen overboard from craft be english sir harry said escaped from lugger be run down by french craft just a be firing at thought exclaimed captain that

honor suppose one of midshipman said that content of dispatch be with reference to point to be bound wonder where can be here animated discussion arose a to various point against attack of fleet now rapidly assembling at spithead might be directed so far whisper of probable course have be made public be believed indeed that even captain of fleet be ignorant of object upon following day harry at once obtained leave to go on shore for twenty four hour immediately reached head chartered wherry be on point of sailing when heard well known voice among group of sailor standing near ca make head tail of peter langley said boy left merely to go down to village be to have returned first thing in morning to join ship in london well never came back no more what did with unless sailed in smuggling lugger put out hour two afterwards ca make out boy must never have shipped in craft willingly can see reason why must have gone otherwise did cross ferry ca help suspecting there be foul play when black jack return will have out of if kill for have strong party there want dozen good tight hand to come with to hayling will probably be back in couple of day if tackle directly land may find out something about who will go with dozen voice exclaimed that be willing to assist old mate when suddenly harry stepped in among saying there be occasion for can tell about peter langley stepped backwards in astonishment stared open mouthed at harry dash button exclaimed why if be harry in midshipman rig what mean boy mean father be midshipman on board majesty ship caesar peter stood for moment a one stupefied with astonishment then threw tarpaulin high in air with shout of delight fell into water tide carried away peter gave further thought seizing harry hand wrung with enthusiastic delight be news indeed boy said to think of seeing on quarter deck so soon be minute before harry must shake free from friend of whom be old chum of boatswain have known in childhood drawing peter aside at last took to quiet hotel there to intense astonishment of veteran related to circumstance have led to elevation old sailor be alternately filled with wrath admiration be only consideration that beyond doubt black jack frenchman have perished in lucy restrained from instantly rushing off to take vengeance upon hour later pair took wherry sailed to hayling where joy of peter be rivaled by of harry foster mother that evening peter went out so copiously ordered grog for seafaring population in honor of event that village be scene of rejoicing festivity such a be unknown in quiet annals next day harry rejoined ship commenced regular duty a midshipman on board week later whole of ship destined to take part in have arrived blue peter be hoisted at ship head on gun firing from admiral ship anchor be weighed fleet soon left spithead behind consisted of eighteen sail of line with number of frigate gunboat expedition be commanded by sir hyde parker with admiral nelson second in

interview with captain four day after have joined latter told that dispatch box have taken have be sent up to london that content proved to be of highest importance that lord of admiralty have written to admiral expressing extreme satisfaction at capture saying that whole of plan must have be disconcerted have paper fallen into hand of enemy be pleased to express strong approval of conduct of harry langley gave assurance that when time came claim for promotion must not be ignored so lad captain said may be sure that when have passed cadetship will get epaulette without loss of time if be steady well conducted may look out for brilliant position be not many lad who enter navy under such favorable condition must advise to study hard in order to fit for command when time must come from what tell education have not be neglected have doubt know a much a majority of midshipman a to book book be not officer in majesty service must be gentleman that be that in manner be happy to see be desirable also that officer must be able in society to hold own in point of general knowledge with other gentleman midshipman a class be too much given to shirking study to think that if officer can handle fight ship be be required may be be absolutely necessary will find that men who have most made mark be something more than rough sailor need say nothing to a to necessity of at time hazard doing duty be lesson that have clearly already learned a fleet still kept east expectation rose higher higher a to object of expedition supposed that dash be to be made on holland others conceived that object of expedition must be one of north german russian fort latter be confirmed in idea when one fine morning fleet be found to be entering sound instead of passing through however fleet anchored here out of gunshot of fort of copenhagen great be astonishment of officer men alike of fleet when became known that ultimatum have be sent on shore that dane who have be regarded a neutral power be called upon at once to surrender fleet to english upon face of fact known to world at large be indeed most monstrous breach of justice right dane have taken part in great struggle have be going on sympathy be generally supposed to be with english rather than french thus for fleet to appear before capital of denmark to summon king to surrender fleet appeared high handed act of brute force in fact however english government have learned that negotiation have be proceeding between danish government french that great scheme have be agreed upon by dane must join french at given moment united fleet being augmented by ship of other power sudden attack must be made upon england have secret confederation not be interfered with position of england must have be seriously threatened fleet ally must have be able to put onto scene must have greatly exceeded that england must have mustered to defend coast although peace nominally prevailed between england denmark english ministry considered justified posterity have agreed in verdict in taking time by forelock striking blow before seeming ally have time to throw off mask to join in projected attack upon be news of secret resolve on part of cabinet having in way be obtained by heavy bribe from subordinate in admiralty be being carried over in cipher to france in lucy have reached destination dane must have be warned in time enterprise undertaken by parker nelson must have be impossible for fort of copenhagen aided by fleet in harbor be too strong to have be attacked have be thoroughly prepared for strife a matter be unknown to officer of fleet great be astonishment when captain of ship assembled in admiral cabin received order a to position vessel be to take up part be to bear in contest being settled captain returned to respective ship several day be spent in negotiation a dane finally refused compliance with english demand long looked for signal be hoisted fleet stood in through sound be fine sight a leading squadron consisting of twelve line of battle ship number of frigate under admiral nelson steered on through sound followed at short distance by sir hyde parker with rest of fleet danish fort on sound cannonaded fire be very ineffectual fleet without replying steered on until have attained position intended for dane be prepared for action fleet of thirteen men of war number of frigate supported by floating battery mounting seventy heavy gun be moored in line four mile long in front of town be further supported by fort on shore great force be to be engaged by squadron of admiral nelson alone a of sir hyde parker remained outside menacing formidable crown battery preventing from adding fire to of fleet other shore battery upon nelson squadron caesar leading ship of fleet have be directed to sail right past line of ship to operate against detached fort standing on spit of land on right flank of danish position fort mounted many gun much superior to of caesar in weight crew be in high spirit at prospect of fight little a understood cause for be engaged stripping to waist clustered round gun officer at post harry with two other midshipman being upon quarter deck near captain to carry order from a might be required to different part of ship a caesar passed along line of ship to take up position be saluted by storm of fire from danish vessel to made reply suffered however little injury although shot shell whistled between mast struck water on side of several striking hull with dull crashing sound while sail be pierced with hole harry felt that be rather pale be disgusted with at feeling of discomfort experienced there be nothing try nerve more than standing fire of enemy before be time to set to work to reply a soon a order be given for caesar fire to be opened directly gun must be brought to bear roar of cannon answered of fort feeling of uneasiness on harry part disappeared be succeeded by of excitement of battle din be prodigious along whole line british fleet be engaged boom of heavy gun of ship fort battery rattle of musketry from top of ship kept up deep roar like of incessant thunder water be very willow sir first lieutenant reported to captain there be two fathom under foot wind too be dropping so much that have scarcely steerage way current be sweeping along fast prepare to anchor mr francis captain said have scarcely spoken however when there be slight shivering sensation in ship be known by on board that be aground that on falling tide while starboard gun be kept at work men be called off from of port side boat be lowered hawser be got out effort be made to tow ship off shoal sailor pulled hard in spite of storm of shot shell fell round from fort nearest danish ship caesar be fast calling men on board again captain requested first lieutenant to go aloft see what be going on in other part of line returned with news that four five other ship be plainly aground that thing appeared to be going badly in meantime caesar be suffering heavily fire of fort be well directed gunner working piece under comparative shelter be able to pour fire steadily into caesar while floating battery two frigate also kept up incessant fire number of killed wounded be already large a only gun of starboard side must be worked fire be kept up with unabated zeal fort bore many sign of accuracy of fire parapet be in many place shot away several of gun put out of action caesar be clearly overmatched captain hastily wrote note to admiral stating that ship be aground be altogether overmatched begging that vessel might be dispatched to aid if one must be spared in order to partially relieve her of enemy fire here mr langley take gig row off to flagship instantly harry obeyed order through storm of shot shell be flying striking up water in direction made way to admiral ship be lying nearly mile away admiral nelson opened note read through tell captain ball said have ship to spare several be aground hard pressed must do best can ah be lad whom saw in sir hyde parker cabin be not yes sir admiral nodded in token of approval harry prepared to leave suddenly thought struck running into captain cabin asked steward for small tablecloth what on earth d'you want for exclaimed never mind give at once seizing tablecloth ran down into boat a returned towards caesar must see how hardly matter be going with one of mast be down side be battered torn several of port hole be knocked into one still fire continued unabated be clear that must not much longer resist do think must haul down flag harry said to coxswain of boat aye aye sir coxswain said wood iron ca stand such pounding a much longer most captain must have hauled down flag long before even skipper ca stand out much longer there wo be man alive to fight will do a order harry said aye sir coxswain said in surprise will do what like for story of conduct by harry have gained midshipman promotion have be repeated through ship men be proud of lad who have behaved so pluckily at least harry said may do good ca do harm where be boat hook fasten tablecloth to pull for fort coxswain gave exclamation of surprise did a harry told with white flag flying boat pulled straight towards fort a be seen to do so fire of latter have be directed towards boat ceased although duel between battery caesar continued with unabated vigor harry steered direct to step on sea face mounted to interior of fort where on saying that brought message from captain be at once conducted to commandant be come sir harry said from captain to beg of to surrender at once gun have be nobly fought two more ship be coming down to engage with captain must fain save further effusion of life have done brave men must do fight everywhere go against further resistance be vain in quarter of hour fire will be centered upon gun will mean annihilation captain therefore begs to spare brave men under order from further sacrifice taken by surprise by sudden demand be fortunately at moment backed up by two ship of squadron have hitherto taken part in action being seen sailing in governor after hasty consultation with officer resolved to surrender two minute afterwards danish flag be hauled down in fort white flag run up one of danish officer be directed to return with harry to ship to notify captain of surrender of fort astonishment of captain ball at seeing course of boat suddenly altered white flag hoisted gig proceeding direct to fort have be extreme must only suppose that harry have received order direct from admiral that general cessation of hostility be ordered surprise became astonishment when saw danish flag disappear white flag hoisted in place shout of relief exultation echoed from stem to stern of caesar for have felt that conflict be hopeless in few minute caesar must strike flag sort of conjecture be rife a to sudden unexpected surrender of fort expectation be at highest when gig be seen rowing out again with danish officer by side of midshipman on reaching ship side harry ascended ladder with danish officer advancing to captain ball said officer sir have in compliance with summons took to commander of fort in name come off to surrender danish officer advanced handed sword to captain saying in name of commander of fort surrender captain handed back sword ordering harry to follow at once entered cabin astonishment be unbounded when latter informed what have done with many apology for having taken matter into own hand saw said that caesar be being knocked to piece coxswain told that be impossible must much longer resist therefore thought must do harm by calling upon governor to surrender that be possible that might succeed a see have certainly have saved caesar captain ball said warmly be indeed indebted to be piece of astounding impudence indeed for midshipman to convey message with captain have not charged success in present case thousand time condones offense have indeed done well young sir ship company be vastly indebted to will report matter to admiral hundred men speedily took place in boat lieutenant francis be sent ashore to take possession few minute later british flag be flying upon fort ordering harry to accompany captain ball at once took place in gig rowed to flagship battle be still raging to practiced eye there be doubt that english fleet be suffering very severely captain ball mounted quarter deck saluting admiral reported that fort with be engaged have struck that caesar being aground be unable to render assistance to general attack good many of be aground ball admiral nelson said congratulate on having caused fort to haul down color several of danish men of war have struck can not take possession fresh boat load of men came off from shore fire have reopened position be unpleasant one sir hyde parker have signaled to to draw off so far have paid attention fear that will have to haul off leave four five ship to enemy fact be captain ball said be who made fort haul down flag midshipman of mine have said admiral glancing at harry who at captain ball order have left boat be standing short distance off how on earth did do that when told sir that must give aid took upon instead of returning to ship to row straight to fort with one of tablecloth fastened to boat hook summoned commander in name to surrender at once so a to save further effusion of life seeing that more ship be bearing down that have done that brave man must must now think of life of troop impudent little rascal admiral exclaimed midshipman be impudent enough in day boy beat everything however idea be excellent one by jupiter will adopt man must never be above learning be in such sore strait one catch at straw so saying admiral calling to own captain entered cabin at once indited letter to king of denmark begging to surrender in order to save blood of subject expressing admiration at way in have fought saying that have done be possible to save honor might now surrender with full consciousness of having done duty missive be at once dispatched to shore admiral awaited with anxiety result half hour elapsed firing continuing with unabated fury by jove ball admiral suddenly exclaimed there be white flag tremendous cheer broke along whole of british ship a flag of truce waved over principal fort of copenhagen instantly fire on side ceased boat passed between shore flagship with proposal for surrender condition nelson insisted that danish fleet must be surrendered in so firm decisive tone a to convince king that have in power completely to destroy town have only so far desisted from motif of humanity at length to intense relief of admiral principal officer who knew how sore strait be to delight of sailor negotiation be completed victory of copenhagen won where be that boy admiral asked that boy be unfortunately no longer on quarter deck one of last shot fired from danish fleet have struck above knee carrying away leg have at once be carried down to cockpit be attended to by surgeon of flagship in excitement of action men take little heed of what be happening around fall of young midshipman be unnoticed by captain now however that battle be over

have be on other occasion however think that lad will not slip wind time be fretting that career on blue water be at end be sad that must be so captain ball said there be many men who may live to good age will have done le for country than lad in short time be at sea first prevented dispatch must have warned enemy of what be coming from reaching in second place sharpness readiness saved small portion of admiral nelson fleet converted what threatened to be defeat into victory must be proud of son old salt have not boy told sir that be not son boatswain said indeed captain ball exclaimed surprised on contrary spoke of a father in few word peter langley related circumstance of finding of harry when baby captain ball be silent for while then said do know peter have be greatly struck by

aground altogether overmatched admiral nelson have also be good enough to say that be success attended action suggested to course that took brought battle to happy termination thus can not feel that victory have be won be in small degree due to moreover be mindful that be bravery quickness prevented news of intended sailing of fleet from reaching continent in case attack must not have be carried out under such extraordinary exceptional circumstance feel that extraordinary exceptional acknowledgment be due to feel very deep regret that loss of leg will render unfit for active service at sea
