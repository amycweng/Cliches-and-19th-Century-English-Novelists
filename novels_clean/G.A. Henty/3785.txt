in reign of terror adventure of westminster boy by g henty preface dear lad time only few word be needed for story speaks for object have be rather to tell tale of interest than to impart historical knowledge for fact of dreadful time when terror reigned supreme in france be well known to educated lad need only say that such historical allusion a be necessary for sequence of story will be found correct except that noyades at nantes did not take place until somewhat later period than be here assigned to yours sincerely ga henty content journey to france ii mad dog iii demon wolf iv cloud gather v outburst vi anxious time vii d of september viii marie arrested ix robespierre x free xi marie victor xii nantes xiii in hand of red xiv noyades xv england chapter journey to france know what to say dear why surely james be not thinking for moment of letting go well know yes be certainly thinking of have at made up mind there be advantage disadvantage oh be such long way to live among french people who have be doing such dreadful thing attacking bastille a have heard say passing sort of revolutionary law holding king queen almost a prisoner in paris well wo eat dear french assembly national assembly whatever ought to be called have certainly be passing law limiting power of king abolishing many of right privilege of nobility clergy must remember that condition of vast body of french nation have be terrible have long conquered liberty indeed never even in height of feudal system be mass of english people more enslaved a have be peasant of france must not be surprised therefore if in newly recovered freedom push matter to excess at first will right doubt constitutional form of government somewhat similar to own will be established be reason against harry going out there suppose that french people be going to fly at throat of nobility why even in heat of civil war here there be instance of personal wrong being done to family of engaged in struggle in only two three case after repeated rising be even of leader executed harry will be just a safe there a must be here a to distance be nothing like so far a if went to india for example see great chance of setting thames on fire at home school report be always same 'conduct fair progress in study moderate ' mean a take that just scrape along be be harry yes father think so see one can not be at top of form be very true observation boy be clear that if there be twenty boy in class nineteen father have to be disappointed still of course one must like to be father who be not disappointed stick to work boy said there be always fellow who seem to know just right word without taking trouble about come to suppose what do say to idea harry know sir boy said doubtfully know father agreed at anyrate will sleep upon be clear that offer be not to be lightly rejected dr sandwith be doctor in chelsea chelsea in year be very different place to chelsea of present day be pretty suburban hamlet be indeed very fashionable quarter here many of nobility personage connected with court have house broad country field lane separated from stir din of london dr sandwith have good practice have also large family harry be at westminster going backwards forward across field to school so far have evinced predilection for special career be sturdy well built lad of sixteen year old be a father said not likely to set thames on fire in way be a undistinguished in various sport popular among boy in day a be in lesson be a good a average better have fought tough fight with boy of own age have shown endurance rather than brilliancy in ordinary course of thing must probably in three four year time have chosen profession indeed father have already settled in mind that a harry be not likely to make great figure in life in way of intellectual capacity best thing must be to obtain for commission in majesty service a to with doctor connection among people of influence there must not be difficulty have however said nothing a yet to boy on subject fact that harry have three younger brother four sister dr sandwith who be obliged to keep up good position sometimes found difficult to meet various expense made perhaps more inclined to view favourably offer have that morning received than must otherwise have be case two year before have attended professionally young french nobleman attached to embassy be from that letter have be subject of conversation have be received ran a follows dear doctor sandwith since return from paris have frequently spoken to brother marquis of st caux respecting difference of education between english boy own nothing struck more when be in london than great school with child of good family be almost always brought up at home learn to dance to fence have other exercise for limb lack air of manly independence struck in english boy be more gentil know word in language express carry better be not so rough be more polite there be advantage in system for like yours much best brother be to extent convert to view there be such school to must send son in france for what large school have be under management of father boy have none of freedom be distinguishing point of english system of education even if there be such school be sure that madame sister in law must never hear of son being sent there since be so marquis have concluded that best thing must be to have english boy of good family a companion must of course study with under master must play ride with must be treated a one of must learn something of english from must be useful if adopt diplomatic profession must learn french might also be useful to of course great point brother desire be that son must acquire something of manly independence of thought action distinguishes english boy having arranged much thought of know that have several son if have one of from fourteen to sixteen year must like to take position for two three year must be glad indeed to secure companion for nephew if not must do favour of looking round among acquaintance find lad such a need must be gentleman fair type of boy be speaking of may say that brother authorizes to offer in name in addition to expense two thousand franc year to young gentleman who will thus benefit son think that political excitement be agitating paris need be taken into consideration now that great concession have be made to representative of nation be not at probable that there will be recurrence of such popular tumult a brought about capture of bastille in case need not weigh in decision a brother resides for greater part of year in chateau near dijon in burgundy far removed from trouble in capital more dr sandwith thought over matter more liked there be comparatively few englishman in day who spoke french language be indeed considered part of education of young man of good family to make what be called grand tour of europe under charge of tutor after leaving university formed very small proportion of society indeed frequent war have since stuart lost throne of england occurred between two country have greatly interfered with continental travel even now subject of france england be engaged in desperate struggle in india although there be peace between court of versailles st james knowledge of french language then must be likely to be of great utility to harry if entered army expense at westminster must be saved two hundred forty pound must acquire during three year stay in france must be very useful to on first start in life after breakfast next morning dr sandwith asked harry to take turn in garden with for holiday have just begun what do think of harry have not thought much about one way other sir harry said looking up with smile seemed to better that must do thinking for of might perhaps be better able to judge whether must be advantageous otherwise for to accept offer must be best judge a to whether must like to accept not ca quite make up mind a to sir like school very much like being at home want to learn frenchified way to eat frog snail sort of nastiness still must be fun going to place so different to england hearing english spoken learning rum way getting to jabber french might be very useful to in army harry then doctor stopped suddenly army harry exclaimed in tone of astonished delight oh sir do really think of going into army never said word about before must like immensely that slipped out harry for did not mean to say anything about until have left school still if go to france know why must not keep that before think army be very good profession seem to have marked talent for anything else like idea of medicine church be almost heart broken when wanted to accept offer of uncle john of seat in counting house seems to that army must suit better than anything else have doubt must get commission now whenever fight france be sure to be on other side think that must be of great advantage to to have thorough knowledge of french thing very few officer in army posse if accept offer will have opportunity of attaining at same time of earning nice little sum must pay for outfit supply with pocket money for time yes sir must be first rate harry exclaimed excitedly oh please accept offer must like of thing even if do get ever so skinny on frog thin soup can get fat on roast beef again when get back be nonsense harry about frog starving french style of cookery differs from ours eat just a much although may not a rule be a broad heavy a englishman be simply characteristic of race latin people be of slighter build than teutonic a to food know that roman who be certainly judge of good living considered snail great luxury dare say ate frog too gentleman who have made grand tour told that have tasted in paris found very delicate eating may not like living quite at first will soon get over once accustomed to will like quite a well a solid joint principal objection to going lie quite in direction public opinion in france be much disturbed in national assembly be same a parliament there be great spirit of resistance to royal authority something like revolution have already be accomplished king be little more than prisoner must surely make difference to sir see that must harry still must cause mother good deal of anxiety see must make difference harry repeated see sir when go into army there be war mother must be great deal more anxious mean harry doctor said with smile that whether anxiety begin little sooner later doe not make much difference think quite meant that sir harry said added frankly after moment thought suppose did really see that supposing there be trouble in france must possibly make difference to even if there be civil war such a have in england must not interfere with boy see that must make difference chance be so remote that need not influence decision of course if war broke out between two country marquis must see that be sent back safely well then harry be to consider decision be in favour of accepting appointment if please sir be sure will be capital thing for have doubt will be great fun of course at first will be strange to hear jabbering in french suppose will soon pick up so mr sandwith be informed by husband that after talking over with harry have concluded that proposed arrangement must really be excellent one that must be great pity to let opportunity slip good lady be for time tearful in foreboding that harry must be starved for in day be matter of national opinion that neighbour across channel fed on most meagre of diet be not in habit of disputing husband will when letter of acceptance have be sent off busied in preparing harry clothes for long absence ought to be measured for several suit dear said to husband made bigger bigger to allow for growing nonsense dear suppose that clothes can not be purchased in france give plenty of under linen fewer jacket trouser take over better will be much better for to get clothes out there of same fashion a other people boy will not want to be stared at wherever go best rule be always to dress like people around will give money directly get there can get suit two made by tailor who make for lad be going to be with english be more loved in france than french be here though harry have reason to be ashamed of nationality there be occasion for to draw attention of everyone meet to by going about in dress must seem to peculiar in due time letter be received from count auguste de st caux stating that marquis have requested to write say that be much gratified to hear that one of doctor own son be coming over to be companion friend to boy that be sending off in course of two day gentleman of household to calais to meet conduct to paris on young mr sandwith arrival at calais be to go at once to hotel lion door ask for m du tillet during intervening time harry have be very busy have to say good bye to friend who looked with envy with pity upon for idea of three year residence in france be novel one to be petted made much of at home especially by sister who regarded in light of hero about to undertake strange hazardous adventure three day after arrival of letter of marquis dr sandwith harry started by stage for dover doctor put son on board packet sailing for calais evening before gave much good advice a to behaviour will see much be new perhaps good deal that like be better for never to criticize give hostile opinion about thing must not like if french boy came over here made unpleasant remark about english way manner take thing a come do a others do avoid comparison between french english custom fall in with way of around adopt a far a can polite courteous manner be general among french in must say be far ahead of if questioned will of course give opinion frankly modestly be independence of thought among english boy have attracted attention approval of auguste de st caux be natural simple giving air permitting none on part of lad be with father say be to be treated a equal upon other hand be ever on lookout for small slight bear with perfect good temper little ridicule to foreign way manner may excite need not tell to be always straightforward honest true for of quality think posse fair share above thing restrain tendency to use fist fighting come naturally to english boy in france be considered a brutal degrading blow be deadly insult must never be forgiven so whatever provocation abstain from striking anyone must find that in way position be made intolerable will of course appeal to marquis unless obtain redress will come home will find difficulty in travelling when once understand language avoid anything like petty complaint trust there will be reason for complaint at that will find position exceedingly pleasant one a soon a become accustomed to must occasion arise bear word in mind harry promised to follow father advice implicitly in own mind wondered what fellow did when quarrelled if be not allowed to fight however supposed that must under circumstance do same a french boy might be a soon a packet be once fairly beyond harbour harry thought be effectually diverted from other matter by motion of sailing boat be soon in state of prostration in remained until seven hour later packet entered calais harbour dr sandwith have requested captain to allow one of men to show way to lion door harry have pulled together little a vessel entered still water in harbour be staring at men in blue blouse wooden shoe at woman in quaint picturesque attire when sailor touched on shoulder now young sir captain

foot eight hair brown eye gray nose short mouth large be about to reside in france in family of marquis de st caux officer glanced over then returned to harry with polite bow harry in confusion endeavoured to imitate what doe fellow want to bow scrape like for muttered to a followed guide englishman must just have nodded said 'all right ' what can fellow want more must like to know well

pocketed coin harry gave with good luck young master went out taking with a harry felt last link to england turned followed landlord latter mounted flight of stair knocked at door opened young gentleman desire to see m du tillet said harry entered tall big man whose proportion at once disappointed harry preconceived notion a to smallness leanness of frenchman rose from table at be writing monsieur sandwith said interrogatively be glad to see harry did not understand latter portion of remark caught sound of name be right said nodding how do do m du tillet french gentleman bowed harry bowed then looked at other there be nothing more to say smile stole over harry face broke into frank laugh frenchman smiled put hand on harry shoulder said brave garcon harry felt be friend m du tillet face bore expression of easy good temper wore wig with long curl have soldier bearing scar on left cheek complexion be dark red eyebrow black bushy after pause said be hungry then put imaginary food to mouth mean will eat anything harry translated yes will if there be anything fit to eat begin to feel a hungry a hunter wonder for be a hollow a drum nod be sufficient answer m du tillet took

where companion gave order in two three minute bowl of broth be placed before of fully answered harry idea a to thinness of french soup for looked like dirty water with few piece of bread scrap of vegetable floating in be astonished at piece of bread nearly yard long placed on table m du tillet cut piece off handed to broke portion of into broth found when tasted that be much nicer than looked be not so bad after thought to anyhow bread seems plentiful so there be fear of starving followed companion example made way steadily through number of dish new strange to neither sight taste gave slightest indication a to what meat be eating suppose be all right concluded what people can want to make such mess of food for ca make out slice of good roast beef be worth lot of really be nasty of dish be not bad at if one only knew what be made of m du tillet offered wine tasted shook head for seemed rough sour poured out water presently happy idea seized touched bread said interrogatively

little to admire during journey if be like thought to see that have reason for calling la belle france of paris saw little blue bloused porter carried trunk what seemed to harry long distance from place where conveyance stopped street here be quiet almost deserted after busy thoroughfare of central city house stood for most part back from street with high wall heavy gate here be at last guide said a halted before large massive gateway surmounted by coat of arm with supporter carved in stone work rang at bell be opened by porter in livery who bowed profoundly upon seeing m du tillet passing through doorway harry found in spacious hall decorated with armour arm a crossed threshold m du tillet took hand shook heartily saying welcome harry understood action though not word nodded saying

once that family be away be relief to be getting on capitally with m du tillet shrank from prospect of meeting so many strange face meal be speedily served in small comfortably furnished apartment

improvement upon vintage have tasted at calais after breakfast next morning started for walk harry be delighted with louvre tuileries palais royal other public building must not acknowledge be vastly

a if to ask if understood why be taken there harry nodded for indeed be glad to see that time be to be lost for be already conscious that dress differed considerably from of french boy several street gamin have pointed at made jeering remark without understanding word harry felt to be insulting must have heard in purlieu of westminster have considered a challenge to battle have not however suffered altogether unavenged for upon one occasion m du tillet turned sharply round caught one offender so smartly with cane that ran howling away be awful guy harry thought a looked at french boy met be better to be guy than to be chaffed by boy one meet especially if one be not to be allowed to fight be therefore with feeling of satisfaction that turned into tailor shop proprietor came up bowing a harry thought in most cringing sort of way to companion m du tillet gave order tailor unrolled variety of piece of cloth other material for harry inspection lad shook head turned to guide

politician care much for life of paris be well content to live quietly here on estate even can see that storm be gathering a for brother auguste go about shaking head wringing hand anticipation be of darkest what can one expect when fellow like voltaire rousseau be permitted by poisonous preaching to corrupt inflame imagination of people both men head must have be cut off instant began to write scribbler be at root of trouble with pestilent doctrine be too late now mischief be done if have king strong determined might yet be well louis be weak in decision listens one moment to mirabeau next to queen who be more firm courageous so thing drift on from bad to worse assembly backed by turbulent scum of paris be master of situation for time harry lived quiet life at chateau found position very pleasant one order of marquis that must be treated a one of family be obeyed there be distinction made between ernest in morning two boy worked with abbe quiet gentle old man in afternoon rode fenced under instruction of m du tillet one other of gentleman of marquis establishment on holiday shot fished a chose on preserve stream of estate for hour morning two younger girl shared in study learning latin history with brother harry got on very well with ernest there be real cordiality between hauteur insolence with young count treated inferior be constant source of exasperation to harry think little god must often mutter to must give good deal to have for three month at westminster must get conceit nonsense knocked out of at same time be always scrupulously polite courteous to english companion much too polite indeed to please harry have good quality too be generous with money if during ride woman came up with tale of distress be always ready to assist be clever harry to surprise found that knowledge of latin be far beyond own ernest must construct passage with greatest ease altogether puzzled be splendid rider must keep seat with ease grace on most fiery animal in father stable when went out with gun harry felt inferiority keenly not only be ernest excellent shot at end of long day sport must come in apparently fresh untired while harry although bodily far most powerful must be completely done up at gymnastic exercise must do with ease feat harry must at first not even attempt in respect however english lad in three month time be able to rival disgust at finding so easily beaten by french boy nerved to greatest exertion muscle practised in sort of game soon adapted to new exercise harry picked up french very rapidly absolute necessity there be to express in language caused to make progress surprised at end of three month be able to converse with little difficulty having learned entirely by ear spoke with fair accent pronunciation m du tillet who be principal instructor of boy in outdoor exercise took much pain to assist in french helped on in way in power in evening there be dancing lesson although very far from exhibiting stately grace with ernest must perform minuet other courtly dance then in fashion harry came in time to perform part fairly two hour be spent in evening in salon part of day harry at first found most tedious a soon a began to speak fluently marquis addressed most of conversation to asking question about life of english boy at school about english manner custom harry soon found chatting at ease distinction of class be clearly very much le with in england than be here marquis said one day when harry have be describing great fight have taken place between party of westminster boy of neighbourhood seems extraordinary to that son of gentleman must engage in personal fight with boy of lowest class thing must not happen here if be insulted by such boy what must do ernest must run through body ernest said quietly just so father replied say must be wrong according to notion say that english plan be not best english gentleman for monsieur sandwith say that even among grown up people same habit prevail doe not disdain to show canaille even with own rough weapon be superior thus hold respect be coarse way altogether at variance with notion there be much to be said for altogether doe away with reverence that lower class must feel for upper ernest objected be true ernest so long a feeling generally exists so long a there be a be wide chasm between two class a there have always existed in france must be unwise perhaps for one of upper to admit that in respect there must be equality between be not so in england where certain equality have always be allowed to exist englishman of rank have certain feeling of self respect independence result be shown in history of war have be fought between two nation france in early day always relied upon chivalry horde of footman placed in field counted for little england upon other hand relied principally upon archer pikemen must be admitted that beat handsomely then again in war in flanders under english general marlborough infantry always proved superior to ours be galling to admit there be blinking fact of history seems to that feeling of independence self respect english system give rise to even among lowest class must render man for man better soldier than drawn from peasantry whose very life be at mercy of lord think du tillet marquis said later on on same evening when young people have retired have done very well in taking brother auguste advice a to having english companion for ernest if thing be a be under grand monarque say that must have be wise to allow young french nobleman to get english idea into head be different now be on eve of great change what will come of one can say there will certainly be change be good thing that child must get broader idea than in be brought up lad be quiet modest venture to think for scarce entered head of french nobleman generation back that mass of people have feeling wish much le right be useful in way just a animal be needed more consideration have never counted for anything in people have right liberty won year ago must be well for in present day have done so in france fancy next generation will have to adapt to changed circumstance idea ernest jules will learn from english lad will be great advantage to will fit for new state of thing be only during lesson when gouvernante be always present at meal time in salon in evening harry have communication with young lady of family if met in ground be saluted by boy with a much formal courtesy a if have be most distant acquaintance returning bow with deep curtsy meeting be source of great amusement to harry who must scarcely preserve gravity at formal distant greeting on one occasion however even course of meeting be broken boy have just left tennis court where have be playing have laid aside sword carried when walking riding tennis court be at little distance from house be walking across garden when heard scream at short distance be governess with two young charge have thrown arm round stood picture of terror uttering loud scream looking round in astonishment to discover cause of terror harry saw large wolf hound running towards at trot tongue be hanging out there be white foam on jaw have heard m du tillet tell marquis on previous day that dog be great favourite seemed strange unquiet have ordered to be chained up have evidently broken fastening for be dragging piece of chain six foot long behind flashed across at once that animal be mad without instant hesitation dashed off at full speed threw in front of lady before dog reached snatching off coat then kneeling on one knee awaited animal attack without deviating from course hound sprang at with short snarling howl harry threw coat over head then grasped round neck impetus of spring knocked over rolled together on ground animal struggled furiously retained grasp round neck in vain hound tried to free from blinding encumbrance to bite assailant through struggled to shake off hold with leg claw harry maintained grasp tightly round neck with head pressed closely against one of ear several time rolled over over at last harry made great effort when be uppermost managed to get knee upon animal belly then digging toe in ground pressed with weight upon there be sound a of cracking of bone then dog struggle suddenly ceased head fell over harry rose to foot by side of dead hound just a number of men with pitch fork other weapon ran up to spot from stable while marquis sword in hand arrived from house gouvernante too paralysed by fear have stood close by with charge while struggle be going on ernest have come up be standing in front of sister ready to be next victim if dog have overpowered harry le accustomed to running than english boy for moment rooted to ground with horror at sister danger have not arrived at spot until struggle between harry dog be half over have then seen way of rendering assistance believing that dog be sure to be conqueror have placed before sister to bear brunt of next assault seeing at glance that daughter be untouched marquis ran on to harry who be standing panting breathless threw arm round brave boy exclaimed have saved daughter from dreadful death by courage devotion how can mother ever thank saw from terrace speed with sprang to assistance quickness of thought with stripped off coat threw over head after must see nothing except rolling over over in confused mass be not hurt trust not bit sir harry said have killed wonderful there be nothing in sir have heard father who be doctor say that man must kill biggest dog if must get down on back kneel on so when once managed to get knee on felt be all right ah be very well for to speak a if be nothing marquis said there be few men indeed who must throw in way of mad dog especially of such formidable brute a too have behaved with courage son saw be ready to give life for sister have not quickness readiness of friend must have be too late be true father ernest said in tone of humility must have be too late moreover must have be useless for must have torn down in moment then fallen upon sister m sandwith said frankly own have be wrong have thought game of spoke fighting rough barbarous see use now have

made escape unseen through cordon round lair have passed within sight of two boy distance away how have hunted down slain girl shuddered at story of death of wood cutter short desperate conflict with wolf then ernest have principal honour time eldest girl said be pretty evenly divided marquis said see ernest brought wolf to bay by breaking shoulder struck first blow a be flying upon harry who have be thrown from horse then again ernest must almost certainly have be killed have not harry in turn come to assistance dealt mortal blow there be not much difference perhaps chief honour rest with ernest be glad of papa mademoiselle de st caux said be only right chief honour must be with son not with english boy have have more than share already think must not think so if have saved life sister jeanne broke in impetuously be very brave of to kill wolf think be ever ever so much braver to attack great mad dog without weapon think so papa think must speak so warmly to elder sister jeanne marquis said be grown up young lady be in school room still in answer to question admit that first be very much braver deed must have liked nothing better than to stand before great wolf with hunting sword in hand although if have be near when hound attacked must doubtless have thrown before must have be horribly frightened must certainly have be killed for must never have thought of carried so promptly out plan harry adopted of muzzling animal there be need to make comparison on present occasion lad have behaved with great bravery be proud that ernest be one of conqueror of demon wolf will start in life with reputation already established for courage now come with have look at wolf think beast be ever before seen in france be going to have stuffed set up a trophy will stand over fireplace in hall long after have mouldered to dust descendant will point to proudly telling how lad of race with own age slew demon wolf of burgundy ernest be confined to bed for nearly month during time harry often went long ride walk by in evening marquis frequently talked with over situation of country compared event have taken place with struggle of english parliament with king there be one point of difference between two case said one evening in people have already great power in state parliament have always be check upon royal authority be because king tried to overrule parliament that trouble came about here king at least minister appointed have always governed often unwisely admit be likely that mob must govern better be question at present seem bent on showing incapacity to govern even marquis de st caux have in respect thought opinion of old school be royalist pure simple a to politics troubled head little about be matter for minister be business to find remedy for general ill a to national assembly represented only middle class people regarded with contempt why be from middle class said that oppressor of people be drawn be who be farmer general collector official of kind be who ground down nation enriched with spoil be not noble who dirtied hand with money wrung from poor by mean let middle class have share in government be not share desire clergy be to have voice nobility be to have voice king be to be cipher power be to be placed in hand of men chosen of scum of great town mere mouthpiece of ignorant mob be not order that gentry be organizing be disorder such be opinion of marquis be tolerant of other view at gathering at chateau harry heard opinion of kind expressed during ramble alone entered a much a must into conversation with peasant with woodcutter forester villager found that distress prevailed everywhere be terrible people scarcely kept life together many have died of absolute starvation found feeling of despair everywhere dull hatred of who be above in world harry have difficulty in making talk at first must obtain only sullen monosyllable dress appearance showed to belong to hated class set against at once when said that be english in england people be watching with great interest what be passing in france have hesitation in speaking harry motif in endeavouring to find out what be feeling of people at large be not of mere curiosity be now much attached to marquis family report came from part of france a well a from paris together with talk among visitor at chateau convinced that state of affair be more serious than marquis be inclined to admit capture of bastille slaughter of defender massacre of person obnoxious to mob not only in street of paris in of other great town proved that lower class if once obtained upper hand be ready to go length while number of nobility who be flocking across frontier showed that among body there existed grievous apprehension a to future harry have read in book in library of chateau account of frightful excess perpetrated by jacquerie dreadful insurrection have be crushed out by armour clad knight of france who be to undertake task must such flame again burst out noble no longer wore armour have armed retainer must be mere handful among multitude army have already shown sympathy with popular movement must not be relied upon that marquis must face out danger might come seemed to harry right natural thought that be wrong not to send wife daughter at rate jules across rhine until danger be passed marquis have fear one have mentioned jacquerie in one of conversation marquis have put aside a being altogether apart from question jacquerie took place said hundred of year ago people then be serf little more than savage can imagine possible that at day people must be capable of such excess answer of gentleman addressed have weighed little with marquis harry thought over seriously civilization have increased marquis since day of jacquerie condition of people have improved little even now feudal usage be scarce extinct lower class have be regarded a animal rather than men increase of civilization speak of from have received benefit make hate even more bitterly than of old in position above be reformer desire to see sweeping change want good wise honest government desire thing because fear that if come peacefully will come in tempest of lawlessness vengeance well be getting want marquis said peevishly be passing law however absurd that come into hand one be opposing have got rein in own hand what on earth can want more there might have be excuse for rebellion riot two year since there can be none now what say abbe abbe seldom took part in conversation on politics being now appealed to said mildly must allow for human nature monsieur slave who find free with arm in hand be not likely to settle down at once into peaceful citizen men head be turned with change last two year have brought about be drunk with own success who can say where will stop so far find benefit from change bread be a dear a ever men pocket be a empty thought to gain everything find have got nothing so will cry for more more change fury will run higher higher with disappointment who can say to what length will go have already confiscated property of church next will come that of laity have idea be prophet of evil abbe marquis said with uneasy laugh while feeling of gloom anxiety fell over others who heard abbe word god forbid must be prophet old man said gravely hope trust be mistaken that have not reserved terrible punishment for france asked for opinion marquis have given to despite foreboding winter of passed without disturbance at chateau in spring came news of disorder pillage act of ruffianism in various part chateau convent be burned destroyed people refused to pay tax rent to landlord in south popular excitement be greater than in other part in burgundy there be for most part tranquility marquis who have always be regarded a indulgent seigneur by people of estate still maintained that trouble only occurred where proprietor have abused privilege ground down people chapter iv cloud gather occasionally at considerable interval harry received letter from father latter said that there be great excitement in england over event have taken place in france that mother be rendered extremely anxious by news of attack upon chateau state of tumult lawlessness prevailed thought have better resign situation return home harry in reply made light of danger said that after having be treated so kindly must be most ungrateful of to break engagement have made for three year leave friend at present moment indeed like around be filled with excitement of time in spite of almost universal confusion disorder life went on quietly calmly at chateau establishment be greatly reduced for few of tenant paid rent absence of ceremonial brought family closer together marquis wife agreed that have never spent happier time than spring summer of news of failure of king attempt at flight on th of june be great shock to marquis king must never fly said above must never make abortive attempt at flight be lamentable that must be so ill advised at end of september election to legislative assembly a be now to be called resulted in return of men even more extreme violent than whom succeeded must go to paris marquis said one day towards end of october place for french nobleman now be beside king that of wife beside queen marquise said quietly can not say no marquis replied wish must have stayed with child need fear trouble here ernest be nearly seventeen may well begin in absence to represent think can leave chateau without anxiety even be not so must still be duty to go there be thing want to speak to about before start marquise said jeanne be no longer child although still regard a one be fifteen be graver more earnest than most girl of age seems ridiculous to think of thing be clear that have made english lad hero do not think better that must go must be unfortunate in extreme that must get to have serious feeling for have noticed too julie marquis said have smiled to myself to see how girl listens gravely to all say be not disposed to send away in first place have done great deal of good to boy more even than have hoped for ernest now think speaks for idea be broader view wider be fitted before for regime have passed be rapidly becoming fit to take part in be to come in next place dear must remember time have changed mademoiselle jeanne de st caux daughter of peer noble of france be infinitely removed from son of english doctor seem to be approaching end of thing although so far law for abolition of title have be disregarded here must prepare to find that in paris will be no longer addressed by title will be monsieur de st caux may be will object to de st will find plain monsieur caux oh edouard marquise exclaimed aghast be quite in earnest dear can assure will say be still heiress of portion of estate who can say how long estate will remain after title be gone just a gentleman of pave object to title because have none so being penniless will object to property for aught know may decree general division of land good impossible edouard not at impossible julie beggar be on horseback intend to ride last week called in from banker cash at disposal about five thousand louis to morrow du tillet be going to start for holland will hand over to banker there to forward to dr sandwith to whom have written asking to undertake charge if will take advice will forward at same time jewelry if thing go wrong will keep in old age furnish dot for daughter jewel of st caux have always be considered a equal to of family in france be certainly worth million franc even to sell keep few small trinket send others away have wandered from subject under circumstance think a well that must not interfere in matter speak of personally one must not wish for better husband for one of daughter than young englishman must make father be gentleman so be in such time a be coming must be glad to know one of girl have protector a must make be a said at first almost ridiculous be two year older than be in respect be elder regard a pretty child thought be given to study sport have something of english barbarian left in be absolutely indifferent to jeanne preference french lad at age must be flattered english boy doe not notice if notice regard a exhibition of gratitude must well dispense with for having saved life can leave with tranquil heart dear will answer for never in inmost heart have idea of ever making love to jeanne occurred to english lad lastly must be sorry for to leave because good spirit cheerfulness be invaluable at present ernest be apt to be gloomy depressed cheerfulness be at premium in france at present moreover must there be difficulty danger while be absent trust very much to lad good sense courage incident of dog showed how quick be to plan how prompt to carry plan into effect may seem absurd when there be several of staunch tried friend here to rely in way on lad do so not of course a before faithful friend a one whose aid be not to be despised thus happened that on same day that marquis started for paris m du tillet set out from chateau taking with trunk package appeared of little value be not likely to attract attention contained considerable sum of money famous st caux jewel life at chateau be dull after departure of head have few visitor now most frequent among being victor de gisons estate of duke father adjoined of marquis between marie marriage have long before be arranged by parent for once inclination of young people agreed with wish of elder be warmly attached to other formal betrothal however have a yet taken place trouble of time having caused postponement although formerly have be understood that in present autumn marriage must be celebrated young count have at assembly of state general be prominent liberal have be one of who have taken seat with third estate have voted for abolition of special privilege of nobility violence of assembly have alarmed disgusted in winter have left paris returned to father estate ernest harry studied with abbe fenced rode a usual with m du tillet after return from holland ever darkening cloud weighed upon spirit yet life at chateau be pleasant absence of parent general feeling of anxiety knit rest of family closer together much of ceremonial observance have on first arrival surprised amused harry be now laid aside marie happy in visit of lover at prospect of approaching marriage did best to make house cheerful harry who have not much liked at first now found most pleasant agreeable younger girl walked in ground with brother chatted when be gathered in evening just a harry sister have done at home jeanne be if group broke up generally harry companion ever since affair of mad dog have treated a special friend adopting opinion falling in with suggestion might make with readiness caused ernest one day to say laughingly to harry one must think harry that be be elder brother not listens to with good deal more deference than doe to winter came went from time to time letter arrived from paris news be always in same strain thing be going worse worse king be little more than prisoner in hand of people of paris violence of assembly be ever on increase mob of paris be real master of situation greater part of nobility have fled who appeared in street be liable to insult feeling in province kept pace with in paris committee be formed in town village virtually superseded constituted authority number of chateau be burned peasant almost universally refused longer to pay due to seigneur at present none dreamt of personal danger noble who emigrated did so because found situation intolerable hoped that army must be shortly raised set in motion by foreign power to put down movement constituted danger to king noble property over europe a yet there be nothing to foreshadow terrible event be to take place to indicate that movement began in just demand of oppressed people for justice fair treatment must end in people becoming bloodthirsty rabble eager to destroy who be above in birth education intellect therefore although marquis de st caux foresaw possibility of confiscation of property abolition of privilege of nobility be under uneasiness whatever a to safety of child instruction be precise that if small party of peasant attacked chateau be evident that successful resistance must be made m du tillet must send word down to mayor of dijon ask for help must with servant of chateau defend if be attacked by large mob resistance be to be offered be to abandon at once journey to paris with child time went on without disturbance in dijon a elsewhere committee have be formed have taken into hand entire control of management of town at head be son of mayor monsieur lebat understand that young fellow m du tillet said one day on return from dijon like be ambitious pushing be leader of advanced party in dijon be in communication with most violent spirit in paris be bound to say that appears most anxious to be of service to family whenever see assures of devotion to marquis to day mademoiselle marie prayed to assure that need feel uneasiness for that held mob in hand must answer for that hostile movement must be made against chateau in fact know for have taken precaution of buying service of man who be upon committee lebat have actually exerted to benefit have several time be urged by most violent section that mob must be incited to attack chateau have time successfully opposed proposition have declared that while one be more hostile than to privilege of seigneury while must not only abolish noble a class confiscate possession considers that in case of marquis nothing must be done until decree to effect be passed by assembly until time argues people must discriminate chateau of tyrant must be everywhere levelled to ground must be unworthy of people to take measure of vengeance against who have not notably ground down dependent upon that a marquis have not pushed privilege of class to utmost chateau property must be respected until assembly pas decree upon subject be sure be much indebted to monsieur lebat marie said be here at hunting party seemed worthy young man of class of course be out of place among for man in position seemed tolerable yes monsieur du tillet agreed in somewhat doubtful tone of voice so far a assurance go there be nothing to be desired have a said so far acted loyally up to yet somehow like strike that be playing game although what game be can not say at anyrate trust speaks smoothly think have double face that be cruel treacherous be not like monsieur du tillet marie laughed who generally have good word for everyone seems to that be hard upon young man who appears to be animated by excellent sentiment towards spring came again m du tillet learned that mob of dijon be becoming more more violent that spy watchman have be told off to see that none of family attempted to fly for frontier therefore wrote to marquis urging that must be better that family must move to paris where must be in danger in reply received letter begging to start a soon a road be fit for travel about same time victor de gisons received summons from father to join in paris messenger who brought letter to m du tillet brought one also for marie from marquise saying that head of family be of opinion that marriage must be still further postponed a in present state of affair private plan interest must be put aside in view of danger surrounded king marie acquiesced in decision bade lover adieu calmly bravely be quite right victor have felt for time that when france be on verge of precipice be not time for noble to be marrying noblesse oblige if be two peasant might marry be happy a be must wait even though know that waiting may never come to end have

away to louise moulin chatted to gaily while harry walked up down until quarter of hour later count marie made appearance party stood talking together for few minute then adieu be said with very pale face with firmness on marie part then girl with louise turned face to paris while harry victor remained behind until have got well on way be hard to deceive victor said be right insisted must go seemed to resist urged that be cowardly for to run away to leave here alone must not listen to said be duty owed to father family to save that must be wretched if thought be in paris in constant danger of arrest finally have to give way to went against grain for even while be urging must have felt in heart must be cowardly of to go however will know day that victor de gisons be coward be sure be better so harry said will have anxiety enough to bear a to father mother be well that mind must be at ease concerning in reality victor said will be safer here than must be journeying towards frontier paper morning say that in consequence of escape of suspected person of emigration of noble to join enemy of france order have be sent that strictest scrutiny be to be exercised on road leading to frontier over stranger who may pas through who can not give perfectly satisfactory account of produce paper en regle be to be arrested sent to paris therefore chance of getting through must be small indeed whereas while remaining in paris there can be little fear of detection not much risk hope harry agreed there be saying what stringent step may take a time go on victor have taken lodging few house from of harry day excitement in paris increased day there be fresh arrest until prison became crowded to overflowing be late in august prussian be advancing have laid siege to verdun terror be added to emotion excited to madness population of paris black flag be hung from steeple danton ally skilfully used fear inspired by foreign enemy to add to general hatred of royalist republican said in rostrum of assembly be exposed to two party that of enemy without of royalist within there be royalist directory sits secretly at paris corresponds with prussian army to frustrate must terrify royalist assembly decreed death against who directly indirectly refused to execute hindered order given by executive power rumour of conspiracy agitated paris struck alarm into people mind while who have friend within prison wall became more more alarmed for safety on th of august order be issued that inhabitant of paris be to stay in house in order that visit might be made by delegate of commune to search for arm of danton have declared there be eighty thousand hidden in paris to search for suspected person a soon a order be issued harry victor went to lodging telling landlord that have obtained work at other end of town paid rent left city for next two day slept in wood passed most of time discussing project for enabling friend to escape for from stringency of step taken violence of commune must no longer indulge in hope that in short time prisoner against whom serious charge must be brought must be released at same time must hardly persuade even such men a who now held supreme power in hand must intend to take extreme measure against so vast number of prisoner a be now in custody victor harry knew that friend have at first be taken to prison of bicetre whether be still confined there be of course ignorant still there be reason to suppose that have be transferred to of other jail bicetre be have discovered so strongly guarded that force stratagem seemed available jailer be creature of danton robespierre attempt to bribe must have be dangerous in extreme victor proposed that a a well a harry be well provided with fund for have brought to paris money steward of estate have collected must recruit band among ruffian of city make sudden attack upon prison harry pointed out that numerous band must be required for such enterprise that among so many men one must be sure to turn traitor before time came be ready to run risk victor see chance of success in very first man spoke to might denounce if be seized there must be one to look after safety of mademoiselle de st caux sister first duty be towards gave promise to father although be not probable that can be of use to will at rate if possible be at hand must occasion arise on evening of th returned to paris took two fresh apartment at distance from former quarter be greatly anxious a to safety of girl harry at once hastened there found that be well deputy learning from landlord that only old woman niece inhabited upper story having heavy task before have only paid short visit to room have left after asking louise one two question girl however be in state of terrible anxiety a to parent although louise have avoided repeating to sinister rumour came to ear when be abroad doing marketing for now went out alone thinking better that girl must appear a little a possible in street be terrible marie said think night day of father mother can nothing be done surely might devise mean for escape can think of nothing harry said prison be too strong to be taken without considerable force must be impossible to get that together must not bribe wretch have thought over too harry replied see must be necessary to get several men to work together one might perhaps bribe man who have charge of cell there must be other warder guard at gate latter be changed day see how must possibly be done must be use do think be to go to danton robespierre plead with for life must do willingly if think there must be slightest chance of success must be like lamb going to plead with wolf must only attract attention to must not get hold of one of wretch force to sign order for release jeanne suggested eh harry exclaimed in surprise jeanne have best head of that idea never occurred to yes might be possible how stupid of not to think of run into danger harry marie said earnestly such scheme must hardly succeed know mademoiselle think might will think over of course there be difficulty see why must not succeed certainly will succeed if harry undertakes jeanne said with implicit trust in power harry laughed even marie anxious a be must not help smiling will try deserve confidence jeanne be not magician will talk over with hesitated with young fellow who be like royalist in disguise luckily ran against other other day after little conversation discovered other too have relative in prison will be sure join in scheme may undertake two head be better than one four be much better than two when come to acting now must say good night hope when see again will be able to tell have formed sort of plan for release chapter vii d of september victor de gisons be a usual waiting near door when harry left louise moulin what be news henri nothing suspicious hope be out sooner than usual yes for have something to think of here have be planning in vain for last fortnight to hit upon scheme for getting friend out of prison jeanne have pointed out way never thought of what be henri simplest thing in world namely that must seize one of leader of villain compel to sign order for release that certainly seems possible victor said wonder never occurred to of how be to be done ah be for to think out jeanne have given idea must be stupid if can not invent detail in first place have got to settle of have better be in next how be to be managed must be one whose signature people at prison must be sure to obey then victor said must be danton robespierre marat harry added think be a powerful a of others be worst of anyhow victor said there be something straightforward about danton doubt be ambitious think hatred of be real be terrible enemy will certainly stick at nothing be ruthless pitiless think be double faced robespierre be ambitious too think be really acting according to principle such a be must be pitiless too must murder on principle must sign unmoved order for hundred head to fall if thought falling necessary even useful for course of revolution think must shed drop of blood to satisfy private enmity call 'incorruptible be more dangerous than danton for have vice life simply say be fond of bird pet think must make much of danton even if got in power danton must be like wild beast in snare must rage with fury think that must be intimidated into signing what require not do think must robespierre marat be different creature altogether be simply venomous hate world must absolutely rejoice in slaughter so loathsome be in appearance that even colleague shrink from be venomous reptile whom must be pleasure to slay a must be to put one heel upon rattlesnake whether be coward not know must think so men of type be seldom brave think if have in hand might frighten into doing what want then marat will be harry said that much be settled tomorrow will find out something about habit till know about that can not form plan let meet at dinner time at usual place then will go outside assembly wait till come out fortunately know well by sight will be sure to go surrounded a usual by mob of admirer to jacobin club from there can trace to home doubt anyone must tell where life must be dangerous to ask when have found that out can decide upon next step be however saved trouble contemplated for learned from conversation of two men among mob who cheered marat a entered assembly what wanted to know marat be man for one of said hate aristocracy must bathe in blood never miss reading article in friend of people cry be always 'blood blood ' doe not ape manner of bourgeois doe not wash face put on clean linen be great man be a dirty a best of still life in old lodging though must move if liked into of fine house whose owner be in prison want servant life just a do vive marat where doe great citizen live victor asked men in tone of earnest entreaty on learning address took way to dirty disreputable street where marat lodged citizen marat life in street doe not victor asked man lounging at door of cabaret yes in house opposite do want only be curious to see house where friend of people life a be passing end of street turned down will drink glass be always ready for that man said in hard time one can not do a often a one must like be true enough victor said a took seat at table so marat life over there be not much of place for great man be all want other said carelessly be safer here than must be in richer quarter there must be plot against cursed royalist must kill if have chance be always escorted home from club by band of patriot in evening harry victor returned to street watched until marat returned from jacobin club escort of men with torch bludgeon left at door two three went upstairs with until far in night visitor came went then light in upper room be extinguished be not such easy affair victor said a moved away see a man in wine shop told there be old woman who cook for be much more difficult to seize two people without alarm being given than one be so harry agreed must be done somehow day matter grow more threatening band of scoundrel from marseille have not be brought way for nothing worst of be have such short time to act marat doe not seem to be ever alone from early morning until late at night supposing did somehow get order of release from at night must not present till morning before must present one might arrive discover fastened up might take news to prison before must get out yes be very serious victor agreed begin to despair henri must not do harry rejoined see thought impossible before till jeanne gave idea there must be way out of if must only hit upon perhaps by to morrow morning idea will occur to one of there be thing to be thought of must procure disguise for must be of use getting out unless must conceal after be freed must not do for to go to louise moulin have three visitor already arrival of more to stay with must be sure to excite talk among neighbour last order be so strict about punishment of anyone giving shelter to enemy of republic people who let room will be suspicious only plan will be to get out of city at once will be difficult for to make way through france on foot for in town village there be strictest look out kept for suspected person still must be risked there be other way yes must see about to morrow henri think marquise must support journey for must have to sleep in field moreover will probably elect to stay near child until can go together therefore think that will be best for to come either to can take additional room saying that mother be coming up from country to keep house for yes must be much best plan victor now here be close home hope by time meet in morning one of may have hit upon plan other for getting hold of scoundrel have hit upon idea victor harry said when met next morning be glad to hear for though have lain awake night must think of nothing well what be idea well see marat often go out in morning alone be so well known be so much regarded by lower class that have fear of assault being made upon during day plan be that must follow till get into street with few people about then must rush upon seize draw knife to strike shouting villain ' must be few pace behind must run up strike knife out of hand managing at same moment to tumble over marat fall with to ground must give time to bolt must have beard on must have other clothes under blouse must rush into first doorway run up stair pull off beard blouse blue pantaloon then walk quietly down must of course rush up stair meet on way must say have just met fellow running up stair must slip quietly off must be frightful risk henri frightful think must be managed easily enough then of course marat must be very grateful to must either get to visit lodging must go up to once have be there must manage to outsit last visitor at night then must do a agreed know thought must hardly have time in morning henri have be thinking of have come to conclusion that best plan must be to seize hold dagger to heart threaten to kill instantly if did not accompany then must go down with into street walk arm in arm with to lodging must thrust ball of wood into mouth so that must not call out even if have courage to do so think must have if be assured that if made slightest sound must kill then must make sign order leave fastened up there must be better to take to lodging than mine in case visit to louise moulin must have be noticed when be released there will be hue cry after captor best plan will be to put knife into heart at once minute have got order signed victor said savagely must have more hesitation in killing than stamping on snake victor man be monster can not kill in cold blood besides must do more harm than good to cause for people must consider have died martyr to championship of right must be more furious than ever against aristocracy account of what have gone through will have just same effect henri must think probable must keep story to have happened once may happen again besides cowardice in signing release of three enemy of people in order to save life must tell against think must keep silence after have got safe away can return so far loosen bond that must be able after time to free five minute start must be that must want plan be not destined to be carried out be morning of d of september a went down into quarter where magazine of old clothes be situated in order to purchase necessary disguise soon became sensible that something unusual be in

in readiness that evening money have be distributed marseillais have dropped hint that blow be to be struck at tyrant everywhere there be suppressed excitement among working class air of gloom terror among bourgeois after time harry victor came together again compared observation have learned anything definite be sure that something unusual be about to take place may be that large number of fresh arrest be about to be made harry said there be still many deputy who withstand violence of mountain may be that blow be going to be struck against must hope that be victor said be terribly uneasy

thought of anything harry be jeanne first question be alone for louise be cooking virginie have lain down cried to sleep have thought of number of thing replied for while have be sitting by victor bedside have turned over in mind scheme by must get marie out of prison at present have fixed upon nothing can not carry out original plan of seizing marat must require more than one to carry out such scheme friend whom relied upon before can no longer aid who be jeanne asked quietly be victor de gisons what bless jeanne harry exclaimed in surprise how did guess that felt sure be victor all along girl said in first place never believed that have gone away marie told have begged prayed to go that have only gone to please seemed to think be right must go did think so gentleman must not run away leave anyone liked behind even if told be not likely why here be staying here risking life for though be not related to have claim upon how must victor run away a marie seemed pleased to think be safe said nothing know if have gone day have be married must never have looked upon a brother felt sure must do that be in paris still then again did not tell name of friend who be working with felt sure must have reason for silence so putting two thing together be sure that be victor what have happened to be in prison too be not in prison jeanne harry said be very ill related whole circumstance of victor fever blamed awfully at first for having hit so hard a may suppose jeanne doctor say think made difference victor delirium be due to mental shock not in way to blow on head still must not like sister to know be very glad have guessed truth for be comfort to talk thing over with poor marie jeanne said softly be well never knew about thought have got safely away kept up now tell about plan must not take victor place help to seize marat be not strong know must hold knife tell must kill if cried out think must know must know be afraid must do jeanne harry said with slight smile shaking head be desperate enterprise for two of besides must never do for to run risk of being separated from virginie remember be father mother elder sister to now next plan thought of be to try get appointed a warder in prison seems full of difficulty for know one who must get such berth certainly must not appoint fellow at age unless by extraordinary influence then thought if let out be english might get arrested lodged in same prison might help to get out then from what hear prisoner be not separated live together harry jeanne exclaimed in tone of sharp pain must not do that of thing have only if be once in prison might never get out again besides there be lot of other prison there be reason why must send to la force rather than anywhere else will never consent to plan thought seemed too doubtful harry said of course if knew that must send to la force might risk must hide file steel saw about might cut through bar a say there be reason why must send there rather than anywhere else must kill that villain who arrested scoundrel after being guest at chateau see must do sister good must probably end in being shut up most hopeful plan seems to to try bribe of warder of doubt must be glad enough to take money if must see way to letting out without fear of detection know thought of before harry agreed must be terrible risk to try for very first man spoke to might turn round on of course there be certain risk jeanne anyway there be getting prisoner out of la force without running sort of risk thing be to fix on a safe plan a can however must think out well before do try failure must be fatal think there be pressing danger just at present be hardly likely there will be repetition of wholesale work of nd of september if have anything like trial of prisoner there be such number of so many arrested day that may be long time before come to sister mean that must trust to only that there be time for to make plan properly have thought of anything have thought of sort of thing since left morning harry be like yours just vague sort of scheme seem possible when try to work out know whether let inside prison to sell everything to prisoner because if did might go in with something see marie find out how must be got out harry shook head think anyone must be allowed in like if did must only be few to whom privilege must be granted yes thought of harry one of might be bribed perhaps to let take place might be possible harry said there must be terrible risk think advantage to compensate for even if did get to spoke to must still be nearer to getting out still must be disheartened can hardly expect to hit upon scheme at once think of head be very clear to day let think over quietly perhaps other idea may occur to one of expect will be to now good night keep courage up rely very much upon jeanne know what comfort be to that be calm brave that can talk thing over to know what must do if have on own shoulder jeanne made answer eye be full of tear a put hand into harry sound came from lip in answer to good night that girl trump mistake harry said to a descended stair have got more pluck than most woman be a cool calm a if be twice age most girl must be quite knocked over if be in place father mother murdered sister in hand of wretch danger hanging over virginie be that doe feel can see doe quite a much if not more than people who must sit down howl wring hand be trump jeanne be mistake now about marie must be got out somehow how be question really see possible way except by bribing guard have least idea how to set about think to morrow will tell jacques wife about may know of men though be likely that do anyhow three head be better than one accordingly next morning took kind hearted couple into counsel when heard that young lady who have be arrested be fiance of sick lodger be greatly interested shook head when told that be determined at hazard to get out of prison be risk so much jacques said that look at life doe seem of much account in day how must be done even if made up mind to be killed see must put bit nearer to getting out of prison place be too strong to break into to break out of think be possible to succeed in sort of way if men who have key of corridor must be bribed guard at gate put soundly to sleep by drugging drink might be managed jacques looked sharply at harry to see if be in earnest seeing that be so said drily yes if must do thing must doubt see way how must be managed be just point jacques in first place will be necessary to find out in corridor mademoiselle de st caux be confined in second to let know that be working for to learn if possible from whether among in charge of there be one man who show sort of feeling of pity kindness when be done must of course try to get hold of of course doe remain in prison day however can see about after have found out first point know woman who be sister to one of warder elise medart said know whether be there now whether have be turned out martha be good soul know sometimes have be inside prison suppose to see brother for before trouble warder used to get out only once month what brother be like know if be like must think be just man to help yes jacques assented did think of martha be good soul must do best be sure thank harry said wish to run risk have already incurred greatest danger by sheltering friend can not let hazard life farther woman may a say be ready to help brother might betray whole of screen sister by saying have only pretended to enter into plot in order to betray risk life day jacques said quietly be sure can trust martha will know whether can rely completely upon brother if can will set to sound elise will go see to day will know what think of when come evening for night watching greatly pleased with unexpected stroke of luck harry went off at once to tell jeanne that outline of plan to rescue marie have be fixed upon girl pale face brightened up at news perhaps said may be able to send letter to must like to send just line to say that virginie be well do think can be done know jeanne at rate can rely that if be possible go well will have be sure give clue by might find out if letter fall into wrong hand tell be working to get free ask if can suggest way of escape knowing place may see opportunity of know nothing write very small only on tiny piece of paper so that man can hide anywhere slip into hand put in ration of bread jeanne wrote little note few loving word message harry have given sign name to harry said will know well enough who come from be better in case must fall into anyone else hand that evening harry learned that woman have consented to sound brother who be still employed in prison have said be sure that must not betray even if refused to aid in plan be to see to morrow morning elise said will go straight from to prison say discipline be not nearly so strict a used to be there be very close watch kept over prisoner friend of guard can go in out without trouble except on leaving have to be accompanied by guard at door so a to be sure that one be passing out in disguise say brother be good natured very fond of money be always talking of retiring settling down in farm in brittany where come from think that if thought must gain enough to do must be ready to run risk for hate terrible thing be being done now seems just man for harry said will tell friend when

suspended over narrow street saw man feebly defending against two others sprang forward just a man fell with stick struck sharp blow on uplifted wrist of one of assailant sending knife be holding flying through air other turned upon drew pistol always carried beneath clothes two men at once took to heel harry replaced pistol stooped over fallen man be badly hurt asked think not know think slipped down must have killed have not arrived well let get to foot harry said holding out hand with feeling of disgust at abject fear expressed in tone of man voice be indeed trembling so that even when harry hauled to foot must scarcely stand have better lean against wall for minute two to recover harry said see have coat cut on shoulder be bleeding pretty freely be nothing to be frightened about if will give handkerchief will bind up for harry unbuttoned man coat for hand shook so much that be unable to do so pulled arm out of sleeve tied bandage tightly round shoulder man seemed to

how hate word startled harry what be have not interfered a have supposed to prevent robbery of quiet citizen by ruffian of street be political assassination have be attempted vengeance by royalist upon one of men of revolution looked more closely at person whose life have saved have thin insignificant figure face be pale looked like of student seemed to harry that have seen before where must not say first thought be one of regret that have interfered to save one of men of d of september then thought flashed through mind that there might be benefit to be derived from young man stranger

of who have deluged france with blood man who next only to marat be hated feared by royalist of france first feeling be one of loathing hatred at same moment there flashed through mind thought chance have favoured beyond hope that comedy have planned with victor to carry out upon person of marat have come to pas without premeditation with robespierre a chief actor so surprised so delighted be that for minute sat unable to say word robespierre be gratified at effect name have produced be strangely mixed character at once timid bold shrinking from personal danger yet ready to urge extremest measure simple in taste yet very vain greedy of applause domestic affectionate in private character ready to shed river of blood in public capacity pure in moral passionless in resolve incorruptible inflexible more dangerous because have passion hate because have not like danton marat lust for blood because human life to be a nothing because have considered necessary that half france must die for benefit of other half must have signed death warrant without emotion hesitation be surprised young man said way of fate be inscrutable interposition of youth have thwarted scheme of enemy of france have be ten second later must have ceased to be one of humble instrument by fate be working for regeneration of people must have perished while robespierre be speaking harry have rapidly thought over role must be best for to adopt must avow real character ask for order for liberation of marie a recompense for service have rendered robespierre must retain present character obtain robespierre confidence there be danger in open appeal for above thing robespierre prided upon incorruptibility might consider to free prisoner for service rendered to must be breach of duty to france resolved therefore to keep silence at present reserving appeal to robespierre gratitude for last extremity pardon monsieur said after have rapidly arrived at conclusion emotion be naturally great at finding have unwittingly be mean of saving life of one on whom eye of france be fixed rejoice indeed must have be mean of preserving life statement be strictly true although not perhaps in sense in robespierre regarded will talk more after supper said sister be see ready with indeed be long past usual hour be just sitting down when be called out by what purported to be important message from

earned in service on look out for employment may offer england be enemy robespierre said raising voice angrily enemy of free institution liberty know nothing about english politics harry replied with smile indeed about politics be little past eighteen so that can earn living ask whether employer be patriot aristocrat be quite trouble enough to earn one living without bothering one head about

greatest man in france post of secretary will be one may well be envied ah see know how to flatter robespierre said with smile much gratified nevertheless with harry word must remember that crave dignity care only for welfare of france know monsieur that be called 'robespierre incorruptible harry said nevertheless belong to france france will assuredly see that day have reward a richly merit there be untruth in harry said to a made way down stair human tiger will meet doom when france come to sens be strange contrast man suppose even tiger be domestic animal in own family food almost

strolled out saw that task of getting order for marie release must be more difficult than have anticipated have hoped that by placing with batch of paper before robespierre must get to sign among

added two name then signed sent back to prison there be list with name of prisoner to be executed on following day harry learned be not sent in to prison authority until late in evening so even be ignorant until last moment of prisoner be to be called for by tumbril next morning thus must know when marie be to go through mockery of trial must also know when name be put on fatal list for guillotine first fact might have be able to learn from ally in prison second most important must not have obtained in other way work have be frequently interrupted by caller member of committee of

robespierre be alone while in house a sister be in out of room day idea of compelling by force to sign order a have originally intended to do with marat be clearly impracticable day after work be over be generally completed by about one o'clock harry called to see how victor be getting on be gaining strength brain appeared to make far le progress than bodily health did not recognize harry in least although must answer question be asked mind appeared blank a to past often lay for hour without speaking word after leaving harry met louise two girl at spot agreed upon day before fresh meeting place being arranged day found difficult to satisfy for indeed day became more more doubtful a to ability to get order of release from robespierre towards man feeling be of mixed kind shuddered at calmness with in letter to provincial committee advocated wholesale execution of prisoner wondered at violence with in shrill high pitched voice declaimed in favour of most revolutionary measure admired simplicity of life affection for sister bird kindness of heart in matter in politics be not concerned among robespierre visitor during next three week be lebat who be harry found important personage being representative on committee of public safety of province of burgundy one of most extreme of frequenter of jacobin club did not recognize harry whom have never noticed particularly on occasion of visit to chateau who in somewhat threadbare black suit have assumed instead of workman blouse wrote steadily at table apart taking apparently notice of what be going on in apartment harry time be not altogether thrown away be duty first thing of morning to open sort letter lay in pile upon table used by robespierre managed day to slip quietly into pocket several of letter of denunciation against person a aristocrat in disguise a being suspected of hostility to commune when robespierre left to go to club assembly harry must write short note of warning in disguised hand to person named must when went out leave at door thus have satisfaction of saving considerable number of person from clutch of revolutionist must then two three day later slip letter of denunciation very few of be dated among rest of correspondence satisfied that when search be made person named must already have shifted quarter assumed other disguise february have come harry be still working waiting busy for several hour day writing examining report with robespierre striving of evening to keep up courage spirit of girl calling in for few minute day to see victor who after passing through long terrible fever now lay weak apparently unconscious alike of past present mind completely gone doctor told harry that in respect did not think case be hopeless strength seems to have absolutely deserted said mind be blank like of little child by mean despair of gradually recovering if must hear voice of lady tell be engaged to might strike chord now lying dormant set brain at work again a to marie harry must hing do what must must hit upon plan for getting out of prison must only wait until change in situation appearance of name in fatal list might afford opportunity for action be evident to that lebat be not pushing matter forward that preferred to wait leave horror of month in prison to work upon mind so break down that must be willing enough to purchase life by marriage with there have be little lull in work of blood for in december eye have be turned to spectacle of trial of king from th of august have remained close prisoner in temple watched insulted by ruffian guard passing time in midst of

won after parting with noble resignation from wife family king on st be executed bearing excited admiration even of bitterest foe france looked on amazed appalled at act for louis have undoubtedly striven best to lessen abuse to go with people in path of reform be objection to shed blood readiness to give way affection for people have allowed revolution to march on bloody way without check be victim noble priest delicate woman cultured men who have reason to complain for be king hatred to resistance left at mercy of foe louis have be best friend of revolution slew trial execution of king have at least good effect of diverting mind of jeanne virginie from own anxiety jeanne be passionate virginie tearful in sorrow indignation over over again jeanne implored harry to try to save king there be still many royalist indeed bulk of people be shocked alienated by violence of convention jeanne urged that harry might from connection with robespierre obtain pas document must enable king to escape harry refused to make attempt on behalf in first place jeanne must be absolutely impossible for king watched a be to escape pas permit that robespierre must give must be of smallest utility must remember that although apparently unite against king there be never ending struggle going on in convention between various party various leader robespierre be one of although perhaps most prominent must wring pas from even if only to see king that pas must not be respected in next place jeanne have nothing to do with struggle in france be staying here to do what little can to watch over virginie for sake of dear parent because love have also if possible to rescue marie from hand of murderer responsibility be heavy enough must by merely using robespierre name rescue king queen child pas across frontier must not do if act in slightest degree interfered with freedom of action towards marie virginie must die for king jeanne said passionately happily jeanne harry replied coolly dying must in respect benefit a life be in eye of thousand time more consequence than of king a chance of safety to extent depend upon mine mean to risk one of chance for sake of majesty besides to tell truth have good deal of liking for own life have marked objection to losing head see have people at home who be fond of who want to see back again with head on shoulder know harry know jeanne said with eye full of tear think that be ungrateful because talk so be always thinking how wrong be that must be staying here risking life for instead of going home to who love think sometimes virginie ought to give up then must go home jeanne burst into tear dear jeanne harry said soothingly worry about must have be just a dangerous at time father be taken prisoner for to have tried to escape from country a be to stay here in fact must say that be good deal more dangerous at present a robespierre secretary be in danger at be little disagreeable certainly serving man whom one regard in respect a being sort of wild beast at same time in own house be bound to say be very decent kind of man not at bad fellow to get on with a to what have done for so far a see have done nothing beyond bringing here in first place coming to have pleasant chat with evening with best will in world have be able to be of slightest assistance to marie a say at home intention be good so far intention have borne useful fruit come jeanne dry eye for be not often have seen cry have thrown in lot together will swim sink in company keep up spirit keep up yours let there be talk about gratitude there will be time enough for if ever get safely to england then perhaps may send in bill ask for payment harry spoke lightly jeanne with great effort recovered composure after although trial danger of king be nightly discussed lamented never said word a to possibility of catastrophe being averted one day towards end of february harry felt thrill run through a on glancing over list of person to be tried on following day saw name of marie daughter of ci devant marquis de st caux although knowledge of robespierre character gave little ground for hope determined upon making direct appeal see citizen said for such be mode of address universal at time among list of person to be tried be name of marie de st caux say marie caux robespierre said reprovingly know de st be forbidden prefix yes what must say about told citizen upon first night when came here that have be in service of father of female citizen although know now that be one of who lived upon blood of people be bound to say that always treated dependant kindly daughter also showed many mark of kindness must now fain return citizen did service on night when first met ask now a full quittance for aid that will grant freedom of young woman be crime of father can not have shared in be young can not do harm to therefore implore to give life be surprised at request robespierre said calmly woman belongs to race who have for century oppressed france be better that must perish altogether if can convince tribunal that be innocent of crime undoubtedly will be spared can not only on account of obligation be under to interfere on behalf such act must be treason to people hope know well enough by time to be aware that nothing must induce to allow private inclination to interfere with course of justice ask of have be little enough be yours thing can not grant for moment harry be on point of bursting out indignantly checked without word went on with writing although tear of disappointment for time almost blinded felt must be hopeless to urge point further did do so might forfeit opportunity now have of learning what be going on month passed before name appeared on fatal list in meantime harry have corresponded regularly with marie by mean of warder have even once seen exchanged few word with having be sent by robespierre with letter to governor of prison marie be greatly changed colour have faded away former somewhat haughty air carriage have disappeared there be expression of patient resignation on face harry have only opportunity to whisper to hope always be not lost yet have spent hour day in lodging imitating signature of robespierre have made up mind must other effort fail must boldly present at prison with order for marie release with robespierre signature forged at bottom thought must write now plainly enough for to pas fear be that prison authority must not act upon unless presented by well known official personage without sending to robespierre to have verified still little change have taken place in victor de gisons condition remained in state almost of lethargy with expression of dull hopelessness on face sometimes passed hand wearily across forehead a if be trying to recollect something have lost be still too weak to stand jacques wife must dress place on couch harry purchased for use worthy couple ran risk now for sharpest spy must fail to recognize in bowed down invalid with vacant face once brilliant victor de gisons harry have many talk with jeanne concerning what must do harry girl said over over again if must get marie away get safe together to england begin to despair now of ever doing if must do must say to marie think victor be safe there only other day a know sent out letter to what must say when learned on arrival in england that victor have time be lying broken down in suffering in paris to question harry for long time must give answer at last said have be thinking over jeanne feel that have right to take marie away without knowing truth about victor misfortune have come upon because must stop in paris to watch over feel now that have right if chooses of stopping in paris to look after oh harry must never think of going away leaving know jeanne if must not be best must stay in disguise of peasant girl with jacques wife must give out that be victor sister who have come to nurse have great hope that voice presence must do what have to do namely awaken from sad state of lethargy must stay there for month until evil day be over jacques workman friend be accustomed now to victor being with there be chance of suspicion arising that be not what seems to be workman whom jacques picked up injured insensible on terrible night must seem natural that sister fiance marie must pas for whichever chose must come help take care of then if can stop in paris with victor of course can stop with louise be afraid not harry said day search for suspect becomes stricter day people be being seized called upon to produce paper proving identity fear jeanne there be hope of permanent safety for save in flight be just month from mock trial at marie have be found guilty sentenced to death harry received double shock among

disguise receive many visit from young man of whom one know anything harry felt colour leave cheek hand shook a hastily abstracted note must scarcely master meaning of next few letter opened be sudden blow for be unprepared must not even think what be best to be done however saying to that have at rate few day before resolutely put matter aside to be thought over when be alone proceeded with work after time came to list of marked out for execution on following day saw with fresh pang name of marie de st caux so crisis have arrived that night never marie must be rescued plan of forging robespierre signature must be put into effect that day opened next few paper mechanically steadied upon robespierre asking question for time worked on brain be swimming be on point of saying that felt

robespierre said be fact that will be wife be surely guarantee be robespierre said what tell convinces that can without damage to cause of people grant request be more glad to do so since secretary have also prayed for life though rendered greatest service owe to debt of gratitude be obliged to refuse for to grant request must have be to allow private feeling to interfere with justice of people now be different tell that except by birth be aristocrat that have long be friend of people that be going to be wife on ground can with good conscience grant release lebat have looked with astonishment at harry a robespierre spoke thank citizen said to robespierre be act of justice relied upon from well known character promise that clemency will not be misplaced that will become worthy citizen may ask said how be that secretary whose face seems familiar to be interested in young woman also be simple enough robespierre replied be in service of father oh remember now lebat said be english wonder citizen that must give confidence to one of treacherous nation saved life robespierre replied coldly somewhat good ground will admit for placing confidence in assuredly lebat said hastily seeing that robespierre be offended now citizen there be matter of importance on wish to confer with harry rose citizen will ask to excuse from further work to day head ache badly can scarce

rapidly put on blue blouse pantaloon have formerly worn pulled cap well down over eye hurried down stair stationed distance along street waited for lebat to come out rapidly thinking matter over concluded that man must not present with order of release until after dark in order that if marie struggled tried to make escape must be unnoticed in street lebat have calculated of course on presentation of order prison official must at once lead marie to gate whether wished not must at order force into vehicle when must be completely in power must confine in own house elsewhere until consented to be wife quarter of hour later lebat came out of house walked down street harry followed after walking for distance lebat came to stand of hackney coach spoke to one of driver when have

wise woman have better make best of after be not very terrible have better marry than guillotine so trembling with loathing disgust have followed resolved that if harry plan to rescue failed must kill rather than be wife of man when reached house elise opened door so have come poor lamb said thanks to good god that have turned out well will be safe here child be rough people will take care of a if be own so saying led girl to little sitting room have prepared for for have afternoon taken other two room on floor occupied be fortunately to let have fitted up a bed room sitting room for there be already communication existing between two set of apartment have only to remove brickwork between double door to throw into one suite telling marie to sit down elise hurried off returned with basin of bouillon drink dear then go straight to bed friend will be here in good time in morning then can talk over matter with waited to see marie drink broth then helped to undress will be asleep in five

harry what then must still further allow that person with good heart upon whom have great claim must all more have remained to protect be driving at harry with supposition said cheek growing little

for payment of bribe promised to warder pistol be also hidden under blouse went down stair waited return of robespierre citizen said when entered circumstance have occurred render necessary for to travel down to nantes to escort young girl boy old woman to town can not travel alone in such time a have claim upon can not ignore surely friend sandwith robespierre said affair of france be of more

absence may put to inconvenience have double favour to ask one be to spare for time second that will give paper recommending travelling with to authority of town through will pas in time when enemy of state be travelling throughout france seeking to corrupt mind of people be necessary to have paper showing that one be good citizen have authority robespierre said be minister ruler be not minister citizen be assuredly ruler be to men look more than to other danton be too headstrong violent alone combine fearlessness in cause of france with wisdom moderation be above thing necessary in guiding state through danger robespierre vanity be so inordinate that accepted compliment a due though waved hand with air of deprecation therefore citizen harry went on letter from must be more powerful than order from person who travel with citizen how be to be sure be not enemy of france france be not to be shaken harry said smiling by effort of old woman of seventy young boy girl can assure that be enemy of france simple inoffensive people who have be frightened by commotion in paris long to return to country life to be accustomed come citizen refused first boon asked methinks can not hesitate at granting one who have deserved well of slight favour be right robespierre said can not refuse even if person who accompany belong to class of suspect of mind know nothing though may have suspicion

there be many people about be little time before must verify jeanne suspicion then noticed that man walking short distance ahead of followed turning that others took harry waited until be in quiet street then quickened pace until be close behind man then drew one of pistol springing forward struck heavy blow on head with butt fell forward on face without cry harry satisfied that have stunned ran on overtook others turning down first street came to be assured that be safe from pursuit have noticed man lounging against house opposite afternoon jeanne said came to conclusion that must be watching so looked out for when came out noticed that a soon a went on began to walk way too so told louise to walk straight on without stopping when came up to be sure must manage somehow to get rid of harry laughed fancy will spend to morrow in bed instead of lounging about perhaps will teach to mind own business in future to leave other people alone be very glad that did follow for felt owed one be sorry to leave paris without paying debt now think be pretty well square meeting between sister be indeed happy one fell on other neck for time scarce word be spoken then stood little apart have long look at other be changed marie dear jeanne said look pale look too softer prettier than used to air grace have be rubbed off marie said with slight smile have learned so much jeanne have be where noble blood have be reverse of recommendation be changed too six month have altered gouvernante must not call wild girl now be quite woman have suffered too marie jeanne said a tear came to eye at thought of change loss of last few month have thought of night day louise have be very good to a for harry owe everything to have always be so hopeful strong have cheered up with promise that must bring to day marie smiled be right jeanne used to laugh little know at belief in hero little thought that time must come when must trust a implicitly a do have right to be proud of jeanne what thought devotion courage have shown for do know saved victor too jacques have told about how victor saw father brought out to be murdered how half mad be springing out to stand beside when harry a quick a thought knocked down before must betray then jacques who be standing by saw helped carry here oh dear how much owe now virginie said turning to youngest must have good look at little one must call little one longer for be already almost a tall a be child how have be growing look so well louise must have be feeding up ah louise how much owe to too hear be going to leave comfortable home take care of girl on journey be such comfort to when harry told must not let go alone mademoiselle old woman said simply be only duty besides what must do in paris with child in england now dear take thing off marie said will just run in see how victor be getting on harry went straight in to want to know whether victor recognized chapter xii nantes harry be very pleased to see look of recognition on victor face a came up to side of couch well victor said cheerfully be glad to see looking more again victor nodded assent hand feebly returned pressure of harry ca understand said after pause seem to be in dream be true marie be here be oh yes be chatting now with sister jeanne virginie know why be here victor asked looking round room marie tell not to ask question there will be plenty of time for afterwards victor be all simple enough be out with there be accident got hurt so workman who be passing carried into house wife have be taking care of have be very ill be getting on better now marie have come to nurse wo leave until be quite well now think be enough for doctor must be very angry if knew have told so much because said be not to bother about thing at just to sleep a much a can eat a much a can listen to marie talking reading to not trouble brain in way because be brain have gone wrong thinking will be very bad for explanation seemed satisfactory to victor who soon after dozed off to sleep harry joined party in marie sitting room oh if must keep here with harry what comfort must be know that must marie be too dangerous know be denounced at louise moulin already there be risk enough in victor being here search for royalist doe not relax indeed seems to become more more keen day victor extreme illness be best safeguard neighbour have heard that jacques have have fellow workman dangerously ill for long time victor can no longer be looked upon a stranger to be suspected while coming here to help nurse will seem so natural step that will excite comment fresh addition of number must be sure to give rise to talk must have commissary of commune here in time to make inquiry to ask for paper of domicile yes know that must be too dangerous to risk marie agreed tremble at thought of journey have hope that will get through safely harry said have good news have not yet told have received paper from robespierre stating have be secretary recommending to authority so that can dispense with ordinary paper must otherwise ask for be good news indeed harry marie said that relief of half anxiety once on sea coast will be comparatively easy to get passage to england dear harry surprise more day be ashamed to think that when dear father mother first told that have accepted noble offer to look after be inclined in heart to think that such protection must be of little use see confess harry know be way to forgiveness there be nothing either to confess forgive harry said with smile be perfectly natural for to think that lad of eighteen be slender reed to lean on in time of trouble danger that be only by lucky accident for saving robespierre life be accident have be enabled to be of use to have now pas will enable to take sister with comparative safety a far a nantes have not be for must have done little indeed to aid must not say so harry be too modest besides be not quickness that saved victor owe everything disclaimer be only thrown away a for feel quite jealous of jeanne superior perspicacity for trusted absolutely from first have nothing to do with perspicacity jeanne said harry saved life from dreadful dog after knew if there be danger must be able to get out of be if be possible for anyone to do so hope will be able to justify trust jeanne arrive safely with at father house can promise warmest of welcome from mother sister fear must long since have given up for dead will be like shipwrecked mariner who have be cast upon island given up a lost father always used to say that if be first rate hand at getting into scrape be equally good at getting out of again think will have quite despaired of seeing again especially a know by last letter sent that said must speak french well enough to pas anywhere a native how surprised will be at arriving with two girl louise virginie said will be pleased more than surprised harry replied have written so much about in letter that girl mother will be delighted to see besides jeanne added boy will have told be waiting behind with so will not be so surprised a must otherwise have be will be funny arriving among people who speak word of language will soon be at home with said harry reassuringly jenny kate be just about age expect will have grown so will hardly know be nearly three year now since left have to look at to assure that jenny will have grown almost into young woman now will go out for bit leave to chat together need not fidget about victor marie elise be with will come let know if wake hope that have gone off fairly to sleep for night knew think have put mind at rest little a to how came here have told be accident in street that brought in here have be too ill since to be moved think will ask more question if be must while nursing resume dress came here in will be le puzzling to than one be wearing now little party started next morning at day light at very first village came to found how strict be watch upon person leaving paris have reason to congratulate upon possession of robespierre safe conduct sooner have sat down in village cabaret to breakfast than official with red scarf presented asked who be where be going production of document at once satisfied indeed immediately addressed young man in somewhat shabby garment who have honour of being secretary to great man in tone of greatest respect virginie at present be shy awkward in attire a boy indeed have there be time night before to procure disguise for a girl must have be done although harry opinion that must attract le attention for to travel a boy be unchanged must have given way have be possible to make change a delay however must certainly be dangerous original plan be adhered to marie have cut sister hair short one must have suspected from appearance that virginie be not what seemed good looking boy of thirteen year old with bundle in hand trudged along road stopped for night at village about twelve mile out of paris after having again satisfied authority by production of pas harry made inquiry next morning went two mile away to farm house where there be heard cart horse to be disposed of after much haggling over term since to give sum be first asked must have excited surprise perhaps suspicion harry became possessor of horse cart drove triumphantly back to village having stowed louise two girl on straw in bottom of cart proceeded on journey met with adventure on journey to nantes be performed in ten day weather be bitterly cold although be now well on in march snow lay deep on ground girl be well wrapped up cart be filled with straw helped to keep warm harry walked for most part by side of horse head for must only proceed at foot pace sometimes climbed up took rein better to chat with girl keep up spirit there be occasion for in case of jeanne virginie often gave way cried bitterly old nurse suffered greatly from cold in spite of warm wrap on arriving at nantes harry proceeded first to maine on producing robespierre document received permit to lodge in town then looked for apartment in neighbourhood of river when have obtained disposed of horse cart statement that be robespierre secretary at once secured for much attention from authority be invited to become member of revolutionary committee during stay in town in order that might see for with what zeal instruction received from paris for extermination of royalist be being carried out offer accepted a must enable to obtain information of be going on have not be for must gladly have declined honour for feeling be daily harrowed by arrest massacre be powerless to prevent for did not venture to raise voice on side of mercy for have done so must have be certain to excite suspicion found that horrible a be atrocity committed in paris be even surpassed by be enacted in province in nantes in particular terrible persecution be raging under direction of carrier who have be sent down from paris a commissioner from commune there harry next object be to make acquaintance of of fisherman to find out what vessel be engaged in smuggling good across to england for be in one of alone that must hope to cross channel however found much more difficult than have expected terror be universal news of execution of king have heightened dismay massacre be going on over france lowest ruffian in great town be now master under pretended accusation be wreaking hate upon respectable inhabitant private enmity be wiped out in blood none be too high too low to be denounced a royalist denunciation be followed a matter of course by mock trial execution man distrusted neighbour fear caused who most loathed hated existing regime to be loudest in advocacy of there be spy everywhere men who received blood money for victim denounced thus then harry effort to make acquaintance among sailor met with very slight success be stranger be sufficient to cause distrust ere long became whispered that have come from paris with special authority to hasten on work of extirpation of enemy of state soon therefore harry perceived that a moved along quay little group of sailor fisherman talking together broke up at approach men sauntering off to wine shop accosted replied civilly indeed with embarrassment restraint although question of general character be answered profound ignorance be manifested upon subject upon wished to gain information sailor seemed to know occasionally cargo of spirit be run from river to england none must name vessel engaged in trade harry soon perceived that be regarded with absolute hostility one day one of sailor said to quietly citizen be good sans culotte warn have best not come down river after dark for there be strong feeling against unless must like body to be fished out of river with dozen knife hole in will take advice harry began to feel almost crushed under responsibility attendance at revolutionary committee tried greatly made progress whatever in effort to obtain passage to add to trouble old nurse who have be much exhausted by change from usual habit inclemency of weather on journey instead of gaining strength appeared to be rapidly losing be forced to take to bed terrible event in paris long strain of anxiety a to safety of girl fate of marie have completely exhausted strength last six month have aged a many year harry tried hard to keep up appearance of hopefulness to cheer girl jeanne quick eye speedily perceived change in be wearing out harry said one evening a be sitting by fire while virginie be tending louise in next room can see in face be of use trying to deceive tell day that hope soon to get hold of captain of boat sailing for england know that in reality be making progress all month when be hoping to get marie out of prison though seemed next to impossible told not to despair knew did not despair now be different be sure that do in heart almost give up hope why trust harry may not be able to do much might try to cheer have be comforting time surely be time took turn be not child now feel like one just at present harry said unsteadily with quivering lip feel sometimes a if a used to say at school must cry for twopence know jeanne can trust be because doubted courage have not told exactly how thing be going on because be entirely upon now that louise virginie have to depend wish to put more weight on shoulder will be relief to to tell exactly how stand then told how completely have failed with sailor how actual feeling of hostility against have arisen think must have stood that jeanne be that terrible committee try be so awful hearing fiend marking out victim exulting over murder that at time feel tempted to throw upon of strangle must be dreadful harry jeanne said soothingly will not be possible for to give out that be ill so absent for time from meeting be sure look ill ill enough for anything a to sailor let that worry even if must hear of ship at present must be of use must leave louise seems to to be getting worse worse doctor called

harry must wait patiently what may send will wait patiently harry said feel better now jeanne will not see give way again what have be worrying most be thought that must have be wiser to have carried out other plan to have put virginie for instance in farmhouse not far from paris for to have waited there till storm blew over must never think that harry jeanne said earnestly know talked over dozen of time louise of agreed that be best chance marie when came out quite thought so too so whatever come must not blame in slightest wherever be be in danger might have be denounced arranged jeanne have responsibility of being here to equal extent must have have responsibility of being anywhere else so be of use letting that trouble now a to sailor know have made acquaintance of of woman in street of be sailor wife possibly through may be able to hear about ship at anyrate must try perhaps must jeanne be very very careful what question put might be betrayed think there be much fear of harry woman be more outspoken than men of be with what call people be clear that others be quite other way see trade have be almost stopped there be great suffering among sailor family of course have be very careful not to seem to have more money than other people have be able to make soup thing have learned to be quite cook from seeing louise at work take to be very poor especially if have child ill
