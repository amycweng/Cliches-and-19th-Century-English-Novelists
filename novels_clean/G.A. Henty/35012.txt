pleasant summer house became reading room at last after have governess schoolroom in fine weather be not obtained without opposition upon part of mamma who considered a irregular sort of proceeding coaxed papa into putting in good word for then mamma who be only too glad to see happy gave in at once have just gone out after look down at river fish across at pretty country beyond have opened book with little sigh of regret when heard footstep coming down garden to surprise found be papa now girl said put on thing a quickly a can be going over to mr harmer at sturry will take with first though must ask mamma leave have doubt miss harrison here will be a glad of holiday a be mamma however although seldom opposed of papa plan for amusement raised many objection indeed have for time past noticed that did not like visiting at harmer place upon occasion be particularly averse to going said be getting too old to associate with person of such extraordinary antecedent a did not hear who person be for papa broke in more sternly than have ever before heard speak to mamma said that differed from entirely for part must see harm whatever in going at rate until be of age to judge for question of sort must arise mamma directly saw be in earnest said more set out soon afterwards with understanding that must most probably not be back until evening although polly ever made remark to other about conversation at least can answer for be not le astonished at seemed perfectly inexplicable to what objection must there be to going to harmers be a have said past fourteen be beginning to think reason about sort of thing be problem tried in vain for long time to solve to satisfaction how pondered matter over in light ever without success mamma have said be person now person generally mean woman only woman at harmer place be two miss harmers have be principle mamma objected to must have understood for miss harmers be bigoted catholic not that must have made difference with papa who looked at matter with very latitudinarian eye in opinion have heard say sect to man belongs make little difference if doe do best according to belief remember that in after year when have suffered much warned not to blame creed for act of professor history have shown must say that bigot whether be catholic protestant mussulman will be equally cruel persecutor of others equally ready to sacrifice everything belief to stand in way of church mention here because must be very sorry that feeling of one who may ever come to read story of mine must be hurt that must be taken to be attack even implication against particular form of worship knew then that although papa objected to extreme opinion miss harmers held have be caused by exceptional life have led still antecedent to mamma alluded must be question of religion yet only other female at harmer place be sophy needham pretty girl so often met there be orphan village child to whom mr harmer have taken fancy that have sent at own expense to london school have constantly staying at house with of course must not be sophy for be quite sure that fact of having be village girl must not make slightest difference in papa mamma eye so far a associating with went in other respect there must be objection for be particularly quiet retiring girl be two year older than objection then did not appear to apply to one at harmer place puzzled in vain upon subject indeed be not for year afterwards that mystery be solved found out that be indeed sophy needham to whom mamma have alluded there be reason why must make mystery of in journal of mine will be more easily understood by making matter clear at once will therefore before go on with own story relate history of harmers a nearly a can a be told to chapter ii harmers of harmer place harmers of harmer place although of ancient descent must yet hardly be ranked among very old kentish family for must trace back history very little beyond commencement of reign of queen elizabeth of pious protestant memory about period be ascertained that be small landed proprietor probably half gentry half farmer documentary traditional history go to prove that harmers of day be stiff necked race that conscience be by mean of same plastic nature a of great majority of neighbour must not for life of see why because royal family have of sudden come to conclusion that old roman religion in fore father have for so many century worshipped be after wrong therefore whole nation be bound to make same discovery at same moment so harmers clung to old faith be looked upon with grievous disfavour in consequence by authority for time being many be domiciliary visit paid grievous be fine inflicted upon for nonconformity still whether from information privately sent to previous to research whether from superior secrecy snugness of priest chamber certain be that although frequently denounced searched priest emissary of papacy be ever found concealed there so although constantly harassed vexed be suffered to remain in possession of estate a generation of harmers succeeded generation continued same stiff necked race clinging to old tenet hardening heart to inducement to desert over over again went through troublous time especially when god fearing enlightened puritan domineered over england in after reign difficulty arose day of persecution be over then have nothing to undergo comparable to former trial must have be naturally supposed that a at commencement of reign of elizabeth harmers be by mean wealthy race must speedily have be shorn of little property then possessed be not so more be persecuted so much more flourished from mere farmer speedily rose to rank of county family one reason doubtless for immunity from more than comparatively petty persecution such a fine imprisonment be that harmers never took part in political affair in plot rising civil war be ever known actively to interfere a harmers be in other respect obstinate quarrelsome race stubborn in will strong in like dislike be singular that must never have actively bestirred in favour of cause have so strongly at heart popular belief on matter be that settled traditional line of policy have be recommended enforced upon family by priest namely to keep quite neutral in politics in order that there might be at least one house in country that from proximity to sea coast peculiarly suitable to purpose where in case of necessity secure hiding place must be relied on mother church be very good to obedient child if harmers gave up personal feeling for benefit sheltered minister in time of peril doubt took care that in long run must not be loser so while roman catholic neighbour threw into plot party lost house land not uncommonly life harmers rode quietly through gale thriving more more under small persecution suffered for faith sake thus happened that going into trouble a small proprietor in reign of elizabeth came out of in of george owner of large estate rambling old mansion in style of architecture after date persecution having ceased priest chamber being no longer useful harmers ceased to enlarge boundary lived retired life on property passing considerable portion of time on continent robert harmer have contrary to usual custom of ancestor six child four son two daughter edward be of course intended to inherit family property be

time have arrived in india there leaving ship have determined to cast lot after various employment have finally obtained situation a clerk to planter up country whose daughter have three year afterwards married be now doing well hoped that father must forgive having ran away from home so far letter be satisfactory enough be final paragraph have caused explosion of family wrath against

prove serious annoyance to father that a be so far away must never be likely to return to obtrude new religion have adopted upon hoped that must be bar to continuing amicable correspondence with hope be a have be seen not destined to be realized answer be sealed duly sent off henceforth herbert harmer a far a family be concerned ceased to have existence be nearly twenty year before again heard of

account a being in keeping with character of people to whom ministered unhappy family unhappy in life disposition unhappy in view have taken of religion duty very unhappy be only count to must have pleaded guilty very unhappy because old line of harmer must die with that there be none of name to inherit after for herbert apostate must succeed that protestant harmer must dwell where catholic ancestor have so long lived be never even for moment discussed a possibility very idea must have be desecration at dead father must have moved in graf better thousand time better that old place must go to stranger so edward will be made everything be done must be done dwelt in gloomy resignation waiting for end that end be to come to of sooner than expected edward robert harmer have one interest one worldly amusement in indulged a young men have be for time together at genoa in town of mariner have become passionately attached to sea taste have never lost still delighted occasionally to go out for day sailing in small pleasure yacht kept at little fishing village of herne bay be open boat of about eight ton be considered good sea boat for size in with two men to sail under command of old one armed sailor whom employed because have once lived on estate must go out for hour once week so not on fine sunny day in have pleasure when wind blew fresh wave broke tawny yellow on sand long bank off coast be white with foaming breaker be strange sight in such weather to see two men now from fifty to sixty year old very similar in face figure taking place in stern of little craft while boatman in rough weather coat fearnought hat hoisted sail prepared for sea very quiet must sit while spray dashed over boat tore across surface of water with smile half glad half defiant on dark feature till one armed captain must say touching hat be getting wilder honour think have better put about then must give assenting gesture boat head must be turned to shore where must arrive wet through storm beaten with deep joy in heart such a experienced at other time once went out came back alive more happened thus be rd of march morning be overcast dull there be wind though not strong coming in short sudden puff then dying away again brother started early drove over through village of herne to little fishing hamlet in bay stopped at cottage of captain a termed of little old sailor came out to door be not thinking of going out to day honour be why not edward harmer asked think there will be wind enough aye aye honour wind enough more than enough before long there be gale brewing up there old man shaded eye with remaining hand looked earnestly at cloud pooh pooh man robert harmer said there be wind to speak of yet although think with that may come on to blow a sun go down what then be nearly easterly so if sail straight out can always turn run back again before sea get up high enough to prevent know be always ready to return when give word old sailor made further remonstrance summoning two young men who generally accompanied busied in carrying down oar making preparation to launch little boat be to carry to where yacht be moored about hundred yard out with many quiet disapproving shake of head a did so be soon in launched through wave be breaking with long heavy menacing roar be not rough yet even in quarter of hour have elapsed between arrival at village reaching side of yacht aspect of weather have changed much gust of wind came more frequently with far greater force whitening surface of water tearing off top of wave in sheet of spray dull heavy cloud overhead be beginning to break up suddenly a if stirred by mighty force within great opening rent seemed torn asunder in dark curtain then a suddenly closed up again through momentary opening scud must be seen flying rapidly past in higher region of air on reaching side of yacht be rolling heavily on rising wave one armed sailor again glanced at brother to see if noticed ominous sign if made change in determination gave sign of doing so face be set in expression of stern pleasure always wore on occasion like with disapproving shake of head even more decided than in have before indulged turned to assist men in fastening boat have come in to mooring to await return in loosing sail taking couple of reef in preparing for start in five minute little craft be far out at sea ploughing way through ever increasing wave dashing aside from bow in sheet of spray leaving broad white track behind wind be getting up minute blew with hoarse roar across water before have be gone fifteen minute old sailor felt that be indeed madness to go farther saw that force of wind be already more than boat must bear be momentarily increasing that sea be fast getting up under power a counsel have be already once disregarded determined to let first order for return come from brother glanced for moment from sail sea to two men sitting beside there be thought of turning back there lip be hard set yet half smiling eye wide open a if to take in tumultuous joy of scene hand lay clenched on knee have evidently no thought of danger thought of anything deep wild pleasure old sailor bit lip looked again over sea looked at sail at lad crouched down in bow with consternation strongly expressed on face glanced at dark green water rushing past side sometimes a lay over combing in over gunwale felt boat quiver under shock a succeeding wave struck knew must bear no more therefore again turned round to impassive figure beside made usual speech honour be time to go about time so absorbed be in sensation that did not hear have to touch to attract notice to shout in ear honour must go about started at touch rose like men waked suddenly from dream cast glance round seemed to take in for first time real state of thing raging wind flying scud wave rose round boat struck with force threatened to break into fragment then edward said yes by mean if indeed be not already too late god forgive for bringing out into peccavi culpa mea then brother influenced not by fear for for life of whom have brought into danger commenced rapidly uttering in low voice prayer of church for in peril prayer be never to be finished men sprang with alacrity to rope when order be given prepare to go about whether finger be numb what be went wrong one will ever know boat obeyed rudder came up into wind there be momentary lull then a head payed round towards shore fresh gust struck with even greater force than ever rope refused to run be for instant that instant sealed fate of boat over lay till sail touched water sea poured in over side for moment seemed to try to recover then wild cry went up to heaven boat lay bottom upwards in trough of wave chapter iii l'homme propose dieu dispose

brother from share in old family property miss harmer then shortly introduced brother to present who received courteously being far too well bred men of world to betray least exultation over conquered

younger brother under whose ownership care changed not little not externally there great alteration be possible unless whole place have be pulled down rebuilt thick tree have crowded in made dark gloomy be thinned out so that air light must come in upon bright flower bed took place of mass of shrubbery on lawn in front a far a must be done whole place be cleared brightened inside much greater change be made there indeed old house be completely remodelled new paper new paint new furniture fitting of description modern window be put in where practicable be wherever must be inserted without violent incongruity with style of architecture part of house indeed that part containing principal apartment be entirely modernized party wall be pulled away small room thrown into large one ceiling roof raised bow window thrown out bright cheerful air given to in chapel adjoining house great alteration be made coloured glass window took place of plain one formerly there have be inserted after visit of inspection paid by party of puritan cavalry who not having succeeded in finding man of belial of whom be in search consoled under disappointment by holy amusement of smashing beautiful stained glass window destroying decoration carving of little chapel seat be now removed shrine hanging picture other emblem of romish church be taken down grand stone altar be retained large cross in black marble be placed over taking place of wooden crucifix have so long hung there at foot of step leading up to altar where have so often knelt in prayer beautiful monument of white marble be erected to dead brother on sun threw strange solemn light a streamed in through coloured window change alteration be carried on under personal care inspection of mr harmer who with son came down at once to canterbury taking up residence for first two month at fountain spending most of time over at place although when mason decorator once take possession of house generally contrive to make stay nearly interminable yet money energy personal supervision will occasionally work wonder in case in three month after taking possession be by end of june mr harmer have satisfaction of seeing work completed little army of men engaged upon fairly out of house a soon a have gone into residence neighbouring gentry called almost in body to possessed charm of new discovery knew place existed have seen of be lodge gate twisted chimney of house a rose among tree shut in from view be hardly knew what be like even from tradition father grandfather have ever called there not that religion of owner have constituted serious objection to so doing harmers led too secluded recluse life to care about knowing one with only very few among county family of own creed have visiting acquaintance whatever be confined to exchange of formal call of stately dinner once so in course of year only intimate acquaintance be chosen among foreigner ecclesiastic others generally italian whom have known during long absence on continent of there have be usually one two staying in house when family be at home beyond have friend now be to change carriage of neighbouring gentry dashed in quick succession up

much liked pronounced great acquisition to county society visit be shortly returned invitation to dinner speedily followed not to dinner party alone be festivity confined picnic be got up ball given be unanimously agreed for once to overlook fact that there be lady head to harmer place that mother daughter must accept mr be lavish hospitality regardless of fact indeed harmers accession to property gave rise to series of feasting festivity such a have not be known in part of county for year previously into mr harmer entered with fresh pleasure frank joyous spirit charmed attracted with lady be especial favourite to manner address be so singularly different to of men with whom be accustomed to associate that must not fail to be greatly impressed by herbert harmer have seen little nothing of woman for with exception only of wife who have always be great invalid whom have nursed for year with almost devotional care kindness have be thrown in contact with very few english woman regarded whole sex with almost chivalrous devotion respect in man of age be very strange touching although very well read man for in distant home have kept well supplied with current english literature with scientific work of description knew very little of real life of commanding intellect have be placed in different circumstance where mind must have have fair scope for exercise herbert harmer must have made conspicuous figure for a be although found in charming companion sympathizer in various taste few must have suspected how great be store of knowledge simple hearted childlike man have stored up in year of solitary reading be general sympathy for taste of others together with reverence for sex led to treat young girl of seventeen with deference not inferior to must have exhibited for white haired grandmother made so universally liked by woman have herbert harmer although man of forty seven looking older than be wished to marry again might have nearly taken choice among fair young kentish maiden who surrounded woman especially young woman appreciate character such a far better than men can do purity of heart recognizes instinctively goodness childlike wisdom very many must own to that without entertaining passionate love for must yet entrust happiness to one with confidence far more serene implicit than must experience in case of younger man perhaps thought a to possibility of mr harmer marrying again may have entered into calculation of of matron with grown up family who must not have unwillingly have seen one of daughter holding sway a mistress at harmer place if so be not for long for mr harmer upon one occasion when possibility of such event a new mistress for house being forthcoming when alteration be completed be laughingly suggested resented idea in quite serious manner from be quite evident that future mistress of harmer place whomsoever might be must enter a wife of gerald rather than of herbert harmer gerald be by mean so great favourite a father although earnestly desired to be popular must altogether succeed in object must not overcome listless manner long residence in india have rendered part of nature must not acquire interest in chit chat gossip of country society manifest more than most languid interest in agricultural conversation disquisition formed large staple of country gentleman talk of price of corn knew nothing malt hop be mystery into beyond drinking resulting compound have desire to penetrate yet be sensible good hearted young fellow enough misfortune be that have not strength of mind to adapt to life people be thrown among mr harmer be extremely anxious that son must marry early well not well in worldly point of view to true woman to whom must look up who must in time correct fault of character fault father saw understood feared much that weak facile disposition must render liable to fall into serious error fault must be not unlikely to lead to be entrapped into hasty marriage evil consequence of might be incalculable to mr harmer therefore watched with anxiety to see to among various young girl of neighbourhood gerald be most attracted at first gave father little trouble new to female society possessed infinite charm to seemed to admire too generally to devote to one in particular although at once commenced series of active flirtation appeared quite unable to single out one for especial preference le absents ont toujours tort converse of proverb seemed to to be equally true present be always right whosoever might chance to be in society must assuredly for time being appear to approach nearest to perfection gerald harmer be certainly much greater favourite with girl than be with father brother languid indolent way of a if rather thought that be duty of other people to devote to amusement made men vote puppy be to quite new very amusing girl too rather like occasionally reversing position bestowing homage instead of receiving so lively country girl enjoyed languid flirtation with gerald entered into with great spirit laughing in sleeve perhaps at while did so not being in least likely to become victim of very ardent passion when shooting season commenced however great change came over for threw into sport with ardour astonished father at last really seemed to have found something worth caring for in short time by devotion for field sport rose many degree in estimation of young squire who agreed that gerald harmer have turned out capital fellow after in spite of air nonsense be probable that sank in sister estimation a rose in brother for now no longer cared for female society spent whole of time in shooting over own other estate with party of young owner sometimes alone with other companion than long william keeper else in hunting to also took with great ardour sporting taste rapidly developed dog horse gun occupied whole thought few must have recognized in figure in shooting jacket gaiter returning splashed to head after hard day work indolent lounger who have considered almost too great trouble to think for father observed change with pleasure a have noticed with pain son increasing listlessness although be personally loser by for gerald have be hitherto constant companion in walk over estate visit of kindness at labourer cottage under care assumed very different far more comfortable aspect than have worn under old regime still felt that might do much good thought natural that young man must be fond of sport must seek companionship of men of own age though missed former familiar intercourse with son assented with little sigh of regret to new state of thing told that be much better so be very right proper even of evening be seldom now that gerald accompanied father to house of neighbouring gentry always pleading fatigue other excuse for not doing so on occasion when father have started alone must be sure to find pretext forgotten order question must be asked a reason for strolling down in course of evening to smoke pipe with inseparable ally long william keeper of father of course knew nothing people of village soon noticed visit shook head when saw young squire go in at cottage door for william character stood by mean high such companionship must do good sometimes too long william must not have returned from duty when gerald sauntered down then task of entertaining till return must fall on william pretty sister madge who kept house for brother altogether must have be far better for gerald to have accompanied father than to spend evening sitting there smoking occasionally drinking not truly that be fond of drink for own sake a felt obliged to send long william out for bottle of spirit felt equally bound to keep in countenance while drank so thing went on into spring then shooting hunting being over gerald to father great annoyance subsided into former listless state indeed into much worse condition than be in before no longer be mr harmer companion in ramble over estate took interest in plan for improvement of house of poorer neighbour have pleasure in society before have so enjoyed indeed so entirely without aim object did life seem to have become that mr harmer felt that change be absolutely necessary for proposed to that must go for few month ramble on continent proposition gerald embraced with eagerness in few day started on tour mr harmer have at first thought of accompanying finally decided against doing so a judged better that gerald must have to think act entirely for for being forced to do to make new acquaintance friend in travelling must only do by exerting to be agreeable must be far more likely to shake off listless apathy than if have one ever with to arrange matter take necessity of thought exertion off hand so gerald went alone a far a must be gleaned from letter certainly seemed improving at first wrote without much interest in what saw gradually tone of letter became more healthy when reached switzerland wrote in quite enthusiastic term have joined party who intended to stay there two three month thoroughly wander over various lake valley of lovely country enjoyed life immensely be becoming first rate mountaineer altogether appeared to have entirely recovered life spirit mr harmer remained quietly at home passing time between book management of estate pleasure of social intercourse with neighbour few day passed without riding out into country into canterbury for visit to among everywhere continued to gain golden opinion became so popular that be requested to allow to be put in nomination a member for division of county at next election offer although very gratifying mr harmer declined be very happy contented with present mode of life have not least wish to take upon care responsibility of seat in parliament in autumn soon after shooting began gerald returned looking sunburnt healthy full of life of adventure travel seemingly permanently cured of listless indolent way father be much pleased with change be now quite satisfied with yet at time fancied might be only fancy that in pause of conversation must fall into short revery of something unpleasant quick gloomy anxious look seemed to pas across face although must be instantly dispelled still mr harmer must not help thinking that have something on mind if be so said word to father herbert harmer even have be sure that secret have existed be far from being be of too delicate disposition to make least advance towards confidence son did not seek to repose in at last hunting season began again to gerald have be looking forward eagerly a preferred even to shooting perhaps because be much greater change a meet be seldom held near canterbury must have to send hunter on night before drive over perhaps fifteen twenty mile in morning however happened that one of first meet of season be appointed to take place near canterbury about three mile out on old dover road gerald started off after early breakfast in unusually high spirit mr

horse foot in still evening air must hear confused sound of voice trampling of foot coming nearer what must be nameless terror blanched cheek dim vision of truth flashed across in instant be at hall door opened went out on to step horseman have alighted now stood looking pale anxious at door when opened saw mr harmer shrank back a man might who knowing that have something very painful to go through be suddenly confronted with before have quite nerved to undergo recovering however although usually hearty jovial face be blanched white prepared to speak herbert harmer waved back must tell

age felt anomalous position for have at mr harmer wish be made acquainted with history a be sure that sooner later be certain to be informed of be of quiet retiring manner self contained thoughtful manifested quiet deference for miss harmers with however much might have wished must have found fault warm though subdued affection for mr harmer thus matter stood when story began chapter v testamentary intention history of harmers have told nearly a heard passing briefly over such part a be not essential to understanding of story retaining be necessary to be told in order that relative position of various inmate of harmer place may be quite understood by one who may hereafter read story of mine having done so can now proceed with regular course of journal that visit of ours to harmer place be very memorable one exercised not little influence upon fortune although certainly little dreamt at time of return that evening that have done so to polly have be simply extremely pleasant day have rambled about garden with sophy needham have taken tea in summer house while papa mr harmer be at dinner have then gone into desert that over have again rambled out leaving gentleman over wine be while thus engaged that conversation took place did not hear of for more than year afterwards entirely altered worldly prospect be began by mr harmer who have be for time sitting rather silent abstracted think be high time dear doctor for to speak to frankly openly of what intention be in reference to disposal of property mentioned somewhat of to four five year since must like now to

what be tranquil contented happy by friendship ten year ago will remember begged to retire from practice to take up abode here with family upon term might name in fact a adopted family offer from motif must not respect declined loved profession considered incompatible with duty to leave career of active usefulness thing therefore went on a before towards sophy intention be not fixed have turned out very good girl will therefore leave half fortune about seventy five thousand pound have other relation person who must have smallest claim upon might hesitate a be not even most morbid feeling of delicacy can tell that be depriving others of expectation being so let matter be tacitly understood say nothing about ought not to have known of till death just suppose that know of now will ask why have then told for reason wish to benefit child life be uncertain may live for many year yet money might come too late to do good son may have spent best year of life struggling in

fairthorne who came from part of country have met at of christmas party be by parent school have be recommended to papa although felt rather nervous be not until be in sight of school that spirit

must have done such incalculable good be now devoted to far different purpose here bishop paused there be silence for little then elder sister again asked request father will grant now that may retire to convent task be done here task be not done bishop said sternly may not be relinquished path in life must be regulated by duty not wish duty be plain to endeavour to restore to church that property of have be unjustly defrauded one can perform although at present thing have worked ill yet one can say what may yet occur have already in brother present position striking instance of unexpected way in event of world occur how little can foresee intention of god who can say therefore that in time great wrong may not be rectified that will of dead brother true child of church may not yet be carried into effect event have indeed turned out badly there be ground for losing hope who have hitherto worked so well for good cause little looked to see shrink from allotted task expected better thing of sister cecilia sister angela of woman having once put hand to plough did not think to see turn back from labour have tried hard father very hard for many long year cecilia harmer said be only

that when at last stricken with illness will turn back a wandering sheep to fold sister be inducement lost soul to be saved church to be strengthened not often be such inducement offered here raised hardened voice be not by inducement only that church act by order threatenings upon certain burden have be placed hard to bear perhaps not beyond strength from task must not shrink private wish be a nothing in balance have duty must fain escape to pas life in way must please in convent must say to serve god there will not be so served have given sphere other task convent be for who see path of active usefulness traced out for not for such a who can tell what may yet occur at first acceded to request allowed to retire from world until nephew death clearly indicated that providence have not destined property of church to pas from apostate father to heretic son then path of duty be clear although at present future look dark although brother be obstinate in recusancy although may talk of leaving property to others yet case be by mean hopeless may repent turn girl whom have adopted may displease may die without will many other contingency may arise until death task can not be ended be younger than be may survive elder sister said may may not that doe not alter path of duty bishop answered one thing will concede just at present presence in england can do little good have consent therefore to entering religious house remaining there until will hear from person whom have informed have undertaken to let know what be passing there that change have taken place in sentiment towards girl in health may be week month even year when word come must be prepared to go instantly back to do one who may speak in name to may direct thank dear father elder sister said while even angela acquiesced mutely to be ready quite ready to agree know importance of success to church grieve over seeing property pas away into hand of others for part seem to feel presentiment that time will come before long when will be successful three time lately robert edward have come to in sleep have told to hope on for that light will yet shine through darkness have told father that there be much in dream undoubtedly sister church have in age maintained that at time revelation be made to faithful in dream by apparition at vulgar mock now return to hotel will hear from in course of day if a believe must rather be within reach of ministration than go among stranger will speak to superior of establishment here who will be sure gladly receive a inmate again sister knelt before received blessing then returned through quiet street of ravenna to hotel chapter vii society graciously condescends for upwards of year after mr harmer have spoken to papa relative to intended disposition of property matter be not mentioned to one be known only to dr mr ashleigh brother harry sister at end of time made public intention spoke of openly did for reason connected with sophy needham for whom be desirous of obtaining suitable society at time matter gave good deal of annoyance much a be generally liked esteemed there be people found a there always be found upon occasion who made ill natured remark upon good fortune who really seemed by talk to be personally aggrieved at mr harmer kind intention towards have be asked why be so probably must not have replied for a mr harmer have with exception of sister who be amply provided for relation in world be evident that there be one who must be considered a wronged injured by disposition of property however so be although papa received sincere congratulation of old friend think felt good deal ill natured remark came to ear of people for whose opinion must have thought must have cared nothing be rather surprised at for if there be one person more than who have by whole life conduct showed that did not care for money be papa might therefore have well afforded to laugh at such accusation a suppose one however conscious of rectitude like to be spoken ill of even by people whom despises whose opinion about others must treat with contempt be not however of long continuance for a far a be concerned talk wonder soon died away thing settled down into usual state be not so a regarded sophy needham announcement that be to be heiress of half of mr harmer large fortune elicited greatest reprobation disgust among very portion of population who have be most cordial in congratulation a to destination of other half namely among country gentry clergy very numerous powerful body in canterbury professional men respectability of place to think that girl called poor sophy very hard name that young person must be raised up into one of richest heiress of part of country be scandal to morality outrage to public decency elevation be offering premium to immorality among lower order did mr harmer suppose that person of kind however wealthy must be received into society indeed thing be quite out of question be first outburst of opinion among upper two hundred of canterbury by degree finding that mr harmer did not concern greatly with what be said about that showed sign of changing declared intention in deference to popular voice society gave up talking so much about opinion be declared unchangeable a to objectionable nature of conduct think likely that mr harmer who loved peace quiet above thing must have suffered matter to remain a be papa have serious talk with on subject pointed out that sophy be now eighteen year old that mere declaration of mr harmer intention towards have not be of use in procuring friend of own age that for sake ought to again re enter society be growing up knowing nothing of world must anything happen to mr harmer being left entirely unprotected alone must fall easy prey to fortune hunter of worst kind fortune must thus instead of benefit turn out positive evil to mr harmer acknowledged truth of agreed with doctor reluctant a felt to change present studious retired mode of life ought still for sake to make effort to re enter society accordingly next day ordered carriage made long round of visit to old friend in town precinct for although have ceased to visit have still kept up casual acquaintance with have before known indeed have met many of during frequent visit to papa mr harmer call be everywhere received with pleasure frank winning manner seemed at once to place upon familiar footing with of friend with whom have once be favourite apologized for hermit life have so long led said that circumstance have induced to determine to abandon that hoped that wife daughter must show that forgave by calling at harmer place at end of day if well satisfied with reception have personally met with be unable to persuade that have made slightest progress a far a sophy who be real object of visit be concerned cordial invitation have be in instance given to repeat call in case have more than evasive answer be returned in reply to invitation to lady of family on day succeeding visit interchange of call took place at canterbury be quite without precedent great question one have to ask be must go over to harmer place to call upon sophy needham must hardly have be supposed necessary to have asked question upon have three month before decided unanimously in negative then be so easy to say will not do thing before have be asked so very difficult to refuse when be indeed many of canterbury lady be now sorry that have spoken so very decidedly be ready to admit that there be really good deal to be said in favour of calling upon poor girl however fortunately for vaccillating creature happily for propriety strict respectability of town head of society from whose dictum there be appeal sternly said that thing be of course out of question society in general naturally followed suit repressed little sigh of regret agreed that be quite out of question have population of canterbury be differently proportioned to what be answer might have be otherwise have there be young men in place who might have won heiress mother might have rebelled against edict of exclusion for son sake have called upon sophy needham a will explain in proper place there be young men in canterbury therefore motive for one to rebel against constituted authority to outrage propriety by calling at harmer place papa when informed of decision be very indignant angry much more so than have be by recent aspersion on even went so far a to say that if be christian charity must rather fall among heathen exerted to utmost to bring matter about other lady must not call unless lady of precinct did lady of precinct must not however be not papa way to give up anything have once undertaken accordingly one day sat down wrote a follows dear old friend although correspondence have be pretty regular be now three year since met want wife daughter to come down stay week with before after christmas a may suit best diocese can be sure do without for little while know will be glad to see again old place where lived so long must give great pleasure to enjoy society once more at same time tell frankly that be in power to confer great favour benefit upon upon old friend of yours herbert harmer will remember brought up child son left behind that sent to school in fact adopted a own happened when be here in last letter told that intended to leave fortune about l be now naturally anxious to introduce into society in order that may see world make suitable match a otherwise poor girl must at death be nearly certain to be snapped up by worthless fortune hunter now will hardly believe when tell that christian matron of town shake garment at poor child insist that presence must be contamination to pure atmosphere breathe sophy be quiet modest ladylike girl be greatly interested in here can hing be sure that great proportion of lady must be willing enough to call upon be like society in general mere flock of sheep who will only follow where bell wether lead now two three lady who act in capacity to canterbury society consider that poor little lamb will taint whole flock therefore pronounce infect excommunicated dear old friend rely upon kind wife to take off ban pharisee have lain upon if will both go over during stay here to call upon canterbury will be only too glad to do same if bishop lady pronounce visitable who will say nay know old friend in eye of wife sin of poor girl parent will not affect be not to blame why must fault be visited upon know that upon head need say nothing wide view of christian love charity be so well known that word upon subject must be superfluous if will do dear bishop will confer inestimable benefit upon herbert harmer grand daughter will very greatly oblige yours very truly alfred ashleigh turned out a papa have hoped bishop with wife daughter came down to spend week with day after arrived have perfect levee of visitor when room be at fullest mr harmer came in being of course in complete ignorance that visit have be principally brought about for especial benefit bishop greeted warmly for mutually esteemed liked other be very glad mr harmer to hear from friend doctor that have given up hermit mode of life be going out into world again suppose year have be hoarding up treasure house must be perfect scientific museum by time doctor tell that library be nearly perfect of kind must really come over day before leave inspect collection mr harmer expressed gratification visit must afford will certainly come bishop went on will give great pleasure let see to morrow will be engaged in call upon friend in town suppose say day after what do say dear asked raising voice to wife who be sitting on other side of room be going over day after to morrow to see mr harmer museum library will gertude accompany adopted daughter added turning to mr harmer must be growing quite young woman by time certainly dear wife answered must like very much mr harmer face flushed with pleasure wrung bishop hand be easy to see that felt kindness saw true motive of offer to brings wife daughter to harmer place a to remainder of present be simply astounded buzz of conversation ceased throughout room dead silence ensued a for myself must certainly have laughed out loud have not silence be so great that dared not do so at general look of dismay in female face of rather amusement on part of gentleman who must guess have be vainly urging wife to call conversation presently became general again effort be too great to be continued long in very few minute most of present took leave only to be succeeded by fresh caller until past four after hour be strict etiquette of canterbury that visit be permissible on appointed day visit be paid accompanied in carriage papa rode on horseback miss harmers be away a indeed have be case since sophy have left school taken up permanent residence there sophy be pale evidently very nervous in manifest desire to please be easy to see that be much affected deeply grateful for kindness must be mean of removing disadvantage under have laboured have weighed much upon mind however before visit lasted time a library collection of scientific apparatus have to be inspected be over have recovered usual placid demeanour visit have consequence papa have predicted from society unanimously agreed that although certainly be strange very strange step for bishop lady to have taken still a have done so there must be harm in one else doing same in fact that must only be what be right proper lady whom papa have rather irreverently spoken of in letter a bell wether of flock held out to last declared that must not reconcile to conscience to sense of what be due to husband position flock be no longer obedient to lead indeed whispered amongst that bishop lady who be moreover daughter of peeress must know good deal better be proper right than mere canon wife must do consequence be that from moment influence of lady over canterbury society waned much opposition to poor sophy recoiled upon head of who have made in short time one in canterbury neighbourhood called at harmer place general verdict upon sophy be decidedly satisfactory be pronounced quiet self composed ladylike indeed sophy evinced none of nervousness have shown upon occasion of bishop visit to felt owed to people nothing so although perfectly polite courteous be yet composed tranquil of lady who have called quite prepared to be very patronizing kind found such line of conduct completely out of question there be quiet dignity self possession about became much be well bred hostess receiving grandfather guest few girl enacting such part for first time must have played so well for three four month after bishop visit have given signal for society to admit sophy needham within circle intercourse be restricted to morning call of extremely formal nature seemed by mean likely to bring about result to obtain mr harmer have emerged from solitude made up mind therefore to break ice again seemed setting over surface of canterbury society by giving series of picnic open air fete first of took place early in june when be away at school full particular of upon return whole of inhabitant of canterbury neighbourhood whose position rendered eligible be invited together with officer of garrison very necessary addition at canterbury where dancing young men be almost unknown large marquee be erected boarded for dancing quadrille band brought down from london military band engaged for afternoon archery butt be set up bowling green mowed rolled coloured lamp placed in walk to be illuminated after dusk people met at between three four have substantial tea at six magnificent supper at eleven nothing in short taste unlimited purse must do be neglected result be splendid success yet early in evening difference have arisen must have marred pleasure of whole scene have not be for firmness of mr harmer seemed that soon after nine o'clock when began to get dusk of lady of precinct have objected strongly to coloured lamp have just be lighted began to sparkle in tree grass by side of various walk not in for allowed effect to be very pretty a offering inducement pretext for isolated couple to stroll away get entirely beyond maternal supervision two of lady waited upon mr harmer a sort of deputation from others happened that one of be chief of party who have opposed sophy needham introduction into society who have at last come to conclusion that a others be going must be showing want of christian feeling to refuse to do a others did lady recited to mr objection entertained concluded lighted walk will tempt young people to stroll away get quite out of sight a thoughtless officer be sure to persuade to walk there will lead to sort of silly nonsense flirtation dear lady mr harmer said a to result entirely agree with a although be old fellow now do like to see young people enjoying be precisely for very reason that have alleged have have garden lighted up there be nothing to reply to one of lady said rather angrily of course mr harmer can do a like will forbid daughter to walk there dear madam mr harmer said gently can equally of course do a please appears to will appear to one else if issue order that can have very poor opinion of very slight confidence in principle of daughter show in fact that can not trust to stroll for few minute with gentleman have never met before in well lighted walk where there will be dozen of other couple similarly enjoying be in place must hesitate greatly before laid serious imputation upon child deputation retired greatly crestfallen result be that for evening young canterbury girl be for first time in life nearly emancipated from maternal supervision enjoyed evening proportionately flirting with zest greater for being amusement indulged in for first time making mother heart swell mother hair figuratively stand on end at such unheard of going on consequence of lighted walk be that many family of girl who have never hitherto be allowed to dance except in quadrille now found allowed to waltz a pleased not that mother view of extreme impropriety of such dance have undergone change that of two evil chose least thought better to have daughter waltzing under eye than that must be wandering away altogether beyond ken why be that mother be so much stricter than father be certain that be so upon occasion while mother be inwardly bewailing conduct of daughter father although many of clergyman be looking on with beaming face on young people enjoying so thoroughly more than one must have be delighted must such thing have be permitted to have put clerical dignity aside clerical white into pocket to have joined heartily in fun did what must to add to general enjoyment several time of gathered into little knot with two three of wife sung old glee five time by taper light wind whistle cold chough crow splendidly sang too have famous voice among think have ever heard fine old glee better sung than have heard at canterbury sophy of course attracted much attention throughout evening be constantly centre of little group of officer not few of whom must have be very willing to have turned sword into ploughshare for sake to have devoted life to care of possession sophy however by mean appeared to reciprocate feeling in favour be naturally of quiet retiring disposition did not care for dancing therefore under excuse of attending to guest danced very little when did so conversation be so simple straightforward that attempt at flirting upon part of partner be out of question altogether although success of fete be brilliant a officer agreed on way back to barrack that nothing must have be better done still a far a sophy be concerned several of have previously announced intention of going in for heiress have even exchanged bet upon subject affair be failure however consoled that there be plenty of time yet especially a mr harmer have announced at supper that fete must take place day six week upon th of july to invited friend fete completely roused canterbury from usual lethargy a mr harmer return to abode of father have done twenty year before one gave party picnic upon large scale be organized to different place in neighbourhood officer of garrison gave ball at second of mr harmer fete polly be present a came off just at end of holiday need not describe a be in most respect similar to first be just a great success enjoyed very much danced great deal with officer who did not seem to consider being schoolgirl bar to a partner a have expected that must have done when not dancing amused in watching sophy knew that mr harmer wished to marry be interested to see with what sort of man be likely to be taken sophy be so quiet that did not seem to care in least with whom danced to evince slightest preference for one there be however one thing noticed that puzzled good deal at time never spoke to one about a event turned out afterwards bitterly regretted that have not done so noticed early in evening remarkably handsome man standing by watching sophy a danced did not know asked lady next to who be be robert gregory dear son of mr gregory hop factor who died about two year ago be thought to have be wealthy man died worth next to nothing be supposed that son of who be be told one of most idle worthless young men in country squandered away be absent year in london went on terribly there be said that poor old father be silly weak enough to ruin paying worthless fellow debt be surprised to meet such person in respectable society suppose mr harmer knew nothing about only invited a son of man who stood well in town robert gregory be certainly very handsome man of powerful build about twenty eight year old a watched face seemed to not to be pleasant one to have bold defiant expression might be merely effect of what have just heard certainly more looked at man more felt repelled by be still watching sophy a mechanically followed direction of gaze distinctly observed to intense surprise glance two three time in direction not mere ordinary glance might fall upon one positive stolen look rested upon be unmistakably in answer to after must not help watching be not dancing observed once twice in course of evening a passed by where stood exchange word two with not naturally openly speaking a walked past so that one not watching a be doing must have noticed thought a have said good deal about at time did not like to speak to papa upon subject a might seem like prying have there

personal courage go who care little for military duty contenting with going through daily routine reserving best energy for evening men with rather supercilious smile languid air with great flow of small talk compliment men much given to stroking moustache whisker with amazing idea of own power of fascination not indeed that blame for for girl do make such fool of that be wonder must consider

oh agnes ada exclaimed after first burst of mutual congratulation be over oh agnes what lovely diamond cross where did get from never showed before explained to manner in have just received well agnes that mr harmer of yours be trump a percy must say what beautiful thing have idea of value of knew nothing of value of diamond suggested twenty pound twenty pound silly child ada said deserve to have present made if know anything of diamond be worth two hundred mean that ada exclaimed quite frightened at idea of carrying such valuable thing round neck be only laughing at can assure be in earnest agnes be quite worth that be splendid diamond cross look quite blaze of light on neck be down stair by quarter to ten percy be already there paid many nonsensical compliment lady desborough soon came down also expressed highly pleased with appearance fully endorsed what ada have said a to value of cross said that be worth more than ada have put at perhaps nearly twice a much now said when percy have gone out of room to fetch something have forgotten wish to give last piece of advice give to miss ashleigh a much a do to ada for a come out under charge consider a responsible for equally to ada say be very careful let high spirit run away with above become noisy know well what tendency be doe not apply to miss ashleigh for although have good spirit know be not likely to let run away with a ada be of beg dance more than once at most twice with gentleman applies equally to miss ashleigh a heiress to considerable fortune be incumbent on to be very careful with whom dance mean dance frequently there be nothing more damaging to girl than name must be mentioned a seen flirting with most eligible party a at present know who be who can not be too careful here percy return interrupted further advice lady desborough might have be disposed to have tendered in few minute visitor began to arrive first ball began may here mention with reference to lady desborough remark about being heiress clara fairthorne have brought news to school when mr harmer intention with respect to be publicly announced from time be generally known there by nickname of heiress chapter ix old story never enjoyed in life a much a did at ball lady desborough introduced good many of first comer to percy brought up more have engaged for first waltz presently asked for first polka after supper card be soon quite full for whole evening at time must have be sorry for a one doe not like to be obliged to refuse very eligible looking man who may be introduced to one besides prevents dancing second dance with particularly pleasant partner be of course unless one have coolness to turn out one already on list at time certainly have not that night preferred having fresh partner dance be so new to wanted to see everything in way be le engaged in interesting conversation be able to give more attention to what be going on be brilliant scene elite of london society be there very beautiful be many of face very exquisite dress not one of through be more lovely than ada almost one of partner remarked to how very lovely be indeed made quite sensation men be not so much struck with be very distinguished looking very gentlemanly polished in manner very very different from what few young men there be at canterbury have languid air about impressed unpleasantly gave idea that have gone out so much into society that have quite ceased to care for dancing that even conversation be too much labour to be undertaken knew be bad taste certainly preferred a partner officer have met at canterbury to languid young guardsman scion of nobility for myself must not understand how one must help dancing with spirit to inspiring music only drawback to enjoyment be that room be so very full that one be dreadfully squeezed knocked about however on venturing to remark to one of partner that room be extremely full found that knew nothing about for answered dear do think so now why one have be remarking to how pleasant be that room be not crowded found afterwards that partner be right have shown ignorance for at of ball went to afterwards crush be so great that dancing be literally impossibility felt very thankful have be to opera for most of partner on finding be fresh from country asked that question having suppose other topic in common with have danced oftener than once with of doubt conversation must have be more lively a be with few exception be not interesting danced well that part did enjoy most thoroughly most of liked dance with percy for told who one be did really good naturedly while of other partner who have done same have be a sarcastic ill natured about one a if thought that must give pleasure to hear other people run down whereas when be making depreciating remark upon other girl dress manner must not feel quite uncomfortable in wondering what must say about presently percy managed to take down to supper carrying off from last partner in very dexterous manner what be very nice managed to get place next to ada who have be taken down by young lord holmeskirk very pleasant young fellow in guard ada introduced to at once pleaded very hard for dance after supper told that card be full urged so much that said at last must dance with if must manage for have not least idea how be to be done may here say that did so second dance after supper coming up to a be leaning on percy arm after polka with saying in quietest way believe have pleasure of dance miss ashleigh carried off immediately music struck up before real partner whoever be must find not being accustomed to sort of thing not having least idea who be be engaged to felt quite nervous uncomfortable for next dance two expecting that gentleman who came near be on point of reproaching for having broken engagement to indeed to very end of stay in london must never bring in spite of what ada told about one doing so to turn off partner in way without feeling be doing something very wrong dare say conscience must have be blunted in time a be never arrived at point lord holmeskirk turned out most pleasant partner of have be introduced to must chat with with more freedom be so perfectly natural unaffected be very merry little group at supper what ate have not slightest idea percy kept plate constantly filled with exception of strawberry cream did not recognise single thing gave then pulled cracker found motto within of singularly silly unsatisfactory nature at last got up from supper went up to drawing room then gentleman at least of who be fortunate enough to find seat sat down when once did so began to think must never come up again be terribly long time seemed such waste to be sitting still doing nothing with splendid music ready to go on again while be downstairs be introduced to several lady to whose house be going in next few night with lady desborough ada at last gentleman came up again began to dance a if to make up for lost time for dancing be certainly better than before supper partner more agreeable chatty besides of people have left so that there be more room enjoyed accordingly think one else did same for there seemed to to be much more lively conversation flirting going on than before supper have said that only danced once with partner there be one exception be lord bangley captain in guard be introduced to early in evening before card be full begged so earnestly for two dance have excuse for refusing of partner have that evening disliked certainly most be handsome man must not deny be must say for be tall very stiff so stiff that head seemed set too far back with supercilious sneering manner very harsh unpleasant voice insufferable air of arrogance conceit ada told next day that lord bangley have condescended to express to great approval of appearance manner curtsied low when ada told must say be that feeling be by mean reciprocal presently room began to thin in earnest there be great noise outside in interval of music of shouting for carriage prancing of horse then in very short time be gone there remained in great drawing room only lady desborough ada percy what do think of first ball lady desborough asked oh delightful exclaimed simultaneously must have gone on dancing night have gone off very well indeed be perfectly satisfied with everything now let go off to bed will have plenty of time to talk over in morning be however very long before ada went to bed took off ball dress let down hair put foot into slipper then sat by fire in room talking over evening partner impression of everything at last said if go to bed soon ada may a well give up idea of going at be nearly six o'clock ada rose to go into own room have good five hour to sleep yet will not breakfast till twelve good night dear after memorable entree into society be out nearly night until before end of month have have quite enough of party ball be really glad when have quiet evening to ourselves sometimes before going to ball went to opera think after time liked more than party percy always accompanied there did not often go ball be sorry for liked so much a partner must talk with so much more naturally freely about one there than must with other partner for first few night went out lord bangley be very attentive to disliked so much that at last always be engaged when asked to dance although be very slow to see that one really must dislike dancing with so very exalted person a at last be forced to adopt conclusion so gave up asking be great relief to for disagreeable manner quite oppressed ada one morning at breakfast at meal by bye lady desborough never appeared be laughing at about when said sharply must not bear have shown so most unmistakably be glad to hear say so agnes percy said for by time ada have pointed out to extreme absurdity of being constantly together for two month calling other miss ashleigh mr desborough time so percy having obtained willing consent took to calling agnes while think called anything really percy came almost naturally to lip for ada have so often spoken of to by name be very glad to hear say so agnes bangley be hated by brother officer be what must call although earl son downright snob snob because be conceited about advantage of person position snob because be narrow minded empty headed coxcomb well done oh most outspoken brother ada said pray what offence have poor lord bangley given for outburst particular offence ada ca bear fellow curious now ada said rather mischievously never heard say anything against before dislike must be of very recent origin recent not recent percy said dogmatically ca bear after have be three week in london lady desborough asked to stay two month instead of one a have originally intended kindly said that be so very advantageous pleasant for ada having with indeed pressed so much that saw really wished on part be only too glad to prolong stay be quite at home now in society knew nearly one enjoyed conversation now a much more than dancing ada told one morning when have be there about five week be getting perfect flirt quite a bad a be indeed worse because quieter therefore much more dangerous there be lord holmeskirk agnes be quite assiduous in attention to now percy have certainly nothing to say against for be exceedingly nice unaffected fellow holmeskirk broke in percy why be mere boy be officer in guard percy be grant two year younger than sapient self still be more than three year older than agnes mind what say dear have free consent approbation only wish have be magnificent self at whom have deigned to throw handkerchief nonsense ada do wish must get out of way of always talking such ridiculous nonsense percy got up quite crossly went straight out of room ada lifted eye in comic amazement penitence dear to think of having angered royal highness did say anything very dreadful agnes remember being so fierce with since be twelve year old one must think have be crossed in love eh agnes what do say to asked with rather mischievous tone be sure know said composedly oh be sure know well let see if can guess not long ago when lord bangley be in question became furious against now be enraged with for recommending nice little lord holmeskirk put two two together dear four be undoubted result what nonsense be talking ada said colouring greatly brother more think anything about than than stopped for comparison than do about ada suggested think nothing of said ignoring suggestion except a old school fellow friend really be surprised ada that ever must talk such nonsense very well dear ada said tranquilly then will say no more about certainly thought have average amount of perception must see a far into brick wall a neighbour seems can not know now that brother who never cared for music who never went ten time to opera in life only go night do because have acquired sudden taste for music still in case will allow be odd that must sit so much behind chair talk to time music be going on doubt however be criticising performance for benefit a never speaks loud enough for to hear of course must not guess that thing too be to say least of strange percy till came be at work day in room upon sanscrit hindostanee smoking so that in spite of double door have on purpose upper part of house used quite to smell of cigar be always expecting mamma to complain about be then certainly strange that must now find time to idle away morning with to ride out by side of carriage in park of afternoon however dare say be because have finished study of eastern tongue be arrived at perfection in how stupid have be not to have thought of before here ada went on sipping coffee a if quite convinced that have be altogether in error honestly be astonished have seemed so natural having percy always with so pleasant listening to sensible conversation so different from light flow of badinage heard of evening seemed such matter of course to enjoy little quiet well flirtation at opera up to moment can say honestly that have never seriously entered head that percy desborough cared for a however thought over conversation together not so much what have said a way in have said conviction came over that perhaps be right after colour came mounting up into face till felt deep crimson even over forehead ada be watching although did not seem to be doing so guessing from what must see of face have arrived at conclusion that be a said jumped up from chair kneeling down by in old impulsive way put arm round kissed burning cheek dear silly blind agnes know be right percy love be silent little then said be sure of what say ada quite sure agnes have not yet said a much to know just a well a if have have not seen way look at when be not noticing dear child be quite sure about about agnes do care for never thought of so ada never once liked very much indeed never entered mind that cared for in way so never thought of now know doe ada persisted kissing coaxingly ah know yet ada so will get answer from on head oh ada exclaimed suddenly what must lady desborough say oh do hope be not true what must say to percy falling in love with country doctor daughter ada did not look at alarmed dear said laughing think need trouble on score country doctor daughter in general be not heiress of twenty five thousand pound mamma be doubt ambitious expects that will make great match have percy be like other people remained in guard stayed at home dare say must have thought nothing under duke daughter good enough for a be be changed be very angry indeed with about have given up now here be in regiment in year so will go on foreign service be mad enough to intend to go with where be then may be quite sure of one thing agnes mamma be very excellent woman know far too much of human nature not to have weighed in mind accepted possibility of percy falling in love before invited very pretty girl like to spend month in house at time knew percy must be at home on leave have reply ready to argument of ada knew enough of lady desborough to feel be true so kissed told that have talked quite nonsense enough for one morning that be quite time to get ready to go out last three week spent in eaton square be perhaps more happy than previous time think be so pleasant that be did not feel so much at home before have be with percy a might have be with brother rather perhaps with cousin now to feel in heart a now did feel that looked at in quite way made feel different at time little awkward with before if ada left room for thing continued to chat with percy a unconcernedly a if have be present now made excuse to accompany if obliged to remain rattled on about anything came uppermost to prevent conversation by possibility taking serious turn ada told one day percy have asked reason of remaining away so told have one to blame who have made uncomfortable by talking nonsense to about be very much in earnest agnes spoke to last night said be only waiting for opportunity of speaking to wo say 'no will agnes darling asked in coaxing way kissing a used to do at school when wanted to do anything for did not answer felt very very happy to know now for certain that loved still must not answer question except to especially to ada who must be sure promised to tell percy so said at last there be use ada in speaking to now at must never accept other man even if loved with heart until father have seen liked how be dr ashleigh to see percy ada asked with dismayed face of course ada be not for to make arrangement for brother said quietly then after pause seeing blank dismay went on be not for to suggest ada a have promised to come down for week to in six week when season be over on way to lady dashwood have doubt that papa must be very happy to see brother if must be happening to accompany be conscious that although said laughingly be blushing crimson still felt be better so than percy must ask now for quite meant what said about papa consent be by mean sure of own resolution if asked be certain to do if did not somehow put off ada looked full in face saw that must be a wished took very gently in arm kissed other lovingly a if in pledge of nearer relationship be to bear then made one more effort must not say 'yes now agnes refer to papa must be same thing put out of suspense ada said positively must not be same thing at if said 'yes mind have not said that ever will do papa must be sure to give consent because love before be engaged to one must like papa to see like first then when tell approves choice will know really mean what say after have doubt ada told something of what have said for from time ceased to try contrive tete tetes between saw that percy be content to wait till time have indicated so be much more comfortable with leave expired went away three four day before visit ended took care last day two not to be alone with for confess doubted own resolution a much a did however nothing be said till be going then a be saying good bye held hand said then may hope to see again in six week agnes looked so earnestly at that stupid colour must come rushing up yes said a steadily a must papa will be very glad to see if must happen to be accompanying ada for moment longer held hand seemed to that drew little towards a if be going to kiss if ada have not be in room believe must have done so a be lifted hand pressed to lip kissed ada heartily be gone very last ball went to before left circumstance happened gave great pain at time be dancing with lord holmeskirk with whom indeed danced more perhaps than with one else be speaking of leaving on following day remarked almost seriously how much must be missed to replied with laughing disbelief after dance be over took seat on sofa placed in conservatory on landing half way up stair be otherwise unoccupied be quite surrounded by flower so that although one who came up stair must see still one must hear what said when have sat down lord holmeskirk said so think will be missed miss ashleigh now can assure that at least by absence will be keenly felt then without further introduction made honest straightforward offer felt very surprised very very sorry told so have looked upon a very pleasant partner have liked very much assured that have never for moment imagined that have regarded in other light suppose love now miss ashleigh said earnestly there be reason in world why must think must day be quite impossible that may in time get to care for honest young nobleman looked so pleadingly up in face must hardly restrain tear lord holmeskirk said be very sorry indeed for what have said to be grieved must unwittingly have obtained love of true heart such a yours be without being able to requite will be matter of lasting regret to must be cruel kindness to deceive can not encourage even to hope there be many here far more fitted than be to win love whose rank must render far more suitable match for than must be parent can assure began earnestly have consent have already spoken to esteem still more for having done so lord holmeskirk be touched at willingness to receive still consent must have be result rather of affection for than own real approval of saw at once in open face that be so that parent consent have be reluctantly given must not be otherwise said naturally wish to choose one who from rank connection may strengthen position however high that may be now can only say again how sorry be for pain have given that can not be will always remember with esteem regard nothing will give greater pleasure than to hear have made happier choice young man saw that further appeal must be hopeless tear stood in honest grey eye thank very much for kindness miss ashleigh believe will ever regard a friend said rising making movement to staircase offered arm a went up began chatting on indifferent subject a did not wish one to even guess what have taken place a walked round room passed by where countess mother be sitting saw looked at anxiously a son caught eye shook head slightly in answer to question asked must see eye open first in astonishment then soften with variety of emotion sorrow for son disappointment pleasure that be not going to make match must not have thought suitable a passed again stopped spoke few word to for have frequently spoken to before have liked much for be kind motherly sort of woman though be countess said heard be last ball that must quite miss face amongst dancer be fresh happy face dear hope may continue so good bye have best wish shook hand with very kindly affectionately in way seemed to say very great many thing must not well express when got back that evening ada who have be rather silent on way home came into room a usually did for talk said agnes be going down stair to get ice saw lord holmeskirk go into conservatory together be there when came up again be quite sure by look that have made offer well what do mean by well asked for felt little hurt that after what have said to about percy must ever dream of possibility of accepting one else of course mean what did answer keep waiting agnes know how anxious impatient have be to get home to ask after what said to about percy ada said rather coldly must have thought hardly necessary to ask of course refused there dear agnes ada said almost cry on neck be angry with have be so nervous though knew must say 'no

different ball have be to since what engagement have be made during season found too although be subject ada be very chary of speaking of have refused one very good offer that be rather under ban of lady mother displeasure in consequence console however ada said with conclusion that there be even better match to be made than one refused that must have set mind on being duchess for idea of love be necessary for marriage be matter never entered mind ada be little bitter upon subject be sorry to see be likely to have dispute with mother upon point for there be doubt that lady desborough be very worldly woman be quite sure that ada although at time thoughtless fond of admiration must never marry one however high rank to whom have not given heart third morning of visit be up early went for usual little stroll in garden before breakfast have not be there many minute before percy joined when went in together be engaged tell how came about what said how answered there be very little in word thus spoken to interest others although so unutterably sweet to listen to to there be something almost sacred in thought of time far too sacred to be told to one even now eight year after cheek flush eye fill with tear finger quiver at thought of few word of kiss by engagement be sealed oh percy percy must have seen future then perhaps better not better certainly for have at least pleasure left of looking back upon short space of intense happiness memory be own nothing can take away from know how made breakfast that morning be sure must have made sort of blunder ada who at once saw what have happened polly who think guessed chattered away so incessantly be not obliged to take part in conversation ada afterwards told that in first cup of tea gave milk that saw put le than eight piece of sugar into second only hope others be better have serious doubt on subject after breakfast be over papa went into study percy at once followed in there a soon a door closed upon ada came round

to abet in folly will pas very briefly over remaining ten day percy ada stayed with for indeed happy time be more than even now can write about calmly papa mamma consent be warmly given be very much pleased with percy only drawback to papa satisfaction at match be fact of percy being in army thought of going abroad percy indeed offered to leave service must not hear of knew how much be attached to profession have objection to thought of going abroad money with pay allowance from mother must enable to live in luxury in part of world two day after engagement took place received very nice letter from lady desborough saying how pleased be to hear of percy choice success said good many kind complimentary thing to did not even at time attach much importance for knew well that be only fact

quite passed off be able to walk again nearly a firmly freely a have before be very kind to a indeed always be sympathized with so gently feelingly upon great loss have sustained that soothed rather than opened recent wound altogether visit did good be very glad to find so much better than have expected for although papa have told that be getting round wonderfully be likely unless have seizure to live for many year have not hoped to see a well a be did not at mind papa going away for have promised to come up twice week from ramsgate to see must be telegraphed for at moment must anything occur to render step necessary so papa went down to ramsgate for month very great deal of good did fresh air sea bathing soon cured nervousness change of scene variety life of place so different from quiet sleepiness of canterbury gradually softened bitterness of grief while nearly day have letter from percy long loving letter very cheering dear to painting future life together making feel very happy so happy that sometimes blamed for feeling so so soon after dear mother death be tranquil quiet life rapidly recovered health strength again have acquaintance down there for ramsgate be too near to canterbury for people from there to visit besides canterbury be great deal too genteel to patronize so exceedingly vulgar place a ramsgate have chatting acquaintance with several of boatman papa be very fond of sitting of evening at end of pier on great stone post to steamer be fastened talking to fisherman of wreck have known on terrible goodwins of vessel have be lost in trying to make entrance to harbour also struck up great acquaintance with old bathing woman not certainly from use that be to for must never let take by hand plunge under water a saw girl do used to talk to of evening when work be done be hanging up towel to dry be very worthy old body not so frightfully ugly a looked in bathing costume with draggled clothes weather beaten bonnet be quiet respectable looking old woman have be bathing woman there for year year have have doubt saved up snug little sum of money told that have married daughter who lived near london who have very nice cottage down at putney who let part of to lodger hoped that if be ever going near london must patronize told that there be not remotest probability of such thing suggested that might know one who might one day go accordingly to please took address down in pocket book certainly without remotest idea that must ever turn out of slightest use to papa on return from visit to canterbury twice week always brought back fresh topic for conversation be at time fond of talking over day visit told so much about patient that grew quite interested in account of improvement otherwise of who be seriously ill be pleased sorry a report of state be good reverse have always be papa habit partly because felt so much interested in work that patient be constantly in thought partly because when be at home always have soup jelly other strengthening food made for among poorer patient a required such treatment one evening when papa came back looked vexed thoughtful however asked question for knew that if thought right must tell presently what be when have finished dinner strolled out on to esplanade in front of house lit cigar leant on rail looked down upon shipping in harbour in gathering twilight at light on goodwin be a yet just visible for time papa did not speak at last took cigar out of mouth said be vexed agnes rather troubled will tell why be discreet little woman now so can trust with what have seen again paused took two three quick puff at cigar a if in angry thought of how must begin then went on there life near canterbury agnes lazy bad dissolute man named robert gregory suppose have noticed although may have possibly met casually be a have said bad man bear character of worst description eight ten year since when be very young man went up to london by extravagance bad habit there ruined old man father brought prenaturely to grave man agnes be good looking yet with bad face be rather coarse perhaps more so than be ten year since when first saw for sort of face when once begin to go off loses beauty rapidly still allow much a object to man that be handsome be just sort of face likely to attract young girl who be new to world face apparently frank good natured yet with something imperious even defiant about very taking to young who can not help feeling flattered by seeing that man who look a if neither cared for feared other living thing must yet bow to that fierce eye must soften loud voice become gentle when address altogether dangerous man for young girl to know very dangerous one for to love to man like accustomed from habit profession to study character be peculiarly repulsive face to be bad man be not only blackguard handsome blackguard be clever determined one face be marked with line of profligacy drunkenness there be passionate dangerous flash about eye have too seen world although only bad side of can when chooses lay aside roughness rampant blackguardism assume tolerably gentlemanly quiet demeanour must very well pas muster with inexperienced girl in short dear if be asked to select man of others of with whom be acquainted whom must least rather meet in society where daughter young girl might see must unhesitatingly say robert gregory fortunately for society here man by well known drunken bad character have placed beyond pale so can do great harm be only last time be in canterbury that heard acknowledge heard with great pleasure that robert gregory be so deeply in debt that writ be out against that unless went away must in short time be consigned to debtor prison so that canterbury at rate for time might hope to be free of well dear daresay be wondering what long story about person of whom know nothing can be going to end in will see that be very much to point to day be rather earlier than usual in visit to mr harmer be driving fast a turned corner of road where plantation in mr harmer ground begin saw man getting over hedge into road probably noise be making breaking through twig together with turn of road prevented seeing hearing gig until be fairly over for a jumped into road looked round be not twenty yard off must hear swear deep oath a pulled hat down over eye turned back to a drove past to prevent seeing face be too late for have recognized robert gregory of course said nothing a drove up to house looking over ground saw sophy needham coming up through tree from very direction from have seen come out be at distance off be almost at door so must not have stopped to speak to without being noticed even have wished did not come into room while be there so that have opportunity of questioning about even have made up mind to do so indeed be so delicate matter must not have spoken to without previous reflection altogether affair have very curious ugly look must hardly be mere coincidence that must be getting over hedge from plantation where must have possible reason for going except to see at very time of coming away from that part of ground look very like secret meeting how such thing must have be brought about be more than can imagine if be so be dreadful business be silent for time then said do know papa remember meeting man speak of at fete at mr harmer last year now mention agnes recollect that be there wondered at time at being invited supposed mr harmer have known father a respectable man have asked son knowing nothing of character disrepute in be held did not notice much did see dance with sophy have done so must have warned mr harmer of real character did not dance with papa said rather timidly for be frightened at thought of what dreadful mischief have resulted might have be averted have spoken of matter at time did not dance with have sort of secret understanding with at least thought so then told have observed that evening at fete must have mentioned at time papa for perplexed good deal went back to school next day never thought of from day to do know agnes papa said throwing away cigar taking three four turn up down in extreme perplexity be very serious be quite frightened to think of what on earth be to be done papa took off hat rubbed hair back from forehead how very unfortunate that did not speak of what noticed at time be not blaming going off to school a say of course put out of head besides did not know man a do must not guess what terrible result might be growing out of what saw must not a mere girl tell how bad be for young woman to have secret understanding of sort with man how fatal when with man a robert gregory have known at time might have done something to put stop to must in case have be delicate matter to have interfered in merely on ground of what noticed sophy must of course have disputed still might have warned mr harmer against allowing such man to enter door must have spoken when sophy be present said how bad character be so a to have opened eye to real nature of man might have done good girl be very slow to believe anything against man love still must have be something have there be opportunity must have related story about knew to be true must have convinced that be thorough blackguard might have be quite ineffectual still might possibly have done good now really agnes said stopping short know what to do be dreadful affair there distress child for be cry now matter may not be a bad a fancy although confess that see possible interpretation can put affair in better light only question be what be to be done to begin with be see placed in peculiarly delicate position in respect to sophy in case of scandal being discovered through mean mr harmer altering will in consequence might benefit from must place conduct motive for interfering in very false unpleasant light in next place in mr harmer present state of health agitation disclosure must produce must not improbably indeed must be very likely to bring on paralytic fit cost life only thing can at present think of be to appeal to sophy fear must hardly be successful a secret understanding between must have gone on for more than year to knowledge dare not even think in what relation may now stand to other still must be tried must fail a feel be quite certain to do appeal must be made to may be bought off of course with be mere question of time if wait till mr harmer death may not occur for year yet sophy be sure to be wealthy heiress if marries before mr harmer will infallibly alter will must no doubt still leave something for love too much to leave beggar even in moment of anger so see be quite matter of calculation robert gregory have waited until now must be getting desperate writ of spoke may induce to come to sudden decision one can say what be altogether very bad business difficult matter for one far more for to meddle in however something must be done much be certain to day be wednesday have not intended to go into canterbury again till saturday now will go on friday so will have to morrow to talk over what be best thing to be done how be to set about be getting late agnes be time to be going in will never forget evening a turned strolled along edge of cliff towards home thought have never seen beautiful night tide be high sea be very calm hardly moved under warm autumnal breeze broke on beach far below foot with gentle plash out at sea light on goodwin shone clear bright while far away to right looking like star near horizon must plainly see deal light below lay harbour with dark shipping bright lamp reflected in still water within sometimes from sea came up faint snatch of song from party in boat enjoying lovely evening above be most beautiful of sky be very deep blue think ever saw so many star a be visible that lovely september night heaven seemed spangled with shone out clear bright with none of restless unquiet twinkle usually have still tranquil seeming a never do seem except on such night a to hang suspended from deep blue above moon be up be only thin crescent be lovely in without outshining glory of star be glorious night absorbed a be with own thought troubled by what have occurred must not help feeling soothed elevated by wondrous beauty of scene looked upon have papa known have passed at interview between sophy needham robert gregory must not have ridden out to ramsgate with news must have acted upon there then perhaps must never have written story if have done so must have be very different to what be long afterwards learnt history of interview of many others have gone before so will again have pleasure of dropping that first personal pronoun of be so tired of relating story a be told to chapter xii explosion there be boy so naturally passionate vicious in whose disposition evil so strongly predominates over good that be obliged to own under conceivable course of training must have turned out otherwise than bad fault might have be checked by early firmness vice eradicated by judicious kindness care yet nothing must ever have altered radical nature nothing must ever have made fair straight tree out of crooked distorted sapling character be that of robert gregory in case there be countervailing force of judicious kindness of proper severity to check strong tendency to evil in disposition mother have died when be infant father who have married late in life who have other child indulged whim neither thwarted in desire punished for fault so grew up idle passionate turbulent boy pursuing own way laughing to scorn entreaty prayer of weak father a time went on character developed chose companion from wildest least reputable youth of neighbourhood soon became even wilder le reputable than worst of at length led life that father be only too glad when expressed desire to go up to london in hope that there with other companion habit might yet retrieve robert gregory be not all bad have good point with other training might have turned out if not good man at rate not character dr ashleigh have described be good natured even generous by fit start certainly still enough so to make who knew a boy before have got entirely beyond control regret that father by weakness injudicious kindness be allowing to grow up curse to nuisance to whole neighbourhood hope father may have entertained of reformation from influence of life in london be destined to be very shortly extinguished wrote at first flaming account of grand friend be making lamenting expensive way of living begging more money to enable to do a did for month for year letter came regularly always demanding money sometimes very large sum of letter be accompanied by plausible tale that wished to oblige great friend through whom shortly expected to obtain lucrative appointment at other time told truth various loss on turf heavy gambling debt must said be paid honour must be irretrievably lost old man patiently answered constant demand upon paid without complaint large sum required truly although weakly loved reprobate son of knew that remonstrance must now avail feared so to alienate liking son still felt for by remonstrance must irritate without reforming so continued to pay pay boy can have once said to a well now a at death there will be enough to last time there hardly be after robert have be six year in london during have only paid three four flying visit to native place received letter from father asking to let know total amount of debt a must rather settle whole at once set clear than be continually asked for money robert consequently sent list even have grace enough left to be ashamed of however enormous amount be paid without word week afterwards letter came from father saying that in six year have spent no le than l now there only remained house in old man lived small farm yielded bare l year that must not touch that not one single penny must farther advance son that if chose to come down live with that must meet with hearty welcome with not one word of reproach for past seeing other course open to robert gregory came back sulkily enough to old house where a have before be said old man did not live many month long a be list of debt robert have sent up from london have by mean comprised whole of at father death therefore be obliged to mortgage farm to nearly full value to satisfy most pressing of creditor then for first time in life robert gregory asked how be to live be by mean easy question to answer indeed think matter over a must must imagine mode by even have be inclined to work be not must have earned living be while be vainly week after week endeavouring to solve problem that intention of mr harmer to make sophy needham heiress be made public robert gregory hailed news a direct answer to question must marry heiress did not jump at conclusion in haste inquired closely concerning habit of family at harmer place of whom previously have known nothing except by name found that life have be hitherto one of seclusion owing to ascetic life of miss harmers studious one of brother heard of sophy needham birth origin heard too that society refused to visit at last said to confidently firmly will marry having arrived at determination robert gregory at once proceeded to act upon soon have whole scheme arranged to satisfaction felt that matter be one required time accordingly sold farm for two three hundred pound beyond amount for be mortgaged on sum calculated to be able to live until be able to marry sophy done putting on shooting suit day after day concealed in ground at distance from house at spot from must see when sophy strolled out must watch direction took one day perceived that course be following in ramble must lead close to boundary of property making circuit took position on other side of hedge therefore off harmer estate when sophy came along must see that be immediately opposite separated only by hedge discharged barrel of gun sophy naturally uttered exclamation of surprise alarm be needed a if astonished at finding lady so close to crossed hedge lifting hat apologized deeply for alarm have given trusted that shock have not be serious in fact made so good use of time that managed to detain in conversation for quarter of hour robert gregory have already be said be handsome man with good figure conversation manner might not have passed muster in critical society still have seen enough of world to be able to assume air of gentleman sufficiently well to deceive girl who have hardly ever conversed with young man before in life address to be straightforward outspoken yet with something deferential about to sophy be quite unaccustomed gratified exceedingly attempt of robert gregory be well timed sophy knew that mr harmer have proclaimed heiress felt felt keenly that society refused to call upon recognise be naturally sensitive shy girl accident of birth have be constant pain sorrow to be therefore in exactly frame of mind to receive with greedy pleasure expression of robert gregory deference distantly expressed admiration noted bad expression in handsome face smiled upon detected flaw in fine figure bent little a spoke to only saw one who treated whom world scorned repelled with respectful deference admiration from moment heart went out freely fully towards a be leaving robert gregory mentioned that lived on other side of canterbury be out for day shooting on neighbouring estate said that on day week must again be there asked if frequently walked in direction urged that must feel really anxious to know if have suffered from effect of sudden alarm have given that hoped must be kind enough to let know how be sophy coloured paused then said that frequently walked in direction that if happened to see a went past must of course be happy to assure that be not in least upset by little start that have have so parted robert gregory felt that a far a be concerned game be won again again met before very long spoke of love to sophy whose life have be hitherto joyless one gave heart without concealment found that for first time have discovered happiness that happiness soon have alloy of trouble when christmas came bishop wife called society in general followed example sophy naturally wondered asked robert why did not do same be prepared for question knew must come sooner later answer have long be determined upon at once said that threw entirely on mercy even if be signal for dismissal from side for ever must tell truth told that owing to want of control a boy have be when very young man spendthrift wild that have dissipated fortune in folly amusement that christian propriety of canterbury have taken upon to be greatly scandalized thereby that although have long since given up former course have returned lived happily quietly with old father although father have never complained to believed to one of previous folly yet society in general have taken upon to refuse assent to welcome of prodigal have indeed desired to go into far country be fed upon husk sophy instead of being shocked at clung to a might have be expected closer well affected scorn bitterness with spoke of christian charity of society struck a have intended must sympathetic chord in own breast for have not too be declared under ban of society for fault sin of own be true society have now condescended to visit why be better more honourably born than before have conduct in way softened towards not bit bishop have said that might be visited so world have graciously extended hand received into fold although sophy accepted offered hand hated giver of although arrayed face with placid smile a entered into society only covered sense of bitter outrage of indignant contempt nursing a did feeling like be with absolute sense of pleasure that found that lover like herself be deemed outcast to be one more new tie between when robert have finished confession own rage wrong against society broke out in stream of bitter passionate word robert gregory found there be far more in ordinarily tranquil quiet woman before than have ever given credit for however present frame of mind be most favourable for plan therefore took good care to keep alive resentment against world in order to bind more closely to be soon after that fete at harmer place be given robert gregory managed to obtain invitation arranged with sophy that must not dance with alleging truth that if did so society must be sure to poison mr harmer mind against render consent to marriage out of question sophy be content to follow guidance in thing to see everything with eye real difficulty of robert gregory course be only yet beginning sophy be indeed won be sophy money not herself that cared for now sophy money at present depended upon mr harmer not upon robert feared that in event of runaway match mr harmer must very materially alter will still on other hand grandfather be extremely fond of have one else to leave money to might in time reinstate in favour at last asked sophy if thought mr harmer must after time forgive if made runaway match with for have hope of ever obtaining consent beforehand sophy be very loath to answer question be quite ready to marry robert shrank from thought of paining old man who have be so kind to however a robert again again returned to point at last came to discus a calmly a did yes thought mr harmer must be reconciled to believed must miss so much that must be sure to forgive in short time be not in nature to bear malice to one yes must soon come round indeed be certain that if robert must make known to that mr harmer must not care for what other people said must judge for must esteem like a did course sophy pressed very much upon lover with many loving entreaty tear for really loved mr harmer truly shrank from grieving entreaty however robert always gently decidedly put aside said that mr harmer must be certain to believe edict of society against must decline to grant opportunity of justifying must refuse to allow to enter house besides must be just a angry at discovering secret understanding existed between a must be at marriage must be certain to forbid intercourse between perhaps even insert condition in will forbidding to marry under pain of forfeiture of fortune for robert made secret from sophy that money must be of greatest use to not a put that cared for money for own sake that if be rich must spend life abroad where scoff sneer of society must reach where must never be disturbed by sarcasm whisper of world while in turn must be able to show society how heartily despised how well must do without sophy in present state of mind thought very grand heroic really believed that lover spoke in noble disinterested manner a be perfectly conscious of advantage of wealth quite agreed that if possible fortune must not be sacrificed robert then at last succeeded in persuading that runaway match be only alternative a really believed that must be very soon forgiven by mr harmer be at length arranged to take place shortly be in spring of year secret acquaintance have then continued eighteen month date be fixed for elopement when paralytic stroke mr harmer have put stop to plan for two reason pressed a again be for money for creditor who have be only partially paid before be now becoming clamorous robert gregory felt that with mr harmer at point of death must be perfect madness to run risk of sophy being disinherited when few week might leave undisputed owner of l so although sorely harassed for money be content to wait other reason be that sophy be full of remorse at thought that have be at point of deserting benefactor met robert now very seldom devoted to mr harmer a however week ran on slowly surely recovered health became former self constant attendance on be no longer needed so fell back to old habit meeting in plantation became more frequent influence resumed power over robert gregory have discernment enough to suit behaviour to word when old man be at worst be full of tender commiseration for when began to recover pretended warm interest in health although inwardly be filled with rage chagrin at convalescence at length own affair arrived at crisis that be in momentary fear of arrest felt once in prison union with sophy must be postponed at rate till after mr harmer death now again appeared to be distant event therefore once more began to persuade sophy to elope with have far more difficult task than before old argument be brought forward be time before must succeed gradually however old habit of listening to opinion prevailed allowed to be persuaded that grandfather might now live for many year that must for short time dispense with service that a have be so useful to during illness a must be more attached to than ever be quite certain that must not for long remain proof to entreaty for forgiveness so at last not without many tear much bitter reproach sophy consented to elopement consented at very interview coming from dr ashleigh surprised robert gregory who elated by success be making way off without observing usual care precaution at breakfast on following morning mr harmer remarked that sophy looked pale ill answered that head ached sadly that have doubt stroll in ground must do good after breakfast accordingly went out after wandering for time carelessly in sight of house made

fitted up a small oratory be surprised at loud talking confusion in house in short time own maid knocked at door then came in with face full of excitement to say that miss sophy have not slept in bed that have searched whole house found sign of doe brother know miss harmer asked after hearing whole story very quietly to end ca say ma'be there be letter on miss sophy table mary took into mr harmer in library when first found have not come out since miss harmer with usual deliberate walk went down stair then into library mr harmer be sitting at table with back to door did not turn round at approach went up beside on table lay open letter one from sophy in hand be pen before sheet of paper on have written dearest sophy come back forgive handwriting be strangely indistinct last word word forgive be large sprawling like schoolboy writing then pen stopped have stopped for ever herbert harmer be dead chapter xiii bad business mr harmer be dead sophy needham be missing such be news groom riding into canterbury for doctor brought such be telegram friend at once sent down to at ramsgate mr harmer dead sophy needham missing flashed like wildfire through canterbury quiet old town be again shaken out of lethargy by intelligence mr harmer during lifetime have be standing topic of conversation have on several occasion quite roused from even tenor of way last sensation be greater more astounding than of predecessor canterbury enjoyed with proportionate gusto sophy needham eloped with notorious reprobate robert gregory for miss harmer by invective on reading letter at once have told round with whom sophy have fled poor mr harmer gone off in fit in consequence be indeed terrible affair be not mended in telling by time tale have made round have swollen to extraordinary proportion fresh addition be made by mouth through passed until at last be extremely difficult to find out what truth of matter be from simple report that sophy needham have eloped with robert gregory that have killed poor mr harmer transition be easy to have killed poor mr harmer detail of supposed murder grew till became tragedy of most coldblooded description groom statement that miss harmer be in dreadful state about soon lost last two word grew into miss harmer be also attacked be lying in dreadful state altogether although robert gregory sophy be undoubtedly much to blame have acted very wrongly believe must hardly have recognised doings in two fiend in human shape whose deed be commented upon in canterbury afternoon next day real truth of story became known there be feeling of disappointment that thing be not a bad a have be reported even then opinion in respect to sophy lover be hardly modified give dog bad name may a well hang couple have be accused of murder violence although charge be now disproved yet be universally agreed that crime might in probability must have be perpetrated have fugitive be detected at time of flight sophy conduct be so atrocious ingratitude to mr harmer so base that there be question that nature so depraved must hesitate at nothing lady of canterbury society be more inclined to insist upon a justified view have originally entertained of impropriety of calling upon young person at harmer place doubt now affirmed have always experienced of possibility of such person ever turning out otherwise than badly felt therefore that have attained great triumph over husband who have be on whole inclined to differ from opinion have always said predicted something of kind from time when have heard of mr harmer intention towards really appeared to to be almost judgment upon for infatuation for venturing to fly in face of public feeling of morality propriety in way have done of husband indeed even now ventured to offer excuse for sophy to point out that good deal might be urged in behalf lonely position ignorance of world of character of man have gone off with still more temptation to must be exposed by such unprincipled blackguard a robert gregory suggestion be contemptuously put aside bad character of man in place of being palliation be aggravation of offence be satisfactorily proved by argumentum ad hominem in woman so delight know very well dear that if own daughter have gone off with such man must have considered very much worse business have be far more angry about than if have run away with gentleman of position character so how can now talk such nonsense a to say that man bad character be palliation of fault have often wondered why be that woman be so much more severe upon offender of own sex than men be be that men know so much more of life human nature than do be that know how comparatively few woman ever be seriously thus tempted during life how hard be to withstand great trial of kind be because know too very few of who be so loud so bitter in contempt for who fall must if placed under same circumstance exposed to same temptation have acted precisely in same way think must be that when hear woman so loud bitter in denunciation when see men look grieved sorry say nothing can not help thinking sometimes that must be better if judged not so harshly scornfully of who have fallen under temptation to through god mercy have never be exposed of course next to startling event have taken place great question upon interest of canterbury be fixed be whether mr harmer have destroyed will not before died be point upon one must enlighten awaited with intense interest day of funeral after must of course be known about to at ramsgate news came with terrible shock papa who have settled to have gone over on day have from reason other postponed to next consequently be with when boy arrived from station with telegram at about twelve o'clock happened to be wet day so contrary to usual habit be indoors when boy came up with note papa signed receipt lad left before opened when did so glanced at content dropped on table with almost groan what be papa asked dreadfully alarmed may read papa motioned assent heart almost stood still a read terrible tidings mr harmer be dead sophy needham be missing be dreadful shock yet have talked thought so much last two day of sophy robert gregory of consequence discovery of connection might have upon mr harmer that must be hardly said to come upon a surprise for time be too shocked to speak at at last said poor mr harmer how dreadful rather poor sophy papa said unfortunate misguided girl how bitterly will repent what life long remorse hers will be have sacrificed happiness of own life by joining to of robert gregory have caused benefactor death be folly whatever terrible fault of sophy conduct now undoubtedly loved dearly while papa be speaking telegram arrived time from miss harmer for former one be sent by friend who have heard news knowing interest in have at once forwarded to while groom who brought in be searching for doctor to go over at once miss harmer message be only please come at once brother be dead on receipt of consulted timetable found train must start in hour in few minute papa started leaving to cry over news have heard to cry a much for sophy a for mr harmer for from what papa said be indeed to be pitied to look forward anxiously to return with full particular of terrible event will tell story of visit to harmer place result a told to may here mention that in future in narrative of mine will always drop first person when be telling of event at be not myself present will relate in order in happened not when be told to be not in case till year after when dr ashleigh arrived at harmer place be shown at once into drawing room where in few minute be joined by miss harmer a nothing have be said of personal appearance of miss harmer from time when brother met twenty one year before date a will in future play far more important part in narrative than have hitherto done be proper to say what be like at period miss harmer when brother left england in year boy of sixteen be aged respectively twenty twenty one be consequently at time of death in year seventy three seventy four at time when be last described be extremely similar in appearance indeed might almost have be mistaken one for other there be now great marked difference between younger sister looked elder of two by at least ten year ascetic life severe self repressive discipline to have subjected seemed to have worn out one sister while have hardened other hardened till impassive face have stony petrified appearance of two have perhaps be originally woman of stronger passion more determined will yet more vigorous constitution have enabled to support lonely hard loveless life to come through harder sterner than before while weaker sister be fast succumbing to long weary struggle angela bended head be more bowed now than of yore look more mild gentle light of peace be to fast approaching when watching penance tear must be over seemed to shine already on face to soften hard unhappy outline cecilia be more upright than before comparatively cheerful life have led at brother house for nearly twenty year have to certain extent worn off look habit of repression humility have gained from early residence in convent afterwards with stern elder brother have too for last twenty year be working with purpose vague one indeed seemingly hopeless one yet to holy purpose worthy of dedicating life to attain namely hope that brother might yet return to old faith that if died before might leave property so that in of case roman church might reap rich harvest elder brother have intended for hope have be to great extent defeated by declared intention of herbert harmer yet clung desperately to bishop of ravenna have cheered time with letter counsel even have almost given up hope of ever winning rich property for church cecilia never despaired when have hurried back again on news of mr harmer first paralytic seizure be with strong hope conviction that must yet on deathbed alter will abjure error of faith have adopted be received forgiven by mother church however event have not turned out a have hoped herbert harmer have died member of new faith estate be certainly not willed to sister cecilia while endured true sense of sorrow for brother loss yet mingled with deep feeling of disappointment rage stern determination that labour of life must not be frustrated doctor ashleigh when entered room saw at once that sister be much agitated yet in different way have evidently be cry miss harmer seemed endeavouring to keep down grief by fierce angry determination while angela sorrow be mingled with strange timid anxious manner dr ashleigh must not understand received message dr ashleigh be aware of terrible event have taken place here be miss harmer be indeed shocked to hear have heard that brother be murdered murdered dr ashleigh said aghast for have heard of floating rumour a passed through town have quite disbelieved yes dr ashleigh brother be murdered killed by conduct of wretched ungrateful woman murdered a much a if have stabbed to heart really miss harmer doctor said alarmed for moment into believing that old friend have met end by foul play sophy conduct be inexcusable wish to enter into defence of still can hardly be termed murderess can see distinction dr ashleigh miss harmer said a spoke tall figure seemed to gain additional height eye flashed colour rose angrily brother dr ashleigh be on fair way to perfect recovery told so that only sudden shock must be likely to throw back again that attack must probably be fatal that shock wretched girl deliberately knowingly gave say be a wilfully murderess of man who have picked from kennel where be born a if have given poison pray that sin may be punished by divine law if can not be by human pray that man for whom have murdered brother may turn out constant retribution curse to may never know happiness again may child if bear cause misery have brought on may hold miss harmer dr ashleigh said sternly stepping forward laying hand impressively on excited woman arm forbear blessing curse proceed from god alone at present grief at sad affair urge to say thing in calmer moment must be be sure first to regret unhappy girl have assuredly grievously erred grievous have be consequence will undoubtedly have to expiate by life long sorrow repentance bitterest enemy need wish worse punishment than own thought husband have chosen need not discus question dr ashleigh miss harmer said angrily nothing will ever alter feeling towards wretched girl nothing can ever soften horror loathing feel towards nothing will ever induce to see face again may be beyond human law in sight be murderess dr ashleigh saw that in miss harmer present state of nervous excited feeling argument must urge must be only vain must indeed tend to heighten anger therefore remained silent angela harmer have not yet spoken be evident that a far a milder nature must go sympathized with sister anger yet sorrow be with predominant have seated in large arm chair by fire on entering most of time sat with face hidden in hand doctor must see tear trickle through withered finger sometimes however when sister be speaking looked up with anxious deprecating glance cecilia heeded not when have done speaking walked up down room with hand tightly clenched eye flashing with anger even through tear of sorrow rolled unheeded down cheek whole form so inspired by emotion that dr ashleigh must hardly believe to be quiet self contained woman have known so long at last became more calm stopped before said dr ashleigh be brother greatest friend may ask to see to arrangement connected with funeral must wish to be buried in such state a be becoming to last of old race ala that can not be laid where fore father have be will see to will miss harmer willingly know whether have particular wish a to where must be laid have heard express preference for village churchyard here know whether have mentioned wish in will know nothing of will miss harmer said positively dr ashleigh noticed sister cast one of frightened glance towards have before perceived know nothing of will repeated steadily if expressed preference for sturry let be so now dr ashleigh here voice softened know that have more to say will wish of course to go up to see poor brother will see hope to morrow next day so saying miss harmer took leave of dr ashleigh retired to own room while took well known way to old friend bed room a went up stair met mary girl who have be sophy needham maid coming down eye be red with cry curtsied to doctor a passed for loved have ever kind word for met be sad affair mary said dreadful sir girl answered will please to tell have become of miss sophy be so anxious to know real truth be afraid have eloped with mr

good master sir a ever lived never angry put out forgived miss sophy with dying breath girl began to cry again how do know forgave miss sophy dr ashleigh asked stopping for be just continuing way up stair how do know forgave miss sophy way sir when miss harmer went into room went stood at door to listen for wanted to hear what have become of poor miss sophy went up to table leant over gave cry ran in be lifting up on table before be letter have just begun to write be only five six word saw began bey dearest sophy ' did not read anything else last two word be ' forgive be writ very large indeed must not help seeing sir a helped to lift up after have be carried up stair went into library to get that letter sir for knew must be great comfort to poor miss sophy when got there be gone asked servant none of have seen so suppose one of miss harmer have taken care of be very glad told mary very glad will indeed be great comfort to poor young mistress so saying doctor went into dead man room mr harmer lay on bed warm light of afternoon sun streamed bright full upon face be tranquil peaceful a in life lip be parted in calm smile smile a of peace forgiveness felt a died doctor looked into old friend face tear welled up into eye died a lived said to forgiving a also must be forgiven dear old friend have spent many happy hour together yet dying a died how can grieve for doctor stood for time sadly musing by bed side then turning softly away be soon on way back to canterbury where gave necessary order then returned to ramsgate chapter xiv missing mr harmer died on friday morning be arranged that funeral must take place on day week on day preceding dr ashleigh left ramsgate early went direct to own house to see several patient who be to call upon there prior to going out on round most of expected have called be sitting alone in library when door opened servant announced mr gregory dr ashleigh rose from seat with cold haughty look on face such a have not for many year be seen upon robert gregory face wore mingled air of anxiety triumph slightly veiled under expression of gravity decorum have assumed a suitable to occasion be evidently much embarrassed how to begin extremely repellant hostile expression of dr ashleigh face did not assist in difficulty may ask doctor said to what owe visit have called dr ashleigh robert gregory began in voice to in vain attempted to give usual loud careless tone have called from wife to ask to whom alone must apply at present time to give intelligence respecting death of grandfather if unfortunate girl who have become wife will call upon will give information assistance in power with will hold communication whatever robert gregory bit lip angrily eye flashed be man little accustomed to be thwarted however a felt that outburst of anger must only injure cause must do good after momentary fierce struggle with went on quietly be naturally indignant with dr ashleigh know that after sad consequence have ensued can not be otherwise be aware that be useless making excuse protestation know that only way in can ever justify course have taken will be by making sophy happy by proving that love confidence in be not so greatly misplaced that after be not so utter scamp a world give credit for undoubtedly man have carefully thought over beforehand what intended to say yet spoke earnestly for really meant what said dr ashleigh shrewd observer of men saw that did so face rather softened in expression robert gregory observed change went on must never have come on errand must have done so truth be friend telegraphed news to message reached only on monday morning a be returning leisurely from north sophy be nearly out of mind doctor called in to see fear that will have attack of brain fever must not have left cry be unceasing to know detail of death whether said word of forgiveness to came down by morning train return by one o'clock to london dr ashleigh be softened now saw by man anxious face changed voice that be truly in earnest that although have unquestionably wooed married sophy for money yet that did really care for doctor thought that chance of happiness be after better than have imagined be sorry to hear what say about wife said in quite different tone to have previously adopted although can not say be surprised knowledge that news of flight have caused mr harmer death must of necessity be terrible grief sorrow to on head however truly rejoice that can give consolation alleviate remorse mr harmer forgave letter be taken in to be found dead with before sheet of paper on have begun letter to last word ever wrote be ' forgive tell from robert gregory face lit up with pleasure time emotion be not purely of selfish kind be glad very glad for sophy sake to hear that mr harmer have forgiven before died indeed even for own sake felt news to be relief hardened a be must not have felt easy with knowledge that good old man have died invoking curse upon with last breath although for reason received news with pleasure be a nothing to satisfaction felt at account have be given of mr harmer death for be quite evident from that have died leaving will unaltered have died few minute after finding sophy be gone with unfinished letter of forgiveness before have probably never even risen from chair have certainly taken step towards altering cancelling will gratified a felt however speedily repressed show of feeling for felt that dr ashleigh be watching knew that good will countenance must be of great service at time besides for sophy sake wished to stand well with for sophy knew esteemed loved dr ashleigh more than other man now mr harmer be dead therefore after minute silence said with air of frankness be indeed glad to hear what tell dr ashleigh will be immense relief to poor sophy even to for be not pleasant to lie under curse of dead man besides must be idle of to pretend be not very gratified to hear that mr harmer took step towards altering will a man of world will naturally suppose sophy wealth be great inducement to when first sought although trust to prove to to have now learnt to love truly for herself be still of course very glad to hear that property be not forfeited be now time must return to train hope that news may have good effect upon sophy health will be down again day after to morrow not to attend funeral to be present at reading of will will suppose take place afterwards will dr ashleigh said miss harmer wrote to solicitor in london yesterday informing of brother death begging to be down at funeral take place at two o'clock now mr gregory will say to sophy that grandfather forgave freely at once that be not for whom have not injured to judge more severely than have done will tell from that in daughter will find friend glad to welcome back to forget past for mr gregory must be folly to say that strong prejudice doe not exist best know whether justly not however day be past be now according a treat sophy that will be received at rate by make happy try dry tear consequence of love for have caused to flow will find that will be glad to know a sophy husband so saying dr ashleigh held out hand to man before robert gregory a grasped experienced feeling of real gratification knew that be truly good man that course towards sophy be in way altered by fact of being heiress because have be forgiven by old friend mr harmer for sake of many year of affectionate intercourse have have with be gratified too by what doctor have said respecting for countenance friendship of good man can be appreciated even by worst character so robert gregory took leave of dr ashleigh returned to town with softened although exultant heart doctor then went over to harmer place saw sister passed most of time in own room engaged in earnest prayer for benefit of brother soul once when doctor have be there spoke to in glowing term of power church possessed to forgive sin even greatest while thus spoke eye lit up with strange passionate fervour of religious zeal fierce burning zeal have for so many century made men equally ready to martyrize others to die martyr that zeal have led to give up worldly good live life of wandering beggar others to allow scruple to interfere with deed can enrich benefit church to belong to remark dr ashleigh returned answer be at time indisposed to enter into religious argument with woman in exalted state of mind in miss harmer be must have be worse than useless on occasion however found in calmer state mentioned to that have seen robert gregory that spoke of coming up on part of wife after funeral for minute so be silent then miss harmer said with stern vehemence let come presume be right never again while live will murderer of brother darken door doctor half smiled at idle threat while angela harmer glanced up at sister from under drooping eyelid must perhaps rather say miss harmer corrected a long a be in house if enter leave harmer place will never hold together for one day sister of herbert harmer murderer doctor be silent for thought that what said must certainly turn out correct for did not deem probable that robert gregory when came into possession be at man to invite two miss harmer to take up abode with next night dr ashleigh did not return to ramsgate harry be to arrive by late train from north after funeral be to go down to ramsgate where be arranged must stop for week two after a must be well able to afford papa have settled to go on to continent for winter with accordingly next day herbert harmer be laid in grave in quiet churchyard of sturry agreeably to miss harmer wish funeral be celebrated with pomp who have gone have never desired for while alive hearse mourning coach with four horse tossing feather man in front with tray of sable plume mute in long array be done in best style people came in from quite long distance to see good many of old canterbury friend sent carriage to join procession there be not many real mourner among who followed first mourning coach contained dr ashleigh son solicitor who have arrived just a cortege be starting other coach contained principal tenant who have liked late landlord who have always found compliant kind in extreme have however very seldom seen a since son death have gone very little among tenant although have always kept well informed concerning affair of of a procession wound through village many blessing prayer be murmured for dead man there indeed have be benefactor many sick bed many aching heart have bounty relieved blessed memory blessed a thousand have done before thousand lying in agony in london hospital never to go out again alive many more to be restored in health strength to family have poured out countless prayer for unknown benefactor who have endowed ward added that comfort whose munificent donation have enabled hospital largely to extend benefit doubtless prayer be not le heard that name be uttered that went up for unknown friend so herbert harmer slept sleep of blessed in quiet churchyard funeral cortege went back to harmer place doctor have be much affected by service over old friend harry too be much moved in case be more thought of grave have last stood beside over whom have heard service read two month before mr petersfield solicitor be calm with be pure matter of business have hardly ever seen dead man knew only a one of wealthiest most eccentric of client have heard from partner that be man of sterling worth mr ransome have always managed mr harmer business knew nothing about mr ransome have died six month before must have be duty in short time to have made thoroughly acquainted with mr harmer affair a be knew very little about during short ride to from church there be hardly word exchanged in carriage a dr ashleigh be entire stranger to solicitor when reached house be shown into drawing room into few minute later robert gregory be ushered how be wife mr gregory doctor asked a shook hand be very ill doctor left certainly calmer more tranquil trust from what medical man said last night that will escape serious attack of brain fever news sent be very great consolation to be still in terribly low spirit here conversation be interrupted by entrance of miss harmer who bowed to dr ashleigh son solicitor of whom have seen before who took notice whatever of presence of robert gregory miss harmer be accompanied rather followed into room by gentleman whom be easy to see by dress be ecclesiastic of romish church who be entire stranger to dr ashleigh gentleman miss harmer said introducing be father eustace friend of ours for many year who having heard of loss have come over from abroad to assist comfort with presence advice father eustace be pale ascetic looking man with large eager bright eye complexion be dark swarthy looked inch what be italian spoke english with strong foreign accent still grammatically pretty distinctly bowed courteously to present then took seat during what followed occupied in closely scrutinizing countenance especially of dr ashleigh robert gregory a if desirous to judge for how nearly tallied with description have received of miss harmer be very pale have quiet fixed look about in dr ashleigh thought read determination to listen with composure to reading of will must place hated robert sophy gregory in position of master mistress of harmer place for little time after have taken seat there be dead silence a if be waiting for other to begin at last mr petersfield said with permission miss harmer will at once proceed to read will of late client mr herbert harmer will be good enough to hand to have not will of brother in possession miss harmer answered coldly not in possession madam be doubtless aware where late brother be in habit of keeping important document have looked mr petersfield among paper have found will among there be pause of blank astonishment how be mr petersfield dr ashleigh said gravely that have not mr harmer will in custody be in hand doctor until about two month ago when mr harmer wrote to saying that be desirous of making slight alteration in requesting to forward did so in charge of one of clerk on day came down here friend of mr harmer died understood be mr ashleigh told clerk that did not feel equal to attend to business that if must leave document with must look over write to to send down again in short time to make alteration required did not hear further from therefore supposed that have changed mind in reference to alteration have forgotten matter altogether remember when clerk came back told that have ventured to suggest that so valuable document ought to be kept in safe place that mr harmer have smiled answered 'you need not be afraid on score have place to put in where burglar in world must not get at there be again blank silence then solicitor went on in case madam think right that must search mr harmer library thoroughly certainly mr petersfield be quite at liberty to search where like father eustace will do kindness to accompany gentleman father eustace at once rose preceded others to library look very strange business mr petersfield dr ashleigh said on way thither very very much so indeed doctor think search here be likely to be attended with success library be thoroughly ransacked drawer be pulled out examined for secret hiding place book be taken down from shelf to look behind place possible impossible be searched a lawyer have predicted without slightest result harry robert gregory performed active portion of work doctor mr petersfield directing operation examining pile of paper came to light during search be very silent be too interested excited to talk from time to time robert gregory muttered savage execration between teeth with exception search be conducted in silence priest sat quietly watched watched not proceeding in seemed to have curiosity attention being directed entirely to way in bore disappointment search lasted for hour by time place have be completely ransacked possible place examined whole floor of room be closely covered with book paper scientific apparatus accumulated litter of year when be done be evident that corner remained unexplored searcher rested from work wiped perspiration from forehead looked at leader for further instruction dr ashleigh drew solicitor to door led into garden opened went out with so that must converse without restraint from presence of priest be extraordinary business mr petersfield dr ashleigh said what do think of do consult professionally dr ashleigh lawyer asked in return certainly do

comparatively small legacy between child illegitimate grandchild miss needham now a understand mr gregory precisely dr ashleigh said be disposition publicly announced that have made of property in event of will not being found presume miss harmer a only relation will inherit everything clearly so doctor be most awkward business however can not now determine what step to take will have plenty of
