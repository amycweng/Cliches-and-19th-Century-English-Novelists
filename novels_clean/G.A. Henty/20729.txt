war with other with peishwa at poona greatly facilitated operation enabled although at cost of much blood to free large portion of india from race be scourge faithless intriguing crafty cruel reckless of life mahratta conquering race a be yet failed in one virtue of courage must sweep land with horde of wild horseman must harry peaceful district tyrannize over town conquered be unable to make effective stand against british bayonet british sabre be race of freebooter even most sentimental humanitarian can feel regret at overthrow of power possessed single claim to admiration weighed like incubus upon people oppressed history of mahratta a written by grant duff whose account have throughout followed be one long record of perfidy murder crime of sort chapter faithful nurse on swell of ground in wild country extending from bombay to foot of ghauts stood small camp in centre be large pavilion residence for time of major lindsay officer whose charge be to keep peace in district be easy matter inhabitant wild lawless lived in small village scattered about rough country for most part covered with forest subject to depredation by robber band who have stronghold among hill major lindsay have with party of twenty trooper not for defence there be little fear of attack by native of concan to add to authority to aid in collection of small tax paid by community to deter mountain robber from descending on to plain generally spent cool season in going round while during hot weather headquarters be at bombay have with wife infant child child be three month old be looked after by ayah who have be in major lindsay service ten year for three elder child have be born to however dying from effect of climate before reaching age of five ayah have nursed in succession have become greatly attached to family especially to youngest charge have come to speak english well with child always talked in native tongue a major saw advantage must prove to boy when grew up to be able to speak fluently one at least of native language nurse be mahratta have be in service of british resident at poona when be recalled have entered that of major lindsay at time captain who acted a secretary to resident young officer from bombay have just ridden out to spend day two with major be sitting with at entrance to tent news from army said be most unsatisfactory a know to astonishment of everyone colonel egerton be appointed to command in spite of fact that be so infirm a to be altogether unfit for active service mostyn late resident at poona carnac accompanied a deputy of council be altogether bad arrangement major said have always be great disadvantage for general to be accompanied by civilian with power to thwart combination against mostyn appointment one must raise objection a having be for year at poona understands mahratta indeed be much liked by so that in negotiation must have far more chance of success than stranger carnac be hot headed obstinate with very high idea of own importance be certain that there will be difficulty between egerton be sorry to say major that anticipation be very speedily verified a know advance party landed at aptee on november rd seized road over gorge on th main body disembarked at panwell sooner have got there than there be quarrel between egerton carnac most unfortunately mostyn who must have acted a mediator be taken ill on very day after landing be obliged to return to bombay hear there be hardly chance of recovery army did not reach top of ghauts till rd of december instead of at latest three day after landing actually spent eleven day before arrived at karlee only eight mile in advance of bhore ghauts of course encouraged enemy gave plenty of time for to assemble make arrangement when last heard be harassing march for past two day news have arrived there seems to be little doubt that mahratta have closed in round rear cut off communication be monstrous that must march so slowly whole thing have be hideous blunder idea of encumbering force of four thousand men with something like thirty thousand camp follower with train of le than nineteen thousand bullock to say nothing of other draught animal be most preposterous thing ever heard of in fact whole thing have be grossly mismanaged say that conduct of mahratta have not for time be doubtful if not threatening be well known that governor general council at calcutta have most strongly disapproved of whole conduct of council at bombay indeed explanation have ever be given a to why took up cause of rugoba scoundrel who grasped crown who be privy to if did not instigate murder of nephew young peishwa be not unopposed for nana furnuwees hurry punt two of leading mahratta minister formed regency under gunga bye widow of murdered peishwa while matter be undecided bombay council opened communication with rugoba who thought be likely to be successful promised to assist if must advance considerable sum of money cede to company salsette small island contiguous to bombay bassein have be captured from portuguese by mahratta altogether inexcusable arrangement a mahratta be at peace with rugoba be not in position to hand island over matter however be settled by sending expedition captured salsette tannah in four year ago since then rugoba have become fugitive without shadow of reason be making war against whole force of mahratta confederacy who although divided amongst frequently engaged in struggle for supremacy have united against for say that scindia holkar hurry punt be in command of army to send four thousand men of whom le than six hundred be european against whole mahratta power be desperate step know have fought won against greater odds many time in history of india force have always be well led marched with smallest amount of baggage possible made up for inferiority in number by speed activity dash here on contrary have force hampered to unheard of degree by baggage camp follower with invalid at head controlled by two civilian moving at rate in testifies to divided council utter incompetency on part of commander be almost impossible even to hope for success under such condition lookout be certainly bad younger officer agreed however before now fighting power of british soldier have made up for blunder of commander may hope that will be case now if disaster happen major said will have mahratta down at gate of bombay a soon a hear rumour of news travel wonderfully fast among native will return to city oh think need fear anything of sort major besides be not on direct line between ghauts city even if find can not push on must say force must be able to secure retreat mahratta horse will never be able to break square of course in case must have to abandon baggage baggage animal agree with that mahratta must doubtless hang on skirt of force follow down bhore ghaut so must not come anywhere near might detach flying party to burn plunder a be custom brave a be mahratta fight for love of fighting simply from hope of plunder of enlarging territory well may hope in day two to hear that battle have be fought that victory have be won not that one victory must settle matter for mahratta force consists almost entirely of cavalry a have only handful must if beaten simply ride off be ready to fight again day if have pushed on occupied poona directly landed must have be easy enough if baggage train have be left behind for be forty mile from panwell to mahratta capital position must have be altogether different mahratta must not have have time to collect force must probably have met with opposition once in poona must have held against whole mahratta force besides be certain that of chief seeing that rugoba be likely to be made peishwa must have come to conclusion that must be best for to side with of course baggage must have be left at panwell in case force must have entered poona three day after landing instead of delaying from th of november until today th of january even now at present rate of advance may be fortnight before arrive at poona think there have be so disgraceful business since first put foot in india at rate will send mary child down to bombay tomorrow be very well to have with when everything be peaceable although think there be actual risk be a well that in turbulent time like with nothing force under such incompetent leading between powerful active enemy must be safe at bombay just before daybreak next morning there be sudden shout from one of sentry who have for first time be posted round camp warning be followed by fierce rush large body of horse foot charged into camp escort be for most part killed a issued from tent major friend be shot down a sallied out sword in hand same fate befell mr lindsay then

did not so much a know that be alive feel sure will take in willingly for be two year older than be always kind to accordingly next morning retraced step have difficulty in finding farm of ramdass choosing time when must be likely to be in for dinner soyera walked up to door of house be standing open a stood there hesitating ramdass came out be man of forty year of age with pleasant kindly face looked at enquiringly do not know ramdass asked why 't be soyera exclaimed so have come back after year thirteen be not since went away welcome back little sister raised voice called anundee young woman two three twenty year of age came to door wife said be sister soyera of whom have often heard speak soyera be wife have be married six year come in let talk thing over have come home for good

with pepper other condiment added how did like being among english soyera liked very well woman said be very kind considerate to nurse although get angry when gorrawallah other men neglect duty punish a mahratta master must do be not double faced when say thing mean word can always be trusted a people doubt be anxious to extend dominion wish to do so for personal gain be not like prince here who go to war to gain territory revenue be reasonable that must wish to increase land for be almost shut up in bombay with salsette other island occupied by who may day be enemy brother laughed seems to soyera that have come to prefer english people to own countryman say not that ramdass asked how liked have told know how tax collector grind down people how scindia holkar peishwa be always fighting other do know that in bombay meanest man must not be put to death unless fairly tried while among mahratta men be executed on merest excuse if not executed be murdered that be true enough ramdass said none of three prince must hesitate to put to death anyone who stood in way seems strange to that even brahmin who must not take life even of troublesome insect yet support men who have killed score of other people be use grumbling thing have always be suppose always will be be not only so in deccan in nizam dominion in mysore so far a know in oude delhi seems so natural to that powerful must oppress weak that one prince must go to war with that hardly give matter thought though a say english in bombay may rule wisely dislike taking life be doing now just a prince do be making war with be true from what have heard when english sahib be speaking together be everything to that prince favourable to must rule at poonah for be holkar scindia to become powerful place one of people on seat of peishwa next step might be that great mahratta force must descend ghauts capture bombay slay white man in be mere handful ramdass said how can think of invading nation like ours because know at least believe that scindia holkar peishwa be so jealous of other that will never act together then see what have done round madras bengal few a be have won battle against great prince lastly mistress have told that although there be few here there be many at home must if chose send out twenty soldier for one there be here besides be not alone who fight native enlist under aid in conquest show at least that be well treated have confidence in good faith of english be very well soyera to talk way must a willingly believe that star will fall from sky a that englishman who simply live in bombay because suffer to do so must ever conquer mahratta a have subdued other portion of india where a everyone know people be not warlike have always be conquered without difficulty look at power at emperor be puppet in hand be same in district on plain of great river rajpoot fear even pindaries must not dare carry raid into country that small body of merchant soldier must threaten seems to altogether absurd well brother will not argue about time will show a woman of mahratta trust day will never come a one who know english have fear of one thing be sure be master here cultivator must be vastly better off than be at present ramdass laughed what do think of sister opinion anundee know what to think young woman said soyera have seen much be wise woman what say be idle word to seems impossible when know that mahratta can place hundred thousand horseman in field own that from what know of english might be better for people like to have such master now soyera ramdass said when returned from work in evening tell more about first how did learn where be living learned from wife of cousin sufder how did fall in with well must tell something have meant to keep entirely to myself know that anundee will keep secret assuredly will be not man to talk of other people affair a to anundee can trust with life well in first place deceived rather deceived when said ' see that have be married ' child be here so must not explain infant be not mine be son of dear master mistress of whom be killed three day ago by band of sufder commanded one who attacked suddenly by night what be child white ramdass asked in tone of alarm be not white because have stained skin be child of english parent will tell how happened related instance of attack upon little camp death of master mistress white officer escort told how have hidden child under cover of tent how sufder have saved life subsequent conversation with regarding child now what do intend to do with soyera intend to bring up a own will keep skin stained one can suspect that be not mine then think of restoring to people not until grows up have father mother to whom must hand now moreover if a say people intend to drive english from bombay fate must be certain when be by with will talk to in english a soon a be old enough to understand that must not speak in language to others then when join own people will be able to converse with in ten year have spent in english service have come to speak language well though can not teach knowledge of english can do much to fit to take place a englishman when time come be risky business brother said say that can not be carried out at rate since have so decided to keep can see better plan two day later sufder came in so got here safely soyera yes have trouble did not expect back so soon matter be settled though think be wrong to grant term to english have in power must have finished matter straight off delay inactivity natural consequence of utter incompetence of divided councillor have occurred colonel egerton in consequence of sickness have resigned command have be succeeded by lieutenant colonel cockburn on th of january be within eighteen mile of poona have still three week provision with two three skirmish have taken place without result yet mr carnac without having suffered reverse now within day march of capital proposed that retreat must be made at once

village of wurgaom be already crowded with camp follower wildest confusion reigned enemy horse took advantage of charged through baggage troop be unable to act with effect being mixed up with crowd of fugitive however soon extricated drove off enemy placed gun in commanding position round village at four o'clock enemy retired early next morning mahratta artillery opened fire on village of sepoy troop now became dispirited hartley men stood firm mahratta did not venture to attack loss on previous day be found to amount to three hundred fifty two killed wounded missing including many who have deserted during night among killed wounded be fifteen european officer whose loss be great misfortune for although sepoys fight well under european officer lose heart altogether if not so led mr palmer secretary of committee be now sent to negotiate with enemy first demand made be surrender of rugoba committee must have agreed to rugoba have privately arranged to surrender to scindia next demand be that committee must enter on treaty for surrender of greater part of territory of bombay government together with revenue of broach surat term be so hard that even craven committee who be entirely responsible for disaster hesitated to accept cockburn be asked whether retreat be wholly impracticable declared that be so captain hartley protested against opinion showed how retreat must be managed opinion be altogether overruled mr holmes be sent with power to conclude treaty however committee never intended to observe scindia took principal part in arranging detail superseding

share in miserable business mr carnac colonel egerton colonel cockburn be dismissed from company service captain hartley be promoted to rank of lieutenant colonel governor of bombay refused to ratify

mysore state first under hyder ali afterwards under son tippoo be source of danger to ally in meantime harry lindsay who be now called puntojee have be living quietly on farm of ramdass suspicion have be excited in mind of neighbour of of people of jooneer that be aught what seemed son of soyera once week be re stained even playmate two son of ramdass believed that be like young mahratta knew that sometimes aunt talked to child for hour in strange language led to believe be dialect of bombay thought might be useful for to learn child be shrewd intelligent strictly obeyed soyera instruction never on account to talk in language with except when be alone for said that if did so great misfortune must happen to thus at six be able to speak english mahratta with equal facility a soon a hair began to grow have also be dyed for colour be fair must at once have excited attention be sturdy boy have never known day illness four more year passed soyera then revealed to fact that be not a supposed mother that be of english parent related to manner in have come by death how have saved language be speaking said be english spoke truly when said be language in use in bombay for be tongue of white men there now will understand why wanted not to speak in to anyone why have stained skin once week at present be at peace with english there may be war again at time in case be known that be white life must not be safe for moment might be thrown into dungeon where must perish miserably then explained to why have not attempted to take down to bombay restore to countryman have always hoped time must come when must do so until grew up to manhood be necessary that must stay with for being without friend in bombay must a boy be unable to earn living boy be greatly affected at news there be thing that have never be able to understand especially why soyera must consider necessary to wash with dye so often when cousin other child of acquaintance be so treated a far a knew for a have be strictly charged never to speak of process considered infliction have never asked question of others have never therefore for moment suspected that be not like around knew that be stronger than other boy of own age more fond of exercise leader in game have accepted a natural accident fact that belonged to race be master of southern india have conquered slain nabob of bengal be gratification to at present thought that might day have to join leave loved behind far overpowered feeling will never become english if go with said saved life have be mother to why must go away from side to people know nothing of whose way must be strange to be right that must do so puntojee will not call by proper name harry lindsay lest must slip out before others life must be spent among own people who think will day rule over india be great people with learning of many thing unknown here from whom always received greatest kindness be not like mahratta always quarrelling among be not deceitful be honourable must be proud to belong to have doubt day will be so though at present be natural that knowing place must not like thought of leaving harry lindsay whose spirit have hitherto be almost inexhaustible who have never be happy when sitting quiet be greatly impressed with what have heard for time withdrew almost entirely from sport of friend hiding in grove from importunity thinking over strange position in be placed soyera at last remonstrated with if have thought must take matter to heart puntojee must not have told about did so because thought must scarcely be stained much longer without demanding reason for what must have seemed so strange thing want to withdraw from playmate to cease from game doing so will if continues excite talk friend will think that spell have fallen upon will shun want to grow up such a father be strong brave skilful in arm to do must be alert active may well be that must not join countryman until be able to play part of man will not be for ten year yet know that cousin sufder have promised that a soon a be able to carry arm will procure post for under scindia there will learn much see something of world whereas if remain here must grow up like other cultivator must make bad impression among countryman when join sufder have promised to teach use of arm a say be very skilful must have better master at rate wish to resume former habit to exercise body in way so that may grow up so strong active that when join countryman will feel be well worthy of think much of such thing be by love for exercise sport that so harden frame that in battle bravest people can not stand against mahratta be strong mother yes can stand great fatigue living a do so constantly on horseback like people of india be not fond of exercise save when at war be difference between english will get up at daybreak go for long ride hunt wild boar tiger in jungle of concan bear among ghauts exercise to be pleasure in service of english have often wondered at way in willingly endure fatigue when might pas time sitting quietly in verandah came to understand that be to love of theirs for outdoor exercise that owed strength firmness of courage none can say that mahratta be not brave although will charge gallantly soon disperse if day go against so also with soldier of tippoo overran arcot threatened madras tanjore carnatic be in hand yet english never lost firmness little by little drove tippoo troop from land have conquered may be that ere long tippoo will be fugitive dominion divided among whom have provoked be not wonderful that while not very many year ago white be merely handful living on sufferance in calcutta madras bombay be now master of southern india half of bengal even venture to engage great empire like of mahratta stretching from sea on west to delhi holding mastery over central india there must be something extraordinary about men why must scarce believe have seen often wondered always when have entertainment instead of sitting quietly 'and having dancing girl to posture for amusement dance with woman not mere movement of body hand such a see among dancer violent dancing exhausting till perspiration stream from face men woman regard a amusement so puntojee if be to take place among countryman again must accustom to fatigue strengthen body in way will be regarded with contempt a one who although of blood have grown degenerate unworthy of will do so boy said will not complain of again hitherto have played for amusement because liked to exercise limb to show others must run faster be stronger than be in future will have motive in doing so will strive to be worthy of father from time harry lindsay devoted to exercise learnt from sufder when visited native town from old soldier when be away to use sword

arranged that must go to house there resume native dress stain in garb felt even stranger more uncomfortable than have done when first put on european clothes be not long in wearing off by time reached jooneer be again at home in took with at mr sankey suggestion number of english book by author recommended so that must by reading learning of by heart retain knowledge of language for next three month spent whole time in practising with sword pistol gun under tuition of old soldier in jooneer who have be noted swordsman in time be already far stronger than son of ramdass although be now young men anxious to at once exercise muscle gain in skill now attached to famous shikaree who seeing boy strength courage took a assistant when went on excursion among hill here harry learned to dig pit for capture of tiger to smear leaf with sticky substance obtained from plant resembling mistletoe so that when tiger bear trod upon finding sticking to foot paused rubbed on head until became blinded bewildered with mass of sticky foliage well placed shot must stretch dead illustration for year worked with shikaree for year worked with shikaree sometimes hunted simply for value of skin more often be sent for by villager who be suffering from depredation of tiger leopard who be willing to pay for having killed harry lindsay acquired quite reputation in jooneer surrounding country for shikaree spoke freely of bravery intelligence skill with arm width of shoulder strength of muscle caused to be regarded a prodigy be generally considered that when grew up must become great fighter attain wide renown a leader of band in service of holkar peishwa when be sixteen sufder who have watched progress with great approval said to be scarce man in year yet puntojee be strong skilful with weapon far more of man than many ten year older than yourself be time that must see something of war since death of scindia few month back succession of nephew doulut who be about own age thing have become even more unsettled than before scindia be great man although at time worsted by rival always managed to repair fortune to add to power whether young scindia will keep wide territory that uncle won be doubtful holkar although at time scindia united a when english marched against poona have be rival enemy peishwa have sometimes be in alliance with one of great prince sometimes with other minister nana furnuwees be man of commanding talent have not be for be probable that scindia holkar must long since have become altogether independent have always contrived to play one off against other by securing service of secondary chief such a rajah of nagpore rajah of kolapoore to hold balance of power be old man at death there be saying how thing will go matter be complicated too by fact that scindia have now in service sixteen battalion of drilled infantry commanded by french officer have proved so valuable in various siege have undertaken that holkar have be obliged to imitate example there be many who think that introduction of infantry will in end prove disastrous to power of mahratta whose strength have hitherto lain in cavalry must perform long journey strike blow be off again so be more than match for infantry of other indian prince with infantry will be altered for march must be no longer faster than can journey order of battle too will be changed altogether will depend more upon foot while horse until now almost invincible will become of secondary importance however be not question at present first thing to be considered be to of three great leader be to attach a know be for many year in scindia service at death position be changed scindia knew be active capable have lived must soon have gained much promotion however chief minister took dislike to felt that now maharajah be gone doulut must be easily swayed by counsel of around that instead of promotion must be more likely to lose command perhaps be put out of way therefore left doulut service have entered that of young peishwa who at advice of nana furnuwees have given command of troop of hundred men year ago gained be goodwill by apprising of hostile intention of rajah of nagpore when promised must at time leave scindia service must give a good position a held there in of peishwa young prince be twenty one will ask nana to present to a one who in time will become valuable officer be likely that mahdoo rao will receive well when hears that though so young have gained great credit a slayer of wild beast that a will see for promise to grow into strong man brave soldier nana furnuwees be man who by conciliating manner gain confidence of who come under influence be wholly due to that authority of peishwa have not be entirely overthrown by scindia holkar be reader of men mind have always surrounded with friend of discernment courage think must be likely if remained in peishwa service to rise to very much higher rank than must ever do being rough soldier with heavy hand holkar at present be fast becoming altogether imbecile be worn out in mind body must not advise anybody to join therefore choice rest between doulut rao scindia peishwa a far a can see there be equal chance of seeing service with can choose without hesitation harry said have still be in army of scindia must have joined too a have now entered that of peishwa who be lawful ruler of mahratta though overshadowed by scindia holkar must certainly choose service in case must rather be with have taught use of arm to owe be not killed when infant therefore must assuredly rather fight under order than take service with holkar scindia a to quarrel know nothing ramdass have often told a much a knew of matter seemed to to be confusion only thing must understand be that be always intriguing against other instead of putting force in field fighting out fairly so deciding who be to be chief lord of mahratta although soldier puntojee can not see that constant antagonism between three principal leader of mahratta be unfortunate in last degree be wasting strength that if properly employed might bring india into subjection when trouble really come will be divided people instead of acting under one head with one mind however be not for soldier to meddle with thing to do duty to chief under whom serve well if such be choice will present to nana furnuwees be glad that have chosen that service for in first place being young may take liking to may obtain rapid promotion still more because must prefer to have with hitherto harry have worn only scanty clothing in use by peasantry small cultivator sufder now bought clothes such a be worn by youth of superior class soyera have offered objection to departure indeed sufder have spoken to on subject before have broached to harry be hard upon to give up said to lad have always known that must be so indeed for last year have seen little of change will be good for will learn manner of war take interest in intrigue trouble be constantly going on of hear little when rejoin countryman few year hence will go with need testimony to show that be son of major lindsay can be useful to in managing household at present be best must stay here young soldier must not care to have mother looking after be for good that must go own way besides will have counsel of sufder to aid must be out of place for present be happy here with good brother sister in law latter of whom must miss sorely moreover poona be two day ride from here will doubt be able sometimes to come over see have done what little must for be now old enough to make own way bird have taught nestling to fly doe not try to keep in nest when be once able to take care of can never be sufficiently grateful for that have done for harry said earnestly have be more than mother to wherever go will not be happy unless be with though see be best time must go alone assuredly when join people have home of own must not seem like home to if did not share two day later harry mounted horse ramdass have given started with sufder for poona on arriving there rode to little camp mile out of town where sufder troop be stationed carry tent with when be on service in field not when on expedition where haste be needed for must make poor progress if be hampered by luggage when on distant expedition take tent be standing camp there be score like round town always remain in same position sometimes one troop occupies sometimes when go on expedition leave when come back if be still unoccupied again take possession if have be allotted to troop vacant one be found for only one regiment of horse two of foot be in city where have line of hut differ from rest of army being always on service others be only called out when there be occasion for under own chief in case of necessity peishwa can put thirty thousand horseman in field besides of rajah in alliance with next morning sufder in best attire went with harry into city latter for first time carrying sword dagger pistol in cummerbund sash without being questioned entered chamber be nana be giving audience to who waited upon on business sufder took place at lower end of chamber moving forward a one after applicant be disposed of until at length turn arrived minister who knew that be brave soldier who have enjoyed confidence of late scindia acknowledged deep salutation with friendly nod what can do for sufder desire nothing excellency save may be permitted to present to one of family son of relation of mine who although still young may venture to recommend to a one possessing great courage intelligence have myself given lesson in use of arm have have other instructor done credit to for past year have be working with famous shikaree have killed many tiger be scourge to village near ghauts together with many bear leopard master reported that fearlessness be great that a marksman skill be equal to own be most unwilling that must leave considered be time for to enter army in believe will soon distinguish how old be minister asked be a yet sixteen a highness may see be a strong a most men having devoted to exercise of sort since be child be indeed cast in strong mould face plea so must enter service of highness peishwa be desire excellency be young to serve a officer for present have best remain with sufder troop in meantime will see what suitable post can be found for with expression of thanks sufder harry left audience hall be good beginning puntojee soldier said a left minister palace nana furnuwees be evidently pleased with think will give special employment at same time serving one master here be not without danger nana especially powerful a be have enemy a powerful for have always stood in way of ambition of scindia that evening officer brought from nana order conferring upon appointment of assistant officer in sufder troop with usual pay allowance three day later order came for to attend audience of minister on arrival be told by officer of chamber that be not to present at public audience that nana must speak to privately be therefore taken to inner chamber where hour later nana joined think by face puntojee that can be trusted have decided to place in service of highness peishwa what position will hold there must depend upon will simply recommend a one of whom have heard much good must be a well for not to mention age let suppose that a look be about same age a be amiable kindly position will be pleasant one be anxious to prevent evil adviser from obtaining influence over be young unsuspicious much harm might thus come to state be then for general interest that must be surrounded by whom can trust so that if plotter be endeavouring to poison mind plan may be thwarted have of course officer about person who be thoroughly trustworthy be much older than chafe somewhat at what wrongly considers tutelage indeed a be twenty one wholly unversed in matter of state be needful that management of affair must rest in hand of who have long controlled must be first to take advantage of imprudence be already by far most powerful of mahratta prince possession be of immense extent hold emperor at delhi in palm of hand can put one hundred thousand horse into field have large number of infantry including sixteen battalion drilled by french officer commanded by de boigne although doulut rao be twenty a yet know little of disposition be of course surrounded by adviser of uncle may be expected to pursue same policy uncle gained great ascendency over peishwa death be fortunate circumstance still be certain that prince until power be matured will yield to advice of to whom conduct of affair be entrusted now be going to palace have requested private audience with mahdoo rao will take with followed by train of officer with whom harry fell in minister proceeded to palace train remained in public hall nana went into peishwa private apartment in few minute official came in called puntojee harry at once followed to inner room where peishwa minister be alone harry bowed to ground prince be young man of whom have spoken to bear excellent character for skill in arm have killed many tiger other beast be other day that complained that have one of own age to whom must talk freely have selected young officer a one who thought must be agreeable to thank heartily nana in truth sometimes need companion think by face that officer will be agreeable one to what post think have best appoint a be famous shikaree must say that must be suitable be to make director of chase never go hunting be true in time when occupation of state lessen might do so nana said indeed even at present there be nothing to prevent hunting sometimes in royal preserve where there must be abundance of game of sort so let be then peishwa said in truth care not for killing of beast unless do harm to villager be right that there must be someone to direct men who have charge of preserve a official will have right of entry here at time will be frequently about person will confer with about other thing a well a chase will of course have apartment assigned to will arrange about emolument nana have better go to house wait for there nana said harry bowing deeply to prince minister left palace did not deceive a to reason for nana have thus placed in position in be likely to be frequently in company of young prince intended to act a spy be firmly determined not to do in matter save in thwarting design scindia might have be public duty by time have learnt much of event be passing ramdass other ryots of acquaintance regarded nana furnuwees a guardian of country for many year be wisdom firmness alone have thwarted design of scindia whose advent to supreme authority must have be regarded a grave misfortune by cultivator of deccan scindia expense in keeping up so great army be enormous exaction of tax gatherer ground to dust cultivator peasantry of own wide dominion harry be therefore ready to give nana faithful support in public matter knew that minister have many enemy even among rajah in peishwa dominion in round for regarded with reason a curb upon private ambition for year intrigue have be going on for overthrow on other hand harry be much pleased with mahdoo rao who be most amiable kindly young man while determined then to do that must in support of nana decided that must on account give report must be unfavourable to peishwa interview with minister on return of latter be short one here latter said be purse of five hundred rupee with to obtain garment suitable for one in attendance on peishwa emolument will be two hundred rupee month will issue order to men employed in forest preserve to report to have requested chamberlain to allot apartment to in palace to tell off two servant to be in attendance on understand that mission a far a be concerned be to give early warning if of favourable to scindia will be furnished with list of name be endeavouring to obtain undue influence over prince who be of altogether unsuspicious character must be likely to fall easy victim to bad counsel can depend upon doing so harry said have be taught to regard scindia a enemy to public peace will use diligence in carrying out excellency order leaving minister harry went to sufder told what have happened in truth puntojee be born under lucky star never dreamt that nana furnuwees must have thus introduced to peishwa now lad have fine career opened to will need caution a scindia ancestor be slipper bearer rose to highest rank honour so be open to to win great position if steer clear of danger attend who play part in public affair foresee that will become favourite with prince remember to put trust in nana be at present greatest power in land have be so for many year unlike most who have attained such authority be liked by people for us power well for good of state see even now young peishwa be by mean secure on musnud adherent of rugoba who be undoubtedly lawful ruler of deccan still live may one day raise flag of revolt in favour of son bajee rao chimnajee appa who with amrud rao adopted son be in close custody in hill fort of sewneree under two of nana officer there be general feeling of pity for young men even among who regard imprisonment a necessary for be free civil war must assuredly break out again feeling be increased by fact that bajee rao be youth of extraordinary accomplishment be graceful in person with handsome countenance charming manner although nineteen be excellent horseman skilled in use of bow considered to be finest swordsman in country be deeply read in religious book in country there be one of age so learned thing however only add to necessity for being kept in prison youth so gifted a many people consider lawful heir to throne must speedily be joined by enemy of nana might not only drive minister into exile dethrone mahdoo rao such being case one can blame nana for keeping in confinement at rate until mahdoo rao have be master for year have proved that be able to maintain position now lad will go into town with purchase dress fit for official of palace quite see have be most fortunate in obtaining position sufder own must have preferred to remain with learn to do service a soldier that may learn later on sufder said having confidence of peishwa may soon obtain military rank a well a civil if war break out may hold position vastly better than must hope to attain to a mere chief of troop seems very ridiculous sufder must be thus put forward without merit of own while who have fought in many battle be still only commander of troop have desire for more sufder replied be soldier can do duty a ordered have head for intrigue consider risk of battle be quite sufficient without of being put out of way for mixing up in plot again rise be not altogether undeserved have by exercise attained strength of manhood early experience a tiger hunter have fitted for post for be appointed just a diligence in exercise in arm will be of good service to if come to hold military command must be circumspect above thing forget to use dye with soyera have furnished hitherto white skin have done harm be discovered here that be english must at once be imagined that be spy little time must be given to explain how matter stand will certainly be careful a to now that be to have private apartment will be able to apply dye without fear of being interrupted a might have be case in camp on following day harry having obtained clothes suitable to position betook to palace where one of officer of chamberlain conducted to apartment assigned to two men appointed to service chapter change in affair harry lindsay duty be little more than nominal report sent in to by in charge of royal preserve must scarcely be considered a satisfactory a stated that owing to fact that for year there have be no hunting there tiger have greatly increased in number have thinned down stag indeed in case have so destroyed other game that be driven to escape from enclosure to ravage village beyond receiving report riding over occasionally to preserve harry have little to do save to take part in court ceremony when called upon to do so to accompany peishwa in walk in palace garden therefore determined to learn to read write in mahratta for two three hour day man of weynsh mercantile class came in to teach so careful be nana furnuwees in preventing scindia adherent from approaching prince that harry have nothing whatever to report on head one day when mahdoo rao who have taken great liking to be walking in garden chatting familiarly to of life in country adventure with tiger other wild beast said have seen cousin bajee rao highness have never seen have heard of of course nothing good be so prince seems that in sport learning be wonderfully well instructed must like to see prince said admire what have heard of greatly be hard that must be shut up in prison yet be scarcely more prisoner than be harry be struck with dismay highness be in way prisoner be not shut up in fortress young prince said be more own master than bajee rao be nana furnuwees treat a if be child be know devoted to that make more pleasant can go where like be always with retinue can not choose own friend highness will forgive if say that be for own safety for peace of country that minister watch over so jealously doubtless think that having be chief adviser to family for so many year having guarded so successfully from who must have lessened authority for present be of greatest importance that must continue to guide state be at least very glad that allows companion of own age to whom can talk freely on subject highness excepting state matter nana presented because be ignorant of court knew nothing whatever of intrigue be not likely to take part in therefore highness pray to speak upon ordinary matter be assured be devoted servant courtier must grow suspicious be to talk of state matter with thing speedily become known must fall under nana displeasure perhaps be right peishwa admitted in tone of melancholy doubt pass in house be known to minister indeed be duty to make so acquainted still feel hard must not have one friend to whom can speak time will come prince when will be able to do so doubtless there will be at hand who will dare to have confidence prince be silent after abstained from remark to harry concerning state have indeed for time be in correspondence with bajee rao who have gained confidence of one of appointed to look after though there be nothing save expression of friendship on part of prince be furious when found out from spy what be going on news came a shock to minister nana have be greatest enemy of house of rugoba discovery of correspondence friendship between two young men so threatened authority that after ordering that bajee rao brother must be more strictly confined than before visited peishwa upbraided bitterly for having entered upon friendship with head of party have harassed family have brought innumerable trouble on state then sent message to harry bidding to come at once how be puntojee said sternly that have altogether failed to justify faith put in have already assisted mahdoo rao to enter into relation with enemy bajee rao harry be thunderstruck at sudden attack lord must have be misinformed know nothing of such correspondence if really went on think peishwa must have taken into confidence do mean to say that mahdoo have not spoken to about cousin sir say so for four month ago spoke in term of admiration for bajee rao did not pursue subject never afterwards alluded to minister looked at fixedly believe said look like double faced man a one who must tell truth be consequence moreover felt that if have known of mahdoo rao intention have not reported to must on receiving message have endeavoured to make escape have of course enquired found that spent afternoon a usual with scribe that afterwards rode out to sufder camp there talked for hour sitting outside tent conversing on ordinary matter then returned here to palace proceeding go far to assure that be ignorant of discovery have be made that correspondence have be going on between mahdoo bajee still thought might have known of correspondence though not of discovery now be quite convinced that be altogether ignorant of what be going on scene with nana knowledge that have brought upon cousin even stricter confinement than before acted most painfully upon mind of young peishwa already embittered by restraint in be being held now shut up in room absolutely refused to leave absence from durbar be put down to illness nana paid great attention to believing that young prince must speedily recover however be not case for settled melancholy took possession of on nd of october appeared at duddera high ceremonial went among troop in evening received chief representative from great rajah three day later threw from terrace in front of palace broke two of limb so seriously injured that died two day afterwards having almost in last breath expressed to nana strong desire that bajee rao must succeed on musnud consternation of minister be unbounded seemed that by sudden unexpected blow whole of plan be overthrown that not only position very life be in danger sent for harry two hour after peishwa death answer frankly said can depend upon absolutely have have communication of kind from enemy can depend upon lord everyone know that have saved state score of time will doubt not do same again have will minister said gravely whether have power be thing sent off messenger to general purseram bhow bidding gather a many troop a possible march hither will send letter to rajah of nagpore scindia holkar being in poona have already seen a have always supported against rugoba be a anxious a be a to succession will now send with duplicate letter to purseram bhow for since terrible accident to mahdoo rao whom loved dearly for amiable character be probable that adherent of bajee rao have be active that movement be watched attempt may be made to stop messenger may send out take sufder troop with if be stopped fight way through force be matter of supreme importance that letter must reach general will reach lord harry said a took in five minute will be on way going to room changed attire mounted horse rode to sufder camp men be ready a nana have sent order to sufder to prepare instantly for journey so be puntojee captain said a rode up orderly did not tell whom be to escort destination in direction do ride be bearer of letter to purseram bhow then know direction giving order to men rode off at once by side of harry be terrible business puntojee be greatly grieved indeed for one must have be kinder to than mahdoo rao yes yes sufder said be very well serious side of matter be just a everything seemed settled may be entering upon civil war more terrible than last of course be sorry for young peishwa doubt whether be in way fit to rule over mahratta kindness of heart go for nothing with people like ours split up into many faction led by many chief ever ready for war need strong a well a able man to hold in check party in state scindia be sort of man to rule be strong in way be troubled with scruple must strike down without mercy who opposed took great care of troop be always ready to follow be man want on musnud not young prince of whom can only say that be kindly why did nana choose be second string to bow sent off messenger a soon a heard of mahdoo rao accident fearing might be intercepted on way have chosen a being person one must be likely to suspect of being messenger on so important matter be important indeed puntojee there be saying what may be result of peishwa death there be doubt that scindia holkar will for once be in complete accord with nana furnuwees will combine in plan to keep rugoba son from succeeding still there be many of friend of rugoba who will be ready to declare for son moreover there be story have be so widely circulated a to bajee personal appearance many accomplishment will gain for great number of partisan journey be performed without interruption at one time body of fifty horseman made appearance on rising ground near road drew off when saw how strong be party after ride of sixty mile arrived at purseram bhow camp harry dismounted in front of general tent entering handed letter what be news latter asked before opening there be none general beyond what letter sent to three hour before left will have prepared to hear only bear copy of letter in case first must not have reached be well that precaution be taken for in truth messenger have not arrived be possible that may have be murdered on way sir for saw party of fifty horseman on road whose intention seemed to be hostile a have sufder troop of hundred men with drew off what be news then be so important that step be taken to stop messenger bear harry related what have taken place old officer giving many ejaculation of regret horror at news of mahdoo rao death 't be terrible misfortune indeed said be like to throw whole country into disorder again opened despatch now glanced through called of officer who be gathered near tent ordered to cause trumpet to be sounded for troop to be in readiness to march at once leaving only small body of infantry to pack up tent follow at more leisurely pace with baggage hour later two regiment of cavalry started infantry men being taken up behind trooper late next day arrived at poona scindia rajah of berar have also be sent for in haste a soon a arrived council be held a to choice must be made of successor be opposed to selection of bajee rao for must have be brought up by mother with deepest enmity towards who have successfully combined against father be therefore proposed that widow of mahdoo rao must adopt son in whose name government must be carried on be not until two month have be spent in negotiation that matter be finally settled one of scindia minister named balloba alone opposed course decided upon bajee rao opened communication with succeeded in winning over to cause having done addressed scindia offering very large addition to territory payment of expense if must assist to gain rightful position a balloba have great influence over young scindia offer be accepted arrangement be made so secretly that nana furnuwees have received intimation whatever of what be going on until agreement have be concluded purseram bhow be again summoned to poona with usual energy made march of one hundred twenty mile in forty eight hour position be difficult one indeed at one blow plan have be so carefully laid by nana be shattered scindia who have month two before formed one of confederacy have now gone round to side of bajee rao who regarded minister a greatest enemy holkar be not to be depended upon in poona there be many adherent of son of rugoba council held by nana purseram two three other great officer be long at time stormy be finally agreed that sole way out of perilous position caused by scindia desertion be to anticipate to release bajee rao declare peishwa purseram started at once to fort where brother be confined harry who be now deeply interested in course of event be one of nana officer who accompanied purseram on hearing general errand officer in command of fort at once sent for bajee brother chimnajee amrud who be adopted son of rugoba who stood on equal footing with regard to succession bajee rao listened calmly to proposal made to in nana name asked several question demanded guarantee be evidently disposed to accept proposal if assured that be made in good faith amrud strongly urged to decline offer bajee upon purseram taking most solemn oath known to hindoo in proof of sincerity accepted offer with brother chimnajee rode with purseram to poona amrud being left behind in fort a purseram considered that must continue to exercise influence over bajee in direction hostile to nana interest a soon a party arrived at capital interview took place between bajee nana when in presence of many of great officer swore to forget enmity injury bajee promised to retain nana at head of administration that same evening minister sent for harry puntojee said have commission for know that be loyal to that can depend upon wish to go at once to scindia camp be now on bank of godavery ascertain how take news doubtless balloba prime minister will be furious at finding instead of bajee becoming mere creature of scindia have placed on musnud retain place a chief minister can employ for business better than most others for greater part of officer be personally known to of scindia while have scarce be seen by have also high idea of shrewdness have doubt that will in way be able to gain information that require indeed will probably be public talk of camp if must find opportunity of entering into negotiation with influential person in scindia court authorize to do so in name to agree to reasonable demand that may make either for payment in money in estate scindia character be wholly unformed though today may be guided by balloba tomorrow may lean on someone else can go in guise think fit a trooper a camp follower in case have better take sufder twenty men with leave in concealment within few mile of camp so that in case of necessity can join men can act a messenger bring report to a be now year since harry have first gone to poona have during time worked diligently must now read write mahratta language be thus able to send in written report instead of being obliged to rely upon oral message might be misdelivered by who carried possibly reported to others instead of to minister whereas reading writing be known to few of mahratta outside brahmin class sufder expressed much pleased when heard that be to accompany harry be sick of life of inactivity said why have have fighting for past five year will forget how to use arm unless there be something doing must willingly accompany into scindia camp be far too well known there to hope to escape observation however will pick out twenty of best men so that if there must be skirmish will be able to hold own of course will choose men who have good horse for may have to ride for harry be very well mounted for mahdoo rao have given two excellent horse a have when out with sufder troop tried against best of of sowars felt sure that must trust to in case of having to ride for life trooper who looked after have become much attached to determined to take with into scindia camp one of sufder other men looking after horse after consultation with sufder decided on adopting costume of petty trader pedlar carrying garment scarf other article used by soldier of laid in store three hour after interview with nana started with escort trooper leading spare horse on pack be fastened own man riding country pony distance to scindia camp be under hundred mile took three day in accomplishing be important that horse must not be knocked up a life might depend upon speed when within ten mile of destination halted in grove near moola river here harry changed clothes assumed of small merchant then mounted pony portion of pack be fastened behind rest carried by servant scindia camp lay around toka town on godavery at foot of range of hill on arriving there went to field bazaar where large number of booth occupied by trader country peasant be erected former principally sold arm saddlery garment latter produce of own village choosing unoccupied piece of ground harry erected little shelter tent composed of dark blanket thrown over ridge pole supported by two others giving height of four foot in centre pony be picketed just behind in front of portion of ware be spread out harry began usual loud exhortation to passer by to inspect having thus established left wasil in charge explaining to price that be to ask for of article sold then started on tour through camp here there pausing to listen to soldier picked up scrap of news learned that there be general expectation that army must march in day two towards poona being rumoured that scindia minister balloba have be outwitted by nana furnuwees balloba have made secret of anger vowed vengeance against man who have overthrown plan have be surely believed must have resulted in scindia obtaining supreme control over deccan returning to little tent wrote letter to nana telling what have gathered giving approximately strength of scindia force adding that from what heard whole be animated with desire to avenge what considered insult to prince note gave to wasil who at once started on foot to join sufder who must forward by four trooper to poona next morning returned after purchasing provision from countryman lighting fire for cooking assisted harry at stall latter be standing up exhibiting garment to soldier who be haggling with over price when party of officer rode by at head be one whose dress showed to be person of importance whom harry at once recognized a balloba having often noticed during negotiation at poona a eye fell upon harry checked horse for moment beckoned to to come to come here weynsh said using term generally applied to commercial caste illustration harry went up to salaamed harry went up to salaamed how come minister asked that so fine young fellow a be be content to be peddling good through country when so well fitted by nature for better thing must be soldier good one for so young man have never seen greater promise of strength seems to that face be not unknown to where do come from from jooneer excellency where people be cultivator having liking for life learned trade of shopkeeper obtained permission to travel to camp to try fortune in disposing of of master good a jooneer be sixty mile from toka explanation be natural enough a former town lay near to main road from scindia dominion in candeish afforded explanation of balloba partial recognition of face a merchant can read write suppose latter went on yes highness sufficiently well for business well think over can scarcely find present life more suitable to taste than of cultivator army be proper place for young fellow with spirit with strength muscle such a have if like to enlist in own bodyguard conduct be good will see that have such promotion a deserve excellency be kind indeed harry said humbly before accept kind offer will permit to return to jooneer to account for sale to employer to obtain permission of father to accept offer must indeed be greatly more to taste than selling of good be well balloba said then broke off ah know now why remember face 't be lightness of eye be of colour rarely seen somehow other appears to that be not at jooneer at poona that noticed face be at poona with master when highness be there harry said that account for minister touched horse flank with heel rode on with thoughtful look on face harry at once joined wasil quick wasil there be time to be lost throw saddle on to pony make way out of camp at once pitch other thing into tent close if leave here will seem strange balloba have seen at poona be likely enough that a think over will remember that be in dress altogether different from go at once to sufder if get there before tell to mount at once ride fast to meet two minute later everything be prepared wasil mounting pony rode off while harry moved away among tent in quiet spot behind one of threw off upper garment stood in ordinary undress of hindoo peasant having nothing on scanty loincloth have scarcely accomplished when heard trampling of horse saw past tent four trooper ride up to spot have just left where be trader who keep tent one of shouted be spy have order to arrest harry waited to hear more walked in opposite direction taking care to maintain leisurely stride to avoid appearance of haste then going down to road by side of bazaar be encamped mingled with crowd there presently one of trooper dashed up have anyone seen man in dress of trader roughly described attire of harry have rid there be general chorus of denial from standing round trooper again galloped on harry continued walk at leisurely pace stopping occasionally to look at article exposed for sale until reached end of bazaar then made across country trumpet be blowing now in camp have doubt that balloba have ordered thorough search to be made for did not quicken pace however until well out of sight then broke into swinging trot for guessed that when be not found in camp party of cavalry must start to scour country have gone four mile when looking behind saw about twenty horseman far back along road country here be flat open with field irrigated by canal running from moola affording opportunity for concealment hitherto have be running well within power now quickened pace ran at full speed calculated that wasil must have at least hour start of that a must urge pony to top of speed must by time have joined sufder be sure that latter must not lose instant before starting to meet have hesitated for moment whether must break into quiet walk allow trooper to overtake relying upon alteration of costume reflected that balloba might have foreseen that must change disguise have ordered arrest of young man with curiously light eye harry have always attempted to conceal feature a far a possible by staining eyelash deep black when looked up colour of eye must hardly fail to strike anyone specially noticing constant exercise a boy have given great swiftness of foot year passed a shikaree have added to endurance speed divested of clothing a be felt sure that horseman who be more than mile in rear when first caught sight of must not overtake for time be running a knew for life for be certain that if caught balloba must have at once put to death a spy although hardy of great endurance mahratta horse be small in size be not accustomed to being put to top of speed except for short charge five mile that have galloped already must have to extent fatigued after running at top of speed for about mile looked back party be still long distance in rear again pressed forward exertion be telling upon before have gone half mile mahratta have approached within little more than half distance far ahead thought must perceive body of horseman be nearly two mile away must be overtaken before must reach therefore turned suddenly off took to one of little bank dividing one irrigated field from a soon a horseman reached spot where have left road too turned off harry who be now husbanding strength saw sudden confusion among little bank of earth on be running be foot wide be softened by water soaked in from side must bear weight well enough not that of mounted man only one two have attempted to follow others have plunged into field here horse at once sank up to knee endeavoured to force animal on others to regain road have quitted two horseman on bank be making better progress horse hoof sank deeply in soft earth pace in spite of exertion of rider be slow one harry turned when came to end of field followed bank at right angle be therefore now running in right direction be more than keeping lead from foremost of pursuer of others galloped along road parallel to ahead horseman have first seen be now within mile on came at top of speed trooper on road halted not knowing whether body be friend foe while on bank reined in horse rode back to join comrade harry continued to run till came to bank leading to road following arrived there just a sufder galloped up with party one of trooper leading horse gave shout of welcome a came up thought must be sufder said from way ran rather than from attire will charge fellow think not harry said in first place scindia have not a yet declared war against nana bajee in second there may be more men coming on behind therefore will be best to leave alone though if attack will of course defend think be intention puntojee see have gathered together suppose dare go back say that have escaped give sword spear latter be part of regular equipment of mahratta horseman sufder handed sword a pursuer advanced towards at canter speedily became gallop took place by side of sufder latter giving word band dashed forward to meet opponent combat be short one sufder follower be picked men be better mounted than scindia trooper made special effort to get at harry latter skill with sword enabled to free from most pressing opponent sufder laid about stoutly men seconding well opponent be speedily struck to ground rest turning horse fled at full speed sufder men must have followed shouted to to draw rein enough have be done well done said if scindia mean war nothing will be said about fight if doe not complaint will doubtless be laid against be better that must be able to say that fought only in self defence that when attack ceased allowed to ride off unmolested though might easily enough have slain whole of on arriving at grove where troop have halted harry at once resumed own clothes for although in early day have be accustomed to be slightly clad felt ill at ease riding almost naked here too found wasil who have ridden with such speed that pony be too much exhausted for to ride back with rest received master with greatest joy for have feared must be captured before leaving camp continued journey to jooneer where halted for night sufder went to house harry rode out to farm chapter british resident a harry drew rein at farm soyera ran out followed by brother anundee with cry of joy at unexpected return be nearly fifteen month since have last seen though have when opportunity offered sent message to assuring that be well hoped ere long to be able to come over to see must scarce have known said in fine clothes of yours sent word that be officer in peishwa service hardly thought that must be so much changed have grown great deal be now much taller than ramdass son worthy farmer anundee be also delighted to see how long be going to stay former asked only till tomorrow at daybreak have to ride forward with haste to poona for have be on mission for nana furnuwees surely be not so important that can not stay few hour puntojee be of importance may have known nana have placed bajee rao on musnud have installed a minister thereby defeating plan of balloba scindia who will probably come along here with whole force in day two late that evening when others have retired to bed soyera harry have long talk together have thought harry asked after speaking for time about doings position at court of joining people again there be peace between peishwa court english there be british resident at poona a have now gained certain rank there must go to with much better face than if have come direct from here a peasant then must probably have be supposed that be impostor that be english of course must be seen by skin might have be thought that have adopted english child be now trying to pas off a son of officer think mother have best continue for time a be see have at present nothing in common with english except blood be war to break out between mahratta bombay must at once declare to resident here go down to bombay even then position must be doubtful one unless be to enlist in army see how must maintain moreover must remember have now deep interest in matter here nana furnuwees have treated with much kindness placed confidence in have many enemy a have told scindia be about to advance against poona be probable that may succeed in driving nana into exile imprisoning for life establishing balloba other person devoted to interest a minister in case scindia must be absolutely supreme nothing must persuade to desert nana who have for many year alone withstood ambition of scindia party say for moment that aid must be of slightest use to at rate will see be not ungrateful for kindness will be faithful to in misfortune a have be kind to when in power be right soyera said cause of nana be cause of in part of deccan for must be infinitely worse off be scindia to lay hand on there be alternative by must at once remain faithful to nana prepare way for joining english when considered that time for doing so have arrived what be soyera might go to english resident tell who be how have be brought up say that at present wish to remain in service of nana who have be good friend to with whom sympathy like of nearly cultivator in peishwa dominion accord say that hope when time come to return to countryman in meantime will give information in power a to what be going on subject only to friendship for nana thus by making useful to resident may prepare way for joining countryman at same time be able to remain with nana until be victorious over enemy cause be really lost plan be excellent one harry said will certainly adopt undoubtedly feeling among english must be in favour of bajee rao nana a bajee be son of rugoba be natural ally moreover must object most strongly to see scindia become master of whole mahratta power must probably use against at first opportunity must a say greatly facilitate obtaining fair position among english might also be able to do nana service of course have seen english resident many time in street of poona more than once on special occasion at mahdoo rao court a be business to know something of connected with palace be probable that may have heard of at rate must be easier to explain to position than must be to go down a stranger to bombay where must be ignorant a to whom must first approach how to declare matter have very often thought over next morning troop started at daybreak riding fast reached poona by noon harry went at once to report what have seen to nana received letter yesterday minister said news be indeed bad purseram bhow have offered to go out to give battle to scindia force must have chance not only be scindia army much larger have infantry regiment commanded by foreign officer against infantry must not prevail must be madness to risk fighting under such circumstance wheel may turn ere long may be in position to thwart scheme of scindia balloba nana have never be conspicuous for personal courage though moral courage ability to meet storm be unbounded be now old man dreaded shock of battle when chance appeared to be so much against must not depend upon support of bajee who have already shown willing to side with strongest to make term for without slightest regard for who have befriended if excellency doe not think of fighting what course will pursue will leave country at once said if stop here know that balloba who be personal enemy will have put to death only need time to recover from sudden misfortune must be madness for to wait here to fall into power of enemy purseram bhow be greatly offended because will not allow to fight who have for so many year done best to prevent civil war in country war however ended must break up mahratta power must not bring horror upon poona be against that balloba be marching if retire bloodshed will be altogether averted will accompany puntojee asked almost wistfully assuredly will do so sir think that can answer for sufder who have know great regard for excellency a to have little hope must escape unharmed if balloba arrive here before leave detected even in disguise in camp have narrow escape for party of cavalry pursued must probably have caught have not sufder with band met defeated with loss of number may be sure that balloba will learn who be in command sufder life must be safer than own may ask when excellency be going to leave poona scout be sent out yesterday a soon a letter be read directly scindia army get in motion will receive news when do will leave horse will be saddled in readiness will be at edge of ghauts by time scindia arrives here can tell sufder to come at once know disposition of captain of various troop will be able to tell who can be depended upon sufder be indeed outside palace having told harry that must wait until have learned result of interview with nana harry briefly related to conversation with minister think be right said purseram bhow be stout fighter be a brave a lion scindia force must be double that must gather at short notice nana doe right not to risk everything on chance of single fight be wily old fox have got safely through danger must have crushed ordinary man will see that before long will be back again reinstated in power at rate will accompany after thrashing gave balloba horseman head must not be safe here hour after arrival on road harry have informed of decision at have arrived upon soyera advice sufder agreed that must certainly be wise step accordingly when latter entered palace harry went straight to british residency sent in native name to mr malet asked for interview be at once shown in wish to speak to sir resident said in mahratta language think have seen at mahdoo rao court have seen excellency there harry replied in same language then seeing that resident spoke language with difficulty went on in english be matter chiefly personal to myself resident looked at in surprise for be first time have heard mahratta speaking english be son of major lindsay who with wife escort be murdered by party of mahratta seventeen year ago at time when english army be advancing against poona be saved by fidelity of ayah who have be in family for ten year cousin of hers be fortunately one of leader of party who attacked camp with connivance carried off made way back to family near jooneer stained skin a see allowed to be supposed that have married in bombay be own child have brought up with intention of rejoining countryman a soon a became man for did not see how until then must earn living among stranger taught a much a knew of language religion of english when be twelve took down to bombay left for two year half in house of mr sankey lady who taught of child of officer there when left bombay be able to speak english a well a other english boy of age nurse have from earliest time can remember encouraged in taking part in sport game when be eight soldier cousin of hers began to teach first exercise in arm continued to work at until went down to bombay on return spent time for month in riding shooting after be for year with famous shikaree took part in killing of many tiger other wild beast be fortunate for when through relation of nurse be introduced to nana furnuwees by to mahdoo rao latter be pleased to take fancy for appointed to charge of game preserve at present moment have just returned from mission in disguise to scindia camp nana have shown great kindness intention be to remain with until have passed through present difficulty be very serious after hope to be able to go to bombay to obtain commission in company service remember well circumstance of murder of major lindsay wife for be in bombay at time be matter of deep regret to for be greatly liked at time everyone be excited over infamous treaty of wurgaum remember when party be sent out on receiving news of attack body of major wife be found a also of servant sowars be reported that trace must be discovered of infant of ayah be thought possible that have escaped hope be entertained that woman might have carried off charge have doubt a to truth of story be nurse still alive be sir a be also man who assisted name be sufder command troop of peishwa cavalry will testify at right time to truth of statement can more readily believe resident said inasmuch a in spite of colour can perceive certain likeness to major lindsay whom knew intimately intention in coming to see now sir be to offer to furnish information to concerning movement plan of nana furnuwees so far a such information must do harm heard that there have be discussion between nana purseram bhow latter wishing to give battle to scindia think nana be right in refusing to sanction for from hear scindia army be very much stronger be sir must say that purseram army must hardly be depended upon to fight under such circumstance what be nana going to do be going to retire a soon a scindia army be fairly in motion be in awkward position mr malet said have reinstated several time when seemed that everything be lost have great respect for ability be only man who can curb ambition of scindia minister scindia entire supremacy must be most unwelcome to for indeed be only owing to mutual jealousy of three great chief of mahratta nation that have gained success be whole power in one hand must certainly lose surat probably bassein salsette have to fight hard to hold bombay will be very glad to receive report can supply with for be next to impossible to obtain anything like trustworthy information here only hear what be desired that must know late change have come a complete surprise to for what news do obtain be more often than not false unfortunately truth be virtue almost unknown among mahratta have perfect genius for intrigue consider perfectly justifiable to deceive not only enemy friend when do think of declaring mr lindsay will remain with nana so long a there be slightest chance of success unless indeed course of affair must lead to english intervening in trouble then in case declare against nana must feel duty to leave at once think there be probability of policy have be to support a peishwa minister against scindia holkar will of course report appearance to authority at bombay be sure there will be disposition to advance view for sake of father moreover knowledge of language of mahratta be of course perfect must not have maintained deception so long will of be strong recommendation in favour after thanking mr malet for kindness harry returned to sufder camp gave account of interview with resident be satisfactory indeed puntojee show wisdom of step took now a to affair here have mentioned name of five captain of troop of whom can think be relied upon however be now going out to see have only be waiting for return six hundred men be small body be beginning have doubt that others will join nana later on be not sufficiently sure of sentiment to open matter to be essential that suspicion of nana intention to leave town must get about there might be riot in city possibly of captain who have not received promotion regard a due might try to gain scindia favour by arresting on following day messenger arrived from nana requesting sufder to place with troop such other captain a must rely upon on road mile west of poona must leave town quietly with small body of friend join there sufder at once sent off five of men with order to captain whom have seen on previous afternoon within hour six hundred men be gathered at point indicated hour later party of horseman be seen coming along furnuwees soon rode up accompanied by several of strongest adherent officer be gathered at head of troop nana drawing rein said to thanks for fidelity will not forget hope when time come to reward a deserves motioned to harry to join scindia army be to march morning said horseman will be here by tomorrow evening at latest rode to satara where nana have arranged to stop until received news from purseram bhow a to course of event at poona two day later messenger rode in with news that scindia have arrived near poona have have friendly interview with bajee rao balloba have seen purseram have pretended great friendship for old soldier be by mean deceived by protestation if have only to do with scindia nana said matter must be easily arranged young rajah be only puppet in minister hand several day passed then letter came from purseram said that balloba have resolved to oppose bajee rao to have minister peishwa of own nomination that proposed to that mahdoo rao widow must adopt chimnajee a son that bajee must be placed in confinement that purseram bhow must be minister asked be advice a to what course must take stated that balloba have said be greatly influenced in method proposed by hope of rendering in degree acceptable to nana a latter have only placed bajee rao on musnud a mean of checkmating scindia advised purseram to accept offer pointed out absolute necessity for retaining bajee in own custody purseram omitted to follow portion of advice formal reconciliation took place by letter between balloba nana latter be invited to proceed at once to poona on finding that purseram have allowed balloba to retain bajee in hand suspected that whole be scheme to entice into power of enemy therefore made excuse for not going bajee ignorant of plot have be planned went to scindia camp to remonstrate against heavy demand for money on account of expense to scindia have be put to astonishment be then there made prisoner chimnajee positively refused to become party to usurpation of brother right be compelled by threat to ascend musnud on day after installation purseram bhow wrote proposing that nana must come to poona to meet balloba to assume civil administration of new peishwa government while command of troop military arrangement must remain a stood in reply nana requested that purseram must send son hurry punt to settle preliminary instead of coming a envoy hurry punt left poona with over five thousand chosen horse naturally excited nana suspicion be strengthened by letter from rao phurkay who be in command of peishwa household troop warning to seek safety without moment delay now that saw that half measure be no longer possible nana ceased to be irresolute when fortune seemed to men to be desperate commenced series of successful intrigue astonished india have quietly increased force during week of waiting since have left poona have ample fund having carried away with immense treasure accumulated during long year of government there be time to be lost a soon a received letter of warning left town of waee made for concan a soon a reached ghauts set whole of force to block pass by rolling great stone down into road in addition strong barricade be constructed force of two hundred men left at point to defend infantry have recruited threw into fort of raygurh added strongly to defence balloba have proposed that nana must be followed without delay offered of scindia best troop for purpose purseram acting in accordance with advice of of nana friend raised objection have now however resolved to break altogether with minister whose timidity at critical moment be considered by a proof that must never again be formidable accordingly gave up nana estate to scindia took possession of house property in poona for own use after remaining for few day waiting event sending off many messenger nana sent for harry have mission for said be one requires daring great intelligence know one to whom must be better committed than to see that owing to turn event have taken bajee rao be natural ally have suffered at hand of balloba be prisoner in scindia camp though a understand free to move about in privately received hint bajee recognizes doubtless belief that be powerless to help either in be mistaken have be in communication with holkar who be alarmed at ever increasing power of scindia will throw whole power into scale to aid rajah of berar kolapoore have engaged to aid for same reason nizam will sign treaty be agreed upon between time since rao phurkay have engaged to bring peishwa household troop over when signal be given more than have through ryajee patal who be enemy of balloba opened negotiation with scindia offering estate of purseram bhow fort of surrenuggar with territory yielding ten lakh on condition of placing balloba in confinement re establishing bajee rao on musnud returning with troop to own territory have doubt that when bajee rao hears will be glad enough to throw heartily into cause may tell that be apparently guest rather than prisoner that have camp of own in centre of of scindia therefore when have once made way into encampment will have difficulty in obtaining private interview with be necessary that must have money silver must be too heavy for to carry will give bag containing thousand gold mohurs will enable to begin work of privately raising troop will undertake business sir only person fear in smallest degree be balloba must disguise so that will not recognize without delay harry mounted horse placed two bag of money have be handed to in wallet behind saddle exchanged dress for of one of sufder trooper then started for poona reached next day did not enter town put up at cultivator two mile distant from want to hire cart with two bullock said to man can furnish one a know must require money paid down a guarantee that will be returned that can give will leave horse here be fully worth waggon ox however will leave with hundred rupee may not keep waggon many day after be dark harry went to town purchased paint other thing that required for disguise having used went to house of british resident on stating who be be shown in mr malet did not recognize in roughly dressed countryman young officer who have called upon before be harry lindsay being in poona called upon to give information recognize by voice resident said fear that there be nothing of importance that can tell now that nana furnuwees be homeless bajee rao be no longer peishwa nana be not done with yet sir why be fugitive with handful of troop under have brain sir be worth more than army believe if go well will not be long before be back in poona a minister to peishwa minister to chimnajee sir minister to bajee rao must that be so mr malet said since one be fugitive other prisoner see chance whatever of such transformation will briefly tell sir what be preparing bajee feeling certain that will ere long be sent to fortress have communicated with nana imploring to aid if have turned to nana for support be mad acting a balloba tool on contrary sir think that doing so show that recognizes nana ability feel ere long may become useful ally already nana have be at work holkar who naturally view with intense jealousy scindia entire control of territory of peishwa have already agreed to put whole army in field rao phurkay will rebel with household troop what be vastly more important scindia have embraced nana offer of large sum of money grant of territory to arrest balloba to replace bajee on musnud in addition to have won over rajah of berar have incited rajah of kolapoore to attack district of purseram bhow have obtained nizam approbation of treaty have already be settled between nana nizam general basis of be that bajee be to be re established with nana a minister on other hand territory formerly seized by peishwa to be restored mission here be to inform bajee rao of plan have be prepared to obtain from solemn engagement that nana will be reappointed a minister on success of plan mr malet listened to harry with increasing astonishment be important news indeed said marvellous of highest importance to already have be asked by council of bombay to give opinion a to whether be expedient to render assistance to nana furnuwees be to almost a important a to nana that scindia must not obtain supreme power have replied must not recommend such step for nana cause seemed altogether lost that aid to must be absolutely useless must only serve scindia with pretext for declaring war against of course what have told entirely alters situation will not be necessary for council to assist nana can give fair word even if balloba must win day will have ground for accusing of having aided nana be impossible to overlook value of communication mr lindsay can promise that will not find government of bombay ungrateful for will relieve of anxiety progress of event here have caused on leaving residency harry returned to farm where have left horse early next morning put on disguise again painted line round eye touched of hair of eyebrow with white paint mixed white horsehair with tuft on top of head dropped little juice of plant resembling belladonna used at time by lady in east to dilate pupil of eye make dark brilliant in eye soyera have told of herb when related to how balloba have detected by lightness of eye be greatly surprised at alteration effected in appearance felt assured that even balloba must not again recognize bought dozen sack of grain from farmer placing in bullock cart started for scindia camp have during night buried gold for thought that until knew ground must feel certain of entering bajee rao camp unquestioned must be better that there must be nothing in cart be searched to betray carried in hand long staff universally used by bullock driver passing through poona arrived hour later at camp be pitched three mile from city a large number of cart with forage provision arrived daily in camp for use of troop attention be paid to on enquiring for encampment of bajee rao one of whose officer have said purchased grain for horse of officer escort soon found spot be on somewhat rising ground in centre of camp be much larger than have expected to find a beyond being prevented from leaving bajee have full liberty be even permitted to have of friend round two three dozen trooper of household regiment in charge of be young officer who be well known to harry during time of mahdoo rao seeing standing in front of tent harry stopped cart opposite to leaving went up to where will unload cart asked know nothing about officer said who have ordered supply will be welcome enough for be very short of forage then changing tone harry said know nujeef be friend puntojee impossible other said incredulously be so be not here for amusement a may guess be on private mission to bajee rao will inform that be here dare not say whom come from even to can explain fully to will let know certainly puntojee there be little doubt that balloba have spy here will be necessary to arrange that meeting will not be noticed do sit down here by cart a if waiting for order where to unload will go across to bajee tent see nujeef accordingly went over to rajah tent returned in quarter of hour bajee will see said first unload grain in line of cavalry place in front of bullock leave there then cross to tent next to bajee be occupied by one of officer who carry purse make payment must be watched must seem that be only going there to receive price of grain bajee will slip out of rear of tent enter next in same way officer be at present absent so that can talk without anyone having idea that bajee be together harry carried out arrangement after leaving bullock made way to spot indicated found young rajah have gone there be puntojee latter said saw few time rao phurkay have often mentioned name to a being one who stood high in confidence of cousin mahdoo nujeef tell that have private communication to make to indeed can well believe that must not thus disguise unless business be important be highness nana furnuwees have received message reciprocates expression of friendship have sent here to let know that time be approaching when deliverance from balloba can be achieved then delivered message with have be entrusted bajee face became radiant a went on be news indeed said that phurkay be faithful to knew thought that be only friend have left truly nana furnuwees be great man will gladly give undertaking asks for in event of succeeding in placing on musnud will be minister with same authority power that have under mahdoo have at farmhouse where be stopping thousand gold mohurs nana have sent to enable to begin preparation urge that must be extremely careful for a see by what have told have ample power to carry out plan without assistance from be most important that nothing will be done can arouse suspicion of balloba until be ready for final stroke have not brought with today a knew not how vigilant might be in camp be possible that sack of grain might be examined a however passed in without question will bring when next come will be in two day suppose there be objection to telling phurkay what be being done none at highness have not yet be informed though communication have passed between nana although latter be well convinced of devotion thought safer that one must know extent of plot until be in readiness two day later harry made journey to camp time with bag of money hidden among grain in one of sack saw bajee rao a before received from paper with undertaking required by nana sack containing money be put down where bajee horse be picketed be there opened by confidential servant who carried bag into tent be close by a be leaving camp harry have reason to congratulate on precaution that have taken for met balloba riding along with number of officer harry have with change of costume assumed appearance of age walked by side of bullock stooping greatly leaning on staff minister passed without even glancing at harry on return paid farmer for hire of cart latter be well pleased for in addition to money so earned have charged good price for two waggon load of grain harry then put off peasant dress resumed that of trooper rode back to raygurh where reported to nana success of mission chapter down to bombay harry stay with nana be short one a in three day be again sent to poona time be to take up

send to distant fortress must seriously upset plan for must have to retain chimnajee in power a representative of brother know that be placed on musnud greatly in opposition to wish certainly hailed with pleasure prospect of bajee release still must not be same thing for minister of peishwa can rule without question by people acting only a minister to representative of peishwa must be far more severely criticised be certain that to raise money for paying sum have be agreed upon extra taxation must be put on odium resulting from must fall upon two officer received harry cordially have personally known a nana representative must have treated with much honour have not be pointed out to that might be fatal to plan for did balloba hear that strange officer be being so treated by must be sure to set at once about finding out who be what be doing there matter be going on well said old general manajee phurkay who be one of rugoba devoted adherent be now staying in bajee camp be enlisting men for service where be being assembled in bajee camp be not interfered with there appears to be very rash proceeding harry said be true that bajee have apparent liberty can have with in camp many of friend gathering of armed men can scarcely escape eye of so keen observer a balloba illustration harry saw party of soldier coming along road few day later harry being out one evening saw party of soldier coming along road from direction of scindia camp be unusual for in order to prevent plundering order be stringent that none of scindia troop must enter poona hurried back to house acquainted two leader with what have seen be inclined to laugh at apprehension when body of horseman be seen coming down street issued order for door to be closed barricaded there be twenty men in house when officer who commanded detachment summoned to open door to deliver two noble to be met by decided refusal from chief from upper window officer then ordered men to dismount break open door when attempted to do so be met by fire of musketry from window many fell officer seeing that house must not be taken except by force much larger than at command rode off at full speed with survivor to scindia camp sooner have gone than horse be brought out from stable two officer with ten of trooper rode off at full speed harry refused to accompany a wished to see what have really happened in order to carry news to nana therefore rode out to farmhouse where have before stayed left horse there returned to poona here heard that rao phurkay have be seized that bajee rao encampment be surrounded by troop who suffered none to enter leave next morning went over there found that a supply of water have be cut off garrison have surrendered being allowed to depart with exception of bajee over whom strong guard have be placed before left manajee phurkay gave direction to gather in neighbourhood of waee did so be joined at once by two chief nana promptly sent supply of money telling to take up position at salpee ghaut where be speedily joined by ten thousand men openly declared for bajee rao in meantime balloba believing that whole plot be work of bajee rao determined to despatch a prisoner to fortress in heart of scindia dominion sent off with strong escort under charge of officer named sukaram ghatgay who although having command only of troop of one hundred horse belonged to ancient honourable family balloba must hardly have made worse choice ghatgay have daughter who be reported to be of exceptional beauty young scindia have asked father for hand ghatgay ambitious enterprising man have given no decided answer not from real hesitation for saw how enormous must be advantage to of alliance in order to increase scindia ardour by pretended opposition so to secure best term possible for reason gave must appear natural to mahratta of good blood a none of must have given daughter of house to one who however high in rank have ancestor belonging to low caste upon way bajee who be aware of scindia wish be most anxious to obtain goodwill urged ghatgay to give daughter in marriage after much pretended hesitation latter agreed to do so on condition that bajee must authorize to promise large sum of money a soon a again ascended musnud that must get prince to appoint prime minister post must be vacant at overthrow of balloba being arranged bajee rao pretended that be seriously ill ghatgay therefore halted with escort on bank of paira taking with disguise a countryman harry a soon a learned that ghatgay have started with bajee mounted followed travelled at little distance in rear of party until halted then went to house of cultivator left horse there exchanged dress a fighting man for of countryman there be occasion for now to disguise age darken eye a before hired cart bought grain for forage sack of rice other thing boldly entered ghatgay camp a price asked be low ghatgay purchased whole content of cart when be cleared harry left cattle wandered about saying that animal needed hour rest presently passed bajee rao who be standing listlessly at door of tent be puntojee harry said a passed followed with horse might help to escape stay talk to here young prince said will seem be only passing time in asking question about country wanted to ascertain road by will travel after crossing river have money with will endeavour to raise force of forty fifty men with to make sudden attack upon camp after will bring good horse with if will run out when hear uproar will ride up with spare horse will leap on to back can gallop off be brave fellow puntojee thank heartily for offer happily stand in need of have gained ghatgay over will linger here until hear that balloba have be arrested that nana furnuwees be approaching poona believe will never forget offer fidelity have prompted when be established a peishwa will if plea have post at court may desire thank much prince be officer of nana know that in acting a have done be acting in interest a well a yours be glad that necessity for making attack upon camp be obviated might have have considerable trouble in raising sufficient force for purpose for even most reckless must hesitate to fall on one of scindia officer in next place although doubt not must have be able to carry off ghatgay must a soon a have beaten off attacking party have set out in pursuit raised whole country difficulty of reaching western ghauts must have be immense hope to see highness at poona so saying strolled carelessly back to bullock cart waited till animal have finished feed then drove off again returned cart to owner started again for poona on arrival there went to residency informed mr malet bajee have gained over officer who be escorting be ready to come back to poona a soon a blow be struck will be struck soon mr malet said be in readiness sent report on to council urging that a seemed likely that bajee rao must soon be on musnud must express readiness to recognize received despatch only yesterday saying that perfectly agreed with have already sent off messenger to nana stating willingness to recognize bajee a lawful heir to late peishwa thing be working well nizam general have be ordered to watch purseram bhow who be raising troop for purpose of aiding in crushing bajee supporter holkar scindia troop also be in readiness to move after fete of dussera regular battalion in peishwa service commanded by mr boyd will march to neera bridge brigade of scindia regular will move against raygurh be evident that balloba purseram have slightest suspicion of what be going on must never have despatched troop from here certainly have felt very uneasy since bajee be carried away for be necessary figure must be here a soon a nana arrives otherwise there must be recognized head must have be hopeless to try to deliver once imprisoned in one of strong fortress in scindia dominion latter must have made term for that chose to dictate news have relieved of anxiety think probable that everything will now be managed without bloodshed that may for time have peace here next morning harry rode off rejoined nana who thanked warmly for manner in have carried out mission especially for offer to attempt to rescue bajee from captor must have be greatest misfortune said have be carried far away must have be obliged to recognize brother chimnajee scindia having bajee in hand must have kept up constant pressure might probably have marched to poona to restore must certainly have succeeded in doing for feeling of population must have be in favour of lawful heir a token of satisfaction here be order upon treasurer for fifty thousand rupee being ready scindia on th of october suddenly arrested balloba sent body of troop with of nizam general for purpose of seizing purseram bhow latter receiving news of what have happened in good time taking with chimnajee fled to fortress be quickly pursued obliged to surrender bajee rao be brought back to beema eighteen mile from poona brother amrud rao phurkay be also released nana joined army at salpee ghaut scindia infantry under mr boyd marched for capital nana refused to enter however until have received formal declaration from bajee that intended treachery against pledge be given treaty be at same time entered into by nizam scindia agreeing to establish bajee rao on musnud reinstate nana a prime minister matter being settled nana returned to poona from have be absent for nearly year resumed duty of prime minister fortnight later bajee rao be solemnly invested a peishwa one of first act be to send for harry to whom gave robe of honour thirty thousand rupee in money in token of gratitude for risk have run in communicating with for daring proposal to rescue from hand of escort on day after nana re entry into capital harry received note from mr malet asking to call expect colonel palmer to relieve of duty here in course of day two need scarcely say will be glad to be released from work be surrounded with infinite difficulty constantly upset human calculation nana be in power again turn of wheel may take place at moment may again be exile possibly prisoner seems to that must be well for to accompany to bombay remembrance of service will be fresh can not be recognized by council that body be frequently changed in two three year time there will be fresh men who will know nothing of what have happened now be indisposed to rake up old report letter to reward past service especially a whole position here may have altered dozen time before will gladly do so sir thank very heartily for kindness will ride over to jooneer tomorrow bring old nurse down with have doubt sufder will be willing to accompany have rendered good service to nana latter will be sure grant leave of absence for a long a may be necessary think must certainly be best to take down if possible must make affidavit in bombay must place beyond doubt that be major lindsay son be morally certain that there be relative of father mother still living in england say that require assistance from when return home a everyone doe two three time in course of indian service must be pleasant to find friend there must be well that position must be established beyond question will gladly go down with soyera said when harry laid matter before be happy contented here must be glad to see bombay again be home for ten year be very glad have made up mind to go for be time that must take place among countryman recommendation of resident at court of poona be a good one a must wish for must say that have better give up at once staining skin can see that have not used dye for day must be a well to recover proper colour before mr malet introduces to council at bombay will ride down to town harry said engage gharry native carriage to carry to poona when get there will learn what route mr malet will take how fast will travel will then see will be best for to go down in gharry to be carried in dhoolie palanquin will cost money harry be well provided with fund harry said for nana bajee rao have made handsome present for service rendered there be therefore reason why must not travel in comfort arrived at poona two day later harry having ascertained that new resident must not arrive until next day that must probably wish mr malet to defer departure for at least two day in order to give experience of faction intrigue there of character of who be likely to influence event rode to see nana who have not yet returned to poona have come excellency said to tell that be wish to retire from public service minister looked greatly surprised why puntojee said sound like madness young a be have secured powerful protector in peishwa may hope to reach high office in state a grow older know though went on speaking to rather than to lad high office be thing to be desired mean being mixed up in intrigue of kind being object of jealousy hatred running terrible risk of ruin at change in government here then turned again to harry what be thinking of doing will speak frankly to highness be not mahratta a everyone else suppose be son of english parent then went on to give account of killing of father mother of how be saved by soyera brought up a son until such time a might with advantage go down to bombay nana listened with great interest be strange tale said when harry brought story to conclusion explains thing have at time surprised in first place colour of eye always struck a peculiar then figure be not that of countryman there be many a tall a have not width of shoulder strong build lastly have wondered how young mahratta must be endowed with so much energy readiness be willing to take heavy responsibility on shoulder to be so full of resource now that have told story think be right to go down join own people everything be disturbed nothing be certain from day to day here be fugitive short time ago ere long may again be exile moreover one can tell what may happen to people be quarrelling with tippoo a quarrelled with father hyder think that before long be possible will overthrow take possession of territory be various power of india united must not be so english will always find ready to enter into alliance with will so enlarge dominion mahratta may laugh at idea of being overthrown by such small army a english general command constant dissension mutual jealousy between holkar scindia peishwa rajah of berar others will prevent ever acting together may be that will be conquered piecemeal have watched very closely have taken place in southern india in bengal have seen handful of trader gradually swallowing up native power seems to that may well be that in time may become master of india be to say a much to of prince must scoff at prediction have be business to learn what be passing elsewhere have agent at madras calcutta report be ever that power of english be increasing few year ago seemed that french be going to carry before like native prince have gone down before english who seem moreover to get on better than french with native to win respect liking well young sir will be sorry to lose because while with good reason be seldom able to trust to give absolute confidence to of around have always felt must wholly rely on during past year have seen much of have freely told plan to a have done to others have chosen for mission must not with safety have entrusted to of own follower knowing that scindia holkar must be ready to pay great sum for secret none except bajee to whom sent with particular be aware of extent of plan be in communication with more than one of rajah have played part marvellously well for must not have deemed possible that one of race must live so long among without exciting suspicion while remain in bombay hope that will act a confidential agent ask to divulge secret may learn relating to project connected with deccan must like to be informed a to course of affair generally of course dealing with council there must be carried on through english resident there be much information respecting view of council with regard to tippoo nizam bengal will be valuable for to know must not so act excellency without permission from council must imagine that must not be averse to such arrangement especially a perhaps must give private information a to state of party here such a must not care to tell resident certainly must do so change resident so frequently that must be impossible for new men to really understand situation with intimate knowledge of poona must readily grasp of course arrangement must only be temporary a own position be so uncertain in case life can not now be long one must propose that salary a private agent be thousand rupee month thank much sir if stay at bombay obtain permission of council to correspond with will readily undertake part can have little objection to arrangement a doubtless have agent in bombay already certainly have be native necessarily can only send rumour current in bazaar known generally to public news be for most part worthless have favour to request harry said namely that will give leave of absence to sufder in order that may accompany to bombay old nurse must alone substantiate birth identity must be necessary for to give evidence before legal authority will readily do sufder be honest faithful can rely upon absolutely for anything in sphere of duty have only today appointed to command of two hundred men although have hand ready to strike have brain capable of planning have not be so must before have raised to higher position when return from bombay will grant revenue of village of will be patal mayor so that in old age will be able to live in comfort on leaving minister harry went to sufder camp beo be back again puntojee yes have brought soyera down with have great news to tell soldier went on will not be news to sufder know that command have be doubled that will now be captain of two hundred men can tell much more than that be to accompany down to bombay day after tomorrow so a to give evidence about birth furthermore nana will on return bestow upon jagheer revenue of village district so that a say when grow too old for service will be able to live comfortably be good news indeed better even than be to have command of two hundred men for in truth be beginning to be weary of service be now nearly fifty feel growing stiff nothing must please more than to be patal of village community of hold jagheer however so long a nana life retains power will remain soldier at death will serve other master will take to country life again doe nana know that be english yes have told story be obliged to give reason for resigning a nana have support of government of bombay there be risk in doing so how long will be before get quite rid of colour sufder can not say must think that in fortnight greater part of will have faded out maybe soyera know of something will remove more rapidly soyera when asked said that knew of nothing must remove dye at once that if washed hand face two three time day with strong lye made from ash of plant grows everywhere on plain must help to get rid of will go out tomorrow morning fetch in when have made lye mixed with oil made very strong soap how do mean to dress to go down harry have choice even if have must ride out of here in best court suit change for english clothes when got down ghauts may have to come up here again for aught know be better therefore that one must know that be english mr malet however solved difficulty for when in evening harry went to enquire about time that must start said have be thinking of offering suit to ride down in unfortunately clothes must be great deal too small for however think that after be best must go down a be in first place must not show to advantage in english clothes in must feel tight uncomfortable at first in second place think that be perhaps a well that council must see a be then must better understand how have be able to pas a mahratta year will introduce now to colonel palmer be important that must know for possibly may be sent up here on mission other for having favour of nana must be specially fitted accordingly next morning started early soyera have prepared liquid soap a be decided that must go in native dress harry thought a well not to use especially a dye be gradually wearing off party consisted of mr malet sufder harry with escort of ten cavalryman belonging to one of native regiment mission clerk have be transferred to colonel palmer a knowledge of affair must be useful to newcomer soyera be carried in dhoolie followed close behind trooper evening descended ghauts into concan encamped there on following day rode into bombay where mr malet took to hotel principally used by native of rank visiting bombay have best stay here till send for said to harry will see of council tonight doubt there will be formal meeting tomorrow to ask opinion about probability of present state of thing continuing at poona will of course tell story will likely request to go at once to see therefore leave hotel until hear from sufder have not previously visited bombay next morning early went out with soyera a guide to inspect european part of town be much struck with appearance of neatness order in fort solidity of building be strong place assuredly said to harry on return in first place must be necessary for force attacking to cross over narrow isthmus causeway uniting island with land must be impossible in face of force provided with artillery guarding then if succeeded in winning that must have to make way through native town to get on to maidan must be defended by gun from battery in addition to artillery on land might be swept by gun on board ship truly who talked about driving english into sea can not have known anything of strength of position a to carrying by assault must not be done must garrison be starved out since must always obtain supply of sort by sea yet except at causeway place have natural strength mahratta acted unwisely indeed when allowed english to settle here must not foresee future sufder now doubtless be sorry if in future british become master of india mahratta will have reason to regret having given foothold wherever power extend native be far better off than be under rule of own prince be british master there must be no more war more jealousy more intrigue peasant must till field in peace men who now take to soldiering must find more peaceful mode of earning living think surely harry for after leaving poona have be told to call so that english can ever become master of india conquered carnatic even there be not safe from foray of hyder ali mysore bar way farther north then there be nizam to be dealt with then berar mahratta then come rajputana beyond be sikh fierce chief of scinde be true that english have beaten people of lower bengal have always be looked down upon despised a cowardly effeminate by fighting men of india besides how few be white soldier say too that french have promised tippoo to send big army to help to drive english into sea french have quite work enough at home harry said be true that have got into egypt be shut up there by fleet moreover even be to cross over into arabia how must march across dry almost waterless country for thousand two of mile when arrived in scinde must find fighting men of province sikh opposed to must never be able to fight way down to mysore thing be absurd conversation be interrupted by arrival of messenger from government house with request that mr lindsay must at once attend there harry horse have be saddled in readiness be brought round for must have seemed strange for mahratta whose dress showed that held good position to go on foot sufder rode by side soyera following on foot dismounting at government house threw rein to one of lad who be waiting in readiness to hold horse of officer coming to see governor on harry mentioning name native doorkeeper said have order for to be taken at once to council chamber sahib on arrival here governor with four member of council mr malet be seated at long table mr malet rose said be mr lindsay gentleman truly sir must be difficult to recognize a fellow countryman in garb governor said though colour be somewhat le dark than of mahratta since left poona have ceased to dye sir a to dress will be last time will wear unless must be called upon to go to poona again story be most singular one governor said mr malet assures that be son of major lindsay have be telling how escaped massacre at camp how ayah have brought up have come down with sir thought that testimony must be necessary have also brought down cousin who be present at foray in father mother be killed account will be confirmed by statement do credit to mahratta food training mr lindsay mr malet have mentioned to that at one time be employed a shikaree to keep down tiger be doing havoc among villager near top of ghauts have also informed of very valuable service rendered by informing of nana furnuwees measure for regaining power replacing bajee rao on musnud intelligence saved great expenditure of money in preparing to support with certainty that by doing so might excite enmity of scindia tell also why continued so long in deccan instead of coming down here think acted very wisely have mentioned service in matter in report to board of director have said partly a recognition of partly because be son of english officer who be killed in service must at once give appointment subject to approval now sir must prefer civil military branch must much prefer military harry answered without hesitation unless indeed sir think service must be more useful in civil if be at calcutta madras there must be more scope for in civil service a hold at present little territory beyond island there be therefore few appointment affording opportunity for display of intelligence certainly posse must circumstance alter might owing to knowledge of country language be told off for civil work in emolument be very much higher than in military branch of service will at once be gazetted to rd native cavalry do duty with regiment until service be required elsewhere fresh disturbance may break out at poona in case might be attached a assistant to colonel palmer do think must be known again think must be very unlikely sir when skin have recovered proper colour be dressed in uniform feel sure one must recognize a having be officer in peishwa court very well sir then will see name in gazette tomorrow will within day so report to officer commanding regiment may say that must be well if nurse man who came down with be to draw up statement concerning birth swear to at high court might be valuable to in future after expressing thanks to governor council harry went out rode back to hotel with sufder chapter in company service there be conversation between harry sufder on way back to hotel harry saying that must tell news when soyera joined otherwise must have to go through twice rode slowly through street soyera arrived few minute after now harry said will go up to room talk matter over mr malet have be kind enough to give such favourable report of that be appointed lieutenant to rd regiment of native cavalry will be employed a assistant to resident at poona must there be fresh disturbance there be good fortune indeed sufder said wonderfully good fortune owe in first place to soyera in next to yourself see have gained greatly by taking advice remaining in deccan until fit for military service have declared who be when took down to bombay before there be saying what might have become of now first thing to do be for to go out order uniform when return will draw up in mahratti english full account of manner in be saved by soyera from being murdered how have be brought up harry have learned at governor name address of official at judge court who must get statement copied out in proper form writing when have taken down from lip of sufder soyera saw gentleman who promised that document must be ready by next day having thus put business in train harry went to call upon mr sankey did not recognize at once a soon a made known received most warmly looked a if must grow into big fellow hardly expected that must have done so soon be more than four year since left think that be likely to grow taller than be though of course will get broader then told what have happened since left how have just be appointed officer in native cavalry regiment be very glad have come now daughter have married be going to sail for england in few day whether will stay there permanently come back can not say at rate will be away at least two year must have be very sorry to have missed mr sankey have

of shakespeare play by heart must recite great many passage from writing of dean swift mr addison mr savage others next visit be to jeemajee who received with real pleasure when told who be harry have not learned did ever learn that kindly parsee have contributed hundred pound towards expense of education did know that have presented with outfit of clothes have be mean of being placed with mr

morning told about saying that must most likely come today tomorrow will have tent pitched for afternoon soldier told off a servant of course at first will have to go through somewhat unpleasant task of learning drill from what mr malet told think be not likely to be much with a from perfect knowledge of mahratti of country can do better service in staff appointment than with regiment be much fairer than have given to expect have be hard at work for last two day in getting rid of dye with have be coloured ever since be infant ah be not very noticeably darker now than other officer in regiment now will hand over to adjutant will of course mess with today can then introduce to brother officer adjutant be sent for soon entered mr lewis colonel said be mr lindsay who be gazetted to

killed here at time of advance on poona will be great acquisition to adjutant said a left tent with harry most of speak little mahratti will be very useful to have one of who be perfect in way of course have not got full kit yet will want mess jacket waistcoat can lend till get own made be ordered already be to get in couple of day be so much more important must get undress uniform to enable to begin work did not press tailor quite so much a to other clothes be ready to begin work at once sooner better harry replied then will hand over to native officer who have charge of drilling of recruit there be small yard behind barrack where european be instructed in first stage to see doing goose step must not add to respect soldier have for white officer be therefore taught such matter in private so that when come out for company drill be not quite at sea hour later harry be at work under instruction of native officer by time have finished tent have be erected for be glad to find bath ready for be much warmer down in bombay than above ghauts have be hot work drilling adjutant have chosen mahratta servant man surprise when newly joined officer addressed in own language be great a mr

for important service first impression of be favourable one be now nearly six foot in height with powerful well knit frame face be pleasant good tempered although feature be still boyish there be expression of restraint determination have be acquired from circumstance in have be placed have seen barbarous splendour of entertainment at peishwa court nothing like well ordered table now before with snow white cloth bright silver perfect appointment when meal be over colonel said a duty be over for day think must be most interesting if mr lindsay must give account of life adventure a be here must save trouble of going over story again again for be be sure like anxious to know how be that have be able year to pas a mahratta among mahratta there be general expression of agreement cheroot be lighted told story with detail when have finished colonel said be sure be obliged to lindsay have have remarkable experience few of have in course of life gone through anything like same amount of adventure to have be at age peasant boy english school boy shikaree officer in peishwa court confidential agent of nana furnuwees now british officer be indeed wonderful speaks volume for intelligence discretion can not take whole credit to myself sir have two good friend nurse not content with saving life taught english instructed in way of people even in religion continually urged to exercise in way so when day left must in bodily strength activity not be inferior to others aided by brother expended saving of year in having educated here next to owe much to sufder who first taught use of arm then presented to nana without introduction must have entered mahratta service at have gone a private soldier instead of obtaining at once post at court to mr sankey owe very much for kindness showed pain took with owe much too to mr parsee merchant yes owe much to of colonel said teaching advice must not have gone for much have not be for own energy for confidence inspired in peishwa minister what be going to do about nurse have not quite arranged a yet sir will at rate remain here for time love a mother think that so long a be quartered here will remain have already found lodging at house of woman of same caste a herself tell that be sure will be comfortable with if move go on quietly in deccan will return to brother where be thoroughly at home happy sufder will return in course of week so be greatly interested in what see here especially in shipping never having seen sea before think probably will remain for two three year with troop of two hundred men will then settle in village of surrounding country have received jagheer although not large will suffice for to live in comfort be few mile from jooneer will therefore be able to be near friend pay frequent visit to cousin ramdass in short time harry became general favourite made acquaintance of officer of regiment in garrison for romantic story speedily circulated before have be fortnight in city have received invitation to dine at mess after exciting life have led for two year felt on being released from drill life in garrison town be dull monotonous simple habit in have be brought up did not help to enjoy heavy meal at regimental mess occasionally two three other officer crossed to mainland have shooting in wild district of concan be pleased when received order from governor to call upon colonel palmer said have written requesting to send assistant a matter seem to be going on well at poona suggested that from acquaintance with people intrigue must be selected for post even have not done so must have chosen a being better fitted for than other officer here instruction be simple will watch endeavour to penetrate scheme of various faction assist colonel palmer generally be to go up in uniform sir to wear disguise similar to in came down here be matter over have be thinking have come to conclusion that will be more likely to obtain intelligence in native garb party look with jealousy upon must be chary of giving information to officer of residency therefore if have objection think that will be advantage to to assume native dress of course must not go in attire that came down in for although must not be recognized in uniform must if dressed a before must rather leave matter entirely to also manner in can proceed must also decide for whether to renew connection with nana furnuwees appears to that be only honest man in deccan only man who take patriotic view that there must be peace rest throughout country be however more willing than others that must in way interfere in affair of deccan that certainly be so sir know that be most earnest desire to posse friendship of authority of bombay have frequently told that be great admirer of english of method of government of straightforwardness sincerity with conduct business be afraid of see that where once make advance never retire be convinced that if obtained footing above ghauts there must be turning out that influence must be supreme very well mr lindsay showed such discretion judgment during residence at poona that be well content to leave matter in hand appointment a assistant to colonel palmer will carry with civil allowance of three hundred rupee month of course necessary expense will be paid must find expedient to use certain amount of bribery to obtain news require in other quarter besides of minister will refer matter to resident will of course give report to colonel palmer will be under order generally will be requested to further special mission in way in power when will start sir a soon a like mr lindsay will be ready sir a soon a clothes be made for must have one two disguise of various kind to use a most desirable of can doubt buy ready made perhaps of if so will start at

morning early will get leave to take soldier servant abdool with be sharp fellow may be useful will have to buy pony for what sort of disguise do want one be that of native soldier be easy enough a

uniform be then folded up stowed in wallet behind saddle have brought with good supply of grain for horse provision for so that might not have to stop at village rode at steady pace mounted ghauts by eleven o'clock then waited three hour to feed rest animal just a sun be setting entered poona having accomplished journey of fifty mile knowing place so well harry rode to quiet street near bazaar seeing old man at one of door asked if knew of anyone who must afford accommodation for servant can do myself man said be alone in house two merchant who have be staying here left yesterday can let have house except one room for have stable suppose sahib there be outhouse must hold two horse illustration there be little haggling over term there be little haggling over term for must have be altogether contrary to indian usage to have agreed to price without demur finally matter be arranged at price halfway between man demanded that offered by harry in short time be settled in two room of second floor harry then went out bought two thick quilted cushion used a mattress two native blanket have still provision enough for evening furniture be scanty consisting of raised bed place divan two table raised about foot from ground brass basin large earthenware jar of water harry however be too well accustomed to to consider such accommodation insufficient tomorrow said will get carpet for sitting upon will have to get copper vessel for cooking abdool presently went out returned with two large bundle of forage for horse soon afterwards lay down feeling stiff tired from unaccustomed exertion next morning harry went to residency have again painted caste mark on face completely changed appearance telling guard that have come from bombay have message for colonel palmer be shown in bring message for colonel said shortly for be at time writing despatch yes sir harry answered in mahratti have come to be assistant then be mr lindsay resident exclaimed dropping pen rising to foot received despatch yesterday saying that be coming of course remember now having seen on day came up here dress be altogether different expression of face seems so changed be result of having adopted different caste mark larger than be before with line almost cover forehead did not expect to come in disguise governor thought colonel might be of greater service in finding out what be passing in town in going elsewhere be to come up a native to officer of residency party must keep lip sealed thoroughly agree with resident said disguise differs so much from former appearance think of acquaintance of day must be likely to recognize at present be supposed to be trader have with dress of peasant small cultivator used when went into scindia camp have also dress of brahmin one of better class thought if necessary must enable to enter house of nana other leader without exciting surprise also have uniform with be staying at present in street face market at house of man named naroo be bhaskur have soldier servant with on whom can confidently rely will send with chit when have news to give can send word at what hour have better call now colonel be at order if will indicate to nature of news wish to gain person whom want watched will do best can at present know nothing of change have taken place since left here only event be publicly known be that while peishwa have carried out engagement with scindia with rajah of berar refused to ratify treaty with nizam consequence be that latter general quitted poona without taking leave of bajee rao returned in great indignation to hyderabad matter might have be smoothed over if scindia have intervened if peishwa have made suitable advance to nizam have not done so there be doubt that thoroughly dislike nana furnuwees instead of being grateful to for having placed on throne must gladly weaken power at rate be nana who formed confederacy know that greatest wish be to keep intact to secure peace to country moreover matter have be further complicated by death of holkar left two son behind khassee mulhar unfortunately khassee be next door to imbecile while mulhar be bold able prince brother quarrelled two half brother took part of mulhar who left brother camp with small body of troop took up abode at village just outside city be believe favoured by nana whose interest naturally be to have active able prince a ruler of holkar dominion scindia who be suspect delighted at quarrel in holkar camp supported khassee sent body of troop to arrest mulhar who refusing to surrender maintained desperate defence until be killed jeswunt went to nagpore wittoojee fled to kolapoore be almost only adherent of mulhar who effected escape so matter stand at present fact that imbecile khassee owes elevation to scindia will naturally give latter predominating influence over thus see confederacy have gone completely to piece nizam be estranged rajah of berar have gone home to nagpore holkar power be for time subservient to scindia nana furnuwees be therefore deprived of who aided to bring back to power be well known to nana be not yes colonel be kind enough to place good deal of confidence in then think can not do better than see to begin with gather view on matter have heard nothing from for time know that company be well disposed towards also know that can give assistance in sudden crisis surely colonel bajee rao who owes everything to will not desert opinion of peishwa be that be man without spark of good feeling that have conscience gratitude must betray own brother if thought that must obtain advantage by so doing be born schemer sole idea of politics be to play off one faction against must rather take word of man of lowest class than oath of bajee rao be sorry to hear sir seemed to to be fine fellow with many accomplishment handsome face figure winning manner manner be part of stock in trade colonel said angrily be born actor can deceive for time even who be perfectly aware of unscrupulous character remember one thing mr lindsay that if be in difficulty if tumult break out in city have best make way here at once trooper of escort be thrown from horse killed other day if attire in uniform will pas for one of happens be not likely to be touched party wish to stand well with even be found out that be englishman must be safely sheltered here for must claim a assistant officer in army declare truthfully that have only assumed guise in order to ascertain for feeling of populace thank sir will certainly come here a soon a serious trouble begin that evening after rubbing off caste mark assuming of brahmin putting on dress suitable for padding largely to give appearance of stout bulky man went to nana house will tell minister said to doorkeeper kawerseen brahmin of kshittree caste desire to speak to man gave message to one of attendant who in two three minute returned asked harry to follow minister be alone what have to say to holy man enquired then looking more fixedly at visitor exclaimed why be puntojee be right nana be sent here to ascertain if possible what be going on how thing be likely to tend first must tell that be now here a colonel palmer assistant will take entirely into confidence nana said until told that be englishman when took leave of two year ago must not quite understand why be that felt must confide in more than in older men around esteem english highly especially admire for honesty truthfulness at once impressed a one possessing such quality now that know be english can understand feeling that inspired be glad have come doubt government be well informed a to state of affair here feel power slipping from hand without seeing way by can recover lost ground scindia be solely under domination of ghatgay whose daughter will shortly marry have of course made business to enquire a to antecedent of man find that have reputation of being brutal ruffian remarkable alike for greed cruelty worse adviser scindia must not have holkar be poor reed to lean upon for be a weak in mind a in body at rate be true friend of mine now that have be succeeded by one even more imbecile than who be puppet in hand of scindia to whose troop owes accession power dominion be practically scindia there can be doubt that bajee rao be acting secretly with scindia be to say be pretending so to act for be master of duplicity even where own interest be concerned seems to be unable to carry out honestly agreement that have made be old man mr lindsay can no longer struggle a did two year ago against fate indeed do see mean of contending against such powerful enemy rajah of berar although well disposed towards must not venture alone to support against united power of scindia holkar backed by of peishwa there be one direction in must seek for help namely from government of bombay even be given must scarcely avail much against power of enemy even be sure that must do so must not call in aim through life have be to uphold power of peishwa to lessen that of scindia holkar by playing one against other to avert horror of civil war be to call in aid of english must be acting in contradiction to principle have ever held arrival of force of english here must at once unite whole of mahratta against a did when last ascended ghauts believing a do in great valour discipline have be amply shown by conduct of scindia infantry be mainly officered by european be beyond belief that can withstand whole power of mahratta empire granting that might do so what must be result must see country shaken to centre capital in hand of stranger to what end simply that old worn out man must for very few year remain in power here must be necessary for who placed there to remain a guardian must be mere cypher in hand nothing therefore must persuade to seek english aid to retain in power english must doubtless act in alliance with nizam probably with rajah of berar kolapoore possibly might do so what must be result of leader must in return for aid bargain for increased territory at expense of peishwa who believe that be trusted by great mass of people here must become object of execration at having brought invader into country mr lindsay enemy can believe will capture throw into prison will scarcely take life for to do so must excite storm of indignation always carry poison about with if applied torture a preliminary to death have power of releasing from hand be established at residency sir be living in disguise of have several in town in way can better discover what be going on than if be in uniform a assistant to colonel palmer must there be tumult in city if find that disguise have be detected can make for residency put on uniform declare true character attire a one of resident escort come here a often a can nana said will always be glad to see be relief to speak to one of whose friendship feel secure a brahmin can pas in out without suspicion will always tell how matter stand have not yet spoken nana of work a agent in bombay have sent report from time to time there be nothing in must be of value to at present attention of authority of bombay madras calcutta be centred upon probability of war with mysore tippoo have continually broken condition under made peace with six year ago be known that be preparing for war have received with honour many frenchman be in communication with french government belief that will be supported by army under general bonaparte a be certain that when war break out again will need fighting strength of three town to make head against army of mysore a far a have be able to learn have given little attention to state of affair in deccan have therefore be able to furnish with useful information beyond telling that sympathy of governor council be wholly with that consider that fact of being in power here secures from trouble with mahratta therefore sir have put aside allowance have given considering have in way earned have written order upon banker with whom have placed authorizing to pay money to anyone may depute to receive handed letter to nana latter took without opening tore up offer doe honour mr lindsay be impossible for to accept information have not be without advantage have foreseen that nizam must probably enter into alliance with people that very large increase that have made in battalion under foreign officer be intended to make alliance more valuable however have not deemed necessary to imitate example that of scindia by raising similar force communication therefore have be of real value have saved large outlay here even have not be so there can be question of returning pay undertook certain work have to best of power carried out be not because consider that information sent be not sufficiently valuable that have in way failed to carry out part of contract consider of very great value in first place because a have said relieved from anxiety a to nizam intention of increasing army in second place eased mind by showing that scindia holkar be intriguing with bombay knowledge be worth crore of rupee to be first time sir since have taken part in politics that anyone have offered to return money have received on ground that have not sufficiently earned indeed upon other ground doing so have confirmed opinion of honesty of people must that feeling be common among countryman here negotiation can be carried on alliance can be formed without demand for large sum of money for addition of territory petty war be waged not on question of principle entirely from greed let say more about be a of course have heard very wealthy man have so distributed money among shroffs of india that may happen here will lose comparatively little be glad to know that very small portion of go to one whom regard a genuine friend who doe not draw tenth part of what many of around accept without consideration given for thank sir at rate while be stationed here a assistant resident can not continue to receive pay from must regard a disgraceful action absolutely incompatible with duty well so far will humour mr lindsay though from what hear in carnatic bengal british officer civil military hesitate to accept large sum from native prince harry be well aware that be so that many british official have amassed considerable fortune by gift from native source only replied be matter for own conscience sir may be reward for service rendered just a did not hesitate to accept sum that so generously bestowed upon be not for to judge other men can not think that custom of official accepting present be bad one where can find nana said changing subject if must need to communicate with before call again harry gave address messenger must enquire for bhaskur trader from ahmedabad who be lodging there chatted for time longer with nana then took leave returned to lodging chapter act of treachery month passed quietly scindia more openly assumed supreme power imprisoned several leading men transferred jagheers to own relation colonel palmer have gone down to bombay on leave place being filled temporarily by mr uhtoff bajee be a usual playing deep game desired to become independent of scindia nana furnuwees former believed must sooner later return to own dominion desired aid to get rid of nana therefore be against latter that intrigue be at present directed minister be still object of affection to people who believed a before in goodness of character who put down act of oppression a being work of scindia harry saw nana frequently there being change in position there be little talk of politics minister generally turned conversation upon power relatively to of france extent of resource mode of life among population method of government differs widely from ours nana said after one of conversation in most respect be better change there be made not by force by will of representative of people in assembly minister defeated there retires at once chief opponent succeeds army have determining voice in conduct of affair be wholly under order of minister who may happen to be in power seems strange to undoubtedly system be far better for population there be bloodshed burning of village plundering confiscation of estate be change in personnel of government change in general course of affair be strange that soldier fight so well when a tell never carry arm until enter army while ours be trained from childhood in use of weapon enemy french be same with be same nana so far a civil life be concerned for none carry weapon be trained in use there be one wide point of difference french have to go a soldier when reach certain age however much may dislike while with there be compulsion whatever men enlist in army just a might take up other trade there be however body called militia like army consists of volunteer be not liable for service abroad only go out for short period of training annually however by law must supply of volunteer fall short battalion can be kept at full strength by men chosen by ballot from population be practically dead letter be told that ballot be never resorted to though doubtless must be in case of national emergency ah be pleasant to be minister in country with fear of plot of treachery assassination be younger man must like to visit england stay there for time so that on return must model of institution upon yours fear that must be too much for most powerful minister to effect people be wedded to old custom must not change for others however much might be for benefit order none save in army must carry arm must unite whole people against who issued be on last day of nana furnuwees made formal visit to scindia in return for one latter have paid few day before michel filoze neapolitan who commanded eight battalion in scindia army have given word of honour a guarantee for minister safe return to home european officer in service of indian prince bore high character not only for fidelity to served also for honour in dealing though nana must not have confided in oath sworn by scindia accepted that of filoze without hesitation on arrival near scindia camp traitor seized with battalion attacked retinue amounting to about thousand person among whom be many of principal adherent of be killed of stripped of robe ornament party of soldier be immediately sent by ghatgay to plunder house of nana of adherent harry be in room when heard sudden outburst of firing minute two later abdool ran in scindia men be in town sahib be attacking house of nana adherent be defending a best can there be general panic for be believed that whole town will be looted get thing together abdool will change dress for of native soldier will make for residency will ride sahib will leave horse here if be to go on horseback might be taken for nana adherent trying to make escape be shot down without further question felt misgiving when saw nana going out must have come to same thing in end for if scindia whole army villainous a be treachery have advanced against town nana must have gathered force to oppose three four minute later started abdool carrying bundle containing harry disguise made way through lane where people be standing at door talking excitedly continuous firing be heard in direction of better quarter mingled with shout cry one questioned being too anxious a to own safety to think of anything else residency be mile from town there mr uhtoff be standing at door men of escort be under arm harry have be in frequent communication with from time that have taken colonel palmer place resident did not for moment recognize in new disguise when did so asked anxiously what be going on in town strong body of scindia troop be there attacking nana adherent fear that minister be prisoner in camp be bad news indeed nana told yesterday that intended to visit scindia have received guarantee for safe return from filoze advised not to go said that must confide implicitly in honour of european officer told that various european nation differed widely from other that although must accept word of honour of british officer in scindia service must not take that of neapolitan however said said truly that be incumbent on to return scindia visit that if did not do so must be treated a slight insult must serve a pretext for open war against that a must muster three four thousand men city must yield without resistance believe that be work of bajee rao of ghatgay two scoundrel of whom prefer ghatgay who although ruffian be at least fearless one while bajee rao be monster of deceit know that there have of late be several interview between ghatgay have not least doubt that whole affair have be arranged between with hope on bajee part of getting rid of nana on ghatgay of removing sturdy opponent of future son in law of acquiring large quantity of loot by plunder of nana adherent did well to come here for if work of plunder be once begun there be saying how far will spread will ride at once to see peishwa request explanation of what have occurred there be that trooper dress still lying ready for if must like to put on there be spare horse in stable thank sir must like very much rapidly changing dress be ready by time horse be brought round then took place among trooper of escort rode to bajee rao country palace be three mile from town after seeing everything in train peishwa have left scindia camp before nana arrival there have summoned dozen of latter adherent under pretence that desired to see on matter of business wholly unsuspicious of treachery rode out at once on arrival be seized thrown into place of confinement resident learned from retainer of one of noble have made escape when master be seized be riding to carry news to british official whose influence thought might suffice to save captive life on arriving at palace four of trooper be ordered to dismount harry being one of selected on demanding to see peishwa resident be after little delay ushered into audience chamber where bajee rao be seated with several of officer standing behind received mr uhtoff with show of great courtesy latter however stood stiffly said have come highness to request explanation of what be going on city of poona be being treated like town taken by siege house of number of person of distinction be being attacked by scindia soldiery fighting be going on in street whole of inhabitant be in state of wild alarm be not nana furnuwees have owing to reliance upon solemn guarantee given for safe return be seized when making ceremonial visit to scindia must surely be misinformed peishwa said will readily believe be in perfect ignorance of such proceeding might believe prince mr uhtoff said coldly have not be aware that officer have decoyed number of nana friend to palace on arrival have suddenly arrested bajee rao practised dissimulator a be flushed at unexpected accusation learned sir said after pause that there be plot against person by nana furnuwees adherent have therefore taken what considered necessary step of placing in temporary confinement be little strange highness that man who placed on musnud must be conspiring to turn from however what have be done have be done can not hope that word of mine will avail to persuade to undo act will be considered throughout india a one of grossest treachery ingratitude duty be simple one namely merely to report to government circumstance of case officer behind peishwa fingered hilt of sword four trooper involuntarily made step forward to support resident bajee however made sign to behind to remain quiet resident turning abruptly without salutation to peishwa left hall followed by men mounted a soon a have left palace rode back to residency mr uhtoff keeping place at head speaking word until dismounted when asked harry to accompany to room be bad business indeed mr lindsay can not say that be surprised because having studied bajee rao character have for time be expecting that must strike blow at nana still acknowledge that have come suddenly whole position of affair have changed bajee have freed from nana have only riveted scindia yoke more firmly on shoulder like most intriguer have overreached have kept one object in view be blind to else course must have be to support nana against scindia thus to keep balance of power in own hand have only succeeded in ridding of one man who have good of country at heart who be only obstacle to scindia ambition fool have ruined country think mr lindsay that best plan will be for to mount at once ride down to bombay presence here just now can be of special utility be most desirable that government must have full statement of matter laid before by one who have be present who have made fully acquainted with whole politics of deccan be better that must not go into town again will send in for horse a soon a tumult have subsided have several spare animal here servant can take two of will write to governor report of interview with bajee say have sent down to give detail of what have taken place will save time that must take to write long report will be far more convenient inasmuch a can answer point that be desirous of ascertaining think that can do better than go in disguise that now have on for soldier to be galloping fast be common sight people must be astonished at seeing brahmin trader riding at full speed will give order for horse to be saddled at once in meantime have best take meal will have chance of getting one on road have doubt that dinner be ready for serving will tell butler to give food to man at once twenty minute later harry abdool be on way skirting round poona heard rattle of musketry still being maintained indeed fighting in street of city continued for twenty four hour by two in morning halted at top of ghauts partly to give horse rest partly because must have be very dangerous to attempt to make descent in dark at daybreak continued journey arriving at bombay six hour later rode straight for government house where harry dismounted throwing rein of horse to abdool told attendant to inform governor that messenger from resident at poona desired to see be at once shown in why be mr lindsay governor said though must scarce know in paint disguise matter on come must be something urgent mr uhtoff must not have sent down with harry handed over despatch of be bearer a governor ran eye over face became more more grave a gathered news be serious indeed said most serious now be pleased to sit down mr lindsay furnish with particular of affair when harry have finished governor said imagine that can have eaten nothing today mr lindsay be about to take tiffin bid do so with will at once send to member of council by time have finished meal will doubt be here will be very glad to do so sir if will allow to go into dressing room put on uniform must hardly like to sit down to table in present dress do so by mean if wish must remember that colour will not agree well with dress will remove caste mark sir then will look only a if be somewhat severely tanned in ten minute servant knocked at door said that luncheon be ready harry be already dressed in uniform have removed mark on forehead dye however be a dark a ever have on leaving governor room sent servant down to fetch wallet to tell abdool that be to take horse to barrack meal be informal one governor asked many question be pleased at knowledge that harry showed of principal person in poona character ability at present moment said information that have given can not be utilized must be most valuable be to get mixed up in confusion of party at poona gather that consider nana furnuwees to be great man opinion be not worth much on point sir think that have over over again shown great courage in extricating from difficulty appeared to be overwhelming believe to be sincere patriot that only desire to be at head of administration of affair that may prevent civil war from breaking out to thwart ambition of great prince taste be simple house be furnished plainly care nothing for pleasure of table be honest believe absolutely truthful quality certainly be possessed by very few men in deccan grant that be not disposed to enter into alliance with british have frequently told that admires greatly for straightforwardness truthfulness a well a for bravery method of government in great town in district in be master fear that be to send army to poona on behalf on of of other party might end by acquiring control over affair of country make arbitrator in dispute doubt be right there governor said with smile however at present be certainly not likely to interfere in quarrel intrigue beyond ghauts do see why must be brought into collision with mahratta at rate until have ceased to quarrel among unite under one master in case might make effort to turn out now will go into room where council must be by time assembled proved to be case governor read to note that have received from mr uhtoff then requested harry to repeat detail a fully a have already done there be consensus of opinion a to importance of news come round again tomorrow morning mr lindsay governor said by time will have fully thought matter out so have be masquerading a native again mr lindsay colonel said when harry called upon can hardly consider masquerading a merely resumed dress wore for many year certainly speak mahratti vastly better than speak english for although improved good deal while be here be conscious that though grammar may be correct pronunciation differs good deal from of comrade speak english wonderfully well considering that learned from native colonel said at first spoke a native have learned english casual observer must not now detect accent must lead to suppose that have not be brought up in england will of course be at mess evening think must be better must not do so sir in first place must have innumerable question to answer in second be more important anything said might be heard by mess waiter be quite possible that of be in pay of scindia holkar who keep well informed of go on here be known that english officer have come down in disguise must greatly increase danger when return there have doubt that be right mr lindsay be there anything new at poona yes colonel a will be generally known in two three day there can be harm in telling scindia have made nana furnuwees prisoner by act of grossest treachery have killed almost principal adherent when got away troop be engaged in looting town be grave news colonel said so long a nana be in power be certain that scindia must not venture to take army out of own country for purpose of attacking now that nana be overthrown scindia will be minister to peishwa may expect trouble not at present scindia army have for month be without pay have mean of settling with until doe so certainly will not move think must detain long mr lindsay have only to march into other territory with permission to plunder must be quite satisfied certainly can have liking for rajah of berar kolapoore for of assisted nana to regain power attack upon must at once satisfy vengeance put troop in good temper there be doubt that peishwa will find much more irksome to be under scindia control than of nana be scindia to march away must at once organize army buy holkar aid to render independent of scindia be treacherous beggar mahratta colonel said be absolutely faithless must sell father if must make anything by transaction then know yet whether be to return will see governor again tomorrow morning will then receive order will have dinner sent over to quarter from mess have too much light in room colour may be noticed by servant will let officer know that have returned doubt many of will come in for chat with a one can overhear think that harm can be done by think not colonel will tell colonel went on that be on secret service that will tell a much a can safely do must abstain from pressing with question know that have be acting a assistant to mr uhtoff because be mentioned in order that have be detailed for duty know more than will doubtless be surprised at colour can very well say that a have important message to carry down thought best to disguise will do excellently colonel will be very glad to have talk with friend again after leaving colonel harry went to own room where found soyera who have be fetched by abdool be sorry to say that be going away almost directly said can not be helped expect always to stay here harry now that be in company service must of course do what be ordered be glad indeed to find that although have be with only year be chosen for post in can gain credit attract attention of authority here be thanks to pain that took to prepare for such work expect to be away so long time indeed now that nana furnuwees be prisoner doe not seem to that there can be anything special to do until change take place in situation scindia openly assumes supreme power march away with army that evening harry room be crowded with visitor news of treacherous arrest of nana furnuwees excited liveliest interest be received with very much regret a nana be considered only honest man of minister of native prince to be friendly disposed towards british saw that fall might be followed by important change in attitude of mahratta two day later harry returned to poona next eighteen month passed without very prominent incident in order to furnish scindia with money to pay troop to be in position to march away bajee rao agreed that ghatgay must a scindia minister raise contribution in poona accordingly rule of direst brutality cruelty took place respectable inhabitant merchant trader men of good family be driven from house tortured often to death scourged blown away from mouth of cannon person be safe from persecution poorest be forced to deliver up little saving rich be stripped of everything atrocity of kind be committed upon hapless population bajee rao countenanced thing be now included in hatred felt for ghatgay scindia trouble occurred between peishwa rajah of satara who refused to deliver up agent of nana whom have at bajee request seized a scindia troop refused to move purseram bhow be released from captivity raising army captured city of satara compelled fort to surrender when ordered by bajee rao to disband force that have collected excused from doing so on plea that have money to pay to carry out promise that have given scindia be not without trouble in addition to mutiny of troop three widow of father who instead of receiving treatment proper to rank have be neglected be living in poverty sought interview with be seized by ghatgay flogged barbarously treated cause be taken up by brahmin who have held principal office under scindia father be at last settled that must take up residence at burrampoor with suitable establishment escort however have received private order to carry to fortress of ahmednuggur news of treachery spread soon after have left camp officer in interest of brahmin started with troop of horse commanded dispersed escort rescued lady carried to camp of amrud rao bajee rao foster brother who instantly afforded protection sallying out attacked defeated party of pursuer led by ghatgay five battalion of infantry be then sent by scindia amrud attacked boldly compelled to retreat negotiation be then opened amrud believing scindia promise moved camp to neighbourhood of poona during mahommedan festival troop be suddenly attacked by few brigade of infantry dispersed slew great number pillaged camp holkar now joined amrud rao who have escaped from massacre peishwa negotiated alliance with nizam scindia sent envoy to tippoo to ask for assistance bajee rao did same looked a if desperate war be about to break out time harry have be living quietly in residency performing duty a assistant to colonel palmer who have again taken charge there there be occasion for to resume disguise atrocity committed by ghatgay in poona be apparent to at present there seemed possible combination must check power of scindia colonel palmer however have several interview with bajee rao entreated to put stop to doings of ghatgay latter declared that be powerless to interfere treated with contempt warning of colonel that be uniting whole population in hatred of rebellion under amrud adhesion of holkar to seemed to afford hope that end must come to terrible state of thing prevailing colonel palmer became convinced that scindia be really anxious to return to own dominion where troop so long deprived of natural leader be in state of insubordination if nana be released from prison at ahmednuggur something might be done said might be able to supply sufficient money to enable scindia to leave alarm nana liberation must give to bajee must compel to change conduct lest nana must join amrud with assent of whole population place on musnud nana be only man who can restore peace to unhappy country said to harry see chance of scindia releasing prisoner whom must always use to terrify bajee must latter dare to defy authority harry thought matter over night at last determined to make attempt to bring about old friend release in morning said to resident have be thinking over what said last night colonel with permission be resolved to make attempt to bring about nana release how on earth do mean to proceed mr lindsay plan be not quite made up yet sir in first place will ask to give three week leave so that if fail can make evident that be not responsible for undertaking in next place will endeavour to see nana in prison ascertain from whether can pay considerable sum to scindia for release if find that be in position to do so will then always of course in disguise endeavour to have private interview with scindia to convince that be in way to interest to allow nana to ransom be of course perfectly well aware that in spite of bajee assurance of friendship be at heart bitterly opposed to that return of nana with power before possessed must neutralize peishwa power must be excellent thing if must be done colonel said appears to to be absolute impossibility must rather not tell how intend to act sir so that in case of failure can disavow knowledge of proceeding well since be willing to undertake risk unquestionably bombay government must see with great pleasure nana return to power will throw obstacle in way have better to begin with write formal request for month leave to go down to bombay be there anything else that can do to aid project nothing be much obliged to for acceding to request if for other reason than success must have effect of releasing inhabitant of poona from horrible tyranny to be exposed will be willing to risk great deal to gain will not leave for day two a wish to think over detail of plan before set about carrying out going into city harry went to spot where proclamation of scindia be always affixed be of various kind such a forbidding anyone carrying arm to be in street after that inhabitant must furnish account of income in order that taxation must be carefully distributed to scindia seal be affixed one such order have be placed there that morning sentry marched up down in front of lest insult must be offered to paper satisfied that must suit purpose called abdool to explained what wanted will not be till evening for want before step be taken to

risk have not yet determined upon plan a must have be useless to think of until have seen a have be managed so easily fancy that will have great difficulty in getting at once do so feel certain that will be able to convince that best policy be to free place in old position a peishwa minister a in case must be check upon bajee rao must be able to prevent from entering into alliance hostile to scindia well mr lindsay have given such proof of intelligence courage feel sure that if anyone can carry through will be able to do so need hardly say how deeply grateful will be to for rescuing from

will be sailing for calcutta for le than month so can stay here for few day see how scheme work out will be great step for ensure rapid promotion be indeed obliged to governor for selecting harry said will do best to justify confidence two day later nana furnuwees be brought to scindia camp news caused bajee rao intense consternation at once sent off to open negotiation with nizam for common action offering considerable amount of territory for assistance colonel palmer rode over next morning to scindia camp found that scindia have demanded three million of rupee a price of nana release appointment a minister to peishwa nana have protested absolute inability to raise anything like sum have offered five hundred thousand rupee can quite believe that must not pay sum scindia demand colonel said on return when scindia see that must rather return to prison than attempt impossibility will come down in demand nana will go up in offer be mere question of bargaining when scindia heard of step bajee rao have taken be greatly alarmed for must hardly hope to withstand nizam army that bajee must raise therefore materially lowered demand finally accepted nana offer of nine hundred thousand rupee arrangement being made permitted nana to leave camp in order to raise money receiving solemn oath that if failed to do so must return render prisoner again however in few day nana sent in money scindia fulfilled other part of promise insisted upon peishwa receiving nana a minister few day later have ghatgay arrested by son of two of european officer scindia be indeed most anxious to be off did not know that nizam have refused bajee rao offer have received news of widespread disaffection among troop at home felt that must not rely upon with a soon therefore a received money from partially paid arrears due to soldier sum however be altogether insufficient to satisfy troop a nana furnuwees found that bajee be still intriguing with scindia for overthrow that rest must be hoped for until latter army marched away advanced scindia fifteen lakh of rupee from own private fund latter be then able to satisfy troop scindia accepted money still remained in neighbourhood of poona matter be not concluded until month after harry left for bombay on arriving there called upon governor to report release of nana furnuwees received colonel palmer last report four day ago have given full detail of manner in on own initiative brought about nana release approaching departure of scindia of course brought before council quite agreed with a to remarkable daring ability with have

in present must afford to give very much more if be of advantage to will give thousand rupee also to sufder will be useful to when settle down on revenue of district enable to cut good figure among people when arrive there day before be to sail hindu entered harry apartment bowing deeply handed letter be from nana good english friend send enclosed bill upon agent a small token of acknowledgment for inestimable service have rendered during long life have have many friend in supporting acted in own interest alone have shown absolutely disinterested friendship have always be opposed to people interfering in affair of deccan see now that nothing save intervention can save country from absolute ruin owing to constant struggle for supremacy among great rajah see that be far better must enjoy peace protection under foreign power than be exposed to ruin misery at hand of warring faction grieve have not seen again colonel palmer tell that be about to start for calcutta madras to join army be about to act against tippoo be unlikely that will ever see again will never forget have not be for must have ended life prisoner at ahmednuggur nana bill enclosed be order for hundred thousand rupee upon nana agent in bombay when harry went to say goodbye to governor latter said be likely that will see old regiment before long captain lindsay morning ship arrived with order from lord mornington for to send a many troop a must possibly be spared to ascend southern ghauts join near seringapatam lord mornington be now at madras making arrangement for advance when brother colonel wellesley will move forward with nizam troop there be still doubt what part mahratta will take probably will hold aloof altogether until see how matter go know tippoo have sent thirteen lakh of rupee to bajee rao that latter scindia be in constant communication with however at present will take notice of proceeding allow peishwa to believe that be deceived by constant assurance that give of friendship although have declined to enter into treaty with similar to nizam have made be enough to have one formidable foe on hand at time experience of bajee assures that will not commit by openly declaring for tippoo until see how matter be going wind be unfavourable be not until six week after leaving bombay harry arrived at madras be now november on landing learned that general harris be in command of army be assembling at vellore that governor general have returned to calcutta therefore at once went back to ship next day sailed for town on arriving there presented at government house on sending in name be in short time shown in to lord mornington private room be glad that have come captain lindsay latter said wish that have be here sooner came by first ship sir after governor of bombay received letter owing to contrary wind have be nearly two month on voyage landed for hour at madras hearing that have returned here hesitated whether to come to for order to join general harris at vellore thought better to come on so again embarked on ship have only just anchored be quite right sir for be agent rather than soldier required own thought governor must have sent older man be bearer of letter from believe that in give reason for honour did in selecting for post will look through presently lord mornington said if will dine with here will then have read will be able to decide where can be employed to best advantage dinner be quiet one only officer of governor general suite being present governor received harry with much more cordiality than have evinced at first interview introduced to officer with expression captain lindsay have done very valuable service in deccan little allusion be made to business until other officer have left when lord mornington said have read governor of bombay letter be convinced that must have made better choice than have done speaks of in highest term have given slight sketch of story fuller one of manner in obtained release of nana furnuwees learn that nana have always be considered friend although have not be able to give support that must wish a must have entailed war with mahratta bombay be in position to undertake nevertheless release will doubtless to extent counterbalance duplicity of peishwa who while lavish in promise to be receiving money from tippoo will undoubtedly unless restrained by nana openly espouse cause must gain success over showed such intelligence in matter that say can place confidence in although nizam have be obliged to dismiss french troop in service to send portion of army to act in connection with own against mysore be in way to be trusted being a slippery a rest of indian prince like mahratta must assuredly join tippoo if saw way to doing so be so certain that nothing must be gained by sending agent to hyderabad therefore propose to open communication with rajah of berar none of officer be able to talk mahratti though many of be of course familiar with southern dialect rajah be already practically at war with mahratta a for long time troop have be ravaging territory of purseram bhow be invited to do by peishwa when purseram took side against be doubtless in apprehension of attack by mahratta upon promising to guarantee dominion to give support if attacked may be willing to venture into alliance with doing so must alike help in keeping nizam to engagement deter mahratta from moving be mission intend to confide to believe that must not be in better hand if will call tomorrow afternoon written instruction power to act for to enter into engagement in name will be ready for must wish to start next morning will have escort of twenty trooper indian prince have little respect for person who travel unattended will understand that instruction recite maximum that be authorized to offer to rajah if will be satisfied with le will of course grant a little a can if demand more must refer matter to at rate so long a be negotiating will take active step against though have learned that bajee rao have already be at work trying to persuade to join tippoo against be treaty concluded must no longer hope to retain nizam indeed must find difficult to contend against so powerful confederacy at rate if rajah will not join must endeavour at least to secure neutrality day after tomorrow will start will have route map prepared for distance to nagpore be about eight hundred mile will get there in four week travelling thirty mile day have given order today for one of company ship of war to take escort to mouth of ganjam express messenger have already started with order to

consideration whereas wish to travel in style suitable for agent to impress native mind with importance have horse have one sir pony for servant must purchase good one with showy equipment will of course charge other expense appointment will be thousand rupee month have doubt rajah will lodge handsomely must not do so have best encamp outside town put up with inferior lodging very well sir will

be bed four large chair table while between outer inner wall of tent be bath a soon a halted one of trooper rode into village purchased fowl rice ghee condiment for use of escort who be mahommedans harry found to satisfaction that set of waggon have started that morning for next halting place that must find everything ready for there be great satisfaction for have feared that work of taking down packing tent must delay start in morning at end of day ride must have to wait hour before tent came up whereas by system of double carriage must not be delayed head man told that party must start in morning a soon a cart must be packed that fresh bullock must be hired at village where must halt must travel night so a to be in readiness for when have accomplished stage that process must be continued until reached nagpore chapter popular tumult journey be performed without incident harry enjoyed much for luxurious method of travelling be quite new to three week after leaving coast arrived at nagpore on previous day native officer have be sent on beforehand to inform rajah of arrival of high officer of governor general have taken on letter from lord mornington accrediting harry to act in name accordingly when party arrived within mile of town be met by two officer of rajah who welcomed in name said that residence have be prepared for use that of escort be surprised at harry perfect knowledge of language for hitherto british agent who have come to nagpore have have very slight acquaintance with have have to carry on conversation by mean of interpreter town be large straggling composed for most part of native hut built of mud there be however few brick house property of flourishing trader palace be large square edifice without architectural adornment tree grew everywhere in street in distance town have appearance of forest harry be conducted to one of largest brick house in town host of sweeper have be at work carpet be laid down furniture placed in principal room have doubt that have be requisitioned from owner by rajah for furniture supplied from palace principal room be on upper floor there be ample accommodation for escort below harry requested officer to ascertain when rajah must be ready to receive visit from returned with word that must receive in private audience at eight o'clock evening accordingly at hour followed by four of trooper rode to palace guard of honour be drawn up at entrance saluted a passed in entrance hall staircase be lined by attendant bowed profoundly a passed be conducted to large audience chamber where rajah attended by principal officer be seated conversation be of usual ceremonial kind prince expressing satisfaction that governor general must have sent one of officer to confer with assuring harry of goodwill friendship towards english while harry on part expressed strong desire of lord mornington that relation between rajah must be continued unbroken that nothing must ever occur to disturb amity present sent by governor general be then brought in displayed appeared to give much satisfaction to chief after durbar be over latter told harry that must receive privately at ten o'clock next morning on arriving at time be shown into prince private apartment there explained to governor general desire that must join confederacy between nizam english have quarrel with rajah said at present none can say how affair will end say that peishwa have agreed to assist tippoo be match more for nizam while know not whether english company tippoo be strongest must remain neutral peishwa tippoo might eat up be true rajah must remember that in last war english showed that be much stronger than tippoo be glad to make peace with by giving up nearly territory be much stronger now ship arrive day with more more troop believe tippoo will assuredly be unable to stand against english power even if be backed up by whole strength of poona of course know that message have be sent to by tippoo that have promised large slice of nizam dominion if will invade so prevent from aiding english harry saw by change in prince countenance that be surprised to find that negotiation with tippoo be known to english government replied however be true that tippoo have sent to have given answer matter be too important to be settled in hurry certainly tippoo offer be very advantageous can understand that be tempting rajah yet entailed war against english nizam when have finished with tippoo instead of gaining territory must find that much of yours must be lost undoubtedly be to join governor general must show that be not unthankful for service assistance must be handsomely recompensed what doe governor general offer be desirous of knowing what own view be rajah will assuredly meet if possible have not thought of yet prince said must talk matter over with councillor be good friend with peishwa also with nizam with tippoo know that english be great people have have nothing to do with save complimentary message have be exchanged therefore be not matter upon one can come to hasty decision governor general must wish to think matter over well before deciding rajah indeed there be occasion for undue haste seeing that english army be still lying near madras be not yet ready to advance therefore will leave matter for present believing that in wisdom will be able to see how matter be likely to go whether english company tippoo be likely to be best friend be nearly fortnight before harry heard again from rajah latter have returned visit sent over present of sweetmeat food to guest at end of time came in one evening with only two attendant have come to speak to on matter privately said minister be altogether divided in opinion say must fight against tippoo who be cruel implacable foe who have slaughtered hindu in territory who refused to embrace religion others say be better to be friend with for seems that white men intend to eat up india already have taken carnatic bengal now want to take mysore what will take next for wish well to english though there be few of be brave strong council know of offer that tippoo have made unless can show that english be also ready to give material advantage will not be able to persuade chief that interest must lie in alliance with be so rajah if will inform be expectation will see how far tally with governor general have authorized to offer be not greedy prince said wish only to have what be fair just think that aid be worth two crore of rupee pound that company must put in possession of land of purseram bhow together with land lie between malwan including territory of rajah of bhopal demand harry said gravely be so far beyond what be authorized to offer that fear be altogether useless for to submit to governor general must be sure consider that in naming such term have resolved to make acceptance impossible be by mean intention rajah said nothing must be further from thought in order to secure alliance that believe must be advantageous might be able to make slight concession will send off messenger then submitting offer asking for instruction requesting may be allowed to meet by further concession on part fear strained a english treasury be by preparation for war against tippoo must be impossible for company to pay sum name do think that must be disposed to guarantee territory of bhopal seeing that have quarrel with rajah of country doubt might be willing to grant portion of territory of mysore lying on other side of godavery must be a valuable a bhopal a rajah be still uncertain a to side must be most advantageous to take a thought that campaign against tippoo must last for many month offered objection to harry proposal latter sent off two trooper next day with letter to lord mornington saying that a rajah demand be knew altogether out of question have sent to simply to gain time hoping before answer arrived army must have gained such success over tippoo a must induce prince to greatly modify term trooper be charged not to use undue haste to travel quietly at rate not exceeding twenty mile day two month passed rajah be in hurry for two party among councillor be so evenly divided that be by mean sure that even if wished must put army in motion in support of english tippoo in next place believed that latter must win be reluctant in extreme to take step must draw down upon vengeance of lord of mysore occasionally saw harry although expressed anxiety for return of messenger harry must see that feeling be only feigned at heart be not sorry that be not yet called upon to decide at end of month harry have received letter from governor general brought by messenger in disguise of peasant only said march th army have left vellore on th nizam contingent also marched a have that from bombay by st of month must have reached plateau bombay army at sedaseer forty five mile west of seringapatam main army about eighty mile east of town by end of month must be before tippoo capital siege will probably occupy month even if berar decides against army can not arrive in time to aid tippoo therefore if can extend negotiation for month after receive mission will have be fulfilled messenger have of course be sent off before arrival of trooper in calcutta if lord mornington calculation be correct seringapatam must be invested before must return three day later indeed report reached nagpore that tippoo have fallen upon advance guard of bombay army have be repulsed on th have attacked general harris have again be defeated that on th main army have forded cauvery have marched to sosilly news caused great excitement in town although seringapatam be generally supposed to be impregnable a english have failed to take during last war be believed that after futile siege must be forced to fall back again from want of food a did upon previous occasion rajah like majority believed that seringapatam must defy assault surrounded a british army must be by mysore cavalry must very speedily be forced to retire that although tippoo might have yielded to wish of general attempted to check advance must have be with only portion of army including contingent furnished by nizam bombay army amounted to forty three thousand men tippoo be credited with having at least twice force uniform success against neighbour have created belief that be invincible rajah therefore be well content to let matter rest until more decisive news reached be on th of april that messenger returned with letter no longer want active assistance from berar army be within striking distance of seringapatam few thousand native horse one way will make little difference have done very well in gaining two month by referring matter to rajah demand be of course ridiculous be evidently playing double part if be defeated tomorrow must join tippoo attack nizam can still however offer five lakh of rupee guarantee additional territory peishwa be acting in precisely same way army be to come to assistance have not yet moved like berar be simply awaiting event at rajah came in evening hear that messenger have returned sir yes be sorry to say that governor general considers demand be altogether excessive treasury be almost empty be to guarantee extension of dominion must bring on war with peishwa rajah of bhopal be willing to pay five lakh of rupee to cover maintenance of troop while in field rajah flushed with anger be altogether insufficient said say be final offer rajah be offer be authorized to make in first place possibly if be willing to make concession of reasonable kind may be able to meet must remember that friendship of company be of slight advantage must assuredly be of infinite value to be territory invaded by scindia peishwa may at moment make up difference purseram bhow may again become commander of peishwa army after manner in troop have for last two three year raided jagheer must be bitterest enemy harry saw that consideration made powerful impression upon rajah latter said must think matter over sum that offer be altogether insufficient can not be entertained for moment however there be time for reflection during next four week harry saw rajah occasionally latter made attempt to talk business be evidently undecided in mind a to best course must take feared tippoo more than feared english still believed that latter must assuredly fail in capturing seringapatam tippoo offer too have be considerably higher than of calcutta a have promised large slice of nizam dominion for assistance have therefore determined to reject english offer to march into nizam country a soon a heard that besieging army have fallen back harry suspicion that be case be to certain extent confirmed by fact that body of armed men began to arrive in considerable number felt that own position be beginning to be precarious native officer commanding escort brought in almost hourly report of what be passing in city population be mixed one nearly divided between hindu mahommedans latter naturally sympathized altogether with tippoo while former be in favour of taking part on side so matter continued until th of may when horseman rode into town with news that seringapatam have be captured by british tippoo be killed feeling akin to stupefaction be excited by news seemed at first that must be false for be incredible that tippoo with so strong army must have be unable to defend fortress that a be believed must withstand attack however formidable for four month illustration a rode through street saw how fierce feeling of resentment have be excited by news rajah sent at once to ask harry to visit a rode through street saw by scowling face of mahommedan soldier how fierce feeling of resentment have be excited by news that native officer have brought in few minute before rajah be deeply agitated have heard news sahib have rajah do think possible perfectly indeed have be expecting for day supposed english general needed time to bring in provision from country round to form plan construct battery to be astounding rajah said walking up down room of course harry said proposal made to can not now be carried out feel justified under changed position of thing in continuing negotiation always intended to help english rajah went on doubt rajah have noticed for time that have be gathering large force here have given indication for what purpose be intended be intended of course for service with english rajah said must have be set in motion a soon a negotiation be completed at rate rajah in spite of temptation offered by tippoo have remained neutral will be considered in favour can assure that there will be breach in friendship between english matter will merely remain a be before war commenced except that nizam will become more powerful than before rajah said will doubt be so for will certainly take considerable share of tippoo dominion need not trouble know desire of governor general have always be for peace be driven into war by failure of tippoo to carry out undertaking to release european prisoner in hand also by great preparation be making to regain territory that have lost can not be to interest of company that nizam must use increased power to be scourge to neighbour can promise that wanton aggression on part will be regarded with displeasure probably lead to interference in behalf now rajah must remind that be here a guest rely upon to protect a came through street attitude of mahommedan soldier be very threatening must not be surprised if attempted to attack house need not say that outrage upon escort of british agent must be tremendously avenged that must be more easily forgiven have taken part of tippoo than if allow escort to be massacred will take immediate step for safety must attempt be made will come with household guard to assistance squadron of will ride back with now to prevent insult being offered to in street will relieve of presence tonight harry said wish to be object of strife between people will therefore take farewell of at once will have pleasure in informing governor general of step that have taken to provide for safety give assurance that disposition be wholly friendly rely on nothing so much a to secure friendship to remain on most amicable term with harry have doubt that assurance be given in fall of seringapatam death of tippoo have be terrible shock to rajah even fact that have missed opportunity of allying with english be a nothing to thought of what must have happened have declared for tippoo rajah at once gave order for squadron of horse to mount continued conversation with harry until be ready in courtyard then bidding adieu to prince latter mounted be escorted through street by cavalry guard although presence prevented attack being made on lower class groaned yelled have doubt have not be for escort must have be murdered on way back directly arrived called trooper to arm told to barricade gate to be ready to take post at window in case of assault looking out saw that rajah men have taken up position in front of house great crowd soon began to gather there most of men be evidently soldier have arm in hand loud shout be raised be not long before musket be discharged quickly followed by others native officer in charge of guard ordered soldier to seize who fired a men pressed horse forward crowd closed in upon breaking rank rendering powerless while have be going on men of harry escort be hard at work in getting up paving stone of yard piling against gate lower window be barred a there be entrance except by front gate be felt that must hold house for time a soon a guard be swept away portion of crowd attacked gate with shower of stone while heavy musketry fire be opened at window so heavy be that harry must not allow trooper to show there posted behind barricade of stone against gate so when yielded might be able to open fire whilst showing only head over top line of stone harry regretted now that have not when returned from rajah at once ordered men to mount cut way through mob few at least might have escaped though doubtless must have be pursued by irregular cavalry a be felt that although might sell life dearly must be destroyed to man unless rajah sent assistance to that must endeavour to do so felt sure for massacre of british envoy escort be certain to bring english troop to nagpore sooner later assurance that rajah have done in power to save must be accepted a sufficient house stood in garden extended distance behind be here that horse be picketed front gate be very strong one be certain to resist attack for time harry called off men set to work at wall at end of garden be only constructed of dry mud directing to make hole large enough for horse to pas through at side be quiet people in native house there having gone round to front to watch what be doing harry stood there for few minute watching men at work saw with satisfaction heavy tulwars rapidly cutting through soft wall told that when have finished four of be to remain to guard hole in case might try to force way in rest be to return to aid comrade at gate have great fear that attempt must be made to enter in direction for window in back of house be like in front large anyone attempting to climb wall enter garden must be liable to be shot down from window a must not be covered a be on other side by fire kept up from house outside entrance into garden from house be made by small door at bottom of staircase leading from have be zenana for garden be always considered special domain of lady there be small door for servant office used by men who early in morning went in to keep garden in order when harry rejoined party in front found that gate be yielding lower portion have be almost chopped away here wall of stone prevented entrance men with ax must scarcely reach to touch upper half presently however hinge of upper end of one of half door yielded to weight great shout arose from mob musketry hitherto directed against window be now concentrated on opening be no longer one sided trooper glad that time for inaction have passed returned fire with vigour have shifted upper line of stone so that there be room between for musket barrel lying in shelter be enabled to take deliberate aim at assailant at shot man dropped crowd opened speedily cleared away from line of fire there be pause of minute then strong party of soldier rushed forward began to try to pull down barrier number of others opening fire over head so a to prevent defender from standing up to fire down into be evident that ere long slope must be formed outside by assault must be made that men must for time repel attack harry thought certain sooner later must succeed there must then be time to retire therefore sent man back to see if hole in wall be large enough returned directly saying that men there have just concluded work that six of be coming back harry now gave order to native officer who be standing beside to order men to lead horse through opening when have be gone minute two sent men except four to follow example of comrade while left with redoubled fire so assailant must not know that of defender have be withdrawn be not long before trooper ran back with word that horse have be taken through news came just in time for so much of barricade have be pulled down that must now be climbed harry therefore gave word with last of defender went off at run troop be gathered in deserted lane at bottom of garden on harry arrival men sprung into saddle galloped off rattle of musketry be now very heavy suddenly stopped moment later shout yell told that breach have be carried yard found to be deserted will search house first harry said to native officer will be cautious about a will think that at moment may come upon will be sure that must meet with desperate resistance expect that will be ten minute before discover how have slipped through hand made long detour then approached palace from other side harry having determined to place under protection of rajah for did not think possible that must escape by hard riding a might be pursued by whole of cavalry just a be approaching heard fresh outbreak of firing musketry being mingled with crack of field gun rajah have gone out to rescue harry said must have be too late if have stopped there however can rely upon now five minute later rode into courtyard of palace be almost deserted one of official came out bowing deeply to harry said rajah have gone out with household troop battery of artillery to put down tumult be furious that guest must have be attacked firing presently ceased quarter of hour later rajah rode in messenger have be despatched at once to inform that british officer with escort have arrived at palace harry men have dismounted be still standing by horse rajah sprang from saddle a rode up god be thanked that see safely here friend said when arrived at house feared that be over for rebel have gained possession must not blame for not arriving sooner when firing be heard feared that rabble of town aided perhaps by many of soldier be attacking although until officer who commanded guard have placed there returned did not dream how serious business be then got soldier together occupied time a many of be in town however a soon a squadron of horse be collected couple of hundred infantry together with four gun of battery headed on arriving opened fire upon mob who speedily scattered fifty sixty of being killed then entered house expecting to find only dead body there be sign of strife questioned prisoner have taken inside said just before came up hole have be discovered in garden wall be believed that have escaped through be about to ride with speed to prevent pursuit being taken up when messenger arrived with welcome news that have just entered palace thank heartily rajah for having so promptly come to aid though assuredly must have arrived too late to save have not a soon a fighting began set to work to prepare mean of escape once got out be sure that must protect therefore rode here awaited return 't be well indeed that thought of plan sahib for must not for half dominion that hair of head must have be hurt while be here a guest have ended fortunately rajah now what must recommend to do have best stay here until will ride now to camp of men to reproach for conduct to ask if want to bring army have just captured seringapatam down upon when be dark will myself accompany with household cavalry until be mile away pray to report to governor general how grieved be that evil disposed person must have raised riot with intention of killing assure did in power to save will if can be discovered punish concerned in matter will assuredly report very favourably of conduct rajah will have doubt be warmly appreciated will let governor general know that from time of arrival here always have be treated with greatest courtesy attention by leaving infantry artillery with gun in front of palace lest attack must be made upon rajah rode off with cavalry returned two hour later with news that be quiet that troop have returned to duty a soon a be dark party started rajah rode at head of cavalry harry at request taking place with own escort in centre of so that presence among must not be suspected be a well rajah said that news that have left must not be known till tomorrow morning for although troop must have doubt be obedient to order in town like there be many budmashes who might if knew that have started ride in pursuit with intention of attacking after have left once out of town proceeded at rapid pace maintained until twenty mile away from nagpore rajah then returned with main body of cavalry ordering native officer thirty men to escort harry until arrived at frontier there be however little occasion for addition to harry force news of fall of seringapatam have spread like wildfire at village through passed at in halted for night inhabitant saluted harry with deepest respect must willingly have supplied escort with provision without payment have not insisted upon receiving fair value for at frontier rajah troop turned back harry continued journey reaching calcutta early in june when arrived there be well received by governor general who told that have rendered great service by so delaying negotiation that rajah of berar have remained neutral during war with tippoo that must probably soon require service again descendant of rajah of mysore whose government hyder ali have usurped be released from captivity raised to musnud nearly revenue of country be assigned to large sum be set aside for maintenance of family of hyder tippoo remaining territory be divided between company nizam portion be set aside a share of peishwa although have not fulfilled engagement in way be to be given only on condition that signed treaty of alliance with english similar

only scindia country that of peishwa finally great battle be fought near poona in holkar thanks to fourteen regular battalion officered by englishman won complete victory over peishwa force left behind by scindia peishwa be forced to fly take refuge at bassein where entered into negotiation for british support chapter mission by sea fortnight after harry return be again sent for by lord mornington captain lindsay be about to employ on mission of somewhat delicate character there have be many complaint that ship trading among island have be attacked in case captured crew massacred by malay recently received communication from native chief rajah who owns southern point of malay peninsula say that dutch in java greatly interfere with trade a vessel trading in east be bound to touch at batavia on way to europe consequently very few of visit peninsula a to do so must greatly lengthen voyage to batavia asks that must make settlement at end of peninsula so that ship may trade with must be willing to place in possession of island two three mile from extreme southern portion of dominion there can be doubt that position must be extremely valuable one lying a doe on trade route to east be also certain that settlement of kind must be viewed with extreme jealousy by dutch whose possession in java other island render practically master of whole malay archipelago certainly at present hand be much too full here to permit of engaging in enterprise of kind at same time be desirable that must obtain reliable information a to situation there power of rajah advantage that island offer in way of port salubrity of climate other similar particular possession must certainly be desirable not only a centre for future trade with bankok east a port from vessel of war might suppress piracy prevails along malay coast in neighbouring island of sumatra such information may be extremely useful in future when power in country be consolidated be not sole object of mission will proceed before after visit to rajah a will determine to batavia bearing despatch from to dutch governor narrating number of act of piracy have taken place among island requesting that a be paramount power in district will take step for own sake ours to suppress piracy offering on part that two three of ship of war will if think desirable aid in punishment of malay will be accompanied by interpreter there be several malay trader established here of doubt speak hindustani fluently will have enquiry made among will also procure dutch interpreter propose that will go in trading vessel to java appearance of such vessel off batavia must be resented by dutch of course trader do go from here down to island only to not under dutch power used generally to trade on way down with burma siam burmese have shown such hostility to that be no longer safe to enter river have wrested maritime province of siam on side of peninsula from power so trade there be for present at end will therefore send down in one of small sloop larger vessel might irritate dutch small one must be sufficient to furnish with escort to rajah of johore not only for protection because native potentate have respect for person who arrive with sort of appearance of state will of course go a high commissioner with full power to represent anticipate that will be able to conclude formal treaty with rajah of johore will of course ask for equivalent either in money in protection against neighbouring rajah have money to spare at present certainly troop commission therefore will be to acknowledge communication to assure of friendship to ascertain suitability of island that offer to tell at present being so fully occupied with war here be scarcely in position to extend responsibility that when matter be more settled will be prepared to enter into treaty with to open trade with dominion to pay fair sum for possession of island if suitable to enter into treaty of alliance with of value of such settlement there can be doubt whatever for may take before very long of chinese port will be open to european trader week later harry embarked on brig mounting eight gun usually employed in police work along coast be accompanied by dutch interpreter malay trader abdool four trooper of governor general bodyguard in handsome uniform worn by corp lieutenant in command of brig received harry with usual ceremony a government commissioner be at gangway to meet twelve of sailor with drawn cutlass saluted a harry stepped on to deck lieutenant young man of about four five twenty looked surprised when found that official whom be to carry down to java be apparently younger than suppose captain fairclough harry said with smile when entered cabin that expected to see middle aged man hardly captain lindsay heard that be young officer who have rendered distinguished service on bombay side have just returned from important mission in deccan own have not at all expected to see officer younger than can quite understand have be exceptionally fortunate owing to fact that speak mahratti a well a english well hope that after reception have done with ceremony that will forget be at present civil official with temporary rank of commissioner regard treat a might young officer who have be given passage in brig have led pretty rough life hate anything like ceremony may be week on board together must have pleasant time of especially a whole country be new to to also lieutenant said generally cruise from mouth of hooghly to chittagong dreary coast be with low muddy shore score of creek stream in sunderbunds there be little to look after people be quiet very scattered farther east be piratically inclined prey upon native trader occasionally catch at give lesson well will be very glad to adopt suggestion to drop ceremony have not often have to carry civil official in craft be too small for such dignified people when be in tigris often carried civil military official from madras of be unmitigated nuisance not military men civilian absurd air gave a if heaven earth belonged to be sickening seemed to regard a dust under foot whenever heard that be to take member of council from calcutta to madras other way be regarded a infliction of serious kind well propose to begin with when be down here together drop title call lindsay will call fairclough with heart other said what officer have junior lieutenant two midshipman lieutenant when be alone always mess with be not so strict among small craft in company service a be in royal navy think that must be ridiculous for to dine here by mr hardy by two midshipman in separate mess of own that of course do for must not enjoy meal with hardy quite agree with be stateroom be private cabin fairclough be not well yes be accustomed to turn out whenever there be passenger well at rate will feel very much disgusted if do so for must be most uncomfortable so must insist on having thing moved back here when tell that for sixteen year lived in house of small mahratta cultivator may well imagine that can make perfectly comfortable anywhere will be quite contrary to rule of service other began hesitatingly ca help harry replied there be rule without exception mine be altogether peculiar case will really oblige very much if will have change made see that be surprised at what told about be too long story to tell now will after dinner today repeat to hardy of experience will see have be curious account for having rank of captain being employed in responsible position at age suppose will soon be getting up anchor yes tide will be favourable now everything be ready for start few minute later clank of capstan be heard going on deck harry found lieutenant hardy preparing to sail a soon a vessel be under way came aft be introduced to harry latter have enquired of chief of governor staff what be customary on occasion whether be to take on board stock of provision not at be reply government make allowance for messing wine sometimes official will take dozen so of champagne with a allowance though liberal must scarcely cover be quite sufficient to enable captain to keep good table provide port sherry harry seeing that voyage might be much longer than usual have sent on board four dozen of champagne of thought might be useful at table if rajah of johore came on board with number of chief if ship be visited by dutch official dutch interpreter be to mess with petty officer malay preferred to prepare victual for wind be light brig drifted quietly down river when evening came on anchored a on account of sandbank lightness of wind fairclough have thought unadvisable to continue voyage at night a soon a sail have be taken in two officer went down to cabin where dinner be ready for be pleasant one for two naval men be in high spirit over change from ordinary routine prospect of sailing on strange voyage abdool a usual have placed behind master chair harry said sha' want to wait on during voyage abdool captain steward will do after meal be over cheroot lighted decanter of port placed on table fairclough asked harry for story have promised latter accordingly gave sketch of life adventure longer wonder lindsay at having attained rank of captain so young that old nurse of yours must have be trump indeed certainly be wonderful that must have lived first a peasant then at peishwa court so long without anyone having have suspicion that be englishman fancy meddling in politics being regarded a friend of peishwa minister of being mean of getting latter out of prison so perhaps averting war between mahratta bombay be ticklish business too at nagpore be lucky in coming so well out of after think most wonderful part be that boy of sixteen must have be shikaree killed end of tiger leopard bear after have risen so soon to rank of captain in company service why have seen done more than most men double age yes have have great luck be owing to old nurse having taken such pain first to enable to pas a mahratta in next place to teach english language english way well story have be unconscionably long one think will go on deck smoke last cheroot then turn in if be new hand from england must say that have better smoke here fairclough said for mist from water swamp be apt to give fresh hand touch of fever time passed pleasantly a made direct for mouth of strait between malay peninsula sumatra there be light steady breeze on morning of eighth day after sailing harry on going on deck saw land on port side a lieutenant on evening before said that must next day sight great andaman be not surprised on looking at chart said to fairclough must have thought that must have be shorter to go on other side of island must have be rather shorter there be four five island to north of andaman very small one halfway between negrais so preferred going outside when get south of little andaman island will pas between nicobar island fancy that perhaps andamans once formed part of sumatra be scattered almost in line from northern point land have probably sunk island be doubt summit of mountain forming part of chain run through sumatra once through passage south of little andaman will sail due east for day two then lay course nearly southeast will take right up strait between sumatra malay peninsula be there island scattered about there there be one nasty little group called arroa island nearly in mid channel will take care to pas in daylight farther down there be several largish island near sumatra coast a passage be sixty mile wide there be little fear of running foul of have dutch settlement at sumatra two three palembang be principal be on river run down into banca strait believe that have trading station at jambi siak fortnight later brig anchored off coast of singapore during voyage harry have have many conversation with malayan interpreter latter told that chief who have written might not be in position to carry out offer not only be small malay state frequently engaged in war with other there be constant internal insurrection struggle various petty chief frequently endeavouring to set up a independent power at present time tumangong chief justice have obtained possession of island of singapore adjacent district of mainland while other chief have also thrown off allegiance to rajah of johore who have usurped power from former reigning family if said want only to obtain place for trade tumangong be doubt person from whom must obtain if wanted whole island must have to treat not only with with rajah a in case latter must defeat overthrow tumangong certainly must not recognize cession of island to be there good port be not needed have hurricane here a do in bay of bengal in china sea indeed among island so vessel can anchor off coast in safety at time of year what be island like be covered with forest jungle malay replied there be few inhabitant hundred fifty so most of be people there be few chinese bugis malay be not cultivator live by piracy attacking small native vessel passing through narrow passage between singapore mainland chinese cultivate patch of land be fertile very rain fall there more than day in year if chinese have must make garden of be better even than land on part of sumatra where produce spice grain of sort malay peninsula must be very wealthy be not split up into several kingdom be always at war with other singapore be great place once seven hundred year ago be capital of whole malay kingdom be taken hundred year afterwards by king of java malacca then became malay capital affair doe not seem very promising harry said after repeating to fairclough what have heard from malay from experience of indian prince there be very little trust to be placed in agreement made with keep just a long a suit then break without slightest sense of having done anything dishonourable seems to that position here be very much like in deccan scindia holkar rajah of berar kolapoore be practically independent of peishwa who maintains only semblance of authority from what interpreter tell there seems to be only puppet rajah who today posse authority whatever who tomorrow may excite quarrel among other chief again become master think that in first place will have to see semi independent chief whose possession singapore form part of afterwards rajah of johore nominal master latter may view matter in one of two way in first place may consider island of importance whatever seeing that even be again master revenue must be obtained from handful of people living there must therefore be glad to ratify cession to for small sum on other hand may consider that elevation of island into position of great european trading port must add greatly to power importance of tumangong might enable to make master of whole of johore seems complicated business certainly sailor replied see though rebel chap having written to calcutta may be trusted to receive hospitably there be saying what rajah may think of be clear how be to get at rajah harry remarked tumangong must doubt object to going beyond what considers a territory a might seem did let do so must be recognizing power of rajah to interfere in business however be certain that must carry home clear report on situation to do must at rate attempt to see rajah of course must endeavour to learn from malay on island whether johore still hold territory running down to sea whether coast chief have also revolted against in first case will send up native to say have mission from governor general of india to visit court if be cut off from sea must endeavour to make way through somehow must never do to return with only story suppose governor general be at aware of state of thing here that chief who communicated with be not acknowledged rajah of johore there can be doubt that possession of island must be of great value to a must become centre of trade not only with east with island round except of course belonging to holland therefore first essential point be to ascertain whether old rajah be likely to regain former authority whether if so will recognize on term cession of island to well be glad lindsay that be business not mine for seems very difficult affair somewhat dangerous one three week after leaving calcutta brig reached island at harry request sailed round taking sounding very frequently in order to obtain knowledge of depth of water nature of sea bottom finally anchored in strait between mainland varied in width from two mile to quarter of mile depth of water at eastern extremity of strait be found to be insufficient for vessel of large tonnage though navigable for ordinary native craft island be twenty five mile long fifteen mile wide being a fairclough calculated about third larger than isle of wight high hill be seen whole island be undulating everywhere covered with forest jungle several small malay canoe have put off to with fruit a from what interpreter have told of smallness of population there be clearly chance of attack being made on brig be allowed to come alongside supply of fruit be very welcome interpreter learned something from native a to state of thing on mainland a to however appeared to take little interest admitted that tumangong be lord a be too poor for to levy contribution from mastership be merely nominal one did not trouble about if must at time send officer troop to exact tribute money must simply retire into interior where must defy pursuit have heard report that there be war on mainland beyond fact that rajah possessed very little authority be unable to give information have vaguely heard that of chief supported family of former rajah on day after anchoring large canoe put off from mainland in stern sat two men whose gay dress showed to be minor chief official harry who have throughout voyage worn only civilian costume of white drill now put on full uniform a did sowars of escort ladder be lowered for accommodation of visitor on reaching deck be received by fairclough officer guard of honour malay interpreter stood by captain side why do come here be first question bring high officer of governor general at calcutta to confer with lord of singapore fairclough answered through interpreter lord thought that might be so one of official said therefore sent off to enquire fairclough led malay to quarterdeck where harry be standing with four trooper a bodyguard behind be official whom governor general have sent to malay struck with harry uniform still more with of guard of be new to impressed deeply salaamed profoundly to have arrived harry said a agent of great governor in answer to request of lord tumangong that must send officer of rank here to treat with seeing vessel of war malay said when harry speech have be translated to lord hoped that might be so directed must prove correct to inform that will come off to see in three day time have heard of might of lord in india that have conquered great kingdom that rule be wise one that people be well contented love not dutch who be hard master make people labour for desire to be on term of friendship with power a understands have taken strong place in india so that have longer importance there have done wisely harry said will be glad to see lord to tell what be in mind of governor envoy be then invited to cabin where be offered refreshment ate sparingly greatly appreciated champagne asked through interpreter if must be instructed how to make liquor be much disappointed on learning must only be made from juice of grape grew in certain land in europe must not be manufactured elsewhere though other wine be equally good must be made that a fruit grown in hot country like theirs must not be grown in europe where climate be much colder so grape must not flourish in hot country three day later tumangong came off in canoe gaily decorated by flag attended by several smaller craft a set foot on deck salute be fired appeared much disturbed when first gun went off interpreter explained to that be mark of honour always granted to native prince of importance seeing that harm be done by fire malay approached harry whose escort have be rendered more imposing by line of blue jacket with musket cutlas drawn up behind harry advanced to meet friendly greeting be exchanged then invited down into cabin where be accompanied by one of chief officer harry captain interpreter went down with malay commenced conversation hope that bring favourable answer to letter governor bid say that willingly accepts offer of friendship must readily establish trading station on island of singapore that being now engaged in serious war in india be not in power at present to engage in alliance might involve in war here since might be unable to fulfil obligation with obligation under treaty be regarded a sacred to be upheld at sacrifice later on when affair be more settled in india will gladly form alliance with here be despatch in language stating reason more fully in order to show friendship have sent down in ship of war to explain matter to to assure that appreciates offer will later on accept that can not enter into treaty now a being engaged in war might not be able to protect from enemy must call upon to do so be bearer of several present from have sent a proof of friendship towards touched bell at signal sailor brought in present consisting of handsome double barrelled gun brace of pistol embroidered robe bale of english cloth other manufacture also dinner service of pottery ormulu clock other article rajah whose face have at first expressed disappointment be evidently much pleased with present after perusing letter expressed a well contented with term value more said because be proof that english make treaty unless able to fulfil condition be far better than accepting treaty then withdrawing from can assure great lord of calcutta although regret much that can not at present form alliance with that will be ready to renew negotiation with whenever notifies that can do so champagne be then produced tumangong have evidently heard from officer how delicious be strange drink bubbled a if be boiling be yet quite cold two bottle be put upon table malay after tasting cautiously at first consumed greater portion two officer only sipping occasionally filling up glass so a to keep others in countenance accustomed to more fiery beverage obtained from trader in dutch possession malay be in way affected by potation although evidently impressed with superiority of english over dutch rival for tumangong remarked truly english must be great people to make such liquor dutch sell fiery drink flavour be not to be compared with hope that lord when again sends ship down to will forward of drink have fortunately case of with harry said contains two dozen bottle will give order for to be placed in boat must see by malay face that be greatly gratified added have doubt tumangong when inform governor general that be pleased with drink will order of to be sent down when there be opportunity so that friendship between can be maintained until time come when can arrange with for concession of trading station on island of singapore offer will be always open to there be occasion for haste conversation continued for time longer then malay officer took place in canoe rowed off under salute similar to have greeted arrival be quite satisfactory harry said to commander yes there be doubt that thought more of present of champagne than of gift sent by governor promise to let have consignment occasionally will keep in good temper now what be next move think must be best to finish with dutch first if there be delay in other matter might get news from malacca of trading station in sumatra that ship have be here in case must guess that be thinking of establishing trading station might send make own term with tumangong there can be doubt that if open free port here will do great damage to divert large portion of eastern trade here being so much more handy for country craft trading with siam china besides having advantage of avoiding heavy due demanded by dutch doubt will be best way fairclough said will get up anchor tomorrow morning in course of afternoon large canoe came off loaded with present of fresh meat fruit vegetable sent by tumangong together with handsomely mounted kris for harry officer of ship continued voyage without incident to batavia arriving there dropped anchor saluted dutch flag salute be returned from shore shortly afterwards large boat flying flag of holland carrying several person rowed out to be apparent at once when ascended to deck that visit of british ship of war be not welcome one jealousy of dutch of attempt on part to obtain footing among island be intense opinion on shore on seeing brig must be that have come to announce possession have be taken of unoccupied island manner therefore be cold when harry informed through dutch interpreter that be bearer of despatch to dutch governor from governor general may say that refers said to numerous outrage committed by malay upon vessel owned by british subject trading among island that suggests that dutch authority must join in attempt to punish marauder from whom suffer equally with british governor will receive at three o'clock afternoon will of course wish to deliver despatch personally to a will acquaint with import will doubt be prepared to give answer forthwith without further word official returned to boat be surly set of beggar fairclough said a rowed off think there be much chance of cooperation in quarter indeed be by mean sure that at heart approve of malay attack at present monopolize trade in spice native craft from island bring production here there can be doubt that piracy of malay act a great deterrent to native trader own from calcutta madras think that very likely that be so harry agreed think that governor have belief that must cooperate in matter really only invited to do so because must explain presence of ship of war in water so will be in way concerned if part of business turn out failure at appointed time captain gig be lowered harry fairclough took place in boat carried dutch interpreter four trooper be received on landing by official guard of honour be conducted to governor residence guard of honour be drawn up at entrance be shown into large room where governor be seated surrounded by member of council rose advanced few pace shook hand with two officer begged to be seated on two chair next to harry handed despatch to be very short sir said perhaps a be aware of import will just glance through governor did so afterwards handed to one of member of council be passed from hand to hand be quite in accord governor said with lord mornington that attack of malay a well a yourselves suffer from be deplorable be greatly to be wished that must be suppressed think that lord mornington must hardly have be informed a to great number of island inhabited by malay great naval force must be required to overawe punish freebooter who be so bold that hesitate to attack trader even when large ship carrying gun for protection nothing short of great fleet of cruiser must suffice in next place did undertake operation on large scale against malay throughout island must unite against might in revenge assail many of port do enormous damage even if fleet performed work be only who must be sufferer certainly have not sufficient vessel of war to attempt such operation even be governor general of india to send down a many vessel a have at disposal force must be altogether inadequate for such extensive operation island be counted by hundred on approach of ship of war people must desert village by seashore take to interior where must in most case be impossible to follow damage must inflict must be to burn village must be rebuilt after ship have sailed away to exterminate piracy must be work not of month of many year however will consult council will draft reply to despatch tomorrow have have pleasant voyage down hope very much so harry replied have have fine weather light breeze conversation be continued for few minute then little party returned to boat there be not much doubt what reply will be fairclough said on whole see that governor be to be blamed though of course have not given principal reason be objection to flag being seen flying beside dutch among island still there be good deal in what say think so too see be going to send answer tomorrow may be taken a proof that be anxious to get rid of a soon a possible chapter prisoner next day governor came off to brig be received with usual honour council be quite of opinion said to harry a to extreme difficulty cost that effort to put down piracy among island must involve ship on station must not be at sufficient for such work at rate be step that must not venture to engage in without assent of home government will of course write home fully upon matter will leave final decision to at same time expressing own view giving idea a to force must have to be employed expenditure involved time required for operation letter contains reply a far a can give to governor general proposal lordship will be sure be sorry to hear view sir imagine that will not hesitate to undertake work of punishing at least people of of island where outrage have taken place a soon a affair be sufficiently settled in india for to dispense for time with service of of company ship of war a harry expected face of dutch governor showed that statement when translated be evidently most unpalatable to after moment hesitation however said if lord mornington wait until everything be quiet in india will probably be very long time before will be able to carry out operation speak of may be sir know whether have heard that seringapatam have be captured that tippoo fell in defence look of amazement even of consternation on part of dutch official showed that news be a unwelcome a be unexpected loss of hold in india by wonderful spread of british power be extremely sore point with nothing must have pleased better than to have heard that power of latter have be shattered be certainly news to governor said shortly there be still other power in india be likely to give at least a much trouble a mysore have done quite admit that harry said have doubt that will be able to deal with a satisfactorily a have done with tippoo possibly a quickly that remains to be seen governor said quite so sir have considerable knowledge of india of native army doubt whether of be a good fighter a tippoo men be be mysore taken by storm by famine by storm after battery have opened fire for few day illustration 'well sir will now return to shore ' governor said well sir will now return to shore governor said abruptly will please to give assurance of high esteem to lord mornington harry bowed without word dutch official descended accommodation ladder returned to shore when be out of hearing fairclough burst into hearty laugh be severe broadside poured into lindsay must see that be absolutely flabbergasted when told about mysore manner before have be almost insolent cut comb finely knew that must be heavy blow for of course view with intense disgust spread of power in india not only have destroyed dream of empire there in case of war with island here will be absolutely at mercy if be strong enough to win kingdom after kingdom in india there must be difficulty in turning out small body of troop have in various possession yes see time may come very shortly for french be likely to lay hand on holland before long a soon a do so will be ready to pop down upon here day of van tromp be long passed dutch navy have become absolutely insignificant well be glad that be over sooner be off better hour after dutch governor have left order be given to get up anchor loosen sail brig be shortly on way north now what be next move fairclough asked a bustle of getting under way subsided malay tell that there be small town on east coast that must be most handy for landing a from there to johore town be not more than twenty mile whether road be open can not say news learned from tumangong people be that there be great deal of fighting going on between johore of petty rajah what position be at present moment must not discover must propose that drop anchor off place that if find native well disposed interpreter must make arrangement with couple of native to carry up letter from to rajah saying have come on matter of business from governor of india asking if be willing to receive to guarantee safety if say there be end to if say yes will start a soon a answer come must take blue jacket with if be attacked by force of malay must probably be annihilated even if took ship company therefore smaller escort travel with better will of course take malay man abdool four men of escort be quite enough if get up without trouble whereas if there be trouble fewer better well hope harm will come of lindsay of course if consider duty to go go must yes think duty consider cession of island to be of extreme importance if only obtain from tumangong day rajah of johore might get upper hand repudiate treaty made without approval narrow a strait be might cross with forty fifty canoe make way through wood annihilate settlement at one blow doubt be so other agreed well if get detained will of course try make way down to coast will remain at anchor off town for month after start if there be news of then will conclude that be hopeless to wait longer will sail for calcutta with despatch a be present at interview will be able to report from own knowledge a to disposition shown by tumangong dutch ten day later cast anchor off village canoe soon came off to with fruit other product shortly afterwards war canoe came out with chief man of town at first be very reticent bottle of champagne opened lip interpreter conversed for time together what doe say harry asked when there be pause in conversation say sir that country be very unsettled that be unsafe to travel town acknowledges rajah a master territory through road run be nominally be infested by band owing allegiance to neighbouring rajah who be at war with have asked if be possible to send messenger through said that there be plenty of men who must venture to go through if well paid think that two men must be better than ten for must hide more easily in forest well ask what must send two messenger through for malay answered that must not say until have spoken to of thought that for ten dollar must be willing to undertake tell must pay will give a much more if on return will guide party to residence of rajah malay shook head must want more for that said two native must

about chief said if succeed will give three bottle of drink have very little of harry said will agree to give three bottle if find messenger to take up letter arranges with others to guide up malay nodded when answer be translated to drank tumbler of ship rum with great satisfaction then went off be going to be more dangerous business than expedition to nagpore harry said to abdool when told what malay have said about danger state of affair on shore lord will manage somehow abdool said be born under fortunate star will assuredly do what be best will do what hope be best abdool one can not answer how will turn out one thing be certain that if fall into hand of malay will meet with little mercy must have have mercy if have fallen into hand of people of nagpore master abdool said be true enough abdool think must have be much better off if scindia have laid hand on after have bearded in tent can not say that expedition be one must have chosen be not convinced that be duty however must hope that will go well with a have done before next day malay came off again have arranged with two men said to take message for ten dollar if go back with will require twenty because rajah might detain will pay harry said supposing must not come back malay said might lose reward will pay in advance will leave money in captain fairclough hand whether return not will before leaf pay to men if

said must not be done must not be likely to be surprised in day a must travel noiselessly must be sure to hear movement of party of men coming along road must hide in forest until have passed moreover people like travelling in dark evil creature be about even bravest fear very well chief then will come ashore in hour give letter a soon a have left harry went down to interpreter gave exact purport of message to rajah leaving to to put in usual form in communication be addressed to person in authority saying that be necessary that must impress with importance a commissioner of great governor of india when be transcribed on parchment have be brought for purpose harry went ashore with lieutenant hardy strong party of seaman for although local chief have apparently be most friendly treacherous nature of malay be well known fairclough thought a well to order to take cutlass with man to carry brace of pistol hidden beneath jacket number of native assembled on shore a boat approached seemed to be attracted by curiosity only just a boat touched beach chief came down to meet attended by dozen armed follower invited harry to follow to own house where two messenger be awaiting be men in prime of life strong active looking fellow harry through interpreter explained exactly what wished done if carry out mission well quickly said will make present in addition to what have be agreed upon will notice rajah manner when read letter tell when return whether appeared to be pleased not whether hesitates a to giving guarantee whether in opinion mean to observe will rely much upon report three day passed then boat brought messenger off to ship so have made journey safely harry said through interpreter met with trouble by way be answer that rajah have sent letter be satisfactory one rajah expressed willingness to receive officer whom english lord have sent to to guarantee safety while at town said that owing to troubled state of country must not guarantee safety on road must send down

four soldier a escort interpreter nodded then talked in low voice to around told to come again that afternoon when letter must be given to take to do think that mean treachery harry asked that can not say lord have talked a came down seems to that must have nothing to gain by hindering that perhaps might detain in order to obtain ransom for from lord of india harry have already enquired from chief of town a to character of rajah be feared not liked chief said know that there be who must prefer that old family must reign again have put many to death whom have suspected a being favourable to be reason why tumangong other chief have revolted against loss of so much territory have not improved in fit of passion spare none what have become of family of former rajah harry asked wife child be prisoner in palace said friend be surprised that life must have be spared rajah be crafty be thought that hold so that must if position became desperate place young prince on throne declare for in case who be now enemy might come over to side be told that except that be kept prisoner late rajah wife boy be well treated account be not satisfactory did not shake harry determination questioning malay further found that have heard at johore rumour that one of chief on border of pahang be collecting large force with intention of attacking rajah that people of johore be erecting strong palisade round town that fighting men of village round have be called in for defence when be escort to come down asked started at same time a did lord will be here by evening very well in case will land

officer of rajah who saluted profoundly chief of village be also there accompanied party until beyond boundary after passing few plantation entered dense forest road be mere footway apparently little used ground ascended rapidly when have gone short distance of malay soldier went scouting ahead rest following in absolute silence stopping frequently to listen be quite evident abdool harry said in whisper what said at village be true people from johore consider journey to be very dangerous one be evidently expecting surprise be afraid that if be attacked will not be able to place much reliance on abdool shook head what be to do sahib if be attacked depends on what malay do if make good fight for will fight too if not see resistance be useless will remain quiet must be of use for six men to fight fifty on such ground a must creep up hurl spear at though might kill of must very soon overpower drop back tell four trooper on account be to fire unless give order presently malay came to stop officer hurried back to harry have heard sound of footstep in wood one of men say saw man running among tree may have be wild beast harry said there be plenty of in wood hear man may have be mistaken in thinking that saw human figure even if be so might be villager who on hearing have left path thinking to be enemy may be that officer said when word be translated to be more likely that be posted there to watch path that have gone to tell band that party be approaching even if be so harry said band may be only small one officer moved forward joined men hour later without slightest warning shower of spear flew from among tree followed immediately afterwards by rush of dark figure several of malay escort be at once cut down rest fled at full speed harry saw that resistance must be hopeless must only ensure destruction therefore called to follower to remain quiet four bearer however threw down burden fled at full speed down path just a number of malay poured out on side be evidently struck with appearance of harry follower be about to rush upon when chief ran forward shouted to to abstain from attacking stranger then walked up to harry who be evidently chief of party who be white man asked where be going interpreter replied that be going on visit of ceremony to rajah of johore be enemy chief said now must come with lord interpreter began chief waved hand for to be silent waited for quarter of hour by time be joined by portion of follower have pursued malay many of carried human head in hand by number of harry saw that very few of native escort must have escaped chief ordered men to pick up package have be thrown down by bearer then turned off into forest after quarter of hour walk arrived at spot where still smoking fire showed that band have halted no pause be made however party kept on way in two hour time reached foot of high range of mountain have be visible from coast climb be severe one in hour came out upon flat plateau here in small village considerable body of men be gathered who hailed arrival of comrade with ghastly triumph of victory with loud shout chief of band led captive to hut somewhat superior in appearance to others in front of stood man whose bright attire ornament showed to be chief of importance who be white man asked soldier who be with officer repeated description that have received from interpreter whom pointed out why be white man going to johore asked be sent by white lord of india lord ask why be sent be sent to johore to ask rajah if must grant trading station to english want english on coast chief said

quite certain have head of twenty men officer good will examine thing put white man malay into hut four soldier into who be other man who be dressed differently be white officer servant interpreter said well can go with master then four trooper be led off in one direction harry others in be hut roughly constructed of bamboo thatched with broad leaf while entrance have door interpreter did not carry arm of harry abdool have be removed thing have turned out badly abdool harry said very badly sahib like look of rajah do abdool be convinced that mean mischief must get away a soon a can have got knife with so have must make way out of back of hut group of dozen malay have taken seat on ground at distance of fifteen yard from entrance have posted sentry behind a be taken in harry noticed that there be patch of grain beyond rose forest knife be good against bamboo sahib know that might cut rattan bind together in first place dig down with knife see if bamboo be sound underneath may have rotted there will stand at entrance went on to interpreter then can not see in bamboo be quite sound sahib then must try way first cut rattan not in line with entrance few foot on one side wood be extremely tough be hour before abdool must cut through free three four of bamboo pole while be doing harry interpreter stood talking together apparently watching movement of malay be going to try escape harry said will go with remain here will certainly kill if overtake there be just chance that will not kill if stay will kill man said confidently may not be today because rajah will be looking over present will be in good temper tomorrow will come in kris assuredly will go with when abdool announced that have cut through rattan harry joined telling interpreter to wait at entrance till called what next master abdool asked next thing will be to pull up bamboo if have cut lashing ought not to be very difficult will make easier if cut ground away a deep a can on side of kneeling down set to work with knife after hour work have laid bare bottom of four of bamboo be sunk two foot into ground now abdool ought to get up easily enough with united strength pulled up bamboo replaced in position one by one got other three up put in again lightly filled in earth now can go at minute notice harry said at rate have better wait till be dark sun have just set when saw rajah come out of hut gave order four trooper be brought out placed in line four native took place behind kris in hand be going to murder harry exclaimed in horror now abdool there be not moment to be lost will be turn next guard have risen to foot watching what be going on three of bamboo be plucked up in moment afforded opening sufficiently large for to pas through keeping hut between guard made way through plantation dashed into forest heard yell of satisfaction in village harry have doubt that four trooper have be murdered ran at full speed through forest ten minute later heard loud shout of dismay have doubt that party have be sent to take out to execution have discovered escape be already almost dark under thick shade of tree for hour ran on malay in advance for must see obstacle better than must habit training of youth having given experience in such work for time have heard loud shout behind have be useful in enabling to keep straight course malay now turned struck off at right angle to line that have be pursuing must keep on for time said when overtake will scatter through forest in direction for hour toiled on sometimes at easy walk sometimes breaking into run at last malay admitted that for time be safe threw down upon ground tomorrow said will take up search in earnest will track footstep have better take to tree now will not be safe to stay here others cordially agreed a for time have heard roar of wild beast abounded in forest harry abdool have run with open knife in hand prepared for sudden attack others will have gone back to village long ago malay said when have made a comfortable a must in fork of tree except men who be guarding will not dare venture into village for must fear rajah anger even more than death from tiger will be first in search tomorrow morning way do wish to go lord have be thinking over a came think that best plan will be to go on to johore doubtless road down coast will be watched how far from johore do think be not very far malay said have be going in direction ever since first turned not very straight perhaps certainly in direction think that can not be more than five six mile from town lie between hill crossed higher one beyond have be descending little time be afraid that johore will not be very pleased to see arriving empty handed to learn that escort sent have be killed still news that bring that enemy be not far off will be useful to will offer to aid in defence of town if be attacked at rate be satisfaction to know that have not very far to go have got so good start of fellow behind that be not likely to overtake before get there more than once during night heard angry growling at foot of tree towards morning there be scraping sound be leopard sahib malay said in alarm be climbing tree to get at abdool be sitting immediately below harry latter called to to come up beside mount a high a can lord malay said trunk be not so rough when get higher beast will find harder to climb will do better here harry said two arm nearly opposite to other be just thing for go out to end of one abdool will go out to end of other will climb out a far a can then will have to follow very slowly whichever way chooses if go for will follow if come way follow when bough get thin wo be able to turn round one behind can give sudden stab will make leave go hold by time have finished speaking be far out on respective branch leopard be close to fork paused moment looked at two men after moment hesitation began to crawl out towards abdool harry at once made way back to trunk then followed animal abdool have gone out a far a dared holding on tightly swayed end of branch up down leopard a approached be evidently disconcerted clung to bough be scarcely six inch in diameter at point have reached snarled angrily a became conscious that be being followed harry feeling convinced that must not turn came fearlessly up to then struck knife into loin a blade be four inch long have hope of striking vital point leopard uttered roar tried to turn strike at with one of forepaw blade again penetrated to full depth time on other side with start lost footing clung for moment to branch with forepaw strove to regain hold harry brought knife down again again on one of paw abdool crawling in quickly struck under shoulder moment later released hold fell heavily through foliage to ground for time be heard roaring then sound came only at interval at increasing distance be good business abdool harry said a returned to former post where malay rejoined be well done indeed sahib when beast climbing tree seemed to that a have weapon except little knife must surely make end of one of interpreter did not understand mahratti in abdool harry always conversed said in hindustani have seen fight with leopard lord even with kris two of people must hesitate to attack one fear more than tiger little did think that two men with small knife must save life from one blood turned to water a saw beast climbing out on bough going out after have done good deal of tiger leopard hunting in time harry said know that leopard can not spring from bough unless be fairly stout one stout enough for to stand with paw upon well day be beginning to break in hour time sun will be up wild beast will have retired to lair hope will see more of be very well to fight under such advantage on foot be tiger hiding near path must be sure to have one of a went along knife must not do more than tickle chapter defence of johore half hour later little party be on way be stiff at first from passing night in sitting attitude be not long before be able to break into trot kept up for hour then to great satisfaction forest abruptly ceased saw at distance of about mile little town of johore lying in cultivated field extended to edge of forest broke into walk for short distance then continued at former pace for must not tell how close pursuer might be behind be not long before saw men at work in field interpreter shouted to that party of enemy be not far behind throwing down tool also made for town spreading alarm a went fresh fleet footed arrived minute before harry party a entered place found whole population in street men armed with spear kris asking way soon reached rajah palace consisted of central house round number of hut be built whole surrounded by stone wall eight foot high rajah when arrived be questioning of people a to cause of sudden alarm be greatly surprised at sight of harry in full uniform attended only by one soldier native how come that arrive like asked angrily explain what have happened harry said to interpreter rajah brow darkened a heard how escort have sent down have be slain to man on previous day excitement increased when told that strong force of enemy be gathered within few mile of town that assault might be immediately expected will tell rajah be used to warfare will be glad to assist to best of power in defence of town how many men be there rajah asked must think there be couple of thousand harry replied of have matchlock greater part of only spear kris have not more than five hundred rajah said can not hope to resist what think will at once go round town see harry said may be that being accustomed to war can suggest mean of so strengthening defence that may hold against enemy rajah having heard many tale of fighting power of white said will go with must defend place if must for if johore be lost must be fugitive within must be killed must have to beg asylum from over whom be once master calling party of men to follow rajah accompanied harry to edge of town be already surrounded by palisade be of great strength circumference be fully mile half tell rajah that must make first defence here fighting men be not numerous enough to hold so large circuit against four time number must suggest that whole population must be set to work to build palisade much nearer to palace woman child must be sent inside provision in town be taken into palace enclosure large supply of water stored there a soon a new palisade be finished who can be spared from defence must set to work to throw up bank of earth against wall upon fighting men can take place must be able to defend palace against assault rajah listened attentively to interpreter english officer word be good said have timber for palisade that speaks of tell rajah harry said when be interpreted to that there be plenty of wood bamboo in hut that stand outside line of new palisade that if pull down can use material moreover in case must be well to level house for if enemy fired must be almost certain to fire house inside palisade rajah face brightened tone of assurance in harry spoke reassured said to interpreter tell officer people will do just a tell if will point out where defence must be erected harry be not long in fixing upon line for entrenchment be two hundred yard in diameter at rajah order whole of men woman of town set to work to pull down hut standing within fifty sixty yard of be work of couple of hour material be carried up to line stronger timber be first planted in hole dug for interval between be filled with bamboo pole on inside face other bamboo be lashed with rattan across a fast a be used more house be pulled down until defence be completed crossbar being nine inch apart work performed men woman child brought up what provision have most precious belonging be carried inside wall of palace be two o'clock before work be finished there be then rest for hour then be set to work to dig trench three foot deep with perpendicular side at distance of two foot from palisade large store of bamboo have be too slender for use in palisade be sharpened cut into length of two foot be planted thickly in bottom of trench others five foot long be sharpened then thrust through interstice between upright bamboo end being fixed firmly in ground inside while sharpened point projected like row of bayonet at height of two foot above edge of ditch be nightfall before work be finished rajah have be time upon spot be delighted when saw how formidable be obstacle have be raised one small entrance alone have be left through woman child now passed lay down in space between new palisade wall of palace men be ordered to take post behind stockade number of boy be sent out to act a scout give notice if enemy approached rajah however be of opinion that a enemy must know that alarm must have be given by fugitive on arrival that inhabitant must be on guard must not attack till daylight harry have at invitation gone up at midnight to house partaken of food be also sent out to abdool interpreter rajah must have continued work through night have not harry dissuaded saying that after six hour sleep everyone must work better at one o'clock horn be sounded with exception of few men left at outer palisade set to work again men be employed in digging trench foot in depth inside inner palisade throwing up earth in front of so a to lie protected from arrow spear until be time for to rise to foot to repel actual assault woman child filled basket with earth thrown from outer trench on previous day carried inside wall where by five o'clock bank two foot high have be raised on platform of bamboo three foot high eighteen inch wide be erected work have scarcely be finished when horn be sounded outside town boy came running in while men ran down to outer palisade a day broke great number of dark figure be seen making way through field on three side of town band saw must have be joined by there be certainly more than two thousand men there will undoubtedly carry outer palisade many of men will be killed many others will be unable to join here think that will be much better to rely on defence alone having now great confidence in harry judgment rajah at once ordered horn to be sounded in short time whole of men be assembled in stronghold entrance closed by bamboo for hole have be already dug close together then short length be lashed across be further strengthened by bank of earth piled against before be quite finished yell of triumph be heard a enemy finding palisade unguarded poured in expecting to find that inhabitant have fled at news of approach paused however in surprise at seeing line of defence outside palace quickly number increased until thick line of dark figure be gathered at edge of cleared space inside defence be quiet not man showed doubtful whether town have not be entirely evacuated malay paused for little time while of chief gathered together in consultation then few of men advanced with evident intention of examining defence be allowed to approach within ten yard of ditch when shower of arrow flew from opening in palisade two only of malay fled back to companion fall of others provoked wild yell of anger horn sounded assailant rushed upon from side when within few yard of ditch hurled spear shot cloud of arrow large proportion be stopped by bamboo such a passed through flew harmlessly over head of defender who replied with far more deadly shower of arrow leaping over who have fallen enemy dashed forward in front endeavoured to check course on arriving at edge of ditch be forced in by pressure of behind long spear of defender gleamed out through opening of bamboo inflicting terrible damage in vain assailant endeavoured to climb out of ditch bayonet like line of bamboo checked arrow of concealed defender told with terrible effect on struggling mass at last at many point ditch be literally filled with dead assailant be enabled to leap upon line of bamboo have so long checked passage advantage be slight slippery pole be six inch apart slanting a did afforded so poor foothold that malay be forced to stand between on narrow ledge between palisading ditch here thrust spear between palisade be wrenched from hand score fell from blow of kris spear arrow until at last leader chief seeing how terrible be slaughter how impossible be to climb bamboo fence called men off fell back pursued by exulting cry from woman who be standing on platform behind wall of palace watching conflict by yell of defender of stockade of few have fallen while five hundred of assailant have perished rajah be almost beside with joy at crushing defeat of enemy suppose be over yet rajah harry said through interpreter there be still five time number will surely not retire without endeavouring to avenge defeat hardly think will attack stockade again possibly will try fire next time will be harder to fight than to keep men at bay rajah looked serious yes said can not return to home say that have left five hundred dead behind what do advise will hardly attack again today rajah therefore will have time to think over at present seems to that only course be to shoot down a many of who bring up firebrand a possible have still number of long bamboo left with might thrust away burning faggot might be cast against palisade rajah nodded that might be done said with success doubt with success at many point rajah if succeed at only one point in establishing big fire against stockade must retire within wall can not burn out there except at gate against that must pile up earth stone must certainly recommend that roof of building inside must be taken off unless indeed have sufficient hide to cover still need not do that until be driven inside wall take short time to take off broad leaf with roof be covered during fight harry have taken no active part in conflict have divided circle into three have taken charge of one division abdool taking rajah third have encouraged men under have gone where pressure of attack be most severe on leaving rajah harry joined abdool will try again abdool think will try to carry stockade by assault again will try fire sahib be just what be afraid of archer will shoot down good many of in such number a be will make little difference must calculate at at least dozen spot will place blazing faggot against palisade abdool nodded have be telling rajah harry went on that men must provide with long bamboo can thrust through opening in stockade push faggot away even if do so must calculate upon enemy succeeding in place in setting palisade on fire must be very serious of course must go in behind wall want to do a long a can possibly stay here think that when night come ought to make sortie be not too few sahib too few to defeat abdool not too few to beat up see wind always blow in evening up from sea noticed last night be quite strong what must propose must be to pull up enough bamboo for four men to go out together on side facing wind two hundred men must first sally out remaining a do so close to ditch when be ready must crawl across cleared ground then at signal attack enemy who taken by surprise must be sure to give way at first a attack fifty men with torch must rush out follow set fire to a many hut a can a soon a have done work must run back when signal be given there will be two advantage in first place sudden attack will disconcert enemy render le willing to expose life by storming place so desperately held in second place wind will carry flame over whole town hope burning fragrants will carry flame over field where crop be dry thus causing much more difficulty in obtaining dry wood for faggot will be exposed to arrow much longer before throw against stockade must be excellent sahib do think men must go just at present moment must do anything be half wild with excitement triumph harry presently went with interpreter to rajah house have plan to propose to said that will render much more difficult for enemy to set fire to stockade then explained scheme rajah eye glistened with excitement nothing must be better said there be one fear be that enemy will follow so hotly that will enter through breach before can close have thought of harry said order must be that when signal be given men must throw down torch then man must run not for hole in stockade to nearest point keep along outside ditch enter by in way point at entered must not be known moreover must be able to enter more rapidly with much le confusion than if arrived together in crowd party must of course be left at breach when sally out moment last man entered must replace lash bamboo in position if however be hotly pursued with own guard must remain outside keep at bay until bamboo one be replaced will leave opening sufficient for one man must fall back fighting certainly must not venture to follow through so narrow passage two hundred fifty of men be brought inside wall rajah explained to duty upon must be employed told off fifty of a torch bearer explained to carefully plan harry have devised gave strict order sound must be made until reached house at harry request impressed upon absolute necessity for not allowing ardour to carry too far that torch must be thrown down everyone run back a soon a horn sounded there be doubt that order be satisfactory one men raised kris spear shouted with joy in present mood nothing must please more than thought of attack upon assailant remained quiet on side until darkness fell then crash of falling hut showed that enemy intended to use fire be about to begin work of making faggot will attack hour before daybreak rajah said may perhaps wait till sun be up for in daylight who carried torch must not be so conspicuous must advance in midst of whole force at what time be likely to sleep many will sleep early said in readiness for fight others will sit up talk night who intend to sleep will probably do so in couple of hour do think that be likely to place guard will not dream that must have boldness to attack let give three hour harry said sea wind will be blowing strongly then greater portion of men who be to remain behind be to be stationed on side on sortie be to be made so a to cover retreat of others by shower of arrow rajah principal officer be placed in command here order be that if enemy came on too strongly be to issue out with hundred men aid party to beat back assailant however harry did not think likely that must be case malay must be scattered over town perhaps even beyond outer palisade before must assemble in force party ought to be safe within palisade again just before ten two hundred men who be to make attack sallied out be led by rajah while harry be to lead firing party chose part because must not be able to crawl across open space a noiselessly a malay must do during day number of hide have be hung on palisade so that enemy must not notice that gathering of men with torch be assembled there in order that light might not be conspicuous at spot fire have be lighted at other point in order to give impression that defender be holding in readiness to repel attack bamboo have be removed ten minute before party issued out so noiseless be tread that harry though close to entrance must not hear when looked out a soon a last man have passed must neither see hear anything men have thrown on ground a soon a have passed out be crawling forward without sound being audible harry abdool have armed with kris spear behind be torch bearer arranged four abreast seemed age before sound of horn rose in air instantly dashed through opening followed by men at full speed crossed cleared ground already sound of shout violent yell clashing of blade showed that rajah men be at work scattering a reached house torch bearer ran from hut to hut pausing for few second at till flame have gained fair hold in le than minute sixty seventy house be in flame harry have man with horn with a soon a saw that work be fairly done ordered signal to be blown torch be thrown down bearer ran back at full speed minute later rajah men poured out from town there be pursuit whole band re entered stockade before with yell of fury number of enemy ran forward a soon a did so arrow began to fly fast from stockade knowing that must effect nothing without mean of breaking through malay retired a rapidly a have advanced short a be interval have elapsed since first signal be given town be at point where attack be made sheet of flame be spreading rapidly on hand hubbub among enemy be tremendous upwards of hundred have be killed by rajah party for most part before must offer resistance not more than five six of assailant have received severe wound loud rose shout of exultation from defender a fire spread with ever increasing rapidity flake of fire driven by strong wind started flame in score of place far ahead of main conflagration in hour only red ember flickering timber showed where johore have stood beyond however there be sheet of flame where crop have be dry ready for cutting garrison felt that assailant must have to go long distance to gather material for endeavouring to burn out while position have be surrounded by zone of fire rajah have at harry suggestion sent whole of men woman to cast earth over dead piled at four five point so thickly in ditch if matter be delayed day said air will be so poisoned that will be well nigh impossible to exist here rajah admitted urged that men must want to cut off head of fallen enemy being general custom among malay may be so rajah must not be carried out here without great danger own life depend upon getting quickly buried have such custom of cutting off head in country be affair of mine body now lie in what be in fact grave few hour labour must be mean of saving town from pestilence later on when enemy depart must advise to build great mound of earth over trench will be record of grand defence by placing strong stockade along top must strengthen position greatly must recommend in case to clear space within a far a wall of house to build town entirely outside there be great dissatisfaction among native at being prevented from taking what seemed to natural trophy when rajah informed that order be given in consequence of white officer advice set about work readily before morning dead be hidden from sight by deep layer of earth next day passed without incident at sharp lookout be kept not only on palisade from top of rajah house be thought that enemy of whom considerable number have be seen going into forest must bring up faggot a closely a possible before lighting still must be necessary to carry brand for purpose now that ground be cleared of hut at least of brand must be seen even if carefully hidden with exception of guard slept during day a be necessary that must be vigilant at night for enemy might on occasion approach at earlier hour hoping to find garrison unprepared harry abdool paced round round on platform of wall although few fire burned among field glimmer of light must be seen where town have stood wish knew what be up to abdool harry said about midnight like silence perhaps have gone away sahib can hardly think that believe will have attack before morning may bring ladder with for climbing palisade may try fire be convinced that will do something position be not so strong a be if have have more bamboo must have set men to dig ditch defend like first be used up now wish have rocket so that must send up one from time to time see what be doing hour passed of malay declared that must hear sound a of many men moving harry listened in vain knew that malay sens be much keener than own went at once to rajah chief have be up till midnight then retired leaving order that be to be called directly alarm of sort be given be seated with two three of councillor talking when harry with interpreter entered people say hear sound rajah can hear nothing know hearing be keener than mine be uneasy for even can not see faintest glow must tell that fire be being brought up in opinion have better leave only two hundred men at palisade bring rest in here can lead out at once if point be hotly attacked must prevent confusion if stockade be suddenly forced enemy may be bringing up hundred of ladder in darkness may get up close before be noticed do a think best rajah said at once went out sent officer to bring in three hundred of men also at harry suggestion to tell others when rajah horn sounded be to leave stockade make at once for entrance through wall half hour passed even harry be conscious now that there be low dull sound in air can not think what be doing rajah who be now standing on wall close to gate said to harry however numerous may be must have moved a noiselessly a did when went out to attack think that will be long before know now rajah have scarcely spoken when there be loud shout from palisade in front of be on side that men have be posted so thickly a be of thing necessary to defend to last in order to enable at other point to make way to gate shout of alarm be followed almost instantly by sound of horn immediately tremendous yell resounded on side be answered by shout of garrison moment later score of ball composed of matting dipped in oil resinous gum be thrown flaming over palisade have be prepared previous day men charged with throwing have earthenware pot containing glowing charcoal beside light showed group of men twenty thirty strong advancing within twenty yard of palisade be carrying tree to batter down stockade rajah said harry behind carrying party be dense crowd of malay who rushed forward a soon a fireball fell hurling spear shooting arrow to defender replied vigorously stockade will not stand moment against tree continued be best to call men in at once rajah ordered native beside to sound horn in two three minute men poured in at entrance a soon a last have come in bamboo be put in hole prepared for with rattan twined between score of men then set to work bringing up earth stone have be piled close at hand in meantime three hundred men on wall kept up shower of arrow on enemy battering ram consisted of tree stripped of branch forty foot long ten inch thick did work by time entrance be secure malay poured in with exultant shout large supply of fireball have be placed on platform a be lighted thrown down assailant be exposed to deadly shower of arrow a rushed forward at moment rajah servant brought up four double barrelled gun be loaded chief said a handed one of to harry how long be since be fired latter asked be three month since last went out shooting rajah replied harry at once proceeded to draw charge must advise to do same rajah gun have not be fired for three month be not likely to carry straight be more dangerous to owner than to enemy rajah called up two of men one of at once drew charge of gun reloaded from powder horn bag of bullet servant have brought enemy did not press attack retired behind palisade from shelter began to shoot arrow fast while few matchlock men also replied must be a well rajah to order men to sit down there be use in exposing to arrow be only wasting own must wait now to see what next move will be fire will be of use to now wall will take battering before give way brave a men may be must not work battering ram under shower of spear arrow must be poured upon must send greater part of men down to get off roof of hut up here must place man two on watch at side throw fireball occasionally in few moment enemy ceased shooting arrow for light of fireball showed that garrison be in shelter there be occasion for to stay here longer rajah will look after matter until morning will send to a soon a there be stir outside in hour hut be stripped of most combustible material be heaped up under platform where must be safe from falling arrow woman drew pot of water from well hundred men be then left in courtyard with order to pull up stamp out flaming arrow that might fall a time went on be evident that assailant have not thought of providing with material requisite greater part of garrison lay down quietly slept harry have waited until saw work in courtyard completed then with interpreter entered rajah house room generally used be empty lamp be burning there laid down on divan while malay curled up on floor harry have slept short time when be awakened by light touch on shoulder springing up saw woman with boy six year old standing beside woman placed finger on lip imploringly harry at once roused interpreter through woman explained that be widow of late rajah that son be lawful heir to throne have come to brave white lord said to ask if people will grant protection must be impossible harry replied people be busy with own war in india even be not so occupied must not interfere in domestic quarrel between malay chief why be fighting here then be fighting in own quarrel be attacked follower killed by rajah now assailing place must have be murdered have not made escape must certainly be killed by if be victorious think likely that before very long there may be english trading station at singapore if son be to go there must certainly be well received will of course relate story have already heard on return to calcutta on explaining that son be entitled to throne of johore may be that sum must be granted for maintenance for may well be that in time throne may again become vacant that people tired of constant war will unite to accept son a rajah may tell that be sure tumangong will grant trading station possibly whole island a be not rajah of johore although at present independent of must like to have assent to cession be for purpose have come here although up to present time have not said anything about to rajah a have be much too busy to talk of such matter may be year before english come to singapore report will certainly be noted assuredly asylum must be granted must be kindly received can say no more than that thanks lord must have hoped for more forgive for having thus disturbed a in house save be asleep thought that be opportunity must not occur again will teach son that english be friend must aught happen to must ever become rajah here will act a friend also when have be interpreted to harry boy left room a noiselessly a have entered harry be well pleased with interview probably present man must when result of struggle became known regain much of power have lost assuredly a long a remained rajah must now be ready to grant anything asked for a singapore be virtually lost to assent must be given without hesitation if on other hand be dethroned died be likely that boy must in time become rajah in view of possibility doubtless governor must order that if at time mother arrived at singapore must be well received chapter break up of monsoon night early morning passed quietly chatter of many voice showed that portion at rate of assailant be beyond stockade be not until nine o'clock numerous party be seen coming from forest suppose have be making ladder night harry said to abdool who be with on wall from owing to fact that house stood on rising knoll of ground commanded good view over stockade assailant must be seen well have doubt will be able to beat off have a many men a want for circuit of wall while will be partly sheltered will have to advance in open malay have indeed be busy since daybreak in manufacturing arrow from thin reed bamboo used in construction of hut demolished on previous evening tipping with chip of stone winging with feather of plenty be found in house scattered about yard felt that must be decisive attack that enemy after one more repulse must draw off that repulse must be given felt confident already slaughter of assailant have be very great while very few of own number have fallen hour later large party of enemy advanced to stockade did unmolested a distance be too great for anything like certainty of aim rajah again took place by harry side presently at sound of horn great flight of arrow rose high in air from behind stockade be fire arrow rajah exclaimed will send hundred men down to help woman to extinguish descended officer following with men woman be seated close to platform a arrow came raining down ran out being joined by rajah men have leafy roof remained in place whole must have be in blaze in two three minute a be vast proportion of arrow stuck in earth burnt out while few that fell among debris have not be cleared away be extinguished immediately for two three minute shower of arrow continued then ceased a to surprise of assailant there be indication of palace being on fire then signal be given for attack exasperated by failure of plan have relied upon a being certain to cause panic malay with loud shout rushed forward large number of carried ladder in spite of many who fell under arrow of defender ladder be soon planted against wall malay swarmed up on side desperate struggle took place of ladder be high enough to project above wall with men upon be thrown back on others malay a climbed up be met by spear of defender a head rose above wall with deadly kris leader moved about among throng below urging men forward harry seeing that thing be going on well round took gun from hand of soldier who attended directed aim against three fell to first shot a soldier handed to reloaded eye caught group of chief behind whom stood what be evidently picked body of men in midst of group be rajah to whom harry have recently be prisoner with feeling of deep satisfaction that hand must avenge murder of four trooper harry levelled gun between two of defender of wall took steady aim fired illustration without cry rajah fell back shot through head a chief be twenty five yard away there be little fear of missing without cry rajah fell back shot through head yell of consternation rose from around two more shot then rang out two more chief fell others shouted to men furious rush forward be made harry snatched up spear lying by side of native who have fallen shouted to rajah guard of twenty men who be in yard below a reserve in case enemy gained footing at point of wall to come up then joined in fight assailant fought with such fury that for time issue be doubtful several time three four succeeded in throwing over wall only to be cut down before must be joined by others at last malay drew off amid exultant shout of defender in short time attack became more feeble at point news of death of leader have doubtless spread effect be aided by several other chief falling under harry fire ere long not one of follower remained inside palisade hour later lookout from top of rajah house shouted that whole of assailant be retiring in body towards forest excited by victory rajah troop must have sallied out in pursuit harry dissuaded from permitting must have lost altogether over thousand of men be still vastly more numerous than people nothing must suit better than that must follow give chance of avenging loss have suffered rajah will come again will never remain quiet under disgrace will trouble more harry said shot six seven of principal chief be indeed friend rajah exclaimed earnestly when word be translated to then there be hope may have peace death of rajah of so many of chief have joined will lead to quarrel dispute confederacy formed against will break up while fighting among will not think of attacking again place have proved so fatal to rajah have difficulty in allaying enthusiasm of men repeated what harry have said to added that since be entirely due to white guest that have repulsed attack there must be doubt that advice must now be attended to since have shown master in war be content said wherever language be spoken malay will tell story of how three thousand men be defeated by five hundred will be said that men of johore surpassed in bravery everything have be told of deed of father there be fear of enemy returning here rajah many of chief have fallen by hand of white friend henceforth for many year will be able to rest in peace in month will have rebuilt house sown again field have be burnt after that will have leisure treble stockade will be built stronger firmer than into forced entry first task must be to carry body of enemy far out beyond town where skeleton will act a warning a to what welcome johore give to foe present of money will be given to man afternoon to help to rebuild house make good damage that have suffered interpreter have rapidly translated speech to harry a went on a rajah ended applause greeted subsided harry said few word to interpreter repeated to rajah latter held up hand to show that have more to say white friend warns that for day two must not leave town may be that enemy have halted near edge of forest in hope of taking unawares however can only be for day two at most for have doubt that provision brought with be by now exhausted if stop in forest will perish from hunger therefore let one go beyond town for two day watch will be kept on roof of house if of enemy make appearance in forest horn will summon to retire within wall there be feasting that night at rajah house officer men of importance be present sack of rice other grain be distributed among soldier woman buffalo have be driven inside wall to serve a food must siege prove long one be also killed cut up very large jar containing fermented juice of pineapple other fruit be served out during day breach in palisade have be repaired at night whole population be told to remain within shelter while numerous guard be posted by rajah while meal at rajah be going on party of native musician played sang malay being very fond of music harry sat at rajah right hand be subject of unbounded praise admiration among company speaker after speaker rose addressed afterwards interpreter said few word to in name thanking for goodwill have shown praising highly not only for bravery especially for manner in have carried out order given to proceeding did not terminate until very late hour harry be heartily glad when at last must retire to rest in morning rajah said to now friend have not told why have come here have be so busy that have not spoken on other subject save war message sent up to be that came from great white lord of calcutta desired to see may be sure that desire of will be granted for be not for coming must now be hunted fugitive people slain be not much that desire rajah tumangong be willing to grant to trading station on island of singapore possibly may acquire from whole island be aware that be not rightful lord of island may be that in time may recover possession of johore thus then come to to ask if be willing to consent to privilege being granted to assuredly will benefit kingdom by providing market close to at can barter produce for good that require with with native trader from east at present be not in position to plant trading station in singapore being engaged in serious war in india may be considerable time before thing have so settled down that can do so have therefore only to ask assent to arrangement with tumangong whenever can be carried out will certainly be willing to recognize authority by gift of money willingly consent rajah said be indeed small thing so long a live will be ready to enter into treaty with doubtless successor whoever may be knowing what have done for state will also agree be not indeed until year that british took possession of island paying sixty thousand dollar to tumangong shortly after have settled there young prince who have escaped from johore came down there be awarded pension at death of rajah be placed on throne by british to general satisfaction of inhabitant next day number of men came in from village scattered among hill who have not heard of approach of enemy until too late to enter town take part in defence by time scout have penetrated far into forest brought back news that although there be many dead there there be sign of enemy work therefore of rebuilding town be commenced available man of garrison who have come in being engaged in cutting wood bringing in in course of next day two several chief whose attitude have before be threatening came sent member of family to congratulate rajah upon defeat that have inflicted upon enemy to assure of loyalty to rule harry have stayed on at earnest request of rajah now declared that must return to coast rajah approval of cession of trading port of island be written in malay english language signed by chief copy be also made signed by harry to be kept in palace in order that on future occasion must be consulted great number of present of kris other article of malayan manufacture be offered to harry excused from accepting saying that in first place be not customary for commissioner of governor to accept present in second that being constantly employed on service have place where must be deposited during long absence on third morning after retreat of enemy harry started with two companion for coast attended by escort of twenty men of rajah own guard commanded by high officer there be now fear of molestation escort be sent a mark of honour starting early reached coast town in afternoon be received with great joy by inhabitant who have be in state of abject terror runner who be bearer of message to rajah from headman have left on morning after harry party have started have returned with news that have found headless body of escort have seen trace of white man follower who have doubtless all be carried off by enemy news caused terrible consternation a be thought that town might be attacked at moment of inhabitant who possessed canoe took to paddled away down coast others fled to mountain finding however from scout who have be left that four day have passed without appearance of enemy most of have returned on evening before harry arrived there on hearing from escort of defeat of invader enormous loss most lively joy be manifested harry be treated with almost reverential respect men of escort agreeing that be solely due to that victory have be gained made however very short stay in village headman at once ordered largest canoe to be prepared be decorated with flower flag manned by twenty rower who a soon a harry two companion took seat in rowed off to brig welcome back lindsay fairclough shouted a canoe approached must hardly believe eye when saw come down to canoe have be in terrible fright about native brought off news that escort have be sent down to take to johore be one killed that a there be sign of of party be certain that have be carried off sent boat ashore morning armed to teeth reported that place be almost entirely deserted two three men left there said that news have be received of by time harry have gained deck where be escort fairclough asked be sorry to say that be murdered however story be long one although rajah sent down food with escort gave be desperately thirsty will tell happened when have wetted whistle fairclough told hardy to come with below harry story be told in full over sundry cup of tea harry preferred to stronger beverage be adventure indeed fairclough said when harry have brought story to end must have given anything to have be with in siege own must not have cared about being prisoner in fellow camp especially a be disarmed must not even make fight for affair with leopard must have be more to taste though if have be in place with nothing knife abdool doubt whether must have come out of a well a did other business be splendid malay of rajah must have fought well indeed to beat off force six time own strength great point be have obtained ratification of tumangong grant whenever may be made be satisfactory of course must not have to mind anything like importance of series of adventure will be something to think over life wish have be there with crew to have backed up though be afraid that most of must have shared fate of malay escort in sudden attack in forest yes with pluck must scarcely have repulsed sudden onslaught though certainly killing must not have be on one side be glad indeed that abdool also came safely out of a must have missed fearfully interpreter showed good man hope that lord mornington will when report conduct make handsome present if have not got away with be hardly likely must ever have found way to johore if have done so must not have explained to rajah that be going to be attacked have got to erect stockade be main cause of success in fact must probably in anger at slaughter of escort have ordered to be executed on spot a be did not take loss of present greatly to heart saved kingdom for there be doubt be not likely that must ever have ventured to defend have not be for confidence that felt in in step took told that must have taken flight at once in case kingdom must have be lost sooner later hunted down now suppose can start a soon a like certainly sooner better will be very glad to be back again for there be saying what be going on there assuredly friendship of mahratta can not be relied upon know that be not likely to make fresh move except in self defence until mysore be completely pacified firm government established still there be never saying what will happen having be in thick of mahratta business along must not like to be out of now well will get up anchor at daybreak tomorrow on board be glad when news that be to sail for calcutta next morning be circulated through ship to crew voyage have be monotonous one weather having be uniformly fine since started have have adventure such a have hoped for with hostile native nothing be talked of night between deck harry story have be told by lieutenant hardy to midshipman who have retailed to petty officer have rapidly spread abdool interpreter be made a much of a be possible considering that must understand english deep be expression of regret that none of sailor have taken part in so tough fight by time sun be up next morning vessel be under weigh with light breeze sailed round singapore then headed northwest wind a before be light a northeast monsoon be still blowing rate of progress be slow wish must have got into hooghly fairclough said a walked impatiently up down quarterdeck before monsoon broke see much chance of generally change about middle of april be well on in first week now at rate at be sailing will take at least three week before get there see be only just clear of northern point of sumatra be already month since got up anchor will have wind almost behind fairclough yes when have settled down be change that like of course sometimes have only few day of moderately rough weather occasionally there be hurricane at break up hurricane in bay of bengal be joke will not mind much if get fairly past andamans for from there to mouth of hooghly be open water must be under uneasiness a to brig battling way through to be caught in hurricane with patch of island rock in neighbourhood must to say least be awkward be there port among island recollect hearing officer say that there be settlement made there year ago be so in establishment be started in southern part of island two year later be moved to harbour on northwest side of bay be called port cornwallis be abandoned in being found terribly unhealthy be pity for afforded good shelter when northeast monsoon be blowing partially so from southwest monsoon doubt must have be made more healthy if country round have be well cleared be not found to be of sufficient utility to warrant large outlay native be so bitterly unfriendly that must require garrison of two three hundred men to overawe must have be always losing life not from open attack perhaps from habit of crawling up shooting men down with arrow week later be seventy eighty mile to west of andaman group directly brig weathered northernmost point of sumatra course have be laid more to west so a to avoid dangerous inside passage when harry went on deck in morning found that wind have dropped altogether there be end of monsoon fairclough said be just going to shorten sail there be saying way wind will come glass be falling fast of course be only to be expected think if be wise after breakfast will take off drill suit get into something better calculated to stand rough weather for be sure to have amount of rain be always case at change of monsoon see be sort of battle between two wind southwesterly will gain in end other will die hard be struggle cause circular storm when be serious be called hurricane though at ordinary time be simply called break up of monsoon generally cause bad weather over indian ocean towards evening low bank of cloud be seen to south sky looked dim misty in opposite direction be mustering force see lindsay glass have fallen so far that fancy fight will be hot one at rate will make snug for night sail after sail be taken in until only storm jib small fore stay sail close reefed main top sail be left standing bank of cloud to south have risen considerably when darkness closed in upper edge be lit up by almost incessant flicker of lightning upper spar be sent down on deck then there being nothing more to be done crew who have donned rough weather clothes awaited outburst that must be more than ordinarily severe there must be doubt men clustered in little group by bulwark talked in low tone a watched slowly approaching storm from south with occasional glance northward where indeed cloud must be seen sky be frequently lit up by reflection of lightning below horizon what do think of harry asked interpreter like malay replied think that there will be great hurricane have seen many change of monsoon never one looked so threatening a doe look bad harry said though a have never be at sea before at change of monsoon be judge at certainly look a if be in for bad gale at rate will be safer here than be in hut in mountain malay made reply for time then said yes sahib there be something to do there directly got in began to prepare for escape be not certain that must succeed might have come in killed before be ready a be busy have not much time to think of danger here can hing a see everything have already be done have not be working sailor have be busy in taking off sail getting down upper spar be ready for worst now just a be when have opened passage for escape felt fairly confident although might meet with many danger have good chance of getting safely away there be danger signal lindsay captain said a pale light suddenly shone out above looking up harry saw ball of fire on main mast head presently seemed to roll down mast till reached top sail yard then broke into two rolled out until remained stationary one at end of yard harry have never seen phenomenon before what be asked fairclough in awed voice be often seen before outburst of severe tempest of course look like ball of phosphorus in reality be electric be sign that whole atmosphere be charged with electricity sailor have sort of superstition about of course excepting that be sign of condition of air be perfectly harmless raised voice stand near foot of mast lad keep well away from there be nothing to be afraid of in light if happened to be struck by lightning ran down mast of might be knocked over know why continued to harry first flash of lightning at beginning of storm be always most dangerous ca account for in way there be question a to fact always feel relieved when first clap of thunder be over for know then that be comparatively safe from danger in way gradually star disappeared mr captain said to lieutenant who be standing near will go down to cabin see how glass stand harry did not hear answer when hardy returned fairclough said to have gone down quarter of inch since looked at hour ago be a low then a have ever seen hardy have better send men aloft furl main top sail altogether run down fore stay sail can get up again a soon a first burst be over put four men at wheel there be still breath of wind stirring stay sail be run down men hung back from ascending shroud of main mast be afraid of light fairclough said think there be slightest danger from will go up sir hardy said ran up starboard shroud while at same moment one of midshipman led way on port side sailor at once followed officer latter have nearly reached yard when two ball of fire began to roll along joined in centre then slowly ascended topmast fireball paused there for minute then vanished now eden lieutenant said let get work done at once before fellow make appearance again men followed out on yard worked in desperate haste with occasional glance up at mast head in couple of minute sail be firmly secured in gasket made way below thank goodness here come at last fairclough said suspense be more trying than gale low murmur be heard faint pale light be soon visible to south get ready to hold on shouted to men sound momentarily increased in volume distant light brightened until long line of white foam be clearly discernible approached with extraordinary speed there be sudden puff of air lasted few second then died away hold on captain again shouted minute later with tremendous roar wind struck brig knowing way must come fairclough have hour before lowered boat brought vessel head round so that pointed north boat have then be hoisted up in interval of waiting ship head have slightly drifted round again wind struck on quarter so great be pressure that heeled far over burying bow so deeply that seemed a if be going to dive head foremost water swept over bulwark in torrent extended almost up to foot of foremast then very slowly a gathered way bow lifted in minute be scudding fast before gale gathering speed moment from pressure of wind upon mast hull from fragment of sail shown forward at present there be wave surface of water seeming pressed almost flat by weight of wind then there be deafening crash blaze of light fore top mast be riven in fragment none of fell on deck wind carrying far ahead have better make way forward mr hardy fairclough shouted into lieutenant ear see if anyone be hurt fortunately precaution have be taken of ordering men away from mast have prevented loss of life several of men be temporarily blinded three four have be struck to deck by passage of electric fluid close to presently regained foot hardy returned reported to captain have better send carpenter down to see that there be fire below in minute man ran up with news that believed foot of mast be on fire mr hardy went to group of men get bucket lad said quietly make way down to hold will go with a be to be expected lightning have fired foot of mast there be cause for alarm a have discovered so soon will not be long in getting under men at once filled fire bucket led by mr hardy went below a soon a hatchway leading to hold be lifted volume of smoke poured up wait minute till have cleared off little lieutenant said then to midshipman who have accompanied go to captain tell that there be more smoke than like ask to come below tell think pump have better be rigged hose passed down fairclough who be accompanied by harry joined just a be about to descend ladder will go down with mr hardy said mr eden will go up send down hand except at wheel set strong gang to rig pump pas hose down lieutenant then made way along hold smoke be very thick be only by stooping low that must get along must see however glow of light ahead can hing with captain said beyond trying to keep from spreading until have shifted store gang with bucket have better come down empty on pile then set to work to clear stuff away a quickly a possible men who came along gradually with difficulty began to remove barrel coil of rope spare sail stowed there several of be overpowered by smoke have to be carried up again others came down took place in three four minute hose be passed down clank of pump must be heard mr hardy took nozzle while men now strong party worked at store directed stream of water upon flame for time effort seemed to make impression steam added to difficulty of working gang of men be set to work forward of mast after hour labour store be so far removed that hose must be brought to play upon burning mass at foot of mast lieutenant have be relieved by harry by two midshipman in succession change be frequent in quarter of hour be evident that flame be well under control men engaged below relieved at pump in hour from first outbreak danger be over though pumping be kept up for time longer captain made frequent visit to deck vessel be still running before wind sea have got up motion of ship be becoming more more violent a there be nothing to be done men below be not disturbed at work be continued until smoke no longer ascended chapter great andaman leaving party below to clear away burnt barrel debris to extinguish fire might still smoulder among rest returned on deck terrible a be storm be relief to to cling to rail breathe fresh air after stifling atmosphere of hold scene however be terrible one lightning be flashing overhead incessantly although thunder be only occasionally heard above howl of storm sea be broken irregular leaping in mass over bulwark sweeping deck force of wind continually tore head off wave carried spray along in blinding shower be very near eye of hurricane captain fairclough shouted in lindsay ear men at wheel tell have be twice round compass already broken sea must alone tell that must get little sail on main mast try to edge out of small stay sail be got out hoisted helm be put down little though still running at slight angle before wind pressure be now sufficient to lay down to gunwale crew gathered under shelter of weather bulwark holding on by belaying pin stanchion night have now set in made little difference for darkness have before be intense save for white crest of tossing wave sheet of foam blew across deck sometimes heavy fall of water toppled down on crew pannikin of hot soup have be served out to men must be last hot refreshment must obtain before gale broke for hatchway be battened down be impossible to keep fire alight best thing can do be to turn in lindsay fairclough said after former have finished soup task of slight difficulty under circumstance can do good by remaining up how long be likely to last probably for two three day possibly longer will take advice harry said will be glad to get wet clothes off for time be sorry that have down for motion be so violent that must with difficulty keep in berth being however completely worn out by buffeting of gale effort required to hold on excitement of fire storm be not long before dropped off to sleep did not wake up until ray of dim light showed that morning be breaking motion of ship be unabated after with great difficulty getting into clothes went up on deck except that cloud be somewhat more broken there be change dark mass of vapour flew overhead torn ragged wild tumble of wave rose fell without order regularity forward bulwark on bow have be carried away deck be swept clear of movable object one watch be below men of other be for most part gathered aft lashed to belaying pin fairclough be standing near wheel with difficulty harry made way to not much change since last night said feel quite ashamed of for having be sleeping in berth while have be exposed to gale there have not be much to do commander said in fact there be nothing to be done except to keep a much a dare from running straight before wind have not have much success way for a see tumble of water show that be still short distance from centre of gale sent starboard watch below at four bell in few minute will be relieved hardy wanted to stay with must not have cook have managed somehow to boil water served pannikin of coffee to hand just before watch turned in have sent word that will have more ready by time come up again looked at watch called out four bell one of men made way to bell with alacrity watch below did not come up for few minute a waited to drink coffee a soon a appeared men on deck went below better for sleep mr hardy fairclough asked a other joined very much better sir think cook ought to have medal cup of coffee before turned in that have just drunk have made new men of will call instantly if there be change mr hardy mr eden have better come with coffee will be ready in cabin there be possibility of sitting at table sitting down on floor to leeward holding mug in one hand biscuit in other managed with difficulty to dispose of meal then fairclough putting on dry clothes threw on bunk midshipman retired to own cabin harry went on deck how be heading mr hardy shouted when joined lieutenant at present moment be running nearly due east a have be round compass several time since gale struck there be mean of saying with anything like certainty where position be be talking over with captain before went down agreed that a centre of hurricane be undoubtedly moving to northeast must have gone good many mile in direction of course there be mean of determining how far till can get glimpse of sun there be doubt that if gale continues will soon be in very perilous position for must be driving towards andamans may have luck to pas north of to go between tried last night to get up little more sail must not stand be obliged to take off again so can hing hope for best two hour later fairclough came out again be afraid that have not be to sleep harry said be better for rest sleep be out of question how be heading now mr hardy northeast sir fairclough took telescope from rack in companion slinging over shoulder mounted ratline to top have made out anything asked sailor stationed there have thought once twice sir that saw land ahead must not say for certain be so thick that be only when cloud open bit one have chance although have taken glass with fairclough did not attempt to use at present stood gazing fixedly ahead quarter of hour later there be sudden rift in cloud low shore be visible five six mile ahead dark mass much farther off rising into cloud fairclough instantly unslung telescope adjusted minute afterwards cloud closed in again telling man to keep sharp lookout descended to deck must set main top sail on again close reefed of course be running straight for land unless be much mistaken be great andaman there be lofty hill distance back from shore only caught glimpse of lower part none of small island have hill to speak of shore be about six mile off a peak lie about centre of island a be hundred forty mile long be seventy mile from northern point know what that mean however must do that can to keep off ay ay sir hardy said turning without word then gave order to men to set top sail be done ship course be laid parallel to shore wind be now nearly northwest lay down until water be several plank up deck crew be lashed to windward clustering where must be most out of danger must mast go fairclough stood for minute looking at shivering mast shroud stretched like iron bar must get gun overboard mr hardy will never stand indeed wave striking broadside be falling in cascade over calling four of men hardy made way down into lee scupper where water be nearly up to waist opened porthole slacked lashing when four gun disappeared overboard required much greater pain to get down gun from port side a tackle have to be attached to so that must be lowered carefully one by one across deck worked heartily also be launched overboard have eased bit fairclough said when hardy rejoined helped to pin down must almost feel difference a gun went overboard be afraid that will make difference in long run hardy said must be making great deal of leeway must say that will be on shore in couple of hour at latest still may have time to look out for soft spot must not have much chance in case hardy only hope be in shift of wind will go round more to north sir then sha' be able to lie course at have gone round point since got up top sail quite so doubt whether will go round soon enough to save if must go round little more to north must try get on other tack be afraid in such sea will not go about of course great aim be to reach port cornwallis if can not get a far a have just be having look at chart see there be three narrow strait how much water there be in know be most vaguely marked on chart one of be thirty mile north of present position if find that can not make northern point will try to get in there be not sure that in case must not be best plan for if there be only water enough to run mile so up passage will ground in comparatively still water whereas a wind have be blowing from quarter be almost certain that there will be tremendous sea in open port fairclough placed at wheel told two midshipman to go round tell crew that there be inlet ahead depth of water be uncertain when approached hand must come aft so a to avoid being crushed by falling mast dozen of men be to take hatchet cut away wreckage if mast fell leaving only couple of shroud uncut when be done directly vessel began to break up who must not swim be to make way by shroud to floating mast who must swim must make at once for shore when have left ship mr hardy will cut shroud mast will probably ground ere long while before sailor have for most part be gazing at coast on have little doubt that body must soon be cast up became lively active a soon a received order seemed that after there be chance for four hour passed wind have now so far headed that brig must no longer keep course parallel with shore twice have endeavoured to put about time failed be now making so much leeway that coast be le than three mile away tremendous sea be breaking upon one of midshipman have for past hour be in foretop with glass captain now went up took place beside saw at once accustomed a be to use telescope in rough weather must be useless here for motion be so great that be only by following midshipman example lashing to mast that must retain footing be sure that have seen break in surf mr eden quite sure sir ought not to be far from now if be rightly marked on chart hour passed be within mile half of shore think can see break over there sir midshipman pointed to spot mile along coast pray god that may be so fairclough said for be only chance two three minute later said be right there be certainly break there there be line of surf doe not run up shore a doe everywhere else at once descended to deck thank god said a joined mr hardy harry who on seeing coming down have made way to shroud there be break in surf be not complete break there be certainly inlet of sort though look a if there be bar there may be plenty of water for for with sea a must break in three fathom of water a draw more than two may get over at rate be only hope give chance if strike lieutenant said for will be comparatively calm water inside bar who can swim must have difficulty in getting ashore others might do so on wreckage mast be sure to come out of if strike heavily will be obliged if will go up to foretop hardy con brig in mind come down before get to white water may a well send mr eden down mr hardy be not long before came down again at captain suggestion harry went below armed with pistol a soon a came up again took place by fairclough seaman have gathered aft boatswain have cut lashing holding spar have be sent down from aloft in place by bulwark boat have be torn from davit smashed with exception of largest cutter lay bottom upwards in middle of ship securely lashed to deck now men captain said raising voice almost to shout so that might hear have behaved a well a men must do during storm have doubt that will continue to do so to end remember that one be to leave ship till give order if be cool calm there be good ground for hope that may be saved if mast fall who have hatchet run forward at once stand in readiness to cut lanyard strike until give order be now fast approaching line of surf let everyone take hold of something mr fairclough shouted if strike be sure to be pooped minute be close to breaking wave everyone held breath a impelled by great breaker dashed into surf with swiftness of arrow there be shock followed by grating noise then brig slowly came to standstill hold on hold on for life captain shouted a wave even larger than last came towering up behind in almost perpendicular wall struck vessel with tremendous force swept waist deep along deck while vessel surged forward there be shock time much slighter a next wave carried on there be general cheer from sailor have floated be through hurrah be indeed over bar there be men in water fairclough shouted get ready to cast rope to four men who have be swept overboard by rush of water be rescued two others be found dead on deck having be dashed against stanchion other obstacle brig continued course four five hundred yard farther then a bank of inlet closed in fairclough gave order for anchor to be let go everything have be prepared for order anchor at once dropped a soon a fifty fathom of chain have be run out brig swung round head to wind muster men see if be missing be done only one besides three found dead did not answer to name general opinion be that have struck against something a be swept overboard have be killed disabled for who have be seen in water have be rescued serve out allowance of grog round mr eden fairclough said tell cook to get fire alight a soon a possible will be glad of good meal well thank god everything have ended far better than must have hoped for two hour later crew having got into dry clothes be sitting down enjoying plentiful allowance of pea soup salt junk while officer be partaking of similar fare in cabin none who saw there must have dreamt of long struggle have be through that ship be well nigh wreck be now late in afternoon fairclough gave order that might turn in a soon a liked except anchor watch of four men must maintain sharp lookout for native of island be bitterly hostile to white think there be real danger said to harry that will attempt to take ship habit be have heard to lie in hiding to shoot arrow at stranger who may land sat chatting for hour after meal be concluded then conversation flagged fairclough said presently think that may a well follow men example turn in can hardly keep eye open gale be still blowing strongly in morning though force have somewhat abated inside bar there be slight swell brig rode easily at anchor for wind be now several point west of north be consequently protected by land work of repairing damage began at once for owing to length of voyage store of provision water be beginning to run very short two three buffalo have be bought at village where harry have landed with exception of fruit meat sent off by tumangong other fresh food have be obtained since sailed from calcutta boat be turned over launched work of making new fore top mast overhauling rigging proceeded with during day several of native be observed at edge of forest by harry who having special work to do have be asked by fairclough to keep eye on shore to ascertain whether be being watched a intended when repair be finished to see if spring of fresh water existed in neighbourhood therefore kept telescope directed on shore soon after daybreak made out two little men at edge of tree native of andaman island be among lowest type of humanity known stature doe not exceed five foot with slender limb large head appearance be almost that of deformed people use clothing whatever plastering body with clay mud to protect skin from sun ray animal be scarce on island people live chiefly on fish carry bow arrow heavy spear to in most case be added shield inhabit roughly made arbour seldom remain long at spot moving about in small community according to abundance scarcity of food use cooking utensil simply prepare food by placing on burning ember men first made out soon disappeared later on harry must see that there be many of inside line of forest be nuisance captain said when told result of examination of shore suppose in day two will have hundred of down here think will try to interfere with a long a be at work will certainly oppose if attempt to enter forest will effectually prevent wandering about in search of water must only go in strong body even then might lose good many life from arrow of course must be able to beat off must be sorry to have to kill lot of poor little beggar one can hardly blame for hostility naturally want to have place to be just a averse to landing a forefather be to julius caesar roman of course must be if only knew very much better off by being civil have number of thing must be invaluable to for instance must willingly give dozen cooking pot a many frying pan if must let obtain water peaceably suppose that at time other malay landed here carried off number of head may have be shot down by reckless ruffian of trader have so come to view stranger a deadly enemy however so far a have heard there be chance of being friendly native trader say that of vessel have be wrecked on coast none of crew ever escaped by way believe that fish be extremely plentiful here have good supply of fishing line on board for generally fish when be at anchor if will let have tomorrow harry said abdool will look after hate having nothing to do certainly fish must be very agreeable change after long spell of salt meat will have first thing in morning accordingly next day line be got out malay interpreter who knew great deal more of fishing than did harry abdool took matter in hand hook be baited with piece of meat shred of white scarlet bunting fish bit eagerly three be kept actively employed in drawing up rebaiting hook be of size from quarter of pound to four five pound by dinner time there be enough to furnish ample meal for on board will keep three four of men at work afternoon fairclough said will have night line down can salt down eat at rate will not be drawing much on store by evening new fore top mast be in place a heaviest part of work be now done order be given for boat crew to start in morning to cruise along coast see if stream ran into mr eden be to be in command crew be to be well armed be not to attempt to effect landing sea have now calmed down southwest monsoon be blowing steadily have better go south land be much higher there there be more likelihood of there being stream think will be able to lie course at rate make long leg short one be to go a nearly a can tell twenty mile if meet with stream by time turn back will have wind free then can be back here well before sunset of course if find fresh water will at once return must like to go with boat mr lindsay very much hand be so sore from hauling in line be afraid will not be able to help in fishing tomorrow party started early consisted of ten men coxswain midshipman harry surf be no longer breaking on bar outside there be bright sea with white crested wave before starting captain ordered reef to be put in sail must carry full sail well enough said to harry there be occasion for haste be always best to be on safe side especially when middy be in command besides be just a well to keep dry jacket keg of water supply of food sufficient for two day be placed on board expect will be back by three o'clock in afternoon mr eden be always well to provide against accident with sheet hauled tight aft cutter be just able to lie course outside line of breaker in little over hour there be break in shore stream of forty foot wide fell into sea general cheer broke from sailor who have be put on allowance for past week put about coxswain midshipman said need go farther ca land have bathe sir coxswain asked certainly not be very thing that mus' do for anything know there may be native about of might get stuck full of arrow before must get out of range will be good news there will be no longer need for being kept on short allowance of water at ten o'clock boat re entered inlet lowered sail by side of brig have be successful suppose by coming back so soon mr eden captain said when be within easy hail yes sir there be small stream about seven mile from here be very satisfactory now can come on board there be plenty of work for hand everyone indeed be busy in repairing damage carpenter be engaged upon bulwark stern have be much damaged by wave have lifted over bar a there be not sufficient plank on board for work canvas be utilized for filling up gap in bulwark after being nailed to temporary stanchion be coated with pitch hand worked cheerfully change of diet already benefited news that there be plenty of fresh water near enabled remaining supply to be freely used matter of slight consequence to men working in broiling sun two day later work be finished on following morning anchor be weighed sail shaken out brig left inlet have saved from destruction after sailing out to sea couple of mile came about laid course for mouth of stream fishing have be continued without intermission watch have again be set work of attending to line be very welcome a helping to pas away four hour of darkness by time left inlet sufficient quantity have be salted down to last ship company for week without recourse to salt meat cask carpenter with three four assistant have patched up second cutter boat have be least injured others have be broken up for firewood of piece being reserved for repair of cutter a soon a brig reached mouth of stream be anchored two hundred yard off shore water barrel have already be got up on deck of be lowered into first cutter of mr hardy took command be not deemed advisable to employ second boat in bringing water on board a if heavily laden water must force way in through hastily executed repair captain then accompanied by harry armed crew took place in went ahead of larger boat into stream be found to be three four foot deep with slow current for little distance up be too brackish to be used be not until entered line of forest that be found fresh enough men in first cutter proceeded to fill cask while in other boat laid in oar musket in hand watched forest in few minute work be done first cutter rowed straight for brig while second cutter followed for distance beyond tree there waited for return so far so good fairclough said be afraid that will be disturbed before have made trip doubt of native followed cutter along shore yesterday suppose recognized what object be a did not enter stream when saw brig going same way morning have doubt that set off in direction however with one more boat load can manage well enough until reach hooghly for with wind will make quick run in quarter of hour cutter be seen returning when approached fairclough again took lead appeared still in forest men have just begun to refill cask when shower of arrow fell among boat let half men go on with work mr hardy others stand to arm not single foe be visible arrow still flew fast from among tree open fire fairclough said fire anywhere among bush suppose that will hit may frighten ca know much about firearm from boat scattering fire of musketry at once opened men loading firing a quickly a must effect be immediate arrow still fell only occasionally evidently shot at random for few of came near boat men in first cutter be working energetically dipping breaker into water emptying into large cask in three four minute be filled hardy hailed captain be full up now sir cask breaker then retire at once mr hardy will follow a issued from under tree arrow again fell fast fire captain said perhaps may issue out then will give lesson that be better not to interfere with men who be doing harm proved to be case one have be hit by fire from boat now that shooting have ceased native with shout of triumph ran out from forest there be hundred of captain hailed boat in front stop rowing mr hardy open fire on now lad went on to own crew fire steadily throw away shot illustration rattle of musketry broke out again a rattle of musketry broke out again from boat many of native dropped others stopped at once shower of arrow be discharged then a fire be kept up fled back into wood men again taking to oar rowed out without further molestation to brig none of crew have be killed four be wounded by arrow hope be not poisoned fairclough said in low voice to harry know whether use poison on island must hope not however will not frighten by even hinting at possibility of such thing happily however evil symptom resulted wound be for most part slight next day be able to return to duty fair weather now set in ten day later brig dropped anchor in river opposite calcutta harry at once went ashore handed to governor full report of what have taken place have not time to read rather bulky report of yours at present captain lindsay latter said with smile please give pith of a shortly a possible island sir be well adapted for trading station must must think when forest be partly cleared away be healthy one

thoroughly in earnest in desire for trading station to be established so close to rajah of johore have ratified agreement have given cordial consent for cession of island to seems that be usurper rightful heir be boy of seven eight year old think be possible that at present man death possibly even before that may ascend throne at present mother be in hand of reigning rajah have promised that if take possession of singapore son can find asylum there small pension for maintenance on part have promised that will bring up son to regard a best friend that if ascends throne will also ratify treaty will become warm ally a to dutch reply of governor be with report certainly be unfavourable one cooperation in work of repressing piracy can be expected from did not expect captain lindsay indeed a told at time only sent to batavia in order to account for presence of one of ship of war in water well sir mission have be in respect most satisfactory will read report give full consideration at leisure for present will remain here available for office military civil at present at rate will retain civil employment will not ask to dine with today a be hardly likely that will

be very glad to have with captain lindsay have frequently heard brother speak of service perfect knowledge of mahratti acquaintance with people will be of great value to know peishwa well do think that will be faithful to engagement that have made with certainly not sir have be intriguing ever since ascended musnud duplicity be only equalled by treachery a soon a be restored in poona will again begin intrigue with scindia other mahratta chief be opinion have formed of from what have heard general said however term of treaty will render practically servant for will maintain body of troop near poona will effectually prevent scheme of from succeeding what course holkar will take can not say other mahratta chief have entered into confederacy against will have force of scindia of rajah of bhopal rajah of berar rajah of kolapoore to deal with partition of mysore have indeed done much to unite mahratta together ever increasing power of british be serious source of alarm for in addition

infantry be encamped twenty two mile north of julnapoor next day army marched against by two route colonel stephenson taking western road general wellesley eastern next afternoon when about to halt general wellesley learned that mahratta be encamped about six mile from on bank of kaitna determined to attack at once without waiting for colonel stephenson for in day must in probability send off infantry begin to carry on desultory warfare with horse illustration plan of battle of general rode on with staff escort of cavalry obtained view of mahratta host from rising ground be in fork formed by junction of kaitna with juah right consisted wholly of cavalry be protected by high rocky bank of stream be at one two point impassable for gun left consisting of infantry artillery be posted in village of assaye lay near fork of river general determined at once to attack at point force under command consisted of four battalion of sepoys th th regiment with th dragoon three regiment of native cavalry in four thousand five hundred men opposed to be ten thousand five hundred disciplined troop taught commanded by european officer scindia irregular infantry of rajah of berar with well appointed train of artillery of over hundred gun forty thousand cavalry from position in british force arrived have to march for distance parallel with river exposed to terrible artillery fire created such havoc especially among bullock drawing gun that cavalry must not move forward infantry therefore proceeded alone crossed kaitna by ford then swinging round advanced against village while be crossing river mahratta cavalry be brought up from former position took post behind assaye steadiness with little force advanced to attack against so immense army have already have effect of shaking mahratta seemed to that opponent must be conscious that be invincible pouring in volley first british line charged with bayonet mahratta infantry at once wavered then gave way fell back on second line posted near juah a th regiment passed through village body of mahratta horse charged be met by british cavalry who drove with great slaughter into river second mahratta line gave way with scarcely resistance british cavalry pressing hotly after cut up terribly infantry followed a quickly a possible suddenly there be roar of gun behind flying mahratta at once rallied faced pursuer a advanced force have captured mahratta gun number of artilleryman have thrown down lying a if dead a soon a saw that british line be still pressing forward in pursuit artilleryman leapt to foot turning gun opened general at once put at head of st regiment native cavalry after desperate conflict in general have horse shot under succeeded in recapturing gun in meantime colonel maxwell with cavalry have

to make way across country to inform general lake of victory have won to point out that at present scindia be paralysed will be unable to send troop to aid force in northwest for must do so will at once enter territory run risk of returning tell lord lake that order be that will remain with think that will have much fighting here though doubt later on holkar rajah of berar will reform army try conclusion with again while on other side there be likely to be heavy fighting must of course travel in disguise be already accustomed to will willingly undertake mission sir must like to take anyone with must be glad if will give four trooper from one of native cavalry regiment will of course ride a petty chief might be interrupted in small village be alone with only servant whereas if have four follower must appear natural to a even pettiest leader be always accompanied by party however small of horseman certainly will give order to colonel of st cavalry to choose four well mounted men who can speak mahratti there be many such in regiment there be difficulty about disguise for large quantity of native clothing have be found in camp harry chose dress suitable for native in command of fifty sixty men four trooper attired in garment of native soldier indeed differed in way from worn by peasantry harry have packed uniform in native saddlebag also cocked hat after taking out stiffening so that must lie flat have exchanged own saddle for of one of holkar horseman advised men to do same so that when joined lord lake must be able at once to appear in uniform there be abundance of native sword spear lying where mahratta force have be defeated abdool have at once be sent into village have there succeeded in buying brown dye used in colouring clothes with harry stained face hand two hour after receiving order rode out from camp followed by abdool four trooper considered that there be little danger in journey a for greater portion of distance must ride through dominion of young nizam must however have to pas through territory of rajah of berar beyond must enter country in british be already supreme while in nizam dominion experienced difficulty news of victory of assaye have already spread inhabitant be relieved of fear have be entertaining of great raid by holkar passage therefore of petty chief with four follower be regarded with indifference indeed be generally supposed to be one of nizam irregular cavalry on way with message to hyderabad still le attention be paid to in village of berar many body of rajah troop have already passed through on way to nagpore be naturally taken to be of fugitive travelled a rapidly a possible horse be inured to long journey have made from fifty to sixty mile day halted at village twenty mile east of nagpore nothing unusual have happened harry have just lain down to sleep when there be sound a of people gathering in front of hut be about to rise to see what be going on when door be opened number of armed villager at once poured into room be seized before have time to leap to foot made attempt at resistance believing that mistake have be committed angrily demanded reason of assault be dragged out into street a happened heard pistol shot moment later four trooper rode up one of have remained at door of hut while others have lain down seeing number of people moving about have roused companion have got out of window at back of hut here horse have be picketed mounting at once rode out just a body of men made rush at door of hut by use of pistol sword have broken through seeing

movement monson marched twelve mile when trooper of irregular cavalry overtook with news that have be completely defeated by holkar army that lucan have be made prisoner retreat be continued force reached pas across mountain on evening of following day took up position there holkar cavalry appeared next morning on th holkar arrived sent in demand for surrender of cannon musket be refused holkar dividing horse into three body charged detachment vigorously in front flank defender again again repulsed attack holkar then drew off about four mile be joined by artillery infantry what be opinion captain lindsay colonel monson said if have regiment of british infantry with sir must say that might attack with success with only four battalion of sepoys seems to that retreat must be better choice of two evil will undoubtedly suffer heavily rain be pouring down unceasingly doubt whether will be able to get gun along ought to be able to march a fast a holkar infantry a to cavalry can certainly beat off two long march be made enemy cavalry swarmed round dared not attack force arrived safely at kotah where expected to find food shelter rajah however closed gate refused to admit force pressed on towards ford on chumbul distance be only seven mile from incessant rain state of road whole day be spent in accomplishing ford be impassable during night subsided little be able to cross day halt be necessary in order to procure grain on th when march be continued gun sank so deep in mud that must not be extricated be therefore spiked abandoned two day later force reached river be so swollen that be unfordable artilleryman be sent across on elephant ten day be spent in carrying rest of troop over partly on elephant partly on raft terrible privation be suffered many men be drowned in crossing while wife child of sepoys who by gross mismanagement be left to last be slaughtered by enemy under eye of husband father on th corp reached rampoora where reinforcement of two battalion of sepoys six gun body of cavalry together with supply of grain forwarded by lord lake from agra awaited notwithstanding reinforcement colonel monson considered duty to continue retreat on nd of august reached banass be also in flood boat however be found portion of troop be carried across early next morning holkar cavalry appeared encamped at distance of four mile next day river be fordable most of baggage four battalion crossed enemy cavalry also crossed in great number to right left of british position artillery infantry arrived in afternoon opened fire on battalion still left on bank harry be with seeing that be being decimated by gun called upon sepoys to charge did with great spirit drove back enemy captured of gun mahratta soon rallied led by holkar charged in such overwhelming number that handful of troop be nearly annihilated harry seeing that be lost cut way through enemy horse succeeded in crossing river illustration harry succeeded in crossing river colonel monson continued retreat reached kooshalpur on night of th found that native officer in command there have declared for holkar that fort contained elephant baggage still held out that evening monson learnt that of sepoy officer be in communication with holkar two company large portion of native cavalry deserted whole of enemy cavalry now encamped round detachment at seven in evening colonel monson continued march forming troop into oblong enemy in vain attempted to break on night of th after halting for few hour moved again at one in morning have sooner cleared broken ground than enemy cavalry made desperate charge be repulsed with great coolness sepoys reserving fire till enemy be within bayonet reach at troop worn out by fatigue hunger arrived at biana pas enemy brought up gun retreat be continued confusion in rank have be increasing day now extended troop broke fled to agra pursued by straggling party of enemy for greater portion of distance in consequence of disastrous affair be decided that lord lake must immediately take field although wet weather still continued large tract of country be under water four week after arrival of monson with fugitive army marched out of cantonment encamped on right bank of river situation be critical holkar army numbered ninety two thousand men of whom sixty six thousand be cavalry have with ninety two cannon have advanced to muttra have be abandoned at approach lord lake sent for harry have dangerous mission for captain lindsay consider more than possible that holkar will make attempt to recapture delhi colonel ochterlony in command there must be warned of probability of attack may be in ignorance of what be passing here will bear despatch urging on to do that can to place town in state of defence to summon to assistance a many irregular a possible from neighbouring chief distance be hundred twenty mile leave to whether to go in uniform in disguise think sir have better disguise a doubtless holkar cavalry be spread over country intent on plundering must fall in with ought to have difficulty in passing off a one of will leave uniform here to be brought on with baggage might take into head to search saddlebag think must be wisest plan general said will of course remain at delhi till reinforcement arrive there despatch will be ready for in hour time there be difficulty in obtaining dye at agra harry stained from head to foot put on disguise in have ridden with news of assaye after receiving despatch started at once direct road lay through muttra a holkar main body be at town rode to northeast a far a secundara there be occasion for great haste for be certain that little time must elapse before holkar must march from muttra accordingly stopped for night at coringunga having ridden about fifty mile speedily secured room abdool at once set to to prepare meal while be being cooked there be sound of body of horse entering village be unfortunate that have stopped here abdool said be sure to be questioned ten minute later door opened officer of holkar irregular horse entered hear that have just arrived said rode in hour ago where be going to sambol there seems chance of fighting at present therefore left army to pay visit for day two to friend man have just prepared meal will share with will with pleasure officer said for have ridden from muttra may have to wait hour before supper be ready for what may be name puntojee yours wisnas officer unbuckled sword seated on ground room being entirely unfurnished be in affair when chased english dog from beyond mountain to agra yes be in never wish to campaign in such weather again be wet through for three week hardly feel have got dry yet be brave fellow sepoys in english service be indeed harry agreed seemed that must destroy yet withstood attack weary exhausted a must have be worst of be that after exertion there be booty to be obtained yes be bad one doe feel so disposed to risk one life when there be nothing to be gained did not even succeed in capturing treasure chest if must have brought infantry up must have destroyed have to march at same rate a gun in such weather must get along slowly for often required bullock of four gun to drag one through quagmire be where english have advantage over road be doubt bad enough for be infinitely worse for after have cut up in passing be mistake when scindia began to form regiment of infantry holkar peishwa imitated before that have india at mercy what power must withstand hundred thousand horseman here today there tomorrow then have in power to waste country to starve out fortress from cuttack to north territory extended from great mountain on east to sea in west now can only move at pace of footman while formerly infantry must venture to withstand charge now a see handful of sepoys set at defiance repulsed charge gained agra simply because gun infantry must not arrive to help there can be doubt that be right harry agreed can not blame scindia holkar for forming regiment of infantry trained by foreign officer have seen how regiment so raised by english have won great victory in carnatic bengal did not think at time ere long might become formidable to mahratta scindia holkar raised regiment not to fight against stranger against other be mutual hostility so diminished strength of mahratta when dog fight dog wild boar ravage land be true enough other said a nation might have ruled asia divided among wasting force against other have allowed stranger to wrest province after province from now will go out see that men have got quarter that people of village be feeding a must in truth have be having bad time lately yes indeed thought lucky sometimes to get handful of grain after twenty hour in saddle can not be helped comrade must drive stranger back towards allahabad recover benares agra delhi then will be able to rest in peace for time before settle account with scindia others who have made disgraceful peace with english will never have peace in deccan till sack destroy bombay force last englishman to take to ship harry started with abdool before daybreak next morning riding day reached delhi late in evening putting up horse proceeded to house occupied by colonel ochterlony resident will tell colonel said that be officer with despatch from general lake be at once shown in colonel burn commander of garrison be with resident be surprised that messenger must be native for knew difficulty british officer must encounter in travelling from agra have ridden with despatch for colonel from general lake be captain lindsay have honour of serving on general staff be glad to see sir ochterlony said kindly name be pretty well known to of a of officer who have successfully carried out several dangerous enterprise can not have be one of most dangerous of for indeed in disguise think that anyone must entertain slightest suspicion that be not what appear to be be told speak mahratta perfectly be brought up among mahratta sir have got through easily only once came upon body of holkar cavalry have just arrived captain lindsay yes not ten minute ago colonel rang bell directed servant who came in to bring in wine refreshment then opened despatch after reading passed across to colonel burn of course have heard report of disaster to monson force be a serious a say be very serious sir be with suffered terribly lost gun baggage at least third of infantry be unfortunate very unfortunate captain lindsay have have so many victory of late that native must have almost concluded that be invincible check will encourage will doubtless bring many waverer over to side think that be in way colonel monson fault column be to join that of colonel murray who however doubtless learning great strength holkar have with fell back with only five battalion of sepoys dozen gun be practically impossible that monson must single handed resist attack of ninety thousand men if have have with couple of british battalion regiment two of cavalry might have held pass alone did not seem to possible that must do so especially when enemy cavalry must have crossed hill at other point taken in rear even if have resisted all attack must have be starved out a being in sort of way representative of general lake colonel monson be good enough to ask opinion quite agreed with that best plan be to fall back believed of course that must find shelter at kotah two day march in rear have not rajah declared for holkar shut gate must have be well for beat off attack on way there be treachery that of commandant of kooshalpur caused disaster holkar be at muttra lake be about to march against yes sir if holkar give battle there will doubt be defeated a despatch will have informed general lake feared much that a advance holkar will content with harassing on march with cloud of horseman while with main body of army march rapidly north to endeavour to recapture delhi obtain possession of emperor person be to warn of danger have ridden here danger be doubt serious resident said town be certainly in position for defence wall be in most dilapidated condition must crumble after few hour cannonade colonel burn force be wholly inadequate to defend city of ten mile in circumference irregular troop can not be relied upon in case of need however must do what can a may be sure that general lake will hasten on with speed will not have to hold out for many day now captain lindsay a say that only left agra yesterday morning have ridden eighty mile today be sure have need of rest general have told to employ on duty may think requisite therefore if will come here at eight o'clock tomorrow morning will be glad indeed of service where did leave horse left at khan few minute walk from here then if will go down tell man to bring up can be put up in stable here have already ordered room to be prepared for servant will give man food next morning harry after taking early breakfast servant brought to room went down to colonel ochterlony office have not brought uniform with colonel said for might have be searched that doe not matter two of escort will ride with will be sufficient to show that represent here be list of zemindars within fifteen mile of city will today visit a many of a possible request to ride in to see tomorrow morning have directed that be to have one of horse for after work yours have just have will need two three day rest say nothing about possibility of holkar coming here might hang back if did so must rather meet a body open matter to will be able to see by manner if of have thought of possibility of city being besieged if have of will possibly excuse coming though think that great majority will come for must know well enough that if holkar took city troop must ravage country a have done village through have passed that therefore be to interest to aid in defence be going now to see emperor to obtain from order for able bodied men of city to set to work under order of colonel burn to repair fortification at point where enemy must naturally attack in case where see that call upon make excuse for not coming in have full authority for telling that who do so will be regarded a enemy will be severely punished estate forfeited excuse will be accepted unless on arrival find that man be seriously ill in case will order that son near relation be sent to represent for next three day harry spent whole time on horseback although be evident to that several of visited be averse to going into delhi none of ventured to incur displeasure of english resident by absolute refusal morning therefore colonel ochterlony received harry have visited on previous day told frankly that be possible that holkar might appear before wall assured that have doubt of being able to resist attack until general lake arrived must be sure to do in few day in meantime great number of men laboured at wall battlement have in case fallen gap be filled up with sandbag moat have be neglected for many year be cleared out side made steeper so that attacking party must have to use ladder for descending into climbing out bastion be repaired a far a must be done house in lane ran round inside wall be loopholed for musketry many of irregular cavalry have deserted sepoys stood firm knowing how terrible be cruelty perpetrated by holkar on who fell into hand number be small be to extent strengthened by levy brought in by zemindars there be time to be lost for on nd of september general lake have approached to within mile of muttra have already be abandoned by holkar whose horseman made appearance before delhi on th irregular cavalry of zemindars be ordered to attack a soon a left town dispersed rode away next day enemy infantry artillery came up heavy fire be immediately opened on southeast angle of city wall in twenty four hour whole of parapet be demolished partial breach made in wall sepoys encouraged by presence effort of ochterlony burn stood ground with great courage at nightfall laboured incessantly at repairing breach in making new parapet with sandbag towards morning formed up passed out through one of breach led by officer made rush at battery have be doing so much damage bayoneted drove off enemy stationed there spiked gun in meantime gun have be playing against southern wall here be able to approach through garden ruin of village until near defence establishing powerful

breach be pulled down material used for forming strong barricade at mouth of street leading from house be loopholed everything be prepared for desperate defence during day gun continued to enlarge breach sepoys who have laboured almost incessantly for four night day be able to lie down for hour night passed quietly holkar have probably heard from adherent in town of retrenchment have be formed colonel ochterlony believed that absence of movement towards breach be sign that be making preparation for sudden attack at other point sentry be placed along wall facing encampment of army just before dawn discharge of musket at lahore gate showed that be against that enemy attack be directed sepoys have be bivouacked in open space in centre of city at once proceeded to point threatened in dim early morning light great mass of men must be made out approaching at same moment fifty gun opened fire on gate to cover advance cannon on bastion by gate replied directing fire on infantry column however pushed forward with loud shout many of carried ladder although suffering heavily from musketry fire opened a soon a came within easy range placed ladder against wall strove to climb face of wall be flanked by bastion from incessant fire of musketry be maintained by strong force of sepoys while others repulsed with bayonet effort of assailant to gain footing hurled backwards many of ladder holkar men who have expected to effect surprise carry wall before defender must arrive there soon lost heart in short time fled leaving most of ladder behind little garrison remained under arm day next night expecting assault on morning of th holkar army be seen marching away in distance on th lord lake arrived harry have not taken part in defence of delhi have on day before holkar army arrived before city ridden out to sekerah five twenty mile away be distance beyond point have hitherto reached petty rajah who held wide jagheer must put five hundred men in field small british force have be stationed there have be recalled at once when harry brought news of probable approach of rajah then promised to send three hundred of troop to aid in defence of city none have arrived be mission be to urge to send off instantly rajah have however heard that holkar force be within day march of capital entertaining doubt that must carry feeble defence without difficulty have resolved to throw in lot with harry be now riding in uniform having obtained loan of jacket trouser cap from one of british officer of garrison rajah received in palace harry saw at once by scowling face of men who gathered round that have only waited for news that holkar army be near delhi before throwing off mask of friendship have come over rajah said to tell that colonel ochterlony request that will send available fighting man to delhi at once prays to despatch a many a can possibly gather together rajah replied coldly why must do so by tomorrow night holkar with great army will have captured town why

on way harry have thought over position did not seem to desperate if only holkar failed to capture delhi even if did so there be still hope have doubt that rajah be waiting to see how matter went if holkar captured city must probably send in to a pledge of goodwill might still hesitate until saw issue of battle be likely to be fought outside wall when english army arrived there have hitherto affected friendship with english have offered objection to small force being stationed near town doubtless news of disaster to colonel monson force have shaken convinced that english be not invincible holkar immense army must inflict decisive defeat upon in case who have shown friendly feeling towards english must be made to suffer for by devastation of land loss of jagheer if not of life harry felt therefore that success of attack on delhi must probably be a disastrous to a to defender of city first impulse be to look out from loophole of tower on one side a have noticed rock fell sheer away from foot of wall to depth of two three hundred foot on other side looked down into courtyard sixty foot below be surrounded by high very strong wall bristling with cannon with strong circular bastion at corner immediately below be flat roof of house occupied by rajah when staying at fort round yard be low building doubtless containing provision munition of war of allotted to picked corp who did duty there hut for rest of garrison being lower down hill near second wall in one corner of room be door on trying found to be unfastened opening walked out there be flight of narrow stone step in what be evidently projecting turret ascending found on flat roof on top of tower spent hour here examining carefully feature of ground defence of fort place though strong did not approach in respect many of hill fort that have seen in deccan concluded that british force of moderate strength must easily effect capture though if stoutly held must defy native attack then returned to room below hour later armed native entered one of carried large bundle of straw threw down in one corner bore dish of rice third skin of water have evidently be told not to address for a soon a have placed burden on ground retired without remark be bad harry said to when have left must just a lief sleep on straw a on bed if have have blanket might have made rope though think must have reached roof of house below much le to courtyard so idea must be given up have heard of fellow working way through floor of cell have taken away knife there be not scrap of furniture from must get iron to manufacture tool there be concealing knife when bring food for be sure to be a be today rice other grain boiled not even spoon to eat with door seems only possible way though at present can not see where possibility come in be of solid wood strong enough to cage tiger still if be to get out fancy that must be through door closer examination of did not increase hope even when pushed hardest against did not yield in slightest degree sat down on straw turned over possible idea in mind scheme of getting out of difficulty presented only chance can see be that instead of four fellow coming up with man who brings food there may be only two taking by surprise snatching weapon from might manage three of must not even hope to silence five before gave alarm hope that abdool got away safely think that if did be likely when have once shaken off pursuit to come back try to find out what have become of face must not have be particularly noticed for expect trooper be attacked a soon a entered that scoundrel house if took off uniform went in in native dress there must be little chance of being recognized when find out where have be taken will no doubt go back to delhi report with holkar within two mile have too much on hand to think of sending to demand release if holkar fails to take place retires a lake approach there will doubt be hot pursuit certainly must not send two three hundred men here le than must be of good whatever rajah have committed by murder of trooper a can not hope for forgiveness must either fly to oude else move in here with force with must think safe from anything short of army be certain that with such important work on hand men can be spared for rescue expedition there be not shadow of chance unless holkar be defeated having settled matter in mind decided that amount of thinking must enable to see way of escaping harry dismissed subject from thought ate rice lay down a soon a became dark having have little rest for past week two day passed a be sitting on platform over cell heard distant boom knew that holkar be besieging delhi next day to satisfaction sound of cannonading be again distinct at rate said to have not carried place by sudden rush there be regularity about fire show that be deliberate doubt be breaching one of wall going to other side of platform saw that good many of rajah follower be standing on wall listening to firing wall be thirty five foot below spot where be standing neither loophole of cell commanded view of so that prisoner must hold conversation with guard below presently man came up on to wall approached group there be like others dressed in small white turban short jacket made of unbleached hemp underneath be loose tunic bound at waist with sash coming down to knee carried spear matchlock across shoulder small shield be slung others did not turn round when few yard from looked up at harry latter saw to delight that be abdool harry dared not make gesture might be noticed nodded head slightly walked to other side of platform where remained for short time then returned abdool looked again in direction continued to talk with others a to attack upon town agreed with holkar must make short work of defender presently whole party descended to courtyard together of went down to lower wall to talk to comrade there whether abdool accompanied be still in fort harry must not make out did not indeed remain long on platform after looking towards delhi for little time went down to room be evident that abdool have enlisted in rajah service have doubt be engaged by governor of fort rajah must be uneasy in mind must assuredly take on men presented in order to strengthen if holkar failed to take town also to gain latter approbation by joining with a large force a possible probably abdool have only enlisted on previous day must of course need time to acquaint with fortification position of guard manner in must best communicate with harry meal be brought up twice day at seven o'clock in morning at nightfall hitherto have be quiet patient a there be nothing to be done to await course of event now that knew abdool be there must certainly endeavour to open communication with be difficult for to keep quiet passed hour in pacing round round room occasionally went up to roof must see sign of abdool therefore remained short time on lookout a be to keep on watching courtyard might attract notice idea might occur to someone that be expecting signal to be made to three day passed without sign then when guard came in with ration harry saw that abdool be one of number a glanced at abdool who be standing little way behind others shook head retired with harry felt momentary disappointment saw at once that nothing must be attempted in broad daylight that be at night only that there be possibility of success thought that abdool have only come up in order to see nature of fastening of door general position be not with party who came up in evening in centre of rice harry found small piece of paper rolled into ball there be not however light enough to enable to read lay awake night at first gleam of daylight went up on to platform seating so that be not visible from below waited till must see to read letter be of course in mahratti so badly written that have difficulty in deciphering finally however made out tomorrow evening when come up will attack others if go well if not will try next evening so intent be in deciphering writing that have hardly noticed outburst of heavy firing in distance have feared enemy have captured delhi on previous day a have heard no firing now roar of cannon be very heavy have doubt that holkar be trying to take town by assault in le than hour sound ceased suddenly have taken town be beaten off decisively said to in afternoon saw party of horseman approaching followed by palanquin look hopeful said to messenger have probably brought rajah news that assault have failed be bringing zenana here for safety until hears issue of battle will probably take place in day two wonder whether will upset abdool plan rajah return be greeted by discharge of matchlock presently however be succeeded by cry of rage clamour of voice holkar have be thrashed now be toss up whether rajah will in anger send up have brought down executed think chance be in favour fellow be evidently crafty must not have persuaded ochterlony that be friendly towards think will hold a sort of hostage so that if holkar be defeated may make favourable term for by offering to surrender be not until hour later that harry party ascending stair when door opened saw that two of men carried torch abdool who be in rear closed door behind then said now sahib struck down man in front of with tulwar harry have risen to foot a heard men coming have braced up for spring when abdool gave word with blow straight from shoulder struck man carrying dish senseless to floor tore sword from sash warded off hasty blow delivered by one torch bearer who be too much astonished at sudden attack to act with decision cut down while at same moment abdool almost severed neck of other thanks abdool harry said grasping follower hand have saved life not yet sahib work have begun there be other danger to be met however arrival of rajah have be fortunate news have brought have first let finish man knocked down there be occasion for tear sash into strip bind hand foot gag with own turban now what be next step have rope round body sahib to lower on to rampart be wearing extra suit of clothes so that can get up a one of garrison think have plenty of time for be not likely that men will be missed everyone be too excited by news that holkar have failed to take delhi to notice whether return not took off outer garment that have brought with while harry removed uniform attired in placing turban of one of soldier on head possessed of shield spear dagger then said what next abdool will put out torch sahib be still burning on floor light might be noticed from below might wonder why stayed here so long be there guard on wall sahib have on lower wall not here torch be extinguished then went up to platform above fastened one end of rope to battlement having first tied knot at short interval will go down first on to wall sahib if by chance man may have come up from below be not likely can hide at once commenced to lower down in two three minute abdool be joined by harry courtyard be dark save that few torch burned here there great babble of talking be going on window of rajah house be lighted up what be plan abdool see that will be able to get through gate here without fear of discovery be gate through other wall shut yes sahib be always closed at sunset except where road come up to gate there be only one place where rock project at foot of wall there be possibility of climbing down be where have intended must cross wall height be twenty foot there have rope of length there be sentry placed except over gate be quite possible that even there there be none tonight there be order among fellow a there be among company troop a there be enemy near think that watch be unnecessary if have be sent there be pretty sure to have gone to hut to talk over news from delhi matter must be easy enough may a well start at once fellow will quieten down presently will then be more likely to hear noise may make looking about went down by stair leading to courtyard walked carelessly across taking care to avoid mingling with excited group at same time keeping a far from torch burning in courtyard a possible passed through gate be standing open without guard followed zigzag road with tower placed at corner mounting two gun so a to sweep approach there be two high wall on hand loopholed for musketry abdool said that there be platform wide enough for two men to pas along whole length of road terminated in heavy gate forty yard above through outer wall bastion covered so be lower gate carried enemy must not be able to bring gun to bear against gate stood open passing through behind bastion came at once upon low stone built hut where majority of garrison lived in time of peace several torch be burning here round of be group of men talking excitedly leaving harry behind one of hut abdool strolled up for few minute to listen to conversation then rejoined master what be saying abdool be saying sir that be wrong of holkar to attack city before have defeated english have cost many life when english be defeated will be able without doubt to capture city probably must open gate to seeing that assistance must come to one doubt then holkar will defeat not in least abdool replied say that have two hundred cannon will mow down english then cavalry will charge there will be end of matter seem to have forgotten about laswaree harry said have better be going where be way up to wall close by sahib ascended step a far a must be seen wall be entirely deserted made way cautiously until close to gate harry then stopped abdool went on with noiseless tread soon returned be a thought sentry be yet posted that tower over gate abdool be great deal too high for to descend by rope that have got yes sahib go out by entrance on to bastion flanking gate rope will be long enough there at rate there will be very short drop entered tower through door communicating with wall abdool led way keep close to sahib went down here morning can find way in dark did not think that there be much chance of coming way be better to find out about moving slowly cautiously came to flight of step descended twenty foot found at open portal leading on to flanking bastion rope be soon fixed will go first sahib will let know how far will have to drop for wall look to higher than be at point where intended to descend illustration abdool at once slipped down be tied round neck of gun abdool at once slipped down there be pause then slight dull sound rope hung loose knot at end be ten foot from ground abdool said in low tone be near enough harry replied then swung over when came to last knot lowered to full length of arm let go fall be not much more than yard abdool stood close by ready to catch must miss foothold on alighting at once started at rapid pace down hill have nearly reached plain when deep note of horn be heard be alarm harry exclaimed have found out have gone will soon be after there be fear of catching abdool said a broke into trot one will know at first what have happened everyone will run to post then will have to search fort ground between lower wall will take time may be hour before horseman start did not think that must miss till tomorrow morning suppose rajah sent up for to amuse by threatening must hardly venture to do more until be sure that holkar have defeated however a say there be very little chance of catching a soon a be down on plain harry went on have better strike north for hour two be sure to ride across plain in direction of delhi thinking will make straight for city will be best sahib fortunately rain have ceased sky be cloudless so that be able to direct course by star for two hour kept due north then turned west be long journey from point where turned harry calculated that must be nearly fifty mile fort be fifteen mile northeast of sekerah be now farther away from delhi than have be when started felt advantage of light native dress sandal abdool have given instead of boot when came across cultivated ground walked great portion of country be sandy waste with ruin of village temple have in palmy day of empire stood there across went at trot for sand be generally compact enough to sustain weight will hardly get there before day break sahib abdool remarked be of little consequence probably by time holkar will have marched away to give battle what be more likely to recruit for many mile round delhi country will be rejoicing at having be spared ruin must have befallen have taken city so have fear that will be hindered on way for though may wonder at appearance for dye have now almost worn off anyone can see be white will be more willing to render assistance there be fear of rajah horseman keeping up pursuit beyond halfway between sekerah city for must know that zemindars people round be in favour that might be attacked when beyond limit of rajah jagheer when morning broke must see in distance minaret of delhi must be ten mile away abdool will enter next house come to fancy from position must be close to residence of zemindar who at once brought in force of fifty men to aid in defence of town there be sure of hospitable treatment indeed sorely need rest food have eaten nothing since yesterday morning counting distance made to north after leaving fort must have walked nearly fifty mile mile farther saw house made straight for be shuja khan within harry asked armed retainer standing at entrance soldier recognized harry having seen when called upon master replied returned last night lord will tell captain lindsay who be treacherously captured by rajah of sekerah have just escaped be on way to city that asks for hospitality enter lord man said salaaming deeply master will be sure gladly receive showed harry into large room where few minute later zemindar joined peace be with sahib be rejoiced to see in safety for heard at delhi that have not returned there be fear ill have befallen escort escort be killed carried prisoner to rajah hill fort have owed escape to faithfulness of servant who got away when others be massacred disguising got into fort contrived escape honour be to zemindar said then have walked night yes went ten mile to north first knowing that must be pursued for heard alarm given just after started have walked fifty mile when say have eaten nothing since yesterday morning may be sure that be sorely in need of refreshment will be got ready at once sahib while be being prepared can take bath change of garment need bath almost a much a need feed harry laughed have just be looking into glass see be well nigh a dark a when came to nine ten day ago host led to room containing bath be soon filled by servant one of whom brought in handsome suit of zemindar clothes be more than hour before went down again a soon a entered room servant brought in meal consisting of slice of meat on skewer pillau of chicken zemindar sat by while ate meal harry gave short account of manner in have effected escape former in turn related event of siege adding that spy have brought in news late in afternoon that holkar must march away in morning a have heard that english army be two day distant be going to meet english to retire towards malwar can not say sahib for spy must not tell doubtless army be much dispirited at failure to take city general opinion of townspeople be that must give battle be victorious must return continue siege have fear of being victorious know in battle of assaye poona how scindia be utterly routed how at laswaree delhi mahratta be scattered think that will venture upon giving battle if doe have fear whatever of result be more than whole army must do to break up monson force although composed entirely of native infantry until be near agra time there will be british infantry cavalry mahratta will never stand against charge harry have already enquired about abdool found that have also have meal be now asleep now sahib shuja said be best that must rest for time there will be nought doing in delhi today after heat of day be over can supply with horse escort harry accepted invitation for be stiff sore from exertion man showed to room have be prepared for be soon fast asleep did not awake until sun be getting low at once went downstairs horse be ready zemindar said pray to take meal before mounting be ready will be served directly harry who have be too tired to do justice to food in morning be by mean sorry to take meal a rose to go thanked zemindar most heartily for kindness be honour that have bestowed upon zemindar said courteously brave countryman be fighting to free from oppression of mahratta one of race must meet with hearty welcome here horse be now brought round one intended for harry be very handsome animal richly caparisoned be fine horse indeed said a be about to mount horse be yours sahib shuja khan said be of good breed will carry far fast will esteem great honour that must ride thank pray 't be little thing to do for one of brave defender of whose deed one of officer be telling when be deploring loss thank most heartily khan after manner in have given can not refuse so handsome present will be proud to ride animal may be sure that a do so will often think of who presented to will assuredly mention to colonel ochterlony very great kindness with have received a rode off followed by escort of four of zemindar retainer saw with satisfaction that abdool be also attired in clean white garment have done well hope abdool have be well treated indeed sahib zemindar head man told be to consider horse on ride own will carry well for be stout serviceable animal be wondering what must do for horse for there be few in city a most of owning sent away with valuable on hearing of holkar approach zemindar be generous man indeed have a heard presented with horse be riding be certainly splendid animal though own be good one be far better in fact have seen handsomer horse anywhere wish have a good one abdool then need not fear being overtaken though mahratta army be in pursuit entered city by northern gate saw nothing of enemy who be encamped on other side of city harry be most warmly received by colonel ochterlony have be in much anxiety about said that have be detained be certain hoped that petty rajah must not have ventured to harm for must be sure that sooner later must have heavy reckoning with fancy sir that be waiting for news from here be convinced that holkar must take city defeat lord lake have done so have doubt that must either have sent prisoner to must have despatched forwarded only head a felt certain that thing must not turn out a stated have great fear for life thought that might have be kept prisoner for very long time for lord lake must have hand full in other direction then released on news that holkar have failed to capture city sir got away owing to fidelity of orderly who after riding off when two trooper with be attacked killed entered hill fort where be confined took service there contrived escape will hand in report with detail for perusal when thing have quietened down bit man have rendered other valuable service must be greatly pleased if in consideration of fidelity daring that have shown must think fit to recommend for promotion a native officer belongs to rd bombay cavalry must certainly have pleasure in doing so captain lindsay will of course be drawing up list of zemindars others who have rendered service recommending for reward to government if will give particular a to man name service will include in list have be with time have not yes sir for upwards of six year accompanied from calcutta to nagpore when went on mission to rajah whom be desirable to keep neutral until war in mysore be brought to end be at assaye journeyed in disguise across country with to carry news of victory to general lake took part with in cavalry charge at laswaree in retreat of colonel monson column be quite good enough colonel ochterlony said must think that must be shortest best way for to recommend direct to lord lake who must be able to put in order at once at same time will send to calcutta recommendation that special reward must be granted to there will be large number of forfeiture of estate of who have sided with scindia holkar make doubt that on strong recommendation will obtain grant of revenue of village two such grant must do good by showing that instance of fidelity even in case of private soldier go unnoticed unrewarded expect general arrival here in couple of day will be very glad sir if only because uniform be coming on with baggage at present with white face showy native dress feel that be stared at by everyone meet uniform captain ewart lent have to leave behind when made escape will not inconvenience poor fellow colonel said for be almost cut in two by cannon shot a enemy advanced to last assault when general arrived within three mile of city harry rode out to camp having first obtained uniform went in to report so got through safely captain lindsay supposed that have when news reached that delhi be defending stoutly for have not have day warning must hardly have held out for hour be colonel burn report of military operation of siege sir be letter from resident be own report of doings since left at agra thank captain lindsay will have communication to send to colonel ochterlony afternoon must be obliged if will carry for harry bowed left then joined officer of staff who be just sitting down to lunch be glad to see again so managed to get through holkar line lindsay oh yes met with difficulty only fell in once with of troop spent evening with officer after rode through without interruption there be really no danger think holkar must have suspected of being british officer now about siege may imagine that be very anxious about for though of course must soon have retaken place there must have be general plunder massacre by brute holkar must wait for particular until get there harry said for know nothing about except what have heard how be be at time prisoner in hand of petty rajah of sekerah promised to send in three hundred men day before holkar arrived be sent to urge to despatch instantly to aid in defence be evidently impressed with idea that holkar be going to retake place without difficulty must afterwards annihilate army so thinking be winning side arrested sent off to hill fort fifteen mile away murdered two trooper how did get away harry gave account of manner in abdool have managed escape fellow a be jewel be indeed major must not part with for money came round with from bombay to calcutta six year ago have ridden with ever since fought most gallantly in malay peninsula at many other place in report to general of last adventure have mentioned service with in various journey have strongly recommended promotion well deserves major said have like carried life in hand for if have be detected undoubtedly must have shared fate chapter awkward position three hour later harry be sent for by general have read report captain lindsay thoroughly concur with that very meritorious conduct of soldier of rd bombay cavalry who have so long be attached to service must be rewarded can not of course promote in own regiment will therefore appear in order tomorrow a appointed havildar in th bengal cavalry be at present under command with statement that having now completed ten year service in bombay army having for six year of be serving chiefly in presidency having distinguished by fidelity courage have now be specially singled out for promotion will be henceforth in charge of escort of twenty men of new regiment attached to general staff a to sir have in despatch will be sent off evening strongly recommended to governor general for promotion to rank of major be see by army list promoted to rank of captain seven year ago before being sent to calcutta considering distinguished dangerous service that have rendered wonder that have not received step be however accounted for by fact that have now for time be away from calcutta with general wellesley be sure that recommendation will at once be complied with be very grateful for kindness sir owe to own merit not to kindness on part lord lake said have altogether exceptional record even in comparatively short time that have be with have performed most valuable service colonel monson report most highly of conduct during retreat mission that undertook at request to colonel ochterlony be most dangerous one in sufficient to ensure promotion there be many zealous officer in service few indeed so qualified by acquaintance with native language a to undertake mission with have be entrusted have so successfully carried out harry took despatch at once mounted horse abdool have brought round a soon a master be summoned to general tent after have left camp called abdool up to side latter be still in native dress abdool will have to look out for cook body servant unless indeed have trooper told off to abdool looked at harry in astonishment how be that lord be dissatisfied with harry laughed not in way abdool upon contrary name will appear in order tomorrow a promoted to rank of havildar in th bengal cavalry a recognition of faithful service be great honour abdool said especially a have not served a soubahdar must far rather stay with have be father to pray to let remain a be be to remain with abdool if have have to leave must have told general be sure must rather not do so that when left must myself show gratitude for good service of own accord have arranged be not to join new regiment be to command twenty sowars of th be to be attached to of general staff for escort duty in way will still be with a native officer instead of servant must be sent on special duty will be sure be able to go with a before abdool face brightened must be well indeed sahib will truly be great honour to be officer if ever return to native village in deccan will be regarded with great respect face of father mother will be made white at honour have won still fear that will not be a much with a have be before nearly a much abdool expect that lord lake knowing how much be indebted to will permit to take with when engaged on detached service trooper will form part of escort at time besides be likely that a matter stand will not be sent away on special duty for time to come will know be glad to hear that general have recommended for promotion also that will shortly be major plea more than own promotion sahib thought that must have have long ago after business at nagpore have only be captain then few month be very young for rank must have be unfair to others if have be promoted then be still very young to be major be not year what have done abdool said did not obtain release of nana furnuwees so change state of affair altogether at poona well be for got rank of captain since then though have made few journey must have be perilous have not be able to speak mahratti like native have have opportunity of specially distinguishing a soon a get to delhi have better order uniform know dress worn by native officer of th must hurry tailor on for may be sure that army will not remain long at delhi will set off to meet holkar a soon a provision be collected for there be saying how far may have to march before meet think that will be in hurry to give battle on th of october army arrived before delhi holkar cavalry be still in neighbourhood news came that infantry with considerable number of gun few thousand horseman have left on th crossed jumna below panniput to attack detachment of one battalion of sepoys matchlock men who be under colonel burn returning to station at saharunpoor from have hastened when report reached that holkar meditated attack on delhi be overtaken by holkar at inhabitant of place joined holkar burn formed camp into square repulsed attack until general lake with six regiment of cavalry horse artillery brigade of infantry arrived to relief on rd of november when holkar at once retired marched south into district known a doab where horseman plundered burnt village near line of route general lake followed at once have before leaving delhi sent rest of british infantry with two regiment of cavalry under general fraser to attack holkar infantry artillery have retired into dominion of rajah of bhurtpoor who although have be first to enter into alliance with british after capture of agra have now declared against have taken up position near rajah fortress of deeg be believed to be impregnable position be very strong one extensive morass deep tank covered front on left be fortified village on right fort of deeg be supported by several line of battery harry have be directed to accompany general fraser be to take with abdool little troop to serve a escort furnish messenger abdool now in new uniform rode at head behind general fraser staff a reconnoitred enemy position felt small pride in changed position especially a british officer of staff of whom have heard of manner in have brought about harry escape took special notice of on march one other have often dropped behind to have talk with next morning british troop moved forward to attack in two line th regiment rushed impetuously against fortified village drove defender out at point of bayonet tremendous fire be at once opened by battery behind without for moment hesitating th charged be speedily in thick of enemy st bengal european regiment followed seeing almost surrounded ran down to assistance be followed by sepoys holkar infantry unable to resist assault fled to shelter of next line of gun general fraser led attack upon be also carried general fell mortally wounded colonel monson who now succeeded to command reformed troop who be in disorder owing to impetuosity of charge led forward again battery after battery be captured number of holkar men tried to cross morass sank in mud lost life rest took refuge under wall of deeg whose gun at once opened fire upon pursuer while tide pressed forward unchecked mahratta horse have ridden down in rear of british have taken possession of first line of battery have turned gun upon late captor consequence must have be serious have not captain norford gathered together twenty eight men of th regiment led against mahratta horse staggered by daring with handful of men advanced against fired hasty volley fled captain norford be killed men took possession of gun mahratta thinking that day be altogether lost did not attempt to recapture a fortress of deeg be far too strong to be attacked by force unprovided with siege gun british drew back until beyond range of cannon carrying off gun captured in battery eighty seven in number total amount of artillery employed against troop be le than one hundred sixty gun loss be naturally heavy amounting to over six hundred forty killed wounded while of enemy be estimated at two thousand killed smothered in morass force encamped beyond reach of gun of deeg awaiting order from general lake battle be scarcely over when colonel monson rode up to harry said be of great importance that general lake must receive news of victory a soon a possible there be one so well fitted to carry a be there will be occasion for disguise time for holkar depredation must have excited whole population against at same time have better take havildar trooper with will command respect if must come across small body of holkar marauder be sure that will give good account of can give indication a to where general lake be likely to be at present sir marched from shamsheer to mahomedabad a probably took road through sekerah doubt settled account with rascally rajah understood from that suspected holkar must make for sherdanah a begum of place have five battalion of drilled troop forty gun must be welcome reinforcement after will of course be guided by holkar movement report of peasantry lead to believe that enemy be advancing in direction of furukabad must say that have best cross jumna at muttra ride to alighur in way will not be likely to meet holkar force must at present be beyond ganges hour later harry started with escort crossed jumna at muttra there learned that holkar have night before arrived within twelve mile of town be a usual destroying everything before harry continued course to cod within mile two of alighur reached late in evening capture of fort believed to be impregnable have have effect of producing so profound respect for british arm harry on arrival be received by principal men of town large house be placed at disposal for escort supply be at once furnished when meal have be eaten horse attended to troop lay down for night harry have be informed that horseman have brought in news that british army have arrived at bareilly started at daybreak late next evening after ride of over one hundred mile rode into lord lake camp what news do bring general asked a alighted from horse have to report sir on th force under general fraser attacked enemy who be very strongly posted within gunshot of fortress of deeg after hard fighting completely defeated captured eighty seven of gun drove from under gun of deeg at once opened fire on enemy loss be estimated at two thousand ours be not known when left camp be roughly estimated at over six hundred in killed wounded among former regret to say be general fraser who be mortally wounded by cannon shot while leading on men be sorry to hear of loss general lake said while rest of news be satisfactory indeed report have reached that rajah of bhurtpoor have joined holkar after coming into agra begging that must accept a ally have difficulty in believing that must have turned against especially a must have known that if holkar be defeated must have to bear whole brunt of anger must not hope to escape a territory lie within two three day march of agra general called staff told of brilliant victory have be won at deeg news spread rapidly through camp be greeted with enthusiastic cheer by troop in meantime lord lake have entered tent obtained full particular of battle be close to general fraser when be struck sir harry concluded escort be with cavalry when charged second line of battery five of escort be killed may say that others led by havildar be among first in at gun have just received news general said that holkar crossed morning at surajepoor be believed to be on way to furukabad be evidently on march to deeg if join troop there may attack colonel monson force therefore intend to leave tent infantry to follow will start at daybreak with cavalry horse artillery hope to overtake especially a have lately moved fast will probably rest day two at next day cavalry marched upwards of forty mile on following morning continued journey have fifty eight mile now before with occasional halt marched day crossed ganges at surajepoor pushed on until within mile of holkar camp believing british to be many mile away precaution have be taken against surprise first intimation of enemy being near at hand be opening of fire at daybreak by lord lake artillery into camp gun being posted so a to permit british cavalry to attack without coming across line of fire round after round of grape be poured into camp then gun ceased firing a six regiment of cavalry dashed in among panic stricken enemy scarcely resistance be attempted in few minute ground be strewn with dead holkar have mounted ridden off with portion of cavalry before men entered camp did not draw rein until reached caline eighteen mile distant troop fled in direction hotly pursued by cavalry for twelve mile great number being overtaken cut down cavalry halted from sheer fatigue having performed almost unparalleled march of seventy mile since last halting place exploit rendered more wonderful by fact that have made march of three hundred fifty mile in preceding fortnight loss in action be only two killed twenty wounded holkar loss be estimated at three killed on field half of cavalry be previously sixty thousand strong be now scattered fugitive that day three royal salute be fired for a many victory namely that at furukabad at deeg capture of shaddone last of holkar fortress in south by colonel wallis a be expected holkar cavalry a soon a recovered from panic rode to deeg joined remains of infantry artillery there general lake remained day two to rest troop after exertion brigade of infantry have be left behind when cavalry started on last march have be ordered to move rapidly down to agra to escort thence heavy gun must be required for siege of deeg on st of december general lake joined force near fortress battering train arrived from agra on th trench be opened on following day in point of territory country ruled over by rajah of bhurtpoor be comparatively small one be inhabited by people called jat who differed in many respect from community round be hardy industrious brave have at one time taken prominent share in war of part of india have be master of agra have lost city however in with considerable portion of territory under present rajah however have regained of lost ground on entering into alliance with british have received considerable increase of territory in circumstance defection be wholly unexpected rajah have standing army of six thousand men must on emergency place fifty thousand in field nevertheless seeing how other very much more powerful native prince have be unable to withstand british arm conduct be not only ungrateful treacherous wholly unaccountable be necessary for army to move forward to deeg with great circumspection holkar cavalry constantly hovered round have to protect enormous train conveying siege appliance provision for force in view of comparatively small equipage now deemed sufficient in native war in india size of accompanied lord lake army on occasion appears prodigious follower be estimated at not le than sixty thousand besides elephant camel hundred thousand bullock be employed on preparation for advance into town during night holkar garrison of deeg retired made for bhurtpoor on morning of th therefore british took unopposed possession of deeg capturing there in battery outside hundred gun week later general lake moved forward to bhurtpoor holkar a before have not entered town have formed camp few mile distant here be able to maintain for rajah of bhurtpoor have called to assistance great marauding leader ameer khan who be raiding in bundelcund also leader named bapeejee scindia with rajah cavalry that of holkar formed so powerful force that british cavalry be fully occupied in keeping at distance from camp in protecting convoy on day of arrival of army before bhurtpoor harry who have now be gazetted to rank of major be sent to agra thirty four mile distant with order respecting convoy be about to be sent off from there be accompanied by abdool ten trooper at time ameer khan have not appeared upon scene be not considered that there be danger of communication with agra being interfered with harry reached city in afternoon waited there until four o'clock next day seeing that preparation for convoy be very large one be completed started at hour be to get a far a possible by so that must be able to reach camp by following evening after seeing in motion harry started with escort for ride back be ten mile away from convoy when night fell bhurtpoor like deeg stood on plain surrounded by swamp morass situation having be chosen from difficulty offered to advance of enemy after proceeding for five mile farther abdool who be riding with harry said know sahib seems to by sound of horse hoof that have left track harry called halt abdool dismounted found that suspicion be correct that have certainly left road be awkward harry said for know how long be since left whether be to right hand left night be indeed very dark one mist almost covered sky be only occasionally that star must be seen must go carefully will fall in one of morass two trooper be sent off one to right other to left one of when have gone about quarter of mile be heard to shout that be fast in morass abdool four of men rode to assistance presently returned with having with greatest difficulty extricated horse nothing have be heard of other trooper again again harry shouted reply came back waited hour then concluded that man on return have missed way altogether that have fallen into swamp when be too far off to hear voice have perished there harry again gave word for to move on time at walk abdool preceded on foot presently said ground be getting softer sahib think that be approaching swamp have better dismount harry said setting example now let move in different direction going very cautiously calling out if come upon soft ground with two of trooper remained with horse one after men came upon swampy ground one only continued to find firm suppose that be way came into abdool harry said a others returned to horse must follow will do on foot be getting serious for quarter of mile kept on ground be comparatively firm then man ahead of gave sudden shout have fallen waist deep into little stream be soon hauled out there be nothing to be done abdool to halt till morning let go back till can find piece of ground dry enough to lie down upon have made however little progress when foot began to sink up to ankle be use abdool have evidently lost bearing altogether must stay where be till morning will get helplessly bogged hour passed slowly painfully from time to time men endeavoured to find firmer ground always without success be with deepest satisfaction at last saw sky begin to lighten hour later be able to form idea of position be far in what appeared to be wide morass there be pool of water in place seemed almost miraculous that must have succeeded in so far entering swamp where even by daylight there scarcely seemed yard of firm ground abdool again went ahead step by step little troop followed frequently having to turn back again on finding line that be pursuing impassable be still hundred yard from what appeared to be solid ground when heard loud shout looking round saw fifty horseman skirting edge of morass when reached point opposite to little party dismounted opened fire one of trooper fell dead several of horse be hit there be nothing for to surrender abdool harry said a of trooper returned fire enemy rode off for hundred yard then leaving horse in charge of few of number returned to edge of morass threw down in long coarse grass again opened fire two more of trooper fell at first discharge harry drew out handkerchief waved illustration harry drew out handkerchief waved will not surrender if be be men said to abdool must only be tortured then put to death if be bhurtpoor men may have fair treatment therefore a soon a enemy have stopped firing shouted whose soldier be rajah of bhurtpoor be shouted back will surrender if will swear to take to bhurtpoor hand over to rajah if will not do so will defend to last native officer stood up assuredly will take to rajah swear on faith very well then send man to guide out of place order be given one of men went back mounted horse rode along by edge of morass for nearly mile others more slowly followed be clear that place in front of be absolutely impassable harry said must never move away be lucky that have not got favourite horse today sir abdool said for harry have bought from one of cavalry horse have be captured from mahratta a one be insufficient for work have to do must be very glad indeed abdool if thought be likely to return to camp soon in such peril a be small satisfaction to know that be safe what do think of chance sahib think rajah of bhurtpoor will harm must feel that situation be almost desperate must put beyond reach of pardon if be to massacre prisoner jat have now dismounted must be seen making way towards on foot sometimes coming straight more often making long bend turn be evident by absence of hesitation in movement that be well acquainted with morass if be only way to harry said be marvellous indeed that made way so far think sahib that be instinct of horse felt mine pull at rein a be leading sometimes to right sometimes to left always let have way knowing that horse can see smell better than can a be in single file followed without noticing turn in ten minute man arrived spoke to harry language differed widely from mahratti that spoken by people of bengal however signed to trooper to lay down arm when have done so started to rejoin others leading horse party followed path be fairly firm harry have doubt that be used by fowler in search of game with at certain season of year lake morass abounded when arrived at edge of swamp where others be awaiting harry handed sword to leader party then mounted surrounded by jat rode to bhurtpoor entrance be greeted with loud shout acclamation by populace making way straight through town covered large extent of ground reached palace noble building built upon rock rose abruptly from plain ascending steep path leading to gate party entered courtyard here captive remained in charge of horseman while leader went in to report to rajah illustration view of rajah palace bhurtpoor presently came out with four of rajah guard led harry abdool into audience chamber rajah with number of personal attendant entered took seat be officer in english army what be rank rajah said in mahratti be major of what regiment be on personal staff of general man be native officer at present commanding portion of general escort how be that be alone last night have ridden to agra day before be too late in starting back to gain camp before be dark lost way finding that be in heart of morass be obliged to wait till morning be well that did not try to get out have done so none of must be here now speak mahratti like native be year at poona a child have mahratta woman a nurse learnt from rajah be silent for minute two then asked doe general think that be going to capture town know be going to try will not succeed rajah said positively gave up deeg because did not want large force shut up there wall be strong be levelled to ground must still defend place to last be aware that people be brave rajah fought well indeed if holkar troop have fought a stoutly result might have be different rajah again sat in thought for time then said wish to treat harshly can honour brave men even when be enemy will have apartment assigned to here be treated a guest only venture to leave palace at least unless leave with there be many who have lost friend at deeg many who may lose life before army retires must not answer for safety must like native officer to be with must esteem great favour rajah have be with for several year regard a friend thank also for courtesy to will give promise not to try to escape a harry believed that in course of short time british must be master of town assented without hesitation rajah looked pleased need be under uneasiness a to trooper will of course be in confinement beyond that will have reason to complain of treatment rajah said few word to one of attendant who at once motioned to harry abdool to follow harry bowed to rajah with abdool followed attendant be taken to commodious chamber wall divan be of white marble floor be paved with same material in two colour framework of window be elaborately carved be evident that room be at ordinary time used a guest chamber attendant left for few minute be better than have even hoped for abdool there can be doubt that rajah though put good face on be desperately anxious behaves to in way in hope that may finally obtain better term than otherwise must do by good treatment of look honest straightforward sahib 't be strange that must have behaved so treacherously just after company have granted increase of territory must make allowance for doubt like indian prince have have to do with be ready to join strongest side heard that holkar be coming down with immense army believed that must not be able to withstand in case a ally must share in misfortune territory must be ravaged killed taken back a prisoner to deccan be probably hesitating when news came of monson disastrous retreat doubtless confirmed opinion of holkar invincibility determined a only way of saving to declare for attendant now entered with four men bearing cushion for divan carpet for floor large ewer basin with soft embroidered towel pile of rug for bed after have retired harry went to window looked out below be courtyard room be on first story well if be to be prisoner abdool must hardly wish to be better suited fortnight rest will do harm for have be riding hard almost ever since left agra with monson force be well sahib that be with when be captured have be alone must have have mercy be because rajah regard a valuable prisoner that have be spared if have not given promise think might have made escape might have done so abdool if have not given promise may be sure that must not have be lodged so comfortably chapter bhurtpoor hour later attendant entered with two servant carrying large tray with variety of dish after have eaten meal harry proposed that must go up to top of one of central tower of palace to obtain general view of country must be better to do than to venture down into courtyard at present abdool sight of uniform might give offence a must not be understood that have rajah permission to move about palace must wait till man come in with tray be possible that may understand enough mahratti to make out what want will show way up must never do for to try to ascend alone might accidentally open door of rajah zenana then doubt if even desire to hold a hostage must suffice to save life attendant understood enough of mahratti to make out request offered at once to accompany ascended numerous staircase until at last reached flat roof of palace above rose three round tower surmounted by dome highest of have gallery running round few foot below dome attendant led way to on reaching gallery found that commanded very wide view over flat country town covered considerable space wall being eight mile in circumference at eastern end fort square solid edifice be built on ground somewhat higher than town have bastion flanking tower a have be learned from prisoner taken at deeg have moat much wider deeper than ran round town wall be built within one side of square looking across country while other three be inside although house be for most part scattered town have picturesque appearance from number of tree growing within towards northeast fort of deeg must be clearly seen to southwest mosque fort of agra be faintly visible in clear air at distance of mile half from city be british camp with white tent irregular black mass marked low shelter of camp follower enormous concourse of draught animal certainly seemed hazardous enterprise for so small number of troop to attack large populous town strongly fortified held by brave people harry remarked on to abdool latter said confidently can not stand against english sahib general lake have always be victorious have so abdool be one of reason why feel so certain of success a did have never yet undertaken siege impetuosity confidence in troop may lead to make attack with insufficient number before be really practicable think that town be to be taken by storm doubt whether lord lake will be content to wait for regular siege operation before try assault look over there towards agra if be not mistaken there be large body of cavalry out there be certainly not men be too much mixed up for possibly rajah may have obtained aid of band of pindarees of other irregular troop at rate will give trouble to convoy left yesterday looked at camp again there be stir in valley look a if have heard of force out there be about to start to attack three regiment of cavalry set out a be getting ready two horseman must be seen to ride off at gallop from group of tree mile from camp a soon a approached mass of horseman in distance turned rode off at full speed have evidently idea of fighting today whoever be may a well go down again abdool be grand lookout will at rate get general idea of direction in attack will be made two day later be able from lookout to see that body of men came went between camp group of tree halfway between town expect that be establishing battery among tree harry said will not be long before affair begin next morning six eighteen pounder opened fire from wood in afternoon battery of eight mortar began throwing shell into town gun on wall answered brisk fire be kept up for next ten day during time several breach have be effected in wall near southeast angle defender have fixed strong wooden stockade in debris night so that attack must be made in order to prevent being done with last made breach be determined to assault at once two prisoner have not have lookout gallery to of rajah officer be constantly there movement of troop be at once reported by rajah have twice thrice come up for short time to watch operation have on occasion talked for minute with harry people will be mad if try to attack through small hole in wall said on afternoon of th be to level quarter of mile of wall might have chance though doubt whether must ever get footing at top with soldier ready to defend that small opening with thirty forty gun to fire at people a advance be a ridiculous a if ten men must attempt to take palace what do think can not say rajah from here be unable to see what be taking place at wall how wide be breach speak of how deep ditch beyond therefore can give opinion english be brave fighter rajah said have taken place in few hour seemed impregnable can not perform impossibility wall be defended by forty thousand men although in open field say that might not defeat seeing how troop be disciplined while with man fight for when be question of holding wall defending breach can trust soldier be twice a numerous have heavier gun more of than have a told english will never get into bhurtpoor at seven o'clock in evening deep almost continuous roar of gun broke out assault have begun harry exclaimed will not see much may get idea a to how thing be going from lookout be too dark for movement of troop to be seen quick flash of gun on side play of flickering fire along top of wall showed that storming party be approaching attack be made in three party one advanced against battery defender have established outside wall at spot where fire must take in flank force advancing against point towards fire of english gun have be directed be to attempt gateway near breach while central column consisting of five hundred european battalion of sepoys be to attack breach for time roar of firing be incessant alarm have be given a soon a british column advanced from wood notwithstanding right column advanced straight against battery captured spiked gun left column a approached gate came upon deep cut filled with water having mean of crossing moved to support of force attacking breach have be greatly delayed ground to be crossed be swampy with many pool in darkness number lost way force arrived at point of attack in great confusion small party of twenty three men only of nd regiment under lieutenant manser who formed forlorn hope crossed ditch breast high in water mounted breach in confusion reigned among troop of officer have lost way there be one to assume command to give order lieutenant manser finding that be unsupported must not with handful of men attempt to attack of bastion from terrible fire be being maintained made men sit down shelter a well a must in debris of breach while recrossed ditch to summon up support in failed order be lost men who formed forlorn hope be at last called back whole force retired suffering heavily from terrible fire to be exposed eighty five be killed three hundred seventy one wounded more deplorable ill managed assault be never made by british troop a harry have thought possible lord lake have treated capture of bhurtpoor a if have be little hill fort have made attempt to carry out regular siege operation trusting to valour of troop have sent across considerable distance of plain swept by enemy fire to assault breach defended by of bravest tribesman of india have not even issued command must have ensured order cohesion in attack lesson have be taught be not sufficiently taken to heart more battery be placed in position on th opened heavy fire against wall on left of former breach have be repaired during two night following successful defence so heavy be fire from new battery that breach be made in course of few hour jat stockaded during night timber be soon knocked to fragment for five day continuous cannonade be maintained large breach formed be necessary to find out how wide ditch be three native cavalry three british trooper dressed a native suddenly dashed out of camp at short distance behind number of sepoys ran out a if in pursuit discharging musket a did so just a six horseman arrived at ditch two of trooper charger be made to fall native havildar shouted to soldier on wall to save from accursed feringhees show nearest entrance to city soldier pointed to gate near breach a soon a men have again mounted havildar rode with along ditch made necessary observation then put spur to horse rode off jat on seeing that have be deceived opening upon with excitement fury however disturbed aim six horseman rode into camp unhurt reported that ditch be not very wide that did not seem to be very deep portable bridge be at once constructed be to be carried by picked men who be instructed in best method of pushing over ditch to prevent recurrence of confusion have be before caused by assault in dark be determined that must be made in daylight on following afternoon storming party moved forward consisted of four hundred twenty men from european regiment supported by rest of troop three battalion of native infantry colonel macrae be in command whole of battery opened fire to cover movement keep down of besieged on arriving at ditch be found that portable bridge must not be thrown across a during night garrison have dammed up moat below breach turned quantity of water into thus doubling width depth few gallant fellow jumped in swam across climbed breach there be few capable of performing feat encumbered by musket ammunition colonel macrae seeing impossibility of succeeding called back retired under tremendous fire from bastion wall assault be even more disastrous than last for loss in killed wounded amounted to nearly six hundred harry be deeply disappointed at revers rajah with great glee reported to with full detail there have be other fighting two british convoy on way from agra have be attacked by horseman of ameer khan holkar rajah first might have be successful for twelve hundred bullock be escorted by only fourteen hundred men although might have defended successfully be unable to keep convoy together animal excited by firing be rushing off in direction when fortunately body of cavalry have be sent out to meet convoy arrived drove off enemy with loss of six hundred men next morning general movement must be seen in british camp rajah who be immediately informed of came up to lookout english general have given up a hopeless said be about to march away look like rajah harry admitted must hardly fancy that lord lake will take such step have tried to take town by sudden assault think that will not retreat until have attempted to do so by regular siege operation hour later whole of tent have be pulled down presently troop huge body of follower cattle be in motion be not going to agra rajah said after watching for time must be going to march to north two hour later great procession have arrived at north of town there halted long line of tent began to rise be going to try point rajah exclaimed truly be brave men will be repulsed a be before fancy will begin in way rajah will make regular approach so that will not have to pas across open ground swept by gun indeed turned out to be case trench be at once opened ere long two battery be established at distance of four hundred yard from wall two day later still nearer opened fire by th of february trench have be pressed forward to edge of ditch mine sunk with intention of blowing up counterscarp so partially filling ditch troop intended for assault took place in trench at early hour so a to be ready to attack a soon a repair made by garrison in breach during night must be destroyed by battery jat however have be rendered so confident by previous success during night made sally crept into advanced trench from workman have be withdrawn started to demolish mine carry off tool a storming party moved down through trench jat who have made first sally joined by considerable number from town rushed forward attacked inflicted considerable loss before be repulsed portion of however still held advanced trench when th th who be at head of column be ordered to dislodge hesitated repulse of former attack have have effect troop believing that enemy must have filled mine with powder must explode a advanced refused to move remaining men of flank company of nd stepped forward a be too few to attack so considerable number of enemy th th sepoy regiment be called to front advanced gallantly enemy be driven from trench at point of bayonet ditch however have again be flooded be found to be impassable there be bastion to right have be damaged by breaching gun troop at once made for few men of th managed to climb up planted flag of regiment on a only one must mount at time jat be swarming down upon be recalled force again drew off having lost in killed wounded nearly nine hundred men notwithstanding terrible loss have be suffered general lake persevered in intention to carry place at point of bayonet on following day battery opened fire on bastion have be nearly carried by th native infantry position have become serious cavalry have fortnight three week before defeated of rajah ally with heavy loss brought in convoy ameer khan who have only joined rajah of bhurtpoor in hope of plunder have deserted ally ridden off with following large body of pindarees with intention of devastating plundering district of rohilcund three regiment of british cavalry under general smith a many of native horse with artillery followed on track after pursuit of three week at last came up with annihilated infantry captured gun cavalry however for most part escaped a horse of pursuer be completely worn out returned to british camp after more than month absence from chase extending over seven hundred mile absence have greatly increased difficulty in british camp without protection danger to convoy be exposed be great provision be running short in camp ammunition be almost exhausted number of gun be rendered unserviceable circumstance afforded only excuse can be made for fresh attack upon bhurtpoor be even more disastrous than have preceded th th regiment deeply ashamed of conduct on preceding occasion volunteered to man with other european regiment five regiment of sepoys under command of colonel monson moved out to attack at three in afternoon nothing must exceed courage displayed conduct rivalled that of storming party at siege of badajos be fighting against impossibility bastion must not be climbed of soldier drove bayonet into wall one above attempted to climb up by step be knocked down by log of wood large shot other missile others attempted to get in by shot hole have be made here there a only one man must enter at time be killed before footing must be obtained time terrible fire be maintained by enemy against men shower of grape musketry swept line pot filled with gunpowder other combustible exploded among bale of cotton dipped in oil fell flaming in midst for two hour hopeless conflict be maintained then order be given to retire men fell back having lost in killed wounded nine hundred eighty seven of comrade thus four assault have cost army three thousand two hundred three of best soldier force be still further weakened by large number of death from dysentery fever result of miasma rising from marsh camp be now shifted to drier ground to northeast of town movement being harassed by enemy horse rajah who have be jubilant over success looked grave when new encampment be fixed have not done with yet said to harry why do not go now see that can not take place because be to do so rajah half india must be in arm against in fortnight never before since set foot in india have such defeat be inflicted upon lord lake can not march away so own entirely beaten never before have english general out here so blundered still although unable to take bhurtpoor general lake know well enough that can easily repulse attack on camp know too that greatest effort will be made to send up reinforcement bombay madras calcutta will send available man ere long loss will be much more than counterbalanced by force will join have during history suffered several disaster never one have not be redeemed revenged holkar be here morning rajah said after long silence came to congratulate on victory after have done so asked that trooper must be handed over to need scarcely say that refused be captured by men though be in alliance with holkar owe fealty be who have aided while have given little assistance to must be sure ride away leave to fate if knew where to go to country capital fort be in hand of english stay near here because be at present safest place for on rd of march british cavalry returned for month attempt have be made to renew siege camp still remained a threat against bhurtpoor time have not be lost convoy escorted by strong party of infantry have come out from agra supply of kind battering gun ammunition arrived almost daily armourer worked at old gun made again fit for service everything showed that when attack be renewed must be much more formidable than before cavalry be given few day rest after arrival before daybreak on th moved out in hope of surprising holkar have however scout well posted far out effected retreat with loss only of of baggage animal retired mile to southwest again pitched camp on nd of april cavalry with horse artillery again moved out at midnight time came upon enemy undiscovered before have time to mount horse cavalry charged in front on flank while artillery swept camp with grape great number be slain in holkar camp in pursuit be continued for eight mile whole of camp equipage greater portion of gun bazaar be captured during next day two large body of holkar troop considering case hopeless deserted when in flight crossed jumna have eight thousand horse five thousand infantry thirty gun remains of great army with have crossed river confident of victory year before on following day lord lake who have received considerable reinforcement again moved camp to southeast of city prepared to resume active operation against rajah have for time be in despondent state next morning came alone to harry room want to have talk with said abdool seeing that conversation be to be private one at once left room friend said have for time felt that cause be becoming hopeless have never supposed that after failing four time with heavy loss people must continue siege see now be wrong might repulse attack of what use must be people must only become stronger after defeat see now have acted a one bereft of sense have quarrel with company added to territory have promised to defend against attack when heard that holkar be approaching with so vast army thought that surely must recapture delhi drive out of agra perhaps down to calcutta that after taking agra must turn against so foolish man be joined now must fain make peace pray to go to general ask what term will grant may be hard be in position to stand out ameer khan have be chased routed holkar be little better than fugitive owns only horse saddle there be one to whom can look for aid put in english general hand will willingly go rajah doubt have be supposed for week escort have perished when general hears of kind treatment that have received treatment so different from that must have met with have fallen into hand of holkar will feel certain have effect on term that will lay down harry have day paid visit to trooper who be confined in large airy room opening into courtyard have be well fed have be permitted to go out into open air for several hour day to mingle freely with jat soldier hour after interview with rajah harry went down there to surprise found abdool trooper mounted a well a party of rajah own guard before leaving rajah have returned sword to a rode through street followed by own trooper with rajah guard riding ahead people looked on with curiosity evinced animosity against successful a have be defence fact that british have received great convoy reinforcement have caused feeling of apprehension a to final result food too be becoming very scarce for although small quantity be brought in by side opposite to occupied by camp be altogether insufficient for need of large population swollen by fighting men of whole country even supply have ceased since return of british cavalry rout of holkar fighting men be losing heart loss have be small in comparison with of besieger defeat of holkar impressed with fear that british must in end triumph have already done more than who have tried to stem tide of british power have repulsed four time defence must be subject of admiration for native people of india therefore when be known that captured english officer be leaving town with trooper idea that end be near caused general satisfaction harry left town by gate nearest to british encampment rajah guard still accompanied halted halfway between wall camp there dismounted officer in command telling harry that order be to wait until return number of soldier have gathered at edge of camp on seeing party riding towards when guard fell back harry with troop approached be seen that be british officer with escort of native cavalry loud cheer broke out most of soldier knew harry by sight have heard of being missing with escort a time have passed without news of arriving be supposed that have be killed by horseman of ameer khan holkar many of men of th native cavalry be in crowd shouted welcome to comrade while several english officer ran up shook harry by hand have be prisoner in bhurtpoor said in answer to question have be extremely well treated can not tell more now be here on mission to general curious to ascertain cause of cheering general lake appeared at entrance of tent just a harry rode up why major lindsay exclaimed where did spring from have given up a dead long ago have be in bhurtpoor sir be now here in character of rajah ambassador be good news come in tell first about harry briefly related how have lost way in morass have be attacked in morning that finding impossible to make way out have surrendered spoke in warmest term of rajah treatment of follower be treated a guest rather than prisoner sir lived in handsome room got excellent food have run of palace scarce day passed on did not have talk with rajah be exceptional case indeed general said have fallen into holkar hand into of ameer khan very different treatment must have awaited now what have rajah to say for plea be sir that believed be army must assuredly sweep away that in case must have be attacked by for having formed alliance with position be certainly awkward one general said now what doe propose doe not propose anything sir place in hand admits fault be a may well be heartily sorry for belief that might still defend town for time ally having be thrashed see that in end must be overpowered asks that will formulate demand news be very welcome major lindsay for indeed be a anxious to be off a rajah can be to see go scindia be giving trouble again have written letter couched in such arrogant term that be virtually declaration of war must not leave here until town be captured for must have seemed to india that have be defeated must have be terrible blow to prestige therefore at cost must have taken place will however be fortnight before will be ready to recommence siege wish to be hard on rajah know that authority at calcutta view case in light that have put be willing to believe that turning against be not act of deliberate treachery fear of holkar treatment of escort be in much in favour of course in a in similar case must deprive of dominion send prisoner to fortress governor general be most anxious that business must be concluded have already cost more men than lost in overthrow of tippoo power have given authority to negotiate peace if rajah offer to surrender have named term approximately rajah treatment of will certainly induce to minimize demand a far a possible especially a be most important that force will be available elsewhere of course grant of territory made to will be rescinded in second place must until term of treaty be fulfilled retain fortress of deeg will garrison strongly rajah must pay twenty lakh of rupee towards expense will not demand at once three lakh must immediately be paid one of son must be given up to a hostage for fulfilment of treaty rajah must also bind not to enter into communication with prince chief at war with think that will allow that be not hard condition certainly not sir have doubt that rajah will agree to without hesitation will have draft of treaty drawn up in hour general lake said of course will carry back to rajah certainly sir fifty men of bodyguard be waiting for halfway between camp town harry left tent found officer of staff many others waiting to welcome back will want to hear what have to tell major head of staff said have best go into mess tent hold durbar tent be soon filled with officer with exception of chief of staff who have be sent for by general in first place lindsay one of officer said take that have come on mission from rajah doe mean to surrender be willing to surrender if term be not too onerous announcement be received with loud cheer there be not one present believed that next assault must be successful cost of previous attack have be so great that be believed city must not be taken unless with great slaughter unhealthiness of country have told upon spirit even more than repulse news that must soon be able to march away created deepest satisfaction now for own adventure lindsay adventure began ended in swamp be four o'clock before convoy left agra then rode on fast till be night when be still five six mile from camp be pitch dark lost way presently found in deep swamp must discover way of getting out of then told of attack how have be obliged to surrender have be guided out of morass when reached rajah palace trouble be ended handsome chamber be placed at disposal havildar of escort be allowed to be with be treated rather a honoured guest than a prisoner lived on fat of land be permitted to wander about palace spent most of time in gallery round highest tower where must see be going on rajah be most kind to enquired daily if want be supplied to satisfaction must often come up to gallery chat with sometimes for hour trooper also be well treated have received great deal of misplaced commiseration one of officer said have thought of a having be tortured to death either by holkar ameer khan now find have be better housed better fed than have be going back again suppose with chief answer yes must not tell condition think can say be certain that rajah will not hesitate moment in accepting well deserves to be let off leniently if only for treatment of men be contrast indeed to what have generally happened to officer who have fallen into hand of of native prince there be general talk until aide de camp came in asked harry to accompany to general tent there be draft of treaty latter said hope that there will be delay in returning prompt answer want yes indian prince be adept in art of prolonging negotiation if see that have disposition to do so say at once have told that term offer be final must be accepted rejected very well sir hope to return with answer tomorrow early followed by escort harry rode for city rajah guard mounted a soon a saw coming escorted to palace street leading to be now thronged with people be evident to harry that among great majority there be feeling of hope that be bearer of acceptable term for among poorer class pressure of want be already severe chapter home harry on arriving at palace at once went to rajah room well sahib what term doe general offer term think sir will have hesitation in accepting here be draft of treaty that proposes rajah glanced at document be written in english in mahratti for none of general staff understood jat language harry saw at once that term be far le onerous than rajah have expected for face brightened air of despondency that have for day expressed passed away be better than have looked for said a rule english have not be merciful to have subdued that territory gave must be taken away be matter of course sum to be paid be heavy a have given time can manage to collect without much difficulty be be demanded that must hold deeg son a hostage until money be paid be fair just thought that condition must meet with acceptance rajah may say that kindly treatment of myself escort have gone way in mitigating term must otherwise have be demanded general said that must understand that can make further diminution of demand tomorrow expects answer yes reply yes at once major lindsay load have be lifted from mind will still have liberty capital people be grateful indeed for clemency have be shown have relied somewhat upon good office have small hope that after what have taken place must be offered such term rajah at once sent for son of whom harry have seen little for be always on wall encouraging troop seeing that breach be repaired a soon a made rajah read to draft of treaty too be visibly relieved for have talked matter over with father on evening before have agreed that probably family must be kept a prisoner in fortress that fortification of town must be destroyed nominee of british government created general have not said of son be to be hostage rajah left that to may say that took same view of position a explained to namely that joined holkar simply from apprehension that if english be defeated by must next turn arm against of will go rajah asked son expressed willingness then will choose third son said to harry others will be more useful here harry rode out early in morning with news that rajah accepted term offered to in hour treaty be written out formally general affixing signature harry returned to city time accompanied by general officer signed name a witness to rajah signature bullock cart with chest containing three lakh of rupee be already in courtyard with rajah third son harry returned to camp army afterwards started to meet scindia who have advanced with army with intention of joining holkar assisting rajah of bhurtpoor have for time be almost openly hostile have sent relation bapeejee scindia with strong body of horse to act in concert with cavalry of ameer khan holkar have sent letter to government amounted to declaration of war when holkar reached camp fugitive heard that bhurtpoor have surrendered at once fell back endeavoured to make excuse for conduct alleging that bapeejee scindia have acted entirely without order that have advanced only with intention of mediating between rajah of bhurtpoor english one be deceived by assurance be thought politic to pretend to believe marquis of wellesley term of office have expired successor have come out with order to carry out policy differing widely from have followed latter have enormously extended area of british possession in india british troop have won marvellous series of victory have be effected at immense cost so far revenue drawn from conquered province barely sufficed to pay expense of occupation management treaty too have be entered into with various rajah chief might at moment plunge government into war in support of ally accordingly lord cornwallis be again sent out to carry out policy of maintaining friendly relation with native power of abstaining from interference in quarrel with other indeed breathing time be urgently needed rapid progress of british arm have aroused feeling of distrust hostility among native prince be necessary to carry out strong peaceful administration in conquered province to give confidence to population to appoint civil officer of sort so to divide troop while ceased to threaten of native power must maintain order in new dependency not yet reconciled to change of master capable of appreciating benefit arising from orderly rule accordingly scindia excuse be accepted considerable portion of dominion have be wrested from be restored even holkar whose atrocious cruelty to british soldier officer who fell into hand must have placed beyond pale of pardon be again invested with most of former possession with object doubt of counterbalancing scindia power a have holkar be driven to take refuge in north a fugitive scindia must have become paramount among mahratta one of last act of marquis of wellesley be to offer harry high civil appointment in one of new province declined upon ground that be about to apply for leave to go to england have indeed already formed idea of quitting service altogether present have received from bajee rao on first arrival at poona on being invested a peishwa still larger one nana furnuwees have given have be for most part invested in purchase of land at bombay in eight year have elapsed town have greatly increased in size land have be gradually sold at four five time sum that have cost proceeds sent to england harry be therefore rich man have be constantly engaged in service for nearly nine year a have never be settled long enough to have establishment of own military pay have much more than sufficed for want large increase have obtained when engaged in civil special duty have be entirely laid by there be then further occasion for to remain in service at rate determined to obtain three year leave before end of time must finally make up mind on subject month therefore after siege of bhurtpoor be concluded harry have interview with lord lake requested three year leave to go to england have well earned major lindsay service have be very great if war be likely to continue must have asked to reconsider request a from what hear complete change of policy have be determined upon have be decided that there will be further extension of territory there be likely at rate for time to be period of peace board of director desire to consolidate territory that have gained wish to abstain from embarrassing alliance from meddling in affair of native prince who have be so long at poona understand shifty nature of scindia holkar indeed of native prince must know well that order be much more easily given than carried out if restraining hand be removed will have scindia holkar peishwa rajah of berar kolapoore bhurtpoor at other throat again will treat declaration that desire peace only a proof of weakness may at moment lay aside private quarrel to unite against unlikely a may seem at present conviction be that there will never be permanent peace in india until be master from cape comorin to border of afghanistan may be half century will certainly only be after hard fighting believe that until india acknowledges rule there will not be anything like permanent peace within border be afraid that be so sir only really sincere honest man have met bent upon serving country be nana furnuwees in consequence be equally hated by peishwa scindia holkar be certainly extremely well treated by rajah of bhurtpoor be doubt largely due to

camp took to house of brother there be brought up afterwards went down to bombay where satisfied governor a to identity received commission have not heard further particular yet major lindsay suppose will come to call harry in time nephew will tell about be sure that will join with in welcoming harry boy heartily in satisfaction that have proved well worthy of race harry be little surprised at detecting tone of warning in manner in last word be spoken at agitation with mr lindsay have listened to husband disappeared however a held out hand to welcome back to england nephew yours be indeed strange story know that husband be greatly attached to father yes loved dearly mr lindsay said can see resemblance to in son be taller more strongly built than harry be say that feature be very like

friendship for sake a well a for brother gave name be glad to meet cousin girl said holding out hand frankly to be of course great surprise to can hardly realize yet that be really cousin now harry uncle said briskly will give order to have thing taken out of post chaise carried up to room will be having lunch directly after that will tell story at full length ten minute later sat down to lunch when harry rejoined others fancied saw trace of tear in eye of mr lindsay daughter thought that perhaps have be thinking that if own boy have lived also must be young men now after meal be over squire said now wife will adjourn to library be most comfortable room in house cosiest just place for listening to long story have told william to get two more armchair there so that can sit round fire be quite proper thing to do when story have to be told light have faded out of sky curtain be drawn squire must not have candle lighted saying that blaze of fire be proper thing to listen by harry related fully manner in have be brought up trained by nurse for time when must present at bombay also adventure in deccan have paved way for obtaining commission told rest more briefly though be obliged in answer to question of others to go somewhat further into personal adventure be wonderful story squire said when at last finished there be many thing that have cut very short must other time tell fully poor father must have reason to be proud of indeed have lived to see now thought that be wonderfully fortunate in obtaining majority at age of thirty five have got ten year younger well have not spared for have kept talking over four hour dinner passed off quickly when wine have be placed on table servant retired mr lindsay said will understand harry that although absolutely certain that be nephew resign offer seat at head of table until document that have brought be formally examined what do mean uncle harry asked in surprise mean of course that a father son estate be yours not mine harry rose to foot understand uncle never dreamt for moment stopped that father be eldest brother yes be year older than at father death must of course have succeeded to estate died before a son will of course succeed must not dream of such thing uncle do think have come down here with idea of turning aunt cousin out taking place if have known must not have come down at must be monstrous if after have be master here for twenty five year must come down to claim estate from be glad to hear say so harry uncle said gravely naturally did not occur to that be ignorant that father be eldest son thought from manner that must be willing to arrange everything on amicable term for of course legally be entitled to back rent honestly say must not pay aunt little fortune portion a younger brother will be amply sufficient to keep three comfortably a to paying arrears must be impossible dear uncle whole thing be impossible have returned home with ample amount of money to live in luxury did not think necessary to mention in story that nana furnuwees presented with considerable sum of money bajee rao did same invested in land close to bombay be now covered with house fetched five time price gave for in addition to have be in civil employment for past six year a have always be on move have never have expense of establishment have thus saved five thousand pound therefore be master of something over ninety thousand pound can if return to india have may say already made up mind not to do buy estate have have very much more than share of adventure have marvellously escaped if return luck might change at rate have have enough of have made very handsome fortune even putting everything else aside must rather know owed possessed to own good luck exertion than to accident of birth can not be lad well uncle harry said obstinately if choose to see thing in light can say be that will at once throw up leave return to india if choose to leave house estate may go to wreck ruin for anything care well well boy wo say anything more about now will leave to lawyer to settle will certainly employ lawyer in matter uncle by mean obtain solicitor opinion a to whether proof have put in hand be sufficient to establish beyond fear of doubt fact that be son of major harry lindsay matter not whether father be elder brother not to anyone except be perfectly satisfied with having proved to satisfaction of in india be son of brave officer object in coming to england be not to see whether be entitled to money simply to find friend among family of father mother if be to end in turning aunt cousin out of place have believed to be own for so many year visit here must be dismal failure must bitterly regret having set foot in england please let say anything more about matter so far a be concerned be concluded nothing can possibly be said will shake determination in way in order to break silence for mr lindsay mary be wiping eye harry went on now that have finished question uncle will tell how got ratification of treaty will day be made for occupation of singapore from rajah of johore a far a excitement went certainly be most stirring business be ever employed in at once launched into narrative of capture escape adventure with tiger defence of johore seems to harry uncle said when have finished that not only have a many life a cat a whole posse of cat can not think that be wild business altogether that having got assent of gentleman with very hard name there be occasion to bother about rajah who seemed to have authority whatever might have got see uncle may be ten year more before governor general will be able to attend to business be a well to get settled once for what did rajah present with for saving capital offered number of weapon thing a have place to put in must not be bothered with think that cash be at strong point with suppose have thousand dollar in treasury be little surprised that did not offer dozen young lady a wife have done so must have resisted temptation a must have be even more trouble than weapon never fell in love with of indian beauty cousin harry have never seen to fall in love with lady of upper class in india whether hindu mussulmans always go closely veiled a to english lady in first place be nearly married in second place went a little into society a must help being on governor general staff nearly always away on duty certainly never saw anyone who caused pulse to beat faster believe from what have read be one of many symptom of being in love harry then enquired about mother relation unfortunately can tell nothing about be only daughter when married father parent died year ago only have lease of place lived in really can not tell anything about there be son who must suppose succeed to property father left be ne'er do well be seldom at home have never seen heard of since well be quite content with relation have found will not trouble to seek further four day passed at end of time mr lindsay received letter from lawyer after breakfast asked harry to go into library with about business that be talking about have today received answer to letter lawyer be of opinion from what told of paper case be strong one that though if chose might give great deal of trouble think that in long run must succeed a want to give trouble a be a completely convinced that be brother harry son a be brother matter may now be considered a finally settled quite so uncle want to hear anything more about if choose to be obstinate turn out can only say that will be sorry that old house where father be born must go to wreck ruin at rate let matter rest for present possibly may yet be arranged to satisfaction of party will certainly not be arranged to satisfaction squire grumbled unless become master here will talk over in six month time related conversation to wife who to surprise looked pleased nothing must be better said must be excellent plan what on earth do mean louisa be a blind a owl peter there can be only one meaning in what have said only one arrangement must be satisfactory to party what be dear squire said little testily mean of course that must marry mary squire sat down suddenly in surprise idea never entered head said why must think of why young fellow have only be here four five day be quite long enough for to see mary be charming girl mr lindsay said have seen very little of lady be doubt struck with idea that be extremely nice girl say that be in love with yet quite enough perhaps to foresee that ere long will feel more ardent than doe at present that be only arrangement possible since be determined to turn out for now mind peter throw out slightest hint to to that solution have ever occurred to might spoil everything must make mary shy with might cause to be awkward give consent to remain here for six month by time question will have solved if be wrong harm will have be done if be right arrangement will be a say satisfactory one to be always against cousin marrying mr lindsay said doubtfully be absurd peter say that in case there be not good deal to be said against where man woman be healthy come of healthy family union can be more likely to be happy think have heard speak never mind what have heard speak sir circumstance alter case case be altogether exceptional one certainly must not wish for finer young fellow a mary husband be desirable partner in respect be well off although quite agree with that whatever cost must give dear old place up grant that must be very pleasant to avoid so terrible wrench one thing like be that man of move about so noiselessly that be like having ghost in room be who be absurd now louisa squire said man have over over again proved to be most faithful friend to own that be little trying to see standing behind harry chair without moving except when master want something after be le fidgety than having footman dodging about well louisa will take particular heed of what have said will be mum a mouse until see how cat jump mr lindsay prevision turned out correct harry remained week longer at parley house then heard that estate be for sale two mile away drove over quietly to inspect ten day later wrote from london said that have bought place be most obstinate fellow ever knew mr lindsay exclaimed a read letter what be dear have bought hungerford place never gave slightest hint of intention well think will be very nice to have so near mr lindsay said decidedly oh of course will be so handy for peter will take cup of tea wife said sharply mr lindsay knew that have nearly put foot in week later harry came down again to see a said what required to be done to house needed persuasion to stay at parley hall to decide upon matter needed great deal of advice from mr lindsay mary then having put house into hand of builder decorator went up to town again however frequently ran down to see how thing be getting on before alteration be finished mary have consented to become mistress abdool preferred to remain a master body servant a before have even before leaving india picked up certain amount of english have improved considerably knowledge of language during long voyage mary fortunately have not shared in mother feeling about on learning that have several time saved harry life have taken to greatly never returned to native land although harry wife talked sometimes of making voyage to india be never enabled to accomplish for a child grew up around mary be longer free to travel abdool devotion be now divided between master mistress little one who be never tired of listening to story of

a much time a cared to give only complaint made against by neighbour be that did not care for field sport a said have seen enough bloodshed to last lifetime must neither shed blood of bird beast
