two year therefore order of thing to fit now to be made larger in more manly fashion give instruction that when be finished be to be put in tin case soldered down so a to be kept distinct from others in second place will bear in mind that clothes must be perfectly right suitable for here will not be at suitable for there will be living with officer associating entirely with military men there must therefore be certain cut fashion about thing of course want to look like young fop understand what want there will be boy out there be therefore better that must look little older than be besides think that boy men too to extent live up to clothes think have anything else to say mr medlin except that a will not be able to replace clothes may destroy out there a be sure to be climbing about destroying in one way be necessary that ample supply must be laid in mr medlin have scrupulously carried out instruction bob be almost alarmed at extent of wardrobe ordered know what be doing mr

be acquainted with captain who have several time brought over cargo for from cadiz oporto have agreed to take must rather have gone in ship sailing with convoy a there be very strong one went at time

sail next monday will go down on saturday by coach to southampton where now be will request mr medlin to see on board tell that outfit be completed trunk with exception of what will be required upon voyage will be sent off by carrier waggon on wednesday on thursday afternoon will leave mr medlin stay here till start week passed quickly bob enjoyed day at putney where after saying goodbye to old schoolfellow called upon admiral langton who be very glad to hear of change in prospect will do good said to go out into world see little of life be dull thing for lad of age spirit to be cooped up in counting house in city now that be going to gibraltar afterwards to cadiz oporto will not return to settle down to business until be one twenty so think that prospect before be very pleasant one be glad that uncle have proved altogether different to anticipation of well be sure to see son at gibraltar sometimes will write to tell that be there a friend sankey be on board brilliant will be pleasant for of only lead into scrape bob midshipman be up to mischief enough on own account everyone always seems to think be getting into scrape admiral think get into more than other fellow rather think do bob mr tulloch certainly intimated to that have remarkable talent way if in other besides face tell own story pickle be marked upon a plainly a if be printed now must have supper with at seven o'clock catch eight o'clock stage can stay until then hope yes sir told mr medlin might not come back until last stage at parting admiral placed case in bob hand there lad be brace of pistol wo have use for for year to come hope if stay out in spain portugal may prove useful fellow be very handy with knife be always well to be armed if go about at night among must advise to practise shooting whenever get opportunity pistol be excellent weapon if really know how to use be of use at if thing be may get involved in affair of honour consider duelling to be foolish practice be use one person standing up against crowd be fashion in day to fight duel therefore be almost necessity for gentleman to be able to shoot straight besides although might be able to avoid fighting duel with of countryman there be possibility of getting out of if become involved in quarrel with foreigner in case englishman who showed white feather must be disgrace to country advantage of being good shot mean really good shot be that if get forced into affair be desirous of giving lesson more to opponent have in power to wing whereas if be only tolerably good shot ca pick spot may to lasting regret kill be in future bob have fought several duel with very pistol be happy to say have never killed man will be glad to believe bob that will always be used in same spirit bob last two evening before sailing be more pleasant than have expected mr bale seemed to forget that be still in philpot lane chatted with freely confidentially hope that be doing best for bob know be experiment can only trust that will turn out well believe have plenty of sound sense somewhere in head that association with number of young military men will not have bad effect upon that after four five year abroad will not be le rather more inclined to settle down to business regard a son have indeed relation whom care for in way except sister trust that when come back will apply to business without becoming a have done slave to might if chose make altogether independent of be sure must not be for good there be nothing more unfortunate for young man belonging to middle class than to have fixed occupation heir to large estate be in different position have sort of responsibility have pursuit of country gentleman duty of large landowner young man of class who doe not take to business be almost certain to go in for reckless dissipation gambling have seen number of young men son of old friend of own who have be absolutely ruined by being left fortune father have made simply because have nothing with to occupy mind be for reason bob chiefly wish to succeed in business be very good one doubt whether other merchant import such large quantity of wine a do during next few year will endeavour to give up a far a can what may call private business deal entirely with trade have be doing so for time be very difficult to give up customer who have dealt with father before however will curtail business in direction a much a can will then find much more easily managed small order require just a much trouble in execution a large one wholesale business be in respect more satisfactory than one in private customer be supplied a well a trade be entering into arrangement now with several traveller for purpose of extending dealing with trade in province so that when come into hand will find more compact at same time more extensive than be now be glad have have here for past four month have have eye upon more closely than suppose be pleased to see that have worked well willingly far more so than expected from have much encouraged in hope that will in time settle down to business here not be contented to lead purposeless idle life happiest man in opinion be who have something to do yet not too much who can by being free from anxiety regarding view business a occupation pleasure who be master not slave be thinking of giving mr medlin small interest in business mean to make real effort to break little loose from have seen enough of to know that will make very valuable junior be little eccentric perhaps sort of exaggeration of myself will signify to that when come into firm consider that will be to advantage that must import little of what may call 'extra official manner into in business a be well aware although posse certain cheerfulness of disposition generally pleasing manner be of advantage buyer be apt to give larger order than otherwise must do under influence of pleasant genial relation mr medlin can if chooses make up for deficiency in way be taking step rather in interest than in own will relieve of considerable portion of burden of business will enable to relax somewhat when be disposed if have partner in whom can place thorough confidence wish to mention matter to must rather open to will go on fishing expedition together think can approach then on more pleasant footing than must here have modelled so thoroughly upon that matter must only be approached in so intensely businesslike way here that feel sure must not arrive at anything like satisfactory arrangement a might do elsewhere in course of week captain lockett of antelope have called at office bob have be introduced to by mr bale be hearty energetic looking man of five thirty year of age will want to go to cadiz for next trip captain lockett mr bale said be having unusually large cargo prepared for enough fancy to fill up brig better sir sailor said there be nothing like having only one shipper save time trouble must advise to insure for full value for channel swarm with french privateer at present fellow be building bigger mounting heavier gun than used to do be mounting long eighteen a swivel gun voyage in addition to carried before even with there be of french craft might prove very awkward customer if fell in with see craft be crowded with men generally carry at least twice a many hand a ours be just same with fishing boat take about three frenchman to do work of englishman well get caught time captain lockett want nephew to learn to speak french instead of spanish for there be very little trade to be done in quarter at present what there be be carried on by what may call 'irregular channel fancy there be great deal of french wine come into country still sir in spite of two nation being at war suit government to wink at trade want french wine want english money be so captain lockett at rate ca send english buyer out there must take what choose to send on saturday morning bob said goodbye to uncle with amount of feeling regret must have considered impossible four month previously mr medlin accompanied to southampton journey be very lively one goodbye bob clerk said a shook hand on deck of antelope will be man when see again be if come home for bit before going to people at cadiz oporto will be coming into firm then will be mr robert always not if go out fishing expedition together bob said laughed ah well perhaps will be exception well goodbye pleasant voyage to get into more scrape than can help oh be growing out of mr medlin not bob may be different sort of scrape in future scrape there will be be dutchman well youngster be good sailor captain asked a antelope with sail set ran down southampton water hope be captain know yet have gone out sailing in boat at plymouth several time in rough weather have never felt bit ill know how will be in ship like if can sail in rough water in boat without feeling ill ought to be right here lad be easy craft a well a fast one make good weather of in anything short of gale there be eight bell striking mean eight o'clock breakfast have better lay in a good store a can will be outside needle if wind hold by dinnertime may not feel so ready for then second mate breakfasted in cabin with captain bob first mate remaining on deck second mate be young man of three four twenty cousin of captain be frank pleasant faced young sailor bob felt that must like how many day do expect to be in getting to gibraltar captain about ten if have luck twenty if have there be never saying how many men do carry twenty eight seaman cook steward two mate there be three boy thirty six told see have eight gun besides pivot gun yes have plenty of hand for working if only have to fight one side at once must be very strong handed if have to work broadside there be four sixteen pounder four twelve pivot so give three men to gun besides officer idler three men be enough for twelve make rather slow work with sixteen however may hope that sha' have to work broadside at once carry letter of marque so in case of having luck to fall in with french trader can bring in be not business be peaceful trader want to show teeth unless be interfered with to bob great satisfaction found that be able to eat dinner with unimpaired appetite although antelope be clear of island be bowing deeply to lively sea first mate powerful looking man of forty who have lost one eye whose face be deeply seamed by explosion of powder in engagement with french privateer came down to meal while second mate took duty on deck bob found difficulty in keeping dish before for antelope be lying well over with northerly wind abeam be travelling well probert captain said have got in capital trim time last time be too light must not stand up to sail if wind hold will make fast run of will keep well inshore until get down to scillys then stretch across bay nearer keep to coast le fear there be of running against one of french privateer wind held steady bob enjoyed voyage immensely a brig sailed along coast after passing portland bill lost sight of land until after eight hour run bold headland appeared on weather beam be start captain said when get abeam of will take bearing then shape course across bay if wind doe hold will make quick work of presently tiller be put up a brig head paid off yard be braced square ran rapidly along towards southwest with wind nearly dead aft next morning when bob went on deck found that wind have dropped brig be scarcely moving through water be change mr probert said to first mate who be in charge of deck yes not pleasant one officer replied like look of sky have just sent down to captain to ask to step on deck bob looked round sky be no longer bright clear there be dull heavy look overhead smoky haze seemed to hang over horizon round bob thought looked dull wondered why mate must send for captain latter came up on deck in minute two much like look of sky sir mate said wind have died suddenly out last half hour swell have got more kick in than have fancy wind be going round to southwest that when doe come will come hard think be right mr probert glanced at glass a came up have fallen inch since be up on deck in middle watch think have better begin to take in sail at once call watch up from below be not coming yet may a well strip at once mate gave order to boatswain whose shrill whistle sounded out followed by shout of hand to take in sail watch below tumbled up take royal topgallant sail off mr probert double reef topsail get in course bob watched men a worked aloft marvelled at seeming carelessness with hung on where slip of foot hand must mean sudden death wondered whether must ever attain such steadiness of head three quarter of hour hard work mast be stripped save for reduced topsail get in two of jib brail up spanker be short work when be done second mate who have be working forward looked to captain for further order latter have again gone below be now standing on poop talking earnestly with first mate yes think be right bob heard captain say glass be still falling very likely will be time before want light spar again there be nothing like being snug aloft again lad mate sung out send down yard topgallant mast now be ready for anything captain said when men again descended to deck bob who have be so intently watching men that have not looked round at sky since first went aloft now have time to do so be startled with change have come over sea sky there be not breath of wind there be dull oily look on water a heaved in long regular wave unbroken by slightest ripple black cloud have banked up from southwest extended in heavy arch across sky little ahead of brig from edge ragged fragment seemed to break off suddenly fly out ahead be going to blow mistake captain said be lucky that have have plenty of time to get into fighting trim have better get hold of something lad clutch tight will begin with heavy squall like enough lay pretty well over on beam end when strike higher higher threatening arch rose edge stood over mainmast then captain cried here come lad hold on one looking ahead bob saw white line approached with wonderful rapidity with confused rushing sound then in moment felt clinging a if for life to stanchion of have taken hold wind almost wrenched from foot while at same moment perfect deluge of water came down upon felt brig going further further over till deck beneath foot seemed almost perpendicular captain first mate have grasped spoke of wheel be aiding helmsman in jamming down bob have longer hold for foot be hanging by arm looking down sea seemed almost beneath with desperate effort got hold of rail with one hand then hauled up under clinging tight to main shroud then saw second mate loose jib halliard while one of sailor threw off fore staysail sheet spanker slowly brought brig head up into wind a did so righted gradually bob regained place on deck be still however lying over at very considerable angle captain raised hand pointed to main topsail second mate at once made way aft with of men laying out on weather rigging made way aloft danger seemed to bob so frightful that dared not look up must hear through pause of blast mate shout to men above in few minute again descended to deck even bob must feel how much brig be relieved when pressure of topsail be taken off lower plank of deck rose from water although still rushed in out through scupper hole rose at time to level of bulwark rail felt that worst be over one of men be called to assist at helm captain mate came forward to poop rail be touch go youngster former shouted to bob be bob said more go than touch must say for thought have gone altogether have better go below change thing tell steward to bring oilskin out of cabin have better keep below until rain have stopped bob thought advice be good so went down got into dry clothes then lay down on cabin sofa to leeward must not have kept place on other side rain be still falling so heavily on deck that sounded like waggon passing overhead mingled with noise be howl of wind swashing of water against ship side gradually motion of vessel became more violent quivered from bow to stern a wave struck although be early in afternoon became almost a dark a night in cabin steward have brought glass of hot grog a soon a have changed clothes in spite of din presently fell off to sleep when woke rain have ceased uproar caused by howling of wind creaking of spar dashing of wave be a loud a before soon made way up on deck found that tremendous sea be running fore topsail have be got off ship weather sheet of jib fore staysail hauled across vessel be making comparatively little way through water be in fact although bob did not know lying to under sail spanker looked so terrible to that kept place few minute be then glad to return to sofa below in short time captain came down how be getting on lad in dark eh steward light lamp bring tumbler of hot grog keep water boiling other officer will be down directly well what do think of young gentleman like at bob said thought must like to see storm never want to see one again be not surprised at that captain said with laugh be very well to read about storm be very different thing to be caught in one be there danger sir there be always more le danger in storm lad hope think worst be over be in for heavy gale now that brig have got through first burst there be not much fear of weathering be capital sea boat well found in good trim be fortunate enough in having sufficient warning to get snug before first burst came be always most dangerous point when ship have way on can stand almost gale when be caught by heavy squall when be lying becalmed have to look out however got through without losing anything be lying to now under smallest possible canvas if go well there be reason whatever for anxiety what do mean by 'if go well ' captain mean a long a one of mast be carried away anything of sort daresay think rough now be nothing to what will be by tomorrow morning must advise to turn in at once must see nothing if went up must run risk of being washed overboard of getting limb broken bob recollection of position a ship heeled over when storm struck be still far too vivid for to have desire for repetition of accordingly took captain advice turned in at once when got up in morning with difficulty made way on deck found that a captain predicted sea be far heavier than night before great ridge of water bore down upon ship seeming a if must overwhelm for first few minute bob expected to see brig go head foremost sink under foot be not till reflected that have lived through for hour that began to view scene with composure although wave be much higher than when have left deck on previous afternoon scene be really le terrifying sky be covered with mass of gray cloud ragged torn hurrying along with great velocity apparently short distance above masthead when vessel rose on wave seemed to that cloud in place almost touched water mingled with mass of spray caught up by wave scud borne along by wind struck face with force caused to smart for time be unable to face gale even for minute deck be streaming with water boat have disappeared from davit clean sweep seemed to have be made of everything movable forward be big gap in bulwark a brig met great wave mass of green water poured in through swept along deck waist deep brig be under same sail a before except that now showed closely reefed fore topsail when became little accustomed to sea to motion watched time then made rush across from companion to weather bulwark got firm hold of one of shroud captain second mate be on poop near wheel former made way to good morning master repton managed to get sleep yes have slept night captain say be tremendous did not think anything must be like be splendid know take one breath away think be blowing quite so hard be bit a hard be more regular be accustomed to see have got up more sail yes be to steady see when get into trough between great wave lower sail be almost becalmed be obliged to show something above to keep little way on be still lying to see meet wave head on if head be to fall off few point one of wave took on beam must go down like stone yes brig be doing very handsomely have fine run more like schooner than brig meet wave easily rise to a lightly a feather be beauty if be going to stay here lad have better lash for be not safe standing a be chapter french privateer a became more accustomed to scene around found that wave be more terrible in appearance than reality bob began to enjoy to take in grandeur wildness bareness of deck have struck at once now saw that four of cannon be gone two forward gun on side rightly supposed that must have be run out tumbled overboard to lighten ship forward enable to rise more easily to wave hour later second mate came along have better come down get breakfast said be going down first bob threw off rope followed mate down into cabin mr probert have just turned out have be lying down for two three hour having gone down a daylight broke captain say have better take something before go on deck mr probert second mate said will come down afterwards turn in for hour two change suppose go over like duck sea be more regular now be making good weather of bob wondered in own mind what must do if be making bad weather meal be irregular one steward brought in three large mug half filled with coffee basket of biscuit ham from cut off slice laid on biscuit of ate breakfast holding mug in one hand biscuit ham in other a soon a have finished two officer went on deck directly afterwards captain came down bob chatted with until have finished breakfast then went up on deck again for two three hour at end of time felt so completely exhausted from force of wind constant change of angle at be standing that be glad to go below lie down again there be regular dinner officer coming below by turn taking biscuit chunk of cold meat standing at teatime captain second mate came down together bob who have again be up on deck for bit joined in taking large bowl of coffee think wind be blowing harder than ever said to captain yes glass have begun to rise little be generally sign be getting to worst of expect be three day gale will have at worst tonight hope by time tomorrow will be beginning to shake out reef have better not go up more will be dark in hour bunk be best place for bob be not sorry to obey order for felt that scene must be very terrible one after dark night however seemed to to be miserably long one for be only able to doze off occasionally motion being so violent that have to jam in berth to prevent from being thrown out blow with wave struck ship be tremendous so deeply did pitch that more than once thought that must never come up again go down head foremost once thought heard crash there be order shouted on deck above resisted desire to go up see what be for knew that must hing that in darkness must see little of what be going on with first gleam of daylight however got out of bunk have not attempted to undress having taken off shoe only when lay down having put on again went up there be little change since previous morning looking forward saw that bowsprit be gone fore topmast have be carried away sea be a high a ever patch of blue sky showed overhead between cloud wind be blowing somewhat le violently have be in war see youngster captain said when bob made way aft may thank god be worse have have pretty close squeak of worst be over now wind be going down gale will have blown out by evening be touch go several time during night if have have few more ton of cargo in must never have risen from of wave think now will see oporto safely be more than expected about midnight for hour bob have considerable doubt a to so deeply did brig bury in wave after twelve o'clock wind fell rapidly although wave showed sign of decreasing in surface be smoother seemed to strike vessel with le force violence now mr probert said captain do joe turn in till first watch will take charge of deck after that can set regular watch again main topsail be already on at six o'clock captain have two of reef shaken out other reef be also loosed when mr probert came up took charge of first watch at eight bell night bob lay on floor for motion be more violent than before vessel rolling gunwale under for wind no longer pressed upon sail kept steady must have found impossible to maintain position in berth in morning went up sun be rising in unclouded sky there be scarce breath of wind wave came along in high glassy roller smooth mound of water extended right left in deep valley high ridge vessel be rolling tremendously lower yard sometimes touching water bob have to wait time before must make rush across to bulwark when did so found almost impossible to keep foot must see that men forward be no longer crouching for shelter under break of fo'castle be holding on by shroud stay smoking pipe laughing joking together until motion abated somewhat be clearly impossible to commence work of getting thing in order did bowsprit mast go together bob asked joe lockett who be holding on to bulwark near yes bowsprit went with strain when rose having buried halfway up waist topmast snapped like carrot moment later be worst dive made there be doubt that getting rid of leverage of bowsprit right up in eye eased good bit a topmast be pretty heavy spar too that also helped how long will be before sea go down if mean go down enough for to get to work few hour if mean go down altogether will be five six day before swell have quite flattened down unless wind spring up from other quarter meant till mast can be got up again well afternoon captain may set men at work think must do much good there must be good chance of getting limb broken a long a calm hold there be hurry one way other mean because must be sailing even if have everything set well yes be something did mean be not thinking so much of sailing a of other people be not very fit a be now either for fighting running must be sorry to see french privateer coming along a long a calm continues there be fear of expect there have be few ship out in gale who have not got repair to do a well a have after dinner effort be made to begin work captain soon ordered men to desist be of use mr probert will only be getting of men killed must be possible to get half done before dark if sea go down bit tonight will get a much done in hour work in morning a must if be to work from now to sunset carpenter might get canvas nail so a to hide gap in bulwark will be something done boy can give coat of paint in morning a for spar must leave hand be at work next morning with first gleam of daylight roller be still almost a high a day before there be now slight breath of wind sufficed to give vessel steerage way be put head to roller changing motion from tremendous rolling when be lying broadside to for regular rise fall interfered little with work spare spar be fitted in place of bowsprit stump of topmast be sent down topgallant mast fitted in place by midday light spar be in place again brig be showing fair spread of canvas casual observer must at distance have noticed slight change in appearance have be good morning work captain said a sat down to dinner be little short of head sail will make great difference in rate of sailing especially if wind be aft be ready to meet with storm again if must come be not likely be ready for anything in fact except heavily armed privateer loss of four of gun have crippled there be choice about matter went against heart to see go overboard be better to lose four gun than to lose ship hope will meet with nothing till get through strait may be able to pick up gun at gibraltar prize be often brought in there condemned there be sale of store so hope to be able to get into regular fighting trim again before clear out from there must think wo be sorry when drop anchor off mole youngster be in hurry now bob said must have given good deal if have have two day ago to have be on dry land now that be right again care how long be before get there be very warm pleasant wonderful change after what be when sailed whereabouts be captain be good bit farther to east than like captain replied have be blown long way into bay there be great set of current in here have drifted nearly fifty mile in since noon yesterday be in degree minute west longitude degree latitude think that mean anything to suppose not captain laughed well mean be nearly due west of bordeaux about one hundred mile from french coast little more than eighty north of santander on spanish coast a wind be sou ' sou'west can lay course for cape ortegal once round there will feel more comfortable feel comfortable at present captain well not altogether be good deal too close in to french coast be just on track of privateer may be making for bordeaux from west south going out in direction so although ca say be absolutely uncomfortable will be certainly glad when be back again on regular track of own line of traffic for strait portugal there be english cruiser on line privateer on lookout for french so that sound of gun might bring something up to assistance there be not much chance of meeting with friendly craft here unless have like ourselves be blown out of course lookout have already be placed aloft several sail be seen in distance in course of afternoon nothing excited suspicion wind continued light although brig have sail set be not making more than five half knot hour through water in evening wind dropped still more by nine o'clock brig have scarcely steerage way be enough to put saint out of temper captain said a came down into cabin mixed glass of grog before turning in if wind have held must have be pretty nearly off finisterre by morning a be have made more than forty knot since took observation at noon bob woke once in night knew by rippling sound of water by slight inclination of berth that breeze have sprung up again when woke again sun be shining brightly got up dressed leisurely a went into cabin heard order given in sharp tone by captain on deck quickened pace up companion to see what be going on good morning mr lockett said to second mate who be standing close by looking up at sail good morning master repton replied somewhat more shortly than usual there be nice breeze morning bob went on seem going on at good rate wish be going twice a fast mate said there be gentleman over there who seems anxious to have talk with want to make acquaintance bob looked round saw over quarter large lugger three mile away what vessel be that asked that be french privateer at least there be very little doubt about must have passed other in dark for when first made out be about four mile away sailing northeast apparently sighted just a made out hauled wind at once have gained about mile on in last two hour have changed course be sailing a see northwest so a to bring wind on quarter think fellow have come up much since still doe come up feel loss of sail now seemed to bob looking up that there be already immense amount of canvas on brig stunsails have be set on be running very fast through water seem to have more canvas set than vessel behind said yes have more lugger sail like witch be splendid boat want very big crew to work be reason why scarcely ever see with except a fishing craft something of sort daresay that lugger have hundred men on board eighty anyhow so be wonder sometimes get worst of always carry three hand to two very often two to one of course be really trader though do carry letter of marque if be regular privateer must carry twice a many hand a do walking to poop rail bob saw that men be bringing up shot putting in rack by gun breech cover have be taken off first officer be overlooking work well lad captain lockett said coming up to see that unlucky calm have got into mess after unless wind drop again be going to have to fight for must wind dropping help sir yes have more canvas on than lugger carry if breeze be lighter must steal away from a be doe gain much doe gain in two three hour will be sending messenger to ask to stop what will do captain will send messenger back to tell to mind own business then will be question of good shooting if can knock out one of mast will get off if ca chance be will see inside of french prison if once get alongside be up with can carry by boarding for can throw three time strength of men on to deck there be little talking on board brig when men have finished preparation stood waiting by bulwark watching vessel in chase of occasionally speaking together in low tone may a well pipe hand to breakfast mr probert have told cook to give extra good meal after will say few word to now master repton may a well have meal may get good one for time still hope that will be able to cripple that fellow have great faith in long eighteen boatswain be old man o ' war man be capital shot be pretty good one myself a sea be smooth have good steady platform to fire from have good hope will cripple that fellow before come up to there be more talking than usual at breakfast captain lockett second mate laughed joked over approaching fight mr probert be always man of few word said little now sooner come up better growled hate running away especially when ca run fastest men will do best suppose probert have be down among first mate nodded want to see inside of prison captain no more than do will stick to gun fancy know well enough will be no use if come to boarding use at probert quite agree with there if come up alongside must haul down flag be of use throwing away men life by fighting against such odds a must let get up be sir have got to keep off if can be done will have to haul wind little when begin so a to get eighteen to bear on yes must do that captain said then will get other four gun over on same side after breakfast be over captain went up took station at poop rail men have finished breakfast on seeing that captain be about to address moved aft lad said that frenchman behind will be within range in course of hour what have got to do be to knock of spar out of a come up slowly will have plenty of time to do daresay carry good many more gun than do suppose that be heavier metal if got alongside of must be more than match propose to let get alongside a imagine of wish to see inside of french prison know will all do best let there be hurrying in fire aim at spar throw shot away chance be in favour for can fight gun while can fight only bow chaser at rate until bear up doe gain on much now when come to get few shot hole in sail will make difference will give ten guinea to be divided among men at first gun knock away one of spar five guinea besides to man who lay gun men gave cheer get gun over to port side will haul wind little a soon a be within range by five bell lugger be within mile half men be already clustered round pivot gun put helm down little captain ordered be enough now boatswain be well within range let see what can do fire when have got well on sight few second later there be flash roar eye be directed on lugger captain be watching through glass there be shout from men ball have passed through great foresail couple of foot from mast very good captain said give trifle more elevation next time if can hit yard will be just a good a hitting mast ah there go two puff of white smoke broke out from lugger bow one shot struck water nearly abreast of brig at distance of ten yard other fell short fourteen captain said thought must have eighteen so far forward shot after shot be fired so far serious damage have be caused by brig have be hulled once two shot have passed through sail captain went to pivot gun laid carefully bob stood watching lugger intently gave shout a saw foresail run rapidly down be only sling cut second mate who be standing by said will have up again in minute if shot have be least bit lower must have smashed yard lugger came into wind a did so eight gun flashed out from side while almost at same moment four broadside gun of antelope be for first time discharged bob felt horribly uncomfortable for moment a shot hummed overhead cutting one of stunsail boom in two making five fresh hole in sail take men from small gun joe get sail in captain said loss be of consequence in minute lugger foresail again rose continued chase heading straight for brig doe like game of long bowl probert captain said intends to come up to board instead of trusting to gun now boatswain try again brig be now sailing somewhat across lugger bow so that broadside gun trained a far a possible aft must all play upon steady fire be kept up to only replied by two bow chaser one of men have be knocked down wounded by splinter from bulwark serious damage have so far be inflicted while sail of lugger be spotted with shot hole bob wished heartily that have something to do must have be glad to have followed first mate example that officer having thrown off coat taken place of wounded man in working gun felt that must only be in way did try to assist steadily lugger came up until be little more than quarter of mile behind now lad captain shouted double shot gun be last chance lay gun carefully fire together when give word now be ready fire five gun flashed out together ten shot sped on way splinter flew from lugger foremast in two place cry of disappointment rose a be seen that be practically uninjured look look captain shouted hurrah lad cloud of white canvas fell over to leeward of lugger two mast be nearly in line shot have narrowly missed foremast passed through foresail have struck mainmast brought sail overboard crew of brig raised general cheer minute before french prison have stared in face now be free helm be instantly put up brig bore straight away from pursuer what do say probert will turn table now give pounding must like to sir nothing better must be dangerous work directly get free of hamper will be under command will be able to bring broadside to play on if have luck knocked away one of spar must turn table upon besides even if made strike colour must never take into port strong handed a be must not dare to send prize crew on board be right probert though doe seem pity to let go scot free when have got almost at mercy not quite sir look there lugger have managed to bring head sufficiently up into wind for broadside gun to bear shot came hurtling overhead yard of main topsail be cut in sunder peak halliard of spanker severed peak came down with run must hear faint cheer come across water from lugger leave gun lad repair damage captain shouted throw off throat halliard of spanker get down send hand up to reef fresh rope through block mr probert joe take eight men with stow away topsail send broken yard down carpenter see if have got light spar will do instead of if not get two small one lash so a to make splice of in minute gun of lugger spoke out again although few rope be cut away more hole made in sail serious damage be inflicted before be again loaded spanker be rehoisted lugger continued to fire brig be now leaving fast a soon a sail be up pivot gun be again set to work lugger be hulled several time seeing that chance of disabling brig be small be again brought before wind in hour new topsail yard be ready that sail be again hoisted antelope have now got three mile away from lugger a sail sheeted second mate shouted from aloft there be sail on weather bow sir be close hauled sailing across head see captain replied ought to have noticed before mr probert have be so busy that have be keeping lookout what do make to be joe said to second mate must say be french frigate sir captain ascended shroud with glass remained there two three minute watching ship then returned to deck be frigate certainly mr probert by cut of sail must say frenchman be in awkward fix have got weather gage of do think if put up helm ran due north must come out ahead of mate shook head not if wind freshens sir a think will must say have best haul wind make for one of spanish port might get into santander yes must be best chance hand 'bout ship vessel head be brought up into wind payed off on other tack heading frigate being now on weather quarter course took brig within mile half of lugger fired few harmless shot at when have passed beyond range of gun shaped course southeast by east for santander frigate being now dead astern men be then piped to dinner be likely to catch sir bob asked a sat down to table hope not lad think will unless wind freshens good deal if did must come up hand over hand take be twelve mile off now be four bell have only got five hour daylight at most however fast be ought not to gain knot half hour in breeze if be five six mile ahead when get dark can change course there be moon be not long below lugger be under sail again sir second mate who be on duty said a gained deck have be long getting up jury mast captain lockett said be best of lug rig still have smart crew on board directed glass towards lugger be five mile away be good sized spar said nearly a lofty a foremast be carrying mainsail with two reef in with wind on quarter be travelling pretty nearly a fast a did before still ca catch know do see mr probert be bearing rather more to north reckons fancy that after get dark may try to throw frigate out may make up way in case must have good chance of cutting off be awkward for frigate will know will guess that instead of wearing round way will be more likely to make other be so mate agreed still will have choice of hauling wind making south by west of running on ca tell will choose be right enough be just toss up if run run will overtake if haul up close into wind doe same will overtake again if do one thing doe other be safe then again may give more westing after get dark bear same course lugger be taking certainly wo gain on fancy will gain bit on then in morning if frigate be out of sight can make for santander will be pretty nearly due south of then if lugger be left well astern can make leg north then get on old course again for cape ortegal lugger must see be of use chasing further yes think be best plan of three captain see frigate be coming up can just make out line of hull must be fast craft hour passed on slowly fortunately wind did not freshen vessel maintained respective position towards other frigate be coming up when began to get dusk be still six mile astern lugger be five mile away on lee quarter three mile northeast of frigate be still pursuing line must take four mile to north of brig present position coast of spain must be seen stretching along to southward hour be perfectly dark even with night glass frigate must no longer be made out starboard helm captain said to man at wheel lay head due east fancy wind be dying away sir mr probert said so long a come stark calm care captain replied must be worst thing must happen for must have frigate boat after light breeze must suit admirably two hour later wind have almost died out will take sail off mr probert if frigate keep on course be steering when last saw will go two mile to south of lugger will go more than to north if hold on night will be hull down before morning will be to windward of with wind light frigate must never catch know lugger must with reduced sail in few minute sail be lowered brig lay motionless for next two hour closest watch be kept nothing be seen of pursuing vessel fancy frigate must have altered course more to south captain said thinking that a lugger be up north must be likely to haul wind in direction will wait hour then get up sail again lay head for cape ortegal when morning broke brig be steering west sign of lugger be visible from top upper sail of frigate must be seen close under land away to southeast just a thought captain said rubbing hand in high glee hauled wind a soon a be dark stood in for coast thinking must do same be well out of scrape two day later brig dropped anchor in tagus where three english ship of war be lying part of cargo have to be discharged here captain at once went ashore to get spar to replace topmast carried away in gale may fall in with frenchman before be through strait said be not going to put to sea again like lame duck bob went ashore with captain be greatly amused at scene in street of lisbon have better keep with a will be going on board in hour tomorrow can come ashore see sight spend day must let joe come with will be too busy to be spared so will have to shift for before landing in morning captain advised not to go outside town know lingo lad might get into trouble see there be always sailor going ashore from ship of war get drunk have spree fancy be favourite with lower class here although shopkeeper of course be glad enough to have money think must be safe for lad like who ca speak word of language to wander about outside regular street there will be plenty for to see without going further a bob be good deal impressed with narrow escape have have from capture be by mean inclined to run risk of getting into scrape perhaps missing passage out therefore strictly obeyed captain instruction when just a be going down to landing stage where boat be to come ashore for came upon party of half drunken sailor engaged in vigorous fight with number of portuguese civil guard turned down side street to avoid getting mixed up in fray repressing strong impulse to join in by side of countryman on mentioning to captain when reached brig latter said be lucky that kept clear of row be nonsense talking about countryman be affair of nationality at nobody must think of interfering if saw party of drunken sailor in english port fighting with constable if did interfere ought to be on side of law why then must anyone take part of drunken sailor in foreign port against guardian of peace to do so be act of grossest folly in first place chance be in favour of getting head laid open with sword cut fellow know stand chance against englishman fist very soon whip out sword in second place must have to pas night in crowded lockup where must be half smothered before morning lastly if be lucky enough not to get week confinement in jail must have smart fine to pay there be plenty of fighting to be done in day like people must see that fight on right side not be taking part of drunken scamp who get into trouble simply because happens to be englishman showed plenty of pluck lad when ball be flying about other day when see uncle be sure will be pleased when tell how well behaved under fire be equally certain must not have be by mean gratified at hearing have have to leave behind at lisbon with broken head in prison through getting into street row in have possible concern between drunken sailor portuguese civil guard bob saw that captain be perfectly right said so frankly see must have be fool indeed if have got into row captain will remember what say in future still know did get into give credit for lad acknowledge strong impulse to do so now in future have better have impulse just other way when find in midst of row in have personal concern let first thought be how to get out of a quickly a can got into more than one scrape when be young fellow from conduct of messmate who have got too much liquor in did good did harm so take advice fight own battle never interfere to fight other people unless be absolutely convinced that be in right if be stick by a long a have leg to stand upon chapter rock fortress on third day after arrival at antelope anchor be hove up dropped down river hour later barque brig came out joined three captain having agreed day before must sail in company a be bound through strait captain lockett have purchased two pounder gun at lisbon brig therefore now carried three gun on side besides long pounder barque carried fourteen gun other brig ten so that felt confident of being able to beat off french privateer might meet on way one two suspicious sail be sighted a ran down coast none of approached within gunshot three craft being evidently too strong to be meddled with rounding cape st vincent at short distance steered for mouth of strait after bold cliff of portugal bob be disappointed with aspect of spanish coast ah be very well first mate replied when expressed opinion give low sandy shore let who like have what call fine bold rock mind mean coast with sandbank lying off coast with shelving beach pretty deep water right up to if get cast on coast like of portugal be certain death ship will get smashed up like eggshell against rock be talking of not soul get chance of escape while if be blown on flat coast may get carried within ship length of beach before strike be hard if ca get line on shore besides be ten to one ship wo break up for hour may get landsman to admire bold cliff wo get sailor to agree with seem to be going along fast although there be not much wind yes there be strong current see river fall into mediterranean ai sufficient to make up for loss by evaporation so there be always current running in here be well enough for going east be not so pleasant when want to come out then have got to wait till can get breeze from somewhere about east to carry out have be kept waiting sometimes for week be unusual thing to see two three hundred ship anchored waiting for wind to change be there pirate over on side bob asked looking across at african coast not about here ceuta lie over there be good friend with gibraltar get most of supply from there once through strait give that coast wide berth for algerine pirate be nearly a bad a ever must snap up ship becalmed on coast have bad luck to be blown ashore hope day will send fleet down blow place about ear make one blood boil to think that there be hundred hundred of englishman working a slave among moor there do see that projecting point with fort on town lying behind be tarifa that used to be great place in time when moor be master in spain yes captain who have just joined said tarif be great moorish commander have heard place be named after gibraltar be also named after moorish chief called tarik ibn zeyad bob looked surprised see that be much like name captain master repton doe sound much like now old name of place be gebel tarik mean tank hill be easy to see how gebel tarik got gradually changed into gibraltar in two hour strait be passed rock of gibraltar appeared rising across bay to left illustration view of gibraltar from mediterranean view of gibraltar from mediterranean there be destination lad captain said be strong looking place be be indeed captain bob said taking captain glass from top of skylight examining rock see captain went on rock be divided from mainland by low spit of sand be only few hundred yard wide sea go round at back of rock along other side of spit though ca see from here so anything coming to attack must advance along spit under fire of gun there do see that building standing up on hill above town be old moorish castle there be plenty of modern battery scattered about near though ca see see rock rise sheer up from spit be only on side close to water edge that place can be entered weak side of place be along sea face on other side rock rise right out of water on side a see slope gradually down there be battery along by water edge if place be attacked by fleet strong enough to knock battery to piece silence gun landing must be effected at southern end see rock be bolder there be landing there be called europa point there be battery there though ca make out from here scene be very pretty one bob watched with greatest interest frigate two men of war brig be anchored at little distance from rock around be thirty forty merchantman waiting for change in wind to enable to sail out through strait white sailed boat be gliding about among at head of bay be village nestled among tree while country behind be broken hilly on opposite side of bay be town of considerable size captain told be algeciras be said large town at time of moor very much larger more important than gibraltar ground rose gradually behind be completely covered with foliage orchard orange grove captain said see that rock rising at end of bay from among tree lad be called 'the queen of spain chair ' be said that at certain siege when moor be here then queen of spain took seat on rock declared must never go away till gibraltar be taken also took oath never to change linen until surrendered know how managed about at last for place never did surrender suppose got dispensation be able to get into clean clothes again day have heard tell that spaniard have colour be called by name sort of dirty yellow came out at time of course must not have be etiquette for other lady to wear white when majesty be obliged to wear dingy garment so took to having thing dyed so a to match hers tint have borne name ever since be very nasty idea bob said must think took pretty good care afterwards not to take oath be hot enough now must think in summer must be baking here be pretty hot on rock in summer know call native of place rock scorpion scorpion be supposed to like heat though know whether do generally find lying under piece of loose rock whether do for heat to keep cool ca say now mr probert may a well take of sail off will anchor inside craft close to new mole may want to get alongside to unload government store have brought out nearer be in le trouble will be to warp alongside tomorrow morning of course if landing place be full will send lighter out to illustration view of gibraltar from bay view of gibraltar from bay sail be gradually got off brig have little way on when anchor be dropped cable length from end of mole scarcely have brought up when boat shot out from end of pier hooray bob shouted there be sister gerald thought a much captain said hoisted number a soon a came round point signal station on top of rock must

consolation if there be siege expect there will be end of hair powder cravat be gineral rule on campaign be worth standing to be shot at to have little comfort in one life do think that there be chance at of spaniard taking place if do besiege bob asked a dr burke took seat none of taking place by force bob have be besieged over over again be pretty nearly always by hunger that have fallen be where pinch will come if besiege in earnest be living on mouse grass be like to be before be over fleet will bring in provision surely dr burke fleet will have can do to keep sea against navy of france spain will do what can may be sure enemy well know that be only by starving out that can hope to take place expect will put fleet here that will be mighty difficult for even boat to find way in between do know about other siege mr o'halloran asked of course know something about last siege know nothing about history of rock before of course gerald doe know why must carrie suppose that when be at school at athlone taught history of bit of rock sticking up on face of globe have enough to do to learn about old roman bad ce to bothering doings can tell about mr o'halloran teddy burke said bob professor who come to have talk with for hour day have be telling about if gerald will move mix glass of grog to moisten throat will give whole story of know doubt that be called mount calpe by gerald friend roman who called hill opposite there mount abyla two together pillar of hercules beyond giving name seem to have concerned with do phoenician carthaginian though of have city out in low country be when saracen began to play game over here that first hear of roderic know be king of goth seems to have be thundering old tyrant one of noble julian who have be badly treated by went across with family into africa put up saracen governor of province across there to invade spain first of made little expedition be in with one hundred horse four hundred foot landed over there at algeciras after doing plundering burning sailed back again with news that country must be conquered so next year twelve thousand men under chief named tarik crossed landed on flat between rock spain left party here to build castle then marched away defeated roderic army at xeres soon conquered whole of spain except mountain of north hear much more of gibraltar for six hundred year algeciras have become fortress of great strength magnificence gibraltar be mere sort of outlying post ferdinand fourth of spain besieged algeciras for year must not take part of army attacked gibraltar captured african moor came over to help friend ferdinand have to fall back spaniard still held gibraltar chap named vasco paez de meira being in command in abomelique son of emperor of fez came across with army besieged gibraltar vasco held out for five month be then starved into surrender just a alonzo eleventh be approaching to assistance arrived before town five day after surrendered attacked castle moor encamped on neutral ground in rear cut off from supply be obliged at last to negotiate be permitted to retire be not long away next time attacked algeciras after long siege took in in there be several war in africa took advantage of to besiege gibraltar be month over business garrison be nearly starved out when pestilence broke out in spanish camp by king many of soldier died rest retired be not until sixty year afterwards in there be fresh trouble then be what might be called family squabble african of fez have held place till then moorish king of grenada suddenly advanced upon took short time afterwards inhabitant rose against spanish moor turned out emperor of morocco sent over army to help moor of grenada besieged place took by famine in christian have slap at henry de guzman who attacked by sea be defeated killed in greater part of garrison of gibraltar be withdrawn to take part in civil shindy be going on at grenada in absence place be taken by john de guzman duke of medina sidonia son of henry be killed in gibraltar be surprised pillaged by one of barossa captain a be leaving christian galley met corsair be killed taken be really only affair worth speaking of between when fell into hand of spaniard when be captured by sir george rooke who have gone out with force to attack cadiz finding that there be not much chance of success in direction resolved with prince george of hesse darmstadt who commanded troop on board fleet to make attack on gibraltar on st of july english dutch landed on neutral ground at daybreak on rd fleet opened spaniard be driven from gun on molehead battery boat landed seized battery held in spite of spaniard springing mine killed two lieutenant about forty men marquis de saline governor be then summoned capitulated so see made only day work of taking place spaniard thought that have made impregnable professor made strong point of that garrison consisted only of hundred fifty men certainly account for success for be use having gun wall if have got soldier to man prince of hesse be left a governor be not long before mettle be tried for in october spanish army with six battalion of frenchman opened trench against town admiral sir john leake threw in reinforcement six month provision at end of month forlorn hope of five hundred spanish volunteer managed to climb up rock by rope ladder surprised battery be so furiously attacked that be killed taken prisoner heavy cannonade be kept up for week when large number of transport with reinforcement supply arrived garrison being now considered strong enough to resist attack fleet sailed away siege went on till middle of march when sir john leake again arrived drove away french fleet captured burnt five of siege be then discontinued having cost enemy ten thousand men so see there be pretty hard fighting over place be threatened in in beginning of twenty thousand spaniard again sat down before fortification have be made good deal stronger after first siege garrison be commanded by lieutenant governor clayton siege lasted till may when news arrived that preliminary of general peace have be signed there be lot of firing spaniard must have shot mighty badly for have only three hundred killed wounded must think that be enough when tell that cannon be so old rotten that seventy cannon thirty mortar burst during siege seems to that one of three hundred must have be damaged by own cannon that spaniard did not succeed in hitting single man be mighty encouraging for mr o'halloran for think that cannon will burst time if spaniard shoot better than did before be little work enough be likely to fall to share of surgeon thank mr o'halloran said have told that very nicely teddy burke did not know anything about before have idea that be when english be besieged here that queen of spain sat on rock be called after see now that be ferdinand isabella that be when moor be besieged here hundred of year before well be glad know something about be stupid to be in

consul in barbary who have come across in from tangier reported that swedish brig have put in there reported that have fallen in with french fleet of twenty eight sail of line off cape finisterre that be waiting there to be joined by spanish fleet from cadiz news caused great excitement be scarcely believed for spanish general have given most amicable assurance to governor on st however spaniard at line across neutral ground refused to permit mail to pas formal notification be sent in intercourse between gibraltar spain must no longer be permitted put end to doubt discussion war must have be declared between spain england step must never have be taken in fact although garrison did not learn until time later spanish ambassador in london have presented what be virtually declaration of war on th messenger have be sent off on same day from madrid ordering cessation of intercourse with gibraltar have not be detained by accident on road might have arrived during general eliott visit to

obeoore ever did stroke of work since flood be not going to demean by beginning what be laughing at young repton be only wondering captain obeoore how ancestor got through flood unless indeed noah be obeoore there be reason to believe that be captain said seriously must have be that if have boat of own found mountain that water did cover have got tree of family at home old gentleman who be learned in thing came to house when be boy remember right well that said to father after reckoning up that first of house must have have place there in ireland well nigh thousand year before adam think father

mean be suppose adam obeoore started at same time one in ireland other in eden have equal number of child a be likely enough people in world must be descendant of adam other half of obeoore see instead of being obeoore genuine descendant in direct line from first of family world must have equal claim to title captain obeoore reflected for minute two be right dr burke said never saw in light be clear enough that be right that le say about obeoores before first irish king of name better there must have be mistake about tree spoke of captain o'halloran apologize be wrong two officer shook

from window until have entered door of own quarter then there be general shout of laughter obeoore will be death of teddy burke exclaimed a threw back in chair exhausted be one of best fellow going can lead on into anything suppose ever gave thought to obeoores anywhere further back than king have vague idea that must have be going on simply because must have seemed to that world without obeoore

whatever of whisky mixed with plenty of water be too hard on altogether doctor laughed there be soberer man in regiment than humble servant well will do good if get on short allowance of wine for time ca think why men want to sit after dinner drink bottle after bottle of port wine be very well to say that everyone doe be very poor excuse why must do woman do see why men must hope time will come

battery sentry told if came foot nearer in boat must fire in end doctor have to cover up with sail lie there night hear major went to lodge complaint when landed of course men be only doing duty hear eliott gave wigging for endeavouring to make disobey order will be on board before gunfire captain lockett there be fear of missing how long do expect to be away captain lockett mr o'halloran asked that depends on how get on if be lucky pick up number of prize may bring in in week if not may be three week especially if calm weather last be sure hope wo be too lucky at first captain bob put in want cruise to finish in week oh sha' consider cruise be finished merely because come in bob captain said will be going out again only put in here to bring in prize cruise will last a long a captain o'halloran sister will allow to remain on board expect that will be able to make very useful will put down in ship book a third mate wo be able to draw prize money a officer because number of officer entitled to prize money be entered when crew signed article if put down a supercargo will share with men in prize take while be away with will be jolly captain not because of money know because will give one more interest in cruise besides will like something to do oh will give something to do will put in joe watch then will learn something be always a well to pick up knowledge when get chance if do take prize will be duty a supercargo to take inventory of what have on board next morning bob packed trunk first thing then went round to professor told that be going away for fortnight so for cruise then went down to port met joe lockett when landed brought up to breakfast a have be arranged with captain night before after that went with up rock to look at spaniard whose tent be good deal more numerous than have be who be still at work arming fort if be general joe said must go out at night with two three regiment spike gun blow up fort don must be expecting must be good beginning must put men in high spirit do see spanish fleet have drifted away almost out of sight to east thought what must be at sunset yesterday when saw that did not enter bay for current must be sure to drive away if wind did spring up well hope will get little evening now must be going down for there be good deal to do before sail chapter cruise in privateer bob be on board antelope quarter of hour before gunfire movement be made until after sunset for of gunboat over at algeciras might have put out have seen preparation for making sail a soon a became dark anchor be hove sail dropped sheeted home brig began to move slowly through water a breasted europa point course be altered to east by north rock faded from sight in darkness first mate be on watch bob walked up down deck with there be occasion for to keep up joe lockett said may just a well turn oh mean to keep watch with bob said captain said be to be in watch want to treat just same way a if be midshipman under well if be midshipman there must be anything for to do now still if like to keep up of course can do so will be glad of company will help keep sharp lookout for ship there be chance of coming across spanish trader tonight suppose joe not in least must keep deal farther out than will if be bound either for algeciras through strait be not likely to meet anything till get near malaga after of course will be in line of coaster there be almeria cartagena alicante score of small port between alicante valencia seem to be going through water very fast joe no not more than two two half knot hour however be in hurry with light wind like want to get too close to shore might have of gunboat coming out after expect that in morning if wind hold light captain will take in upper sail just drift along then after get dark will clap on everything run in so a to strike coast few mile above malaga then will take in sail anchor a close in a dare anything coming along then will take for craft have come out from malaga at midnight second mate whose name be croft came up to relieve watch bob who be beginning to feel very sleepy be by mean sorry to turn in hardly seemed to that have closed eye when be aroused by knocking at cabin door be two bell sir mr lockett say be to turn out bob hurried on thing went up knowing that be hour late thought wanted to keep watch bob ought to have be on deck at eight bell so must have be if have be woke bob said indignantly be not accustomed to wake up just after go to sleep doe seem to have be in bed five minute if wake tomorrow morning will see will be up sharp enough there be hardly wind have be only crawling along night there be gib see behind why doe look ten mile off bob said in surprise be twice that be two three twenty must say now best thing can do be to go down to waist slip off togs have few bucket of water poured over will wake up will feel ever so much more comfortable afterwards have just told steward to make couple of cup of coffee will be ready by time have have wash bob followed advice after bath cup of coffee biscuit no longer felt effect from shortness of night sun have already risen there be not cloud upon sky what be over there asked pointing to southeast look like sail be sail be upper sail of spanish fleet expect be trying to work back into bay again wo do unless get more wind see have taken topgallant sail off brig so a not to be seen there be spanish coast see twelve fourteen mile away to port if like can take glass go up into maintop see if can make anything out on shore bob came down in hour there be fishing boat said at least look like fishing boat close inshore just abreast of yes there be two three little river on side of malaga there be not water in for craft of size fishing boat use there be heavy swell set in here when wind be from east with bit south in run up there for shelter captain lockett now came up on deck good morning bob did not see here when watch be changed sir be woke mean to be up morning be right bob joe agreed to give extra hour morning four hour be very short measure to one who be not accustomed to will soon find that can turn in get sleep when watch be over whatever time of day seems to that watch have worst of captain lockett have from eight to twelve now from four to eight other have only four hour on deck yours be considered best watch bob middle watch a one come on at twelve o'clock be called be always most disliked see at eight bell go off have breakfast comfortably can then turn in till twelve o'clock can get caulk from five six till eight in evening of course if there be anything to do bad weather anything of sort watch be on deck day well be almost sure must like other watch best bob said be wrong lad especially in summer see be not fairly dark till nine must turn in till ten anyhow so that really be only kept two hour out of bunk at watch be getting light when come up at four at five begin to wash deck there be plenty to occupy so that doe seem long till eight bell others have to turn out at twelve o'clock just when be most sleepy to be on watch for four dark hour then go down just a be getting light on cold night in winter in channel think perhaps advantage be other way in fact men get so accustomed to four hour in four hour out that make very little difference to how go day brig kept on same course moving very slowly through water passing coast a much by aid of current a by of sail be pretty well off malaga captain lockett said in afternoon if there have be wind must have have chance of picking up something making from there to strait there be chance of today people like making quick voyage when there be risk of falling in with enemy wo be putting out from port until there be change in weather however look to a if there be chance of little breeze from south when sun go down have seen flaw two on water way yes seems to darker over there mate said will go up have look round yes sir there be certainly breeze stirring down to south shouted from aloft will just suit captain said must be twenty mile off coast at least even if have noticed from above town be too far off for to make out at so will be safe for to run in to land will rely upon bob if be hailed will do best to throw dust in eye captain must tell beforehand particular so can have story pat will wait till see what sort of craft be likely to hail tale may be good enough for skipper of coaster might not pas muster with captain of gunboat be coaster likely to be laden with there be never saying mostly fruit wine grain olive then of must be taking good from large port to small town village along coast of coaster be well worth picking up of course craft will be chiefly on lookout for will be from abroad of have very valuable cargo bring copper lead sometimes silver from mine of mexico south america of carry good lot of silver be too much to hope that must run across prize a bring over hide too be worth money then of course there be ship have be trading up mediterranean with france italy levant so see there be considerable variety in chance of what may light upon coaster be of course staple so to speak if have anything like luck will not do badly with others must look upon a prize in lottery before sun set breeze came up to brig be at once headed for land at ten o'clock light of malaga be made out on port beam brig bore away little to east two hour later land be looming not far ahead sail be got off man placed in chain sounding taken be continued until water shoaled to eight fathom when brig be brought up head to wind anchor let go then anchor watch of four men be set rest of crew allowed to turn in at daybreak officer be out again be found that brig be lying within quarter of mile of land in slight indentation of coast wind have died away sail be loosed suffered to fall against mast must not be better captain lockett said look now a if have be trying to make up down coast have be forced to come to anchor here fortunately there seem to be village near so be not likely to have anyone coming out to how far do think be from malaga captain about ten mile must say bob why do ask be only thinking whether must be possible for to make way there find out what vessel there be in harbour whether of be likely to be coming way if be ten mile be afraid be too far must have to pas through village might be questioned where came from where be going know that spanish must pas muster if be questioned like must be right if be once in seaport one must be likely to ask question then must stroll about listen to what be said certainly must talk quite well enough to go in get meal sort of thing must let do bob captain said be very plucky idea must be right to let carry out must get hung a spy if be detected think there be least fear in world of being detected in seaport bob said must think great fun must like to try to cross country perhaps may have better chance later on captain shook head might go on board ship if one brings up at anchor anywhere near bob if got detected there must take rescue be different thing to letting go ashore presently sail of two fishing boat be seen coming out from beyond low point three mile to east suppose there be fishing village there mate said be glad be nearer examined boat with glass be working out with sweep expect hope to get little wind when be in offing just a be at breakfast second mate who be on deck called down skylight there be three craft to west sir have just come out from behind point there be bringing little breeze with be like mr croft one be polacre xebec third look like full rigged craft a be end on ca say for certain right mr croft will be up in five minute can hing until get wind anyhow breakfast be speedily finished went on deck spanish flag be already flying from peak three craft be about two mile away how be sailing mr croft fancy xebec be fastest sir be astern just now be abreast of polacre now a near a can make out ship brig whichever be seems to to be dropping astern heave away at anchor joe get in slack so a to be ready to hoist a soon a breeze reach want to come up to line be taking now will carry nearly mile outside be fortunate run in six of gun throw tarpaulin over eighteen pounder three gun on side be about enough for to show breeze caught when three spanish craft be nearly abeam have more wind out there than will have here captain said be advantage for want to run away from now get up anchor joe take too many hand watch below have already be ordered to sit down on deck other watch be now told to do same twelve fourteen hand be quite enough to show captain said anchor up sir joe shouted let hang there will get aboard presently now haul that fore staysail across ease off spanker sheet now a come round haul on brace sheet one by one do in a lubberly way a can brig have be riding with head to west came slowly round yard being squared in slow fashion in strong contrast to active way in be generally handled captain watched other craft carefully xebec polacre be gaining on be going a fast through water a three master when get wind little more will have heel of get sail overboard joe tow under port quarter give too much rope might catch sight of on board ship will bring down to rate of sailing want to keep bit astern of dare not attack in daylight mount too many gun for altogether big fellow have got twelve on side polacre have eight xebec six so between have fifty two gun might try if be well out at sea must never do here there may be galley gunboat within hearing so must bide time think be in luck time joe ship must have come foreign at least must say so by appearance though may be from cadiz a to other two may be anything xebec doubt be coast trader polacre may be one thing must hardly think have come across atlantic likely enough be from bilbao santander ship be fellow to get hold of if get chance will be quite content to leave others alone must think so joe agreed ship ought to be valuable prize wherever come from if be sound pretty new must fetch good sum if can get into english port wind continued to hold light four vessel made slow progress through water two leader however gradually improved position be nearly matched in point of sailing captain be evidently making race of hoisting stitch of canvas be able to show by afternoon be fully two mile ahead of ship be mile on starboard bow of brig wind died away to nothing a sun set three spanish vessel have be edging in towards shore polacre anchored just before sunset ship held on for hour be mile astern of other two when also dropped anchor sail have be towing overboard from brig have be got on board again when wind began to drop have come up to within little more than quarter of mile of ship anchor be let go a soon a be seen that crew of ship be preparing to anchor so that brig must be first to do so whether there have be suspicion on board spaniard a to character of brig must not tell watching closely captain lockett saw that order to anchor be countermanded a soon a be seen that brig have done so few minute after men again went forward anchor be dropped for vessel be making way through water well joe there be close to now question be what be to do next if there be wind must be simple enough must drop alongside in middle watch carry by boarding before don have time to get out of hammock a be be out of question of course ca think of towing up on still night a will be must hear slightest noise might attack in boat mate said yes must be possible watch must hear oar instant began to row see by number of gun carry must be strongly manned expect most of be small joe said meant for show rather than use be likely enough may have taken half of on board at cadiz malaga so a to give formidable appearance in case must fall in with craft of description if have come across atlantic must never have carried anything like number of gun for spain be not at war with anyone craft flying black flag be still to be found in water joe might carry gun for defence against be not question of gun at present be question of crew be likely that carry many more than do if must get alongside there must be fear about at own like risk of losing half men in attack on craft like unless can have advantage of surprise what do say to swimming off to a soon a get quite dark captain bob said be very good swimmer used to bathe regularly at putney where be at school have swum across thames back lot of time there be sure to be little mist on water presently wo be keeping very sharp lookout till get later can get hold of cable climb up get in over bow if there be lookout there see what be going on there be danger in thing for if be discovered have only got to dive swim back again there be current to speak of here there must be least chance of hitting in dark must certainly be able to learn something by listening to talk must be very risky thing bob captain lockett said shaking head must like to let do though of course must be great thing if must learn something about own like appearance though ca say why somehow other think be right gun be mere pretence be weak handed must carry very big crew well see there can be possible harm in trying to get on board captain of course if be hailed a approach will turn come back again night will be dark will have difficulty in finding from talking noise on board well joe what do think captain said doubtfully think might let bob try joe said must not mind trying at a ca speak spanish must be able to learn nothing be not likely to be setting watch keeping sharp lookout for time must think that might possibly get on board unobserved if do make out have only to keep on diving in dark there must be little chance of hitting besides certainly must make out that be swimmer if noticed ripple in water must be sure to think be fish of sort bob continued to urge that must be allowed to try at last captain lockett agreed to doing so be already almost dark enough for attempt to be made bob prepared at once for swim took off coat waistcoat shirt put on dark knitted jersey fastened belt tightly round waist over breech took off shoe if be seen said be sure to hear hailing shouting then please show lantern over stern for slight a current be sufficed to make vessel swing head to west rope be lowered over side by slipped down quietly into water be perfectly warm then struck off noiselessly in direction of ship kept two mast of brig in one a long a must make out owing to mist on water soon lost sight of have difficulty in keeping straight course a must plainly hear sound of voice ahead of taking greatest pain to avoid making slightest splash often pausing to listen bob swam on until saw dark mass looming up in front of illustration bob swim off to spanish warship now did little more than float giving gentle stroke occasionally drifting towards until grasped cable now listened intently there be voice on fo'castle above determined before trying to climb up there to swim round vessel keeping close to side so that must not be seen unless someone leaned far over bulwark halfway along came upon projection looking up saw that slab of wood three inch wide be fixed against side at interval of foot apart so a to form accommodation ladder when be not considered necessary to lower gangway two hand rope hung by side of way be now easy drew out of water by rope ascended ladder then crawled along outside bulwark until came to porthole from gun projected then crawled in there lay under cannon two three lantern be suspended above deck by light bob must at once see that be on board ship of war group of sailor be sitting on deck among gun saw that most of be run in that be of heavy calibre several of being pounder a captain joe have agreed that gun be only pounder bob have difficulty in arriving at fact that must have be mere dummy thrust out of porthole to deceive stranger a to armament lay listening for time to talk of sailor gathered that ship have be purposely disguised before putting out from malaga in order to deceive english privateer might come across a to strength learned also that considerable doubt be entertained a to brig that xebec polacre have be signalled to go on ahead so a to induce brig if must be enemy to make attack reason why have not be overhauled during day be that captain feared might escape in light wind for watch have be vigilant have made out that be towing something to deaden way be considered likely that taking ship for merchantman attack must be made in boat during night men joked a to surprise assailant must get boarding pike be piled in readiness shot have be placed in rack ready to throw down into boat a came alongside ship boat have be swung out in readiness for lowering a be intended to carry brig by boarding after repulse destruction of boat have have narrow escape of catching tartar bob said to be very lucky came on board to reconnoitre spaniard be not such duffer a thought fancied be taking in very nearly fell into trap very quietly crawled back under porthole made way along outside bulwark until hand touched rope then slid down by into water a knew there be more chance of sharp watch being kept in eye of ship than elsewhere swam straight out from side until became indistinct then headed for brig light on board spaniard served a guide to for time distance seemed longer to than have before be beginning to fancy must have missed brig when saw looming up on right in three four minute be alongside brig there hailed drop rope overboard there be stir overhead at once where be bob captain lockett asked leaning over side just below sir rope be dropped bob grasped be hauled up thank god be back again captain said have be blaming ever since started though a be quiet felt pretty sure have made out well have news did get on board will get prize money time captain spaniard be ship of war mounting twenty four gun none of smaller than eighteen ten of thirty two impossible bob must not have be so mistaken joe be certain that be fourteen yes sir thing saw be dummy gun be almost drawn in thirty two be most of eighteen have be specially disguised at malaga in hope of tempting craft like yours to attack what be more have shrewd suspicion of what be related whole of conversation have heard described preparation for repulsing boat attack in turn carrying brig in ship boat captain lockett be thunderstruck spanish officer who command must be smart fellow said have have narrow escape of running head into noose thanks to bob for joe have quite made up mind to attack in middle watch well only thing for to do be to get away from here a soon a can if find attack tonight be sure to send boat to in morning then if have engagement must hardly hope to get off without losing of spar even if be not sunk with such heavy metal a carry must have other two craft down on too chance of getting away must be worth nothing well suppose joe best plan will be to tow away must think so sir when hear at may send boat out after can beat off must hardly think that must try for will be sure that if be privateer have be playing same game a have hiding gun will guess that carry strong crew send crew aft joe will tell how matter stand have have narrow escape of catching tartar lad said when men went aft know mr repton swam off hour ago to try find out what ship be like well have be on board brings back news that be trader ship of war disguised that carry twenty four gun eighteen pounder thirty two if met while out at sea might make fight of must never do here especially a two consort must be down upon suspect what be although be not certain everything be in readiness to repel boat attack captain intention being if tried to sink cripple boat then to attack with gun so may thank mr repton that have have narrow escape of seeing inside of spanish prison now what propose to do be to tow out get four boat in water a quietly a can have greased fall already will tow straight ahead at rate for bit craft wo be able to bring gun to bear upon except perhaps couple of bow chaser a wo be able to see there be not much chance of being hit pas hawser along from boat to boat row in line ahead of hull will shelter then lay out heartily be ready if be hailed to throw off hawser get back on board again a soon a can for may send boat out after will get start anyhow for when hear rowing will think be putting off to attack will be minute before will find out mistake joe do go in charge of boat will take helm must cut cable must hear clank of windlass operation of lowering boat be conducted very silently bob have taken place at taffrail stood listening for sound must show that spaniard have heard what be doing oar be scarcely dipped in water when heard sudden lull in distant talking minute later broke out again have order to pay attention to noise captain lockett said so a to lead to think that will take unawares there be moving now added a looked down into water four five minute elapsed then in stillness of evening must hear loud hail in spanish what ship be that cease rowing will sink answer captain lockett said have nothing confused sound of oar to tell where be hail be repeated minute later there be flash of gun in darkness shot hummed through air fire away captain muttered be only wasting ammunition for minute spaniard continued to fire two bow gun then after pause there be crash twelve gun be discharged together be getting farther off minute captain said unless unlucky shot must strike one of spar be safe broadside be repeated four time then be silent be mile away from now bob though daresay can hear sound of oar must be mere guesswork a to position went forward to bow hailed boat take easy now mr lockett think will fire more when men have got wind row on again will head out now must give good three mile offing before stop men in four boat have be exerting to utmost be five minute before began rowing again for hour half continued work then captain lockett said to second mate can go forward hail to come on board think have be moving through water about two knot hour so must be three mile seaward of a soon a men came on board tot of grog be served out round then watch below turned in wo anchor suppose captain there be considerable depth of water here rocky bottom want to lose anchor must take something like hour to get up again besides what current there be will drift eastward there be more of here than have inshore must say there must be nearly knot hour will take good distance away from gentleman before morning now bob have better have glass of grog then turn in joe will excuse keeping watch tonight oh feel all right bob said water be quite warm slipped down changed clothes directly left off firing never mind turn in a be told have done good service tonight have earned keep on board brig if be to stop here till fell to piece of old age when bob went up in morning at five o'clock three spanish vessel be still lying at anchor under land seven eight mile away there be breeze coming joe said be from south so will get long before do will see more of a soon a breeze reached sail be braced aft brig kept a close to wind a must sail lying almost directly off from land want to think that be frightened captain lockett said in answer to question from bob a to course that have decided to get away from neighbourhood altogether expect be only going a far a alicante will run on till be well out of sight then hold on for rest of day east in night head for land again beyond alicante must never do to risk fellow coming upon again when be quietly at anchor might not be so lucky next time hour later lookout in top hailed deck said that there be sail in sight what doe look like halkett joe lockett shouted for captain be below a far a can make out be two master must say brig how be heading about northeast sir must say if hold on course will pas ahead of captain be now on deck first mate went up to top starboard helm bit captain shouted after examining distant sail through telescope keep about east what do think be captain bob asked when two officer came down again to poop must say that be craft about own size bob fancy have come through strait keeping well over other side so a to avoid cruiser from gib be now heading for alicante now be on course again parallel to coast there be reason why must suspect of being anything trader if doe take alarm hope will be alongside in few hour chapter cutting out prize distant sail be anxiously watched from antelope closed in with fast running almost before wind in two hour hull must be seen from deck effort have be made by slacking rope altering set of sail to give brig a slovenly appearance a possible gun have be run in porthole closed a spaniard approached crew with exception of five six men be ordered to keep below bulwark course that spaniard be taking must have brought just under stern of antelope when suddenly be seen to change course to bear up into wind too late lady captain said have blundered on too long there be something in cut that doe like haul down spanish flag run union jack up open port lad show teeth fire that bow gun across forefoot gun be already loaded a soon a be run out shot be fired a message to spaniard to heave to minute later a paid attention broadside followed three of shot went crashing into side of spaniard one of boat be smashed moment later spanish flag fluttered down hearty cheer broke from crew of antelope spaniard be thrown up into wind in few minute brig ranged up alongside within pistol shot gig be lowered captain rowed alongside taking bob with a interpreter prize proved to be brig of about same tonnage a antelope be from cadiz bound first to alicante then to valencia carried only six small gun crew of eighteen men cargo consisted of grain olive oil not bad prize captain lockett said a bob read out item of bill of lading be pity that be not full up instead of only half laden still be not bad beginning craft be of handy size if wo sell at gibraltar will pay very well to take on to england must say be fast hour later two brig parted company second mate twelve hand being placed on board spaniard there be discussion a to prisoner be finally agreed to leave on board ship keep down in hold mr croft see that leave knife with keep couple of sentry over hatchway if wind hold will be in bay by tomorrow evening keep pretty well inshore slip in a close to point a can if do that need not have much fear of gunboat suppose authority will want to keep prisoner of course will report on arrival can give one of boat to land across bay if be not wanted if governor want to buy cargo for garrison let have at once stand out for exorbitant term take fair price be just a well to be on good term with authority might have to put in to refit want spar etc from naval yard if governor doe want cargo sell to anyone else till return there be fear of price going down longer keep more will get for have better bring ship paper on board with captain lockett what for bob see that must be use to bill of lading will be useful for selling cargo can copy sir for mr croft what thought be brig be just own size if must get becalmed anywhere near shore boat put off might possibly be able to pas with paper be capital idea bob capital will have bit of canvas painted 'alonzo cadiz in readiness to nail over stern must there be occasion for well goodbye mr croft safe journey to need tell to keep sharp lookout may trust for sir have desire to rot in one of prison till end of war captain gig took back to antelope weather sheet of fore staysail be eased off square sail swung round a drew two brig got under way heading in exactly opposite direction before captain pronounced that be now abreast of alicante under easy sail vessel head be turned towards land next morning be running along shore at distance of three mile beyond fishing boat small craft hugging land nothing be met with until neared cartagena then sound of firing be heard ahead on rounding headland saw vessel of war chasing five six craft nearer inshore be british frigate captain exclaimed think will get there be cartagena only three four mile ahead frigate will not be able to cut off before be under gun of battery be not above mile ahead of first mate said if must knock away spar with long eighteen might get one of must make much prize money if did joe for frigate must share a have five six time a many men officer a have got be not much must get out of hallo broke out a shot came ricochetting along water be trying shot at forgot have spanish colour up get that flag down run up union jack joe one moment captain bob said well what be bob well seems to sir that if keep spanish flag up may be sunk captain broke in might sir be very unlikely especially if run in more to shore see if be fired at by frigate will never enter mind of spaniard that be anything what seem if like can anchor right under battery in middle of craft will be dark by time get in might take pick of be splendid idea bob boy be getting too sharp for altogether joe be a full of idea a ship biscuit be of weevil keep off helmsman will do again again frigate fired be two mile away though shot went skipping over water near brig none of struck men unable to understand why be running gauntlet of frigate fire looked inquiringly towards poop be all right lad captain said there be not much fear of frigate hitting be worth risking spaniard on shore will never dream that be english can bring up in thick of there be good deal of laughing amusement among men a understood captain motive in allowing brig to be made target of a drew in towards shore frigate fire ceased course be changed off shore nearer captain said to helmsman keep little farther off shore there be not much water here joe for man have be heaving lead ever since have changed course have not got fathom under keel see frigate did not like to come closer must have cut off if there have be deep water right up hour later brig dropped anchor off cartagena at little more than quarter of mile from one of battery guarded entrance to port close to two three of craft have be first chased by frigate a be going on in morning have not entered harbour with consort for be already getting dusk not much fear of coming to ask question evening joe lockett said spaniard be not given to troubling unnecessarily a be outside port be one business in particular at moment hail came from vessel anchored ahead of bob went to bulwark brig have swung head to wind be broadside on with other craft have not suffered from fire of accursed ship hope captain of barque shouted senor not shot struck be fortunate be hulled twice have man killed by splinter be rough welcome home to have just returned from lima have heard nothing about war till anchored off alicante yesterday heard firing a came through strait thought be only one of ship fort practising at mark be lucky put in at alicante must have have suspicion must have let frigate sail up alongside of without trying to escape be fortunate indeed bob shouted back have narrow escape of being captured by ship of war near alonzo be only from cadiz with grain olive oil do think there be fear of rascally englishman trying to cut out with boat tonight not slightest bob replied confidently must never venture on that battery on shore must blow out of water must know very well must not have shadow of chance of taking out for even if captured battery must send to bottom in time oh be perfectly safe from frigate here spanish captain raised hat bob did same left side of ship well what doe say bob captain asked think be in luck time captain mistake how be that bob be from lima say so captain joe exclaimed simultaneously then be something like prize have got hide doubt chance be have lot of lead too maybe silver ah be getting one of boat in water hope be not coming off here if doe joe bob must meet at gangway take into cabin a come in will catch by throat gag bind then bob must go tell men to return to ship that captain be going to spend evening with that will take back in boat must be best thing must happen joe said for in way must get alongside without suspicion so must joe did think of yes hope be coming now saw however boat row to large polacre lying next to spaniard on other side remained there two three minute then rowed away towards mouth of harbour going to spend evening on captain observed be not surprised at that be likely enough have be six month on voyage from lima be unlucky though wish have come here well bob a have got best head among scheme do suggest for getting on board that craft think must carry out joe idea though in different way bob said must say have better get boat out put say twenty men on board be getting dark might lie down in bottom except six oarsman then must pull in towards mouth of harbour just a have done lay up somewhere under rock for couple of hour then row off again make for barque of course must think be captain returning then ten of men must spring on board ought to be able to silence men on deck before must give alarm directly ten men got out boat must row across to polacre a there be doubt captain went ashore with other must take in same way ought to be made lord high admiral of fleet bob will succeed if anything will only must be sure to put off again before spaniard do well joe have better take charge of expedition see however quietly be done there be almost sure to be shouting will take alarm at battery when make out three of suddenly getting up sail will be pretty certain that something be wrong will open fire on that of course must risk thing to be really afraid of be gunboat be sure to have couple of in port may be little time in getting out will come out wind have died away now land breeze be just springing up will hardly get off before gunboat can come to row lot of oar know must clap on sail on prize will hang behind bit tackle gunboat will see what gun there be on board prize may perhaps be able to lend hand that will see of course will take bob with to answer hail from two spaniard be careful when bring up ashore let men row very gently after once get away so a not to attract attention let take cutlass pistol if shot be fired battery must be sure at once there be mischief going on little shouting wo matter so much might be merely quarrel of course instant be on board will cut cable get up sail will remain on board barque joe bob will have command of party attack polacre have better take jolly boat pick out twenty active fellow tell to leave shoe behind le trampling noise there be better tell not to use cutlass unless driven to there be not likely to be above four five men on deck ought to be able to knock down bind almost before know what have happened in few minute boat be lowered manned rowed away for shore a soon a got well past ship men be ordered to row a quietly noiselessly a possible joe have brought with six strip of canvas handed to men told to wrap round oar so a to muffle in rowlock be done boat glided along silently keeping in middle of channel passed through passage between shore rocky island protects harbour then sweeping round stole up behind latter lay to close to rock so far so good joe said in low voice think sharpest eye must have seen now question be how long to wait here longer wait more of spaniard will have turned into bunk upon other hand there be saying how long captain will remain on shore there be heavy dew falling will help to send sailor below must think hour must be about right time don be not likely to be off again before that be distance up harbour to landing place must hardly have taken trouble to go ashore unless meant to stay couple of hour what time be now bob bob opened watch case felt hand be just quarter past nine well will move at ten joe said three quarter of hour passed very slowly bob consulted watch several time before minute hand got to twelve ten o'clock said at last oar have not be got in so boat glided off again noiselessly out through entrance there be light burning at stern of two spanish ship a guide to boat coming off when boat have traversed distance joe ordered oar to be unmuffled rowed straight for barque there be hail at approach man appeared at top of ladder a boat came alongside ten of men rose noiselessly from bottom of boat followed first mate up ladder a reached top joe sprang on spanish sailor seized by throat two sailor following thrust gag into man mouth bound arm laid down be effected without slightest noise other sailor have by time clambered up from boat scattered over deck group of seven eight spaniard be seated on deck forward smoking by light of lantern hung above fo'castle did not notice approach of sailor with naked foot latter sprang upon threw down bound gagged without sound save few short exclamation of surprise being uttered illustration found two spanish mate playing at card three four of sailor now coiled rope against fo'castle door to prevent being opened in meantime joe with two men entered cabin aft where found two spanish mate playing at card sudden apparition of three men with drawn cutlass took so completely by surprise that be captured without attempt at resistance be like rest bound gagged take helm halkett joe said then hurried forward have got asked a reached fo'castle man jack one of sailor said be there nobody on watch in bow sir not man very well now then to work cut cable thompson rest of let fall sail a have only be loosely furled when vessel came to anchor be done in very short time vessel began to move through water before light breeze be dead aft capture of polacre have not be effected so silently bob have allowed boatswain who accompanied to mount ladder first man at top of gangway have lantern a light fell upon sailor face uttered exclamation of surprise called attention of on deck a sailor swarmed up ladder shout of alarm be raised spaniard must not withstand rush of english who beat to deck before have time to seize arm noise however alarmed watch below who be just pouring up from hatchway when be attacked by sailor with drawn cutlass be speedily beaten below hatch secured over bob have posted with two of men at cabin door a officer rushed out on hearing noise be knocked down secured a soon a be effected bob looked round over side hurrah said barque be under way already get sail on lad cut cable while be being done bob mounted poop placed one of sailor at helm then turned eye towards battery astern heard shout have doubt that sound of scuffle have be heard then light appeared in several of casement just a sail be sheeted home polacre began to move through water rocket whizzed up from battery burst overhead by light bob saw antelope spanish barque two three hundred yard ahead with crew getting up sail rapidly minute later twelve heavy gun flashed out astern one after be pointed too high shot flew overhead one two passing through sail boatswain voice be heard shouting never mind shot lad look alive now then up with topgallant sail quicker get up quicker will be out of range battery higher up now opened fire shot did not come near then rocket after rocket be sent up battery astern again fired one of shot cut away main topsail yard struck deck abreast of foremast then tore through bulwark polacre be now making good way felt wind more a got farther from shore have decreased distance from craft ahead boatswain now joined bob upon poop have got everything set will draw now said be walking along well ten minute will be safe if knock away spar be fast craft mr repton be overhauling other two hand over hand have better bear away bit boatswain captain said be to scatter a much a must so a to divide fire right sir boatswain gave order to helmsman slightly altered trim of sail suppose can hing with broken yard boatswain sir matter much going pretty nearly before wind a be sail on foremast draw better so make much difference look out below shouted a there be crash above mizzenmast be cut in sunder by shot struck just above topsail block upper part came toppling down striking bulwark falling overboard lay aft lad out knife boatswain shouted cut away wreck be lucky be two foot lower said to bob must have brought topsail down must have be serious loss now main topsail be of use sprang to assist men when round shot struck almost carried off head bob caught at knife fell from hand set to work with men be lad cut away shouted sha' have many more of on board be good mile away now just a work of getting rid of wreck be accomplished one of men said a rocket burst overhead there be two of gunboat coming out of harbour sir have better close with others then bob said brig will engage when come up will be well beyond reach of battery before do now lad see what gun carry break open magazine get powder ball up must lend captain hand if can polacre mounted eight gun pounder in few minute be loaded battery continued to fire shooting be no longer accurate in ten minute ceased altogether craft have now closed to within hailing distance of brig hallo polacre captain lockett shouted what damage boatswain be killed sir bob shouted back have lost two spar in spite of think be sailing a fast a what gun have got eight fourteen pounder sir be loaded ready keep little ahead of captain shouted be going to shorten sail bit have got to fight gunboat a spoke heavy gun boomed out from bow of one of gunboat shot went skipping between two vessel directly after other gunboat fired shot struck quarter of brig then there be creaking of block a sheet be hauled upon a yard swung round came up into wind broadside be fired at two gunboat then helm be put down payed off before wind again gunboat ceased rowing for minute discharge have staggered for have not given brig credit for carrying such heavy metal then began to row again swivel gun of brig kept up steady fire on two of gun of polacre have be by time shifted to stern opened fire while first mate crew on board barque be also at work fortunate shot smashed many of oar of one of gunboat while stopped rowing in disorder brig be again rounded to opened steady fire with broadside gun upon a gunboat be now little more than quarter of mile away effect of brig fire aided by of two prize be very severe in short time spaniard put round rowed towards shore while hearty cheer broke from brig prize there have be no more casualty on board polacre fire of gunboat having be directed entirely upon brig a spaniard knew that if must destroy capture must be able to recover prize polacre be soon brought close alongside of brig have suffered much captain lockett be sorry to say have have six men killed five wounded have got dozen shot in stern be evidently trying to damage rudder beyond knocking cabin fitting to piece there be more harm done than carpenter can repair in few hour work have not be hit again have sir none of shot came near well examine paper have talk with officer made prisoner then come on board to report will want to go on board barque with see what be laden with bob went below two spanish mate be unbound be sorry senor bob said that be obliged to treat rather roughly see be in hurry there be time for explanation will be obliged if will show be captain cabin hand over ship paper manifesto what be name braganza where be from what do carry be from cadiz be laden principally with wine be bound for barcelona took in nicely senor who must have dreamt that be english when frigate chased under gun of battery thought be spanish a did bob said by time other spaniard have brought paper out of captain cabin bob ran eye down over bill of lading be well satisfied with result contained very large consignment of wine be going on board brig said a put paper together must ask to give parole not to leave cabin until return know whether captain wish to remain here will transfer to own craft well master bob what be prize captain asked be valuable one sir polacre be a see by paper only two

board here presently where be now be in cabin captain gave promise not to leave till return put man on sentry outside so a to make sure of well perhaps have better go back again now will shape course for gibraltar at once firing must have attracted attention of spanish war vessel there might be about must leave barque manifesto till morning a have lost boatswain will send one of best hand back with to act a first mate must get that topsail yard of yours repaired at once doe not matter about mizzenmast yard be of importance may meet with spanish cruiser outside rock may have to show heel yes will be glad of good man captain see know nothing about like giving order be very well getting on board knocking down crew when come to sailing be perfectly ridiculous giving order when men know that know anything about men know have plenty of pluck bob know that be entirely due to swimming off to spanish ship that escaped being captured before will obey willingly a far a can give order still of course do want somebody with to give order a to setting taking in of sail a soon a last gun have be fired three vessel have be laid head to wind when bob boat reached side of polacre be again put on course headed southwest keeping within short distance of other bob new first mate old sailor named brown at once set crew to work to get up fresh spar in place of broken yard men worked with will be in high spirit at capture have made news brown gave that polacre be laden with wine assured to of substantial sum in prize money before morning yard be in place sail set except for shortened mizzen ragged hole through bulwark forward polacre showed sign of engagement of evening before two three men be slung over stern of brig plug have be driven through shot hole over patch of canvas be nailed painted black nothing however must be done with sail be completely riddled with hole crew be set to work to shift of worst cutting away from yard getting up spare sail from below bob have put man on lookout to give notice if signal be made to from brig be quarter of mile ahead of polacre topgallant sail having be lowered after main topsail have be hoisted a be found that with sail set sailed considerably faster than brig presently man came aft reported that captain be waving hat from taffrail have better get up main topgallant sail brown run up to bob said sail be soon hoisted in quarter of hour be alongside brig craft sail like witch captain lockett said a came abreast of yes sir seems very fast be pity be rigged a be captain said be outlandish fashion if be barque rigged must be tempted to shift on board will leave barque alone at present mr repton curiosity must keep bit want to lose of breeze will keep right on a long a last if drop will overhaul barque be slowest craft of three joe lockett have stitch of canvas set to enable to keep up with others at noon large craft be seen coming off from land bob examined with telescope then handed glass to brown be frigate sailor said be same that blazed away at yesterday be brilliant think be sure be same chased yesterday quite sure captain lockett be evidently of same opinion a change be made in course be steering may a well speak captain again bob said polacre closed again with brig brown say be same frigate fired at yesterday captain lockett bob said when be within hailing distance yes there be doubt about want to lose time must stand out try speed with why sir because be afraid will want to take of hand frigate be always short of hand still may not a have got twelve men already away in prize ten in of craft think need be uneasy sir know captain of brilliant officer if like will keep polacre on side so that will come up to first will go on board speak to captain think then must interfere with very well mr repton will arrange so polacre have now taken place to leeward of other two vessel held on in order until frigate be within mile when fired gun across bow a signal for to heave to brig be now flying british colour prize british colour with spanish underneath at order to heave to be thrown up into wind frigate reduced sail a came up a neared polacre order be shouted boat alongside boat be already prepared for lowering four seaman got into rowed bob alongside frigate first person encountered a stepped on to deck be jim sankey who stared at in astonishment hullo bob what in world be doing here

did manage captain asked see brig have be cut up good deal about sail rigging mean to say that sailed right into cartagena why must have blown out of water did go in sir anchored outside port be not suspected because one of majesty frigate fired at a be going in consequence be don never suspected that be anything spanish trader why mean to say captain exclaimed that be brig flying spanish colour chased in under gun of cartagena yesterday be sir bob said smiling did very good turn although intention be not friendly be under spanish colour when made out struck that running gauntlet of fire for little while must be excellent introduction for to spaniard so proved brought up close to other two vessel have talk with captain of one of two captain went ashore after dark so put twenty men into boat rowed in to mouth of port waited there for bit then rowed straight out to ship thought of course be own officer returning so took by surprise captured pretty easily unfortunately there be noise made took alarm on shore however be under way before battery opened be rather unpleasant for bit got safely out two gunboat came out after brig beat off helped a well a must brig have five men killed have one there be several wounded well be very dashing affair captain said very creditable indeed hope will get share of prize money only count a hand bob said laughing be sure be a much a deserve

latter have related in full circumstance of capture of two prize said there be spanish ship of war sir somewhere off alicante at present be got up a merchantman took in thoroughly must probably have be caught if have not be for mr repton then related how bob have swum on board discovered supposed merchantman to be ship of war thank captain lockett will go in have look after be fortunate that told for if have seen lying at anchor under land might have sent boat in to cut out might a nearly did have caught tartar be uncommonly sharp young fellow that repton offered midshipman berth here when first came out refused by what say must be good officer lost to service must have made good officer sir have wit about so thoroughly be doing keeping spanish flag flying when came upon have ordered colour to be run down when suggested keeping up running boldly in to cartagena suppose ca spare few hand captain lockett well sir will be very short a be see have score away in prize have have six killed of wounded wo be fit for work for time mean to take two prize back with to england be valuable must not get anything like fair price for at gibraltar want to run risk of being picked up by privateer on way back so will convoy certainly sha' have man too many to fight gun when have put crew on board suppose not captain said well must do without then now a suppose want to be on way will not detain longer bob be sent for captain lockett have be telling that be mean of preventing getting into nasty scrape with spanish man of war mr repton consider there be great credit due to be pity did come on to quarterdeck must not have got chance then sir bob said well no know that must lad there be something in well goodbye will write tell admiral about know will be glad to hear of doings few minute later privateer prize be on way towards gibraltar while frigate be standing inshore again to search for spanish ship of war chapter rich prize in evening wind died away three vessel be becalmed captain lockett rowed to polacre examined prize then taking bob in boat rowed to barque well joe have made out what have got on board captain said when reached deck sir neither of officer can speak word of english have opened hatch be chock full of hide what there be underneath know come along bob will overhaul paper captain said going to cabin examined bill of lading here be sir bob said triumphantly two hundred ton of lead splendid captain exclaimed be prize worth having of course be stowed away at bottom then be filled up with hide be worth lot of money lead alone be worth six thousand pound at twenty pound per ton be there anything else bob yes sir there be fifty box doe say what be in say so bob perhaps be silver let ask officer spanish first mate be called down where be box bob asked what do contain be full of silver man said sullenly be stowed in lazaretto under cabin will have one of up look into captain said joe call couple of hand down trapdoor of lazaretto be lifted joe two sailor descended ladder with difficulty one of box be hoisted up weighs over two hundredweight be sure joe said illustration find box of silver in lazaretto box be broken open be found to be filled with small bar of silver be same size joe captain asked yes a far a can see captain took out pocketbook made rapid calculation then be worth between thirty two thirty three thousand pound joe why lad be worth forty thousand pound without hide hull be something like capture two men shook hand warmly best thing to do joe will be to divide box between three ship then even if one of get picked up by spaniard french will still be in clover think must be good plan joe agreed will do at once there be nothing like making matter safe just get into boat alongside row to brig tell to lower jolly boat send alongside will get of box up by time be back in hour silver be divided between three ship delight of sailor be great when heard how valuable have be capture how do divide bob asked captain lockett a be watching box lowered into boat ship take half said of other half take twelve share eight second mate six boatswain three fifty hand one share so may say there be eighty share if half of prize be worth twenty thousand pound man share will be two hundred fifty will be worth having bob though be great shame must not rate a officer want money bob laughed must have use for if have uncle have taken in hand be provided for yes understand that captain said if be not so must have proposed to crew that must agree to sharing same a second officer be sure must have agreed willingly seeing that be due to that be not captured ourselves in first place entirely to suggestion that must keep spanish flag flying run into cartagena that owe capture of prize oh must much rather not captain only came for cruise have be splendid one seems to be quite absurd must be getting anything at still will be jolly because will be able to make carrie gerald nice present with own money to send home to mr medlin family something to uncle too if can think of anything must like yes be very well bob for feel that be not fair however a really want money be well satisfied will say nothing

soon after daybreak passed europa point without having be seen by of spanish cruiser be greeted by hearty cheer from vessel anchored near new mole a brought up amongst with british flag flying above spanish on board prize a soon a morning gun be fired gate opened bob landed hurried up to sister husband be just partaking of early coffee hallo bob captain o'halloran exclaimed what back again why did expect for fortnight must have managed very badly to have brought cruise to end so soon well be very glad be back bob sister said have be fidgetting about ever since be away be a glad to see a sister can be gerald put in if have fidgetted when have only gone week can imagine what must have to bear before end of month must have have to move into barrack life must have be insupportable here be sure have said very little about gerald wife said indignantly carrie have not said much aspect have be generally tragic have taken slight interest in fowl there have be marked deterioration in meal remark have be frequently unanswered have got into sister anne sort of way of going upon roof staring out to sea sister be most estimable woman bob be last person who must deny must admit that have be little trying during last week carrie laughed well be only paying back little in own coin gerald what have brought back so soon bob heard of three day ago for gerald went on board brig be brought in a heard that be prize of antelope officer told about cruise up to when have left well there be much to tell up till then bob said except be well appetite be good there have be good lot since have come

setting out again in day two well let hear about bob husband said must see carrie be on thorn lest be going off again now that be satisfied may be able to listen to comfortably well really have adventure gerald have narrow escape from being captured by spanish ship of war ever so much stronger than be be got up a merchantman regularly took in anchored close to intending to board in dark thought must swim off reconnoitre bit before attacked of course saw at once what be cut cable be towed out in dark fired away at did do damage next day late in afternoon came upon brilliant chasing spanish craft into cartagena a have spanish colour up took for one of blazed away at why did pull down spanish colour at once bob never heard of anything so silly carrie said indignantly well see carrie be distance off be likely to damage much ran straight in anchored with rest under gun of battery outside cartagena seeing fired at of course never suspected be english then at night captured two vessel lying next to put out to sea battery blazed away at be not very pleasant till got outside range did not do very much damage two gunboat came out after brig beat back helped who be captain o'halloran asked be prize of course be in command of one hooray bob gerald exclaimed with great laugh while carrie uttered exclamation of horror well see second mate have be sent off in first prize there be only joe lockett so took biggest of two ship cut out captain put in command of men took other have boatswain with of course be man who really commanded in getting up sail sort of thing be killed by shot from battery be only man hit on vessel there be five killed on board brig in fight with gunboat fell in with brilliant on way back went on board must have seen how jim sankey opened eye when said be in command of prize be awfully good prize too can tell one got be laden with wine big one be barque from lima with hide two hundred ton of lead fifty box of silver about thirty three thousand pound worth just think of captain said be worth altogether at least forty thousand pound be something like prize be yes be what do think carrie propose that sell commission raise a much a can

three four small craft panther enterprise childers be kept at anchor day why one admiral must say be very much disappointed for everyone expected to see pretty nearly spanish vessel brought in yes captain o'halloran said have caused deal of talk can tell navy be furious there be sixty vessel laden with very thing wanted pretty well becalmed not more than mile off europa point with battery banging away at nothing in world to hinder panther frigate from fetching in town be out on hill soul who must get off duty at point there be admiral wasting whole mortal day in trying to make up mind if have heard bad language be used in relation to old gentleman must have made hair stand on end of course just a got dark ship of war started equally of course convoy got away in dark except six bit of prize be brought in in morning have heard since that be on purpose to protect valuable fleet that spanish squadron arrived before went away a did turn up squadron went off again have nothing to do

lockett said have not time to lose sail again afternoon captain say there be nothing to prevent going out now a spanish squadron may be back day might have to run gauntlet to get out if lost present chance so be not going to waste hour croft have already sold grain discharged hull be worth little captain have sold a stand to trader for two hundred pound expect have bought to break up for firewood

what besides bob went off into shout of laughter in others joined what be meaning of nonsense teddy carrie asked a soon a recovered composure be there anything in be pure invention be there anything in have be telling that there be twenty five thousand pound in to owner a much more to crew did captain vow declare that if have be for bob instead of going home to divide treasure up between man jack of must be at moment chained by leg in dirty spanish prison at malaga well what doe mean bob there be getting sense out of dr burke be exactly what told carrie anchored close to craft that thought be merchantman that meant to attack in boat swam on board in dark to see if be keeping good watch that sort of thing when got on board found be ship of war with lot of heavy gun prepared to take by

only thing have to do with be that happened to be idea to keep spanish colour flying let frigate keep on firing at idea turned out well of course if have not thought of somebody else must so there be nothing in at well bob may say what like doctor burke said be quite evident that captain thought there be good deal in think really gerald that mr o'halloran have good reason to feel quite proud of be not joking at when say that captain lockett really spoke a if considered that good fortune have have be very largely due to said hoped must have bob on board for cruise certainly will not go more with bob said indignantly if talk such nonsense about afterwards a if there be anything in swimming two three hundred yard on dark night in suggesting keeping flag up instead of pulling down when brilliant however came in two day later captain langton called upon mr o'halloran told that did so in order to acquaint with extremely favourable report captain lockett have made to of bob conduct that from what have said be evident that lad have shown great courage in undertaking swim to spanish vessel much promptness ready wit in suggesting device have deceived a well a spaniard captain langton told

relieving fleet scurvy have shown ravage continued extended a month went on hospital became crowded with sufferer third of force being unfit for duty while there be few be more le affected by a soon a became severe captain o'halloran wife decided to sell more vegetable sent whole of supply beyond what be needed for personal consumption to hospital during eight month only few small craft have managed to elude vigilance of enemy cruiser frequently for many week at time news of kind from without reached besieged small supply of fresh meat have during early part of siege be brought across in small craft from barbary have for time ceased altogether for moor of tangier have under pressure of spaniard broken off alliance with joined in consequence not only did supply cease to arrive english vessel entering strait be no longer able to anchor a have before done under gun of moorish battery for protection from spanish cruiser several time there be discussion between bob sister captain

leave note behind saying that be going to make attempt to get out bring back boat full of orange lemon be past seventeen now be old enough to act for think if thing be managed properly there be particular risk about will think over by tomorrow tell what plan have fixed on on following day bob told doctor that there be two plan first be to be lowered by rope down at back of rock be ever so much simplest of course there be difficulty about if rope be long enough of deserter have failed because rope have be too short must take care to get one long enough only fear be sentry know that there be lot of posted about there on purpose to prevent desertion quite so bob one be allowed to go along path after dark except on duty yes well other plan be to go out with party furnishes sentry down on neutral ground choose dark night manage to get separated from a march out then make for shore take to water of course if one must arrange to have officer with party in secret must make easy enough might be done way doctor said thoughtfully have quite made up mind to do thing bob have quite made up mind to try anyhow well if mean to try bob be just a well that must get shot at start have

behind for o'halloran saying have left one will know whether got down at back of rock swam across bay how have gone have tried to dissuade have made up mind to try seeing that if succeeds may save life of score of child really can not refuse to help well know captain antrobus said there certainly doe not seem much risk in going out a say must get tremendous wigging doubt if be discovered be known that have hand in must not mind risking that for sake of child take firelock repton sergeant must be sure to notice that there be extra man have better join just a set out will say word two to

captain antrobus turned to bob need not wait said go back to guardhouse mind how go bob saluted turned off leaving officer standing by sentry went distance back then walked down sand to water edge waded noiselessly into water oilskin bag be knew buoyant enough to give ample support in water when be breast deep let uniform cloak slip off shoulder allowed shoe to sink to bottom three cornered to float away doctor have advised to do if leave thing at edge of water bob will be thought that somebody have deserted then there will be lot of question inquiry have better take well out into sea with then let go will sink drift along under water if be ever thrown up will be far beyond line in way a whole of guard will answer to name when roll be called tomorrow one will ever give thought to drummer who fell in at last moment if one of doe think of will suppose that captain sent into town with report bag must have be great encumbrance have bob wanted to swim fast a be simply placed hand upon struck out with foot making straight out from shore did for ten minute then being certain that be far beyond sight of anyone on shore turned a nearly a must followed line of coast voice of sentry calling to other came across sea must make out light two in great fort at water edge be easy work water be a nearly a possible temperature of body felt that must remain for time in without inconvenience light in fort served a mark by must note progress hour after starting be well abreast of knew that current must be helping more than have expected must do hour began to swim shorewards a current might for aught knew be drifting somewhat out into bay when be able to make out dark line ahead of again resumed former course be just eight o'clock when guard have passed through gate have started hour later swam what seemed to very long time have mean of telling how time passed when thought must be somewhere about twelve o'clock made for shore be sure that by time must be at least three mile beyond fort a spanish camp lay principally near san roque at head of bay there be tent anywhere by seashore felt sure that must land now without slightest danger here then waded ashore stripped tied clothes in bundle waded short distance back again dropped in sea then returned took up bag carried up sandy beach opening dressed in complete set of clothes have brought with put on spanish shoe round turned up hat placed money in pocket scraped willow hole in sand put bag in covered then started walking briskly along on flat ground beyond sand hill kept on until saw first faint light in sky then sat down among bush until be light enough for to distinguish feature of country inland ground rose rapidly into hill in many place covered with wood hour walking took to one of looking back must see rock rising a judged from twelve to fourteen mile away soon found place with thick undergrowth entering lay down be soon sound asleep when woke be already late in afternoon have brought with in bag biscuit hardboiled egg of portion of made hearty meal then pushed up over hill until after hour walking saw road before be wanted sat down waited until became dark battalion of infantry passed along a sat there marching towards gibraltar two three long line of laden cart passed by in same direction have consulted map before starting knew that distance to malaga be more than twenty league that first place of importance be estepona about eight league from gibraltar that before siege large proportion of supply of fruit vegetable be brought to gibraltar from town starting a soon a became dark passed through estepona at about ten o'clock looked in at wine shop sat down to pint of wine bread then continued journey until taking quietly be in sight of marbella slept in grove of tree until daylight then entered town be charmingly situated among orange grove going into fonda tavern called for breakfast when have eaten leisurely strolled down to port taking seat on block of stone on pier watched boat a while walking down from fonda have passed several shop with orange lemon seemed to that must in respect be better for to get fruit here instead of going on to malaga in first place distance to return be that from malaga in second must probably be easier to get out from quiet little port like than from large town like question puzzled be how be to get orange on board where must reasonably be going to take presently sailor came up began to chat with be wanting boat senor have not made up mind yet said suppose be busy here now no time be dull usually do good deal of

nothing for to do here now to carry what fish fruit want at marbella across to malaga get poor price there to what used to get at gibraltar chance of turning honest penny by smuggling away few pound of tobacco a come back there be a much profit in a there be in sale of good one have to be very sharp for be always suspicious of boat coming back from there used to search so that must think one must

gibraltar men be silent prospect certainly seemed tempting one bob allowed to turn over in mind for few minute then spoke again now men will speak to frankly be just business be bent upon now have come out from gibraltar to do little trade in fruit be sad to see woman child suffering there be a told lot of money to be made out of now will make fair offer put boat head round now sail for gibraltar if wind help bit will be off rock by daylight when get there will give hundred dollar apiece be too much risk one of men said after long pause there be risk at bob said firmly will get in there tomorrow can start again a soon a becomes dark in morning will be able to sail into marbella who be to know that have be across to malaga a intended tell will give fifty dollar for fish can sell there yourselves will fetch quite that men still hesitated spoke together in low voice look here men bob said a took two heavy pistol from bag have come out from rock to do be going to do question be 'which do choose to earn two hundred fifty dollar for couple of day work to be shot thrown overboard boat be going there whether go in not want to hurt must rather pay two hundred fifty dollar fruit may save life of many woman little child be bound to do can make trip not just a please now think will be very foolish if agree for will make three time a much a offer thirty box of fruit that can take in there boat have got to go there now have got to take choice whether go in not how do know that will pay money when get there one of spaniard asked bob put hand into pocket there said there be twenty gold piece be hundred dollar be proof mean what say put into pocket will have rest when get there mind nonsense attempt at treachery if see smallest sign of will shoot down without hesitation now row will put head round men said few word in undertone to other guarantee that harm will come to at gibraltar that will be allowed to leave again yes promise that faithfully now have got to row good bit harder than have be rowing up till now must be past fort santa barbara before daylight boat head be round by time men began to row steadily at present hardly knew whether be satisfied not two hundred fifty dollar be to enormous sum risk be great be not that feared that suspicion must fall upon on return have often smuggled tobacco from gibraltar have high opinion of acuteness of authority what really alarmed be fear of being sunk by spanish british gun however saw that for present at rate have option to obey order of passenger possessed of such powerful argument a held in hand chapter welcome cargo after men have be rowing for hour bob felt slight breeze springing up from off land said may a well get up sail will help along bit sail be large one for size of boat bob felt distinct increase in pace a soon a men began to row again must make out line of hill against sky have therefore difficulty in keeping course be soon back opposite marbella light of must clearly make out little by little breeze gathered strength rower have comparatively easy work of a boat slipped away lightly before wind what do make twelve league from marbella to rock about that man replied if wind hold like will not be very far from rock by daylight be going along about league hour well stretch out to lad for own sake have fear of shot from santa barbara only thing be afraid of be that must be seen by spanish boat may be cruising round side before get under shelter of gun of rock fisherman needed no warning a to danger of being caught bent again more strongly to oar after have rowed two hour longer bob told to pull oar in have better have quarter of hour rest supper bottle of wine said have got own basket forward will take mine out of by side a passenger have paid for boatman have got very superior wine to that ordinarily drank after eating supper bread meat onion drinking bottle of wine be disposed to look at situation in more cheerful light two hundred fifty dollar be certainly well worth running little risk for why must make independent of bad weather must be able to freight boat with fish fruit to trade on own account be surprised at enterprise of young trader whom supposed to be native of gibraltar for bob thought that be a well that must remain in ignorance of nationality a might have felt more strongly that be rendering assistance to enemy did know that be english hour after hour passed wind did not increase in force on other hand did die away there be just enough to keep sail full take much of weight of boat off arm of rower men knowing outline of hill be able to tell what progress be making told bob when be passing estepona two three time there be short pause for men to have draught of wine with exception rowed on steadily will be near thing senor one of said towards morning current count for three four mile against if have be for must certainly have done a be be doubtful think be about mile off shore be not bob asked be about distance want to keep if there be cruiser be sure to be further out than a for santa barbara if see take trouble to fire at there be not much chance of hitting mark a mile away besides almost gun be on land side men made reply to thought of being fired at by big gun be much more alarming than of being picked up by cruiser of own nation although saw there might be good deal of difficulty in persuading authority that have taken part perforce in attempt to get fruit into beleaguered garrison daylight be just beginning to break when one of fisherman pointed out dark mass inshore somewhat ahead of be santa barbara said have already for time made out outline of rock bob gazed anxiously seaward must a yet see sign of enemy cruiser row away lad said wo see for time in half hour will be safe spaniard bent to oar with strength now from time to time looking anxiously over shoulder at fort rapidly daylight stole across sky be just opposite santa barbara when gun boomed out shot flew over head struck water quarter of mile beyond with yell of fear two spaniard threw at bottom of boat get up fool bob shouted will be safer down there than if be rowing if shot strike will be smashed up whether be rowing lying down if stay there will be hour before get out of range of gun while if row like men will get further further away minute be safe in quarter of hour be only however after threatened to shoot if did not set to work again that spaniard resumed oar when did rowed desperately shot from fort struck water short distance astern exciting fresh yell of agony from men there see bob said if have be sending faster through water must have hit ah be beginning from sloop out at sea be small craft bob have made out a light increased mile half seaward have changed course be heading in direction retaining hold of pistol bob moved forward put out spare oar set to to row shot after shot came from fort several from sloop boat at distance present small mark although shot went through sail none struck presently gun boomed out ahead of high in air shot fell near sloop at once hauled wind stood out to sea have got rid of bob said be mile half from fort now can take easy men wo waste many more shot upon indeed only one more gun be fired by spaniard then boat pursued course unmolested bob returning to seat at helm will be on lookout for a go back one of spaniard said wo see in dark bob replied besides a likely a not will think that be one of rock fishing boat have ventured out too far failed to get back by daylight once out of reach of shot from fort sailor laid in oar having be rowing for more than ten hour boat glided along quietly at distance of few hundred foot from foot of cliff be going to do bob asked take fifty dollar for fish sell for what can get for fisherman at once said must take fifty dollar for although have collected have be brought in by other fisherman amounting to five hundred pound in weight must not imagine that fish for must not have got more than ten dollar at outside at malaga must sell for fifty at gibraltar a rounded europa point there be hail from above looking up bob saw captain o'halloran doctor hulloa bob hulloa bob shouted back waved

carrie said thanks to egg vegetable be perfectly well when there be so many people really in want of orange must be downright wicked to eat merely because like in short time manola with two of child

artillery engineer asking to send list of number of woman child of noncommissioned officer private also of officer wife family to send with list here two orderly from regiment with basket have be down to town major got list of number of woman child in town when get return from regiment will reckon up total see how many there will be for think that of box hold about five hundred work of counting out orange lemon for various regiment townspeople occupied time be not until orderly have started with supply that bob sat down to tell story nothing must have be easier said when finished be easy enough a say bob doctor said required lot of coolness presence of mind event certainly turned out fortunately for took advantage of be always point nobody must have done better most people must have done worse have be wondering great deal since have be gone what plan must possibly hit on to get orange into boat how when have got in must manage to get here seems easy enough now have done be more creditable to for hitting on plan worked so well similar praise be given to bob when have again to tell story at governor so managed say to slip out with relief governor said yes sir have got military cloak hat still be curious that did not notice addition to party fancy must have have friend there that general be point must rather not say anything about be way did go out when took to water let coat float away for have be found might have be supposed that somebody have deserted wish must have brought in shipload instead of boatload of fruit mr repton will be of immense benefit to sick unfortunately there be scarcely person on rock be not more le affected if thirty box be multiplied by hundred must be none too much for need orange lemon did however for time have marked effect in checking progress of scurvy especially among child who came in for larger share than fell to sick soldier in month condition of in hospital indeed of many who still managed to do duty be again pitiable on th of october however of boat of fleet went out during fog boarded danish craft from malaga laden with orange lemon brought in cargo be at once bought by governor distributed beneficial effect be immediate case have few day before appeared hopeless be cured a if by magic health of whole garrison be reestablished heavy rain setting in at same time garden upon for month great attention have be bestowed came rapidly into bearing henceforth throughout siege supply of vegetable if not ample for need of garrison inhabitant be sufficient to prevent scurvy from getting strong hold again few day after ship with orange be brought in orderly came in to captain o'halloran with message that governor wished to speak to mr repton bob be out at time went up to castle a soon a returned be at once shown in to governor illustration bob receives commission from governor mr repton latter began after spirit showed other day will be glad to utilize service still farther if be willing will be very glad to be useful in work upon may think fit to employ sir wish to communicate with mr logie at tangier governor said be month now since have have news from at time last wrote said that emperor of morocco be manifesting unfriendly spirit towards that be certainly in close communication with spaniard have allowed ship to take more than one english vessel lying under gun of town own position be said little better than of prisoner for be closely watched still hoped however to bring emperor round again to side a have for year exercised considerable influence over if must grant interview mr logie thought that might still be able to clear up doubt of that spaniard might have infused in mind since letter have heard nothing from be ignorant how matter stand over there matter be important for although while enemy cruiser be a vigilant a at present there be little hope of getting fresh meat over from there be unable to give direction to such privateer others a may find way in here make difference to whether morocco port be open to not until lately when chased must run in there wait for brisk east wind then start after dark be fairly through strait before morning be very desirous therefore of communicating with mr logie be also anxious not only about safety of of several english family there among whom be of of officer of garrison who thinking that must be perfectly safe in tangier avoid hardship danger of siege despatched across strait by native craft came in when first port be closed thinking over appeared to that must be far more fitted than most for mission if must accept have already shown able to pas a spaniard must find that thing have gone badly in tangier that moor have openly joined spaniard might be able to get passage to lisbon in neutral ship to return thence in first privateer ship of war bound for port must of course provide with document requesting officer in command of such ship to give passage must such neutral ship come along must trust to to find way across to tarifa algeciras thence to manage in way must leave to own ingenuity to make way in disguise from that commission be very dangerous a well a honourable one a be englishman detected on spanish soil must almost certainly be executed a spy be ready to undertake commission sir be much obliged to for affording opportunity of being of service be irksome for to remain here in idleness when there be many young officer of own age doing duty in battery a to risk be quite prepared to run will be exactly such adventure a must choose very well mr repton then will send despatch evening together with letter recommending to british officer authority will be written on smallest piece of paper possible so that may conceal more easily now a to mean there be many of fisherman here must be glad to leave firing in bay have frightened greater part of fish away besides boat dare not go distance from rock have caused inquiry to be made have given permit to three men to leave rock in boat after to take chance of getting through enemy cruiser be likely to be very dark night have arranged with to take passenger across to tangier have given permission to take two others with know that there be many jew others most anxious to leave town before enemy begin to bombard men will doubtless get good price from two of to carry across strait will form idea for whether boatman be trustworthy if conclude that be can make bargain with with others to bring back direct authorize to offer hundred pound for doing so come up here at eight o'clock evening will have despatch ready for then will understand that if find moor have become absolutely hostile have difficulty in getting at mr logie be not to run risk in trying to deliver despatch a information will be able to obtain will be sufficient for without confirmation from after further conversation bob took leave of governor on return home carrie be very vexed when heard mission that bob have undertaken at first needed husband persuasion to prevent going off to governor to protest against why dear must make bob ridiculous surely be of age now to go own way without petticoat government have already gained great credit in affair with privateer in fetching in orange other day be far le dangerous here have only got to smuggle in there have to bring back something like ton of orange be great honour for governor to have chosen a to opposing idea be absurd will go round to major harcourt bob said mr harcourt be terribly anxious about daughter be sure will be glad to send letter over to carrie captain o'halloran said gravely have become sudden convert to opinion regarding expedition suppose that bob instead of coming back be to carry amy harcourt off to england must be terrible believe that mr logie a majesty consul must perform necessary ceremony before sailed bob laughed must doubt whether mr logie must have power to officiate in case of minor besides there be english church where banns must be duly published no think must put that off gerald amy harcourt be daughter of one of o'hallorans most intimate friend girl who be about fifteen year old be often at house with mother have suffered much from heat early in june parent have at time when spanish cruiser have somewhat relaxed vigilance sent across to tangier in one of trader be in charge of mr colomb wife of officer of regiment who be also going across for health intended to stay at tangier only for month six week mr colomb have become worse be when last news came across too ill to be moved major mr harcourt have consequently become very anxious about feeling being much heightened by rumour of hostile attitude of emperor towards english mr harcourt gladly availed of opportunity that bob mission offered will be glad indeed if will take letter mr repton be in great trouble about if anything must happen to mr colomb position must be extremely awkward know that mr logie will do best can for for aught know english there may at present be prisoner among moor need not say how bitterly father have regretted that let go yet seemed by far best thing at time for must get abundance of fresh meat food vegetable of course will see how be situated when get there be sure will give best advice can a to what be to knowing how be placed there can do literally nothing managed that fruit business so splendidly that feel very great confidence in be sure will be glad to do anything can mr harcourt if have be boy daresay must have managed something between see girl be different oh wo find difficulty with often tell be a much of boy at present a be girl amy have plenty of sense will tell in letter about going out to fetch in fruit for woman child be inclined to look up to very much already owing to share have in capture of spanish vessel be sure will listen to advice give well will do best mr harcourt bob said meekly have never have anything to do with girl except sister give advice always not by what say bob think always take mr harcourt said smiling well not quite always bob admitted woman be constantly afraid that be going to hurt something just a if boy have got no sense well will do what can mr harcourt be sure hope that will find right over there hope so too mr harcourt said will see captain colomb will be sure to give letter for wife will talk over with if think that have better go straight home if opportunity offer will tell amy to go with stay with sister at gloucester till siege be over then can come out again to will bring down letter myself at seven o'clock from bob went to dr burke have just come from house bob found sister in despondent state about assured have a many life a cat must only be considered to have used up two three of yet be safe for year to come hinted that have more to fear from rope than drowning shooting that made angry did good however be better for to be off thought most likely that must be coming round for talk so be going officially time well what disguise be going to take be have be thinking of what must recommend doctor well choice be not very extensive one can hardly go a be because if moor have joined spaniard must be arrested a soon a landed gerald tell that probably two of jew trader will go away with if so must say must not do better than dress in style there be many of rock scorpion talk spanish english equally well must say that have better take disguise be what be thinking bob said boatman will know have something to do with governor two jew will certainly know that belong to rock if find that moor have joined spaniard jew may try to get through by denouncing must say have better get clothes with can pas a spanish sailor fisherman there be almost sure to be spanish ship in there there be good deal of trade between tangier spain then again will want own clothes if have to take passage in neutral to lisbon so must say that have better go down to town get sort of trader suit fisherman at one of low slop shop then will go a trader to start with carry other two suit in bag will be very good plan bob be not likely to be noticed much when land there be always ship anchored there waiting for wind to carry out must be accustomed to sailor of sort of nationality in street however hope will find occasion for clothes after land own moor have always be good friend of ours emperor must know that spaniard be very much more dangerous neighbour than be can hardly believe will be fool enough to throw over will go down with to buy thing bob have difficulty in procuring clothes required at secondhand shop then took lot home with carrie have by time become more reconciled to what must not be avoided laughed when dr burke came in be like bad penny teddy burke be use trying to get rid of not least bit in world mr o'halloran fortunately know that however hard be upon mean what say do mean very much after be gone say to myself be only teddy burke ' think more of that evening at nine o'clock bob embarked on board fishing boat at new mole one of governor aide de camp accompanied to pas through guard order have be sent to officer in command of various battery that boat be not to be challenged be to show light from lantern a went along in order that might be known other two passenger boatman have be sitting there since before gunfire be glad enough when bob came down took seat in stern taking tiller rope oar have be muffled put off noiselessly when got past europa point found light breeze blowing at once laid in oar hoisted sail vigilant lookout be kept once twice thought made out hull of anchored vessel gave wide berth when morning broke be halfway across strait heading directly for tangier in six hour entered port there be dozen vessel lying in harbour four of be flying spanish colour one be dane other dutchman from time morning broke bob have be narrowly examining fellow passenger boatman came to conclusion that none of be to be trusted a soon a stepped ashore with bag in hand walked swiftly away passing through principal street be crowded with moor held steadily on without speaking to anyone until reached outskirt of town then struck off among hedge garden chapter bob mission a soon a found secluded spot stripped off clothes wore put on of spanish sailor then placing others in bag buried in sandy soil taking particular note of position in regard to tree surrounding object so a to be able to find again then turned to right skirted town till came down to seashore again then strolled quietly back to quay in passing by ship at anchor have noticed name of four spaniard after wandering about for short time entered wine shop seated at table near one at three spanish sailor sat drinking from talk learned that british be shortly to be turned out of tangier that town be to be given up to spaniard that british consul have day before be taken to sallee where emperor now be english in town have not yet be made prisoner be believed that must be seized handed over to spaniard without delay having obtained information bob saw that at rate for present might if chose appear in own character regretted that have buried clothes before knowing how matter stood however there be help for to go back again to place where have hidden did having put on own clothes went straight to consulate be large house facing port clerk be sitting in office understand mr logie be away bob said clerk looked surprised for knew whole of small body of british resident well must not understand how bob must have arrived be bearer of letter to from governor eliott bob said came across by boat landed two hour ago be in disguise not knowing how matter stood here have now ascertained that so far english be not prisoner not at present clerk said will come into house sir may be disturbed here in first place bob asked when be seated in inner room when do expect mr logie back what be real situation order be if can not see mr logie be to obtain a accurate statement a possible a to how matter be going on here a be important that governor must be able to inform vessel sailing from gibraltar east whether can can not put safely into moorish port of course know that vessel have be several time taken by spaniard while at anchor close to town might risk that if there be danger from moor if report last sent by mr logie be confirmed moor must be openly at war with must seize make prize of vessel anchoring danger must of course be vastly greater than of merely running risk of capture if spanish vessel of war happened to come into port where be at anchor of course be merely expressing view of governor be sorry to say clerk said that there be doubt moor be about to join spaniard in formal alliance against englishman be liable to insult a go through street however must not go for much by last week number of soldier rushed into office seized mr logie violently assaulted spat upon otherwise insulted acting a said by express order of emperor be now practically prisoner having be taken under escort to sallee at moment whole of british colony here may be seized thrown into prison if know what moorish prison be must know that must mean death to most of certainly must say to lady can not leave in neutral vessel strictest order have be issued against englishman leaving be in fact so far prisoner although nominally at liberty to move about town believe that greater part of moor regret extremely course emperor have taken many have come in here after dark to assure mr logie how deeply averse be to course for that sympathy of population in general be naturally with english in struggle against spaniard who have for time be deadly foe of moor unfortunately emperor have supreme power anyone who ventured to murmur against will must have head stuck up over gate in time so that sympathy of population doe not count for much how many english be there altogether hundred four made up list last week of course includes men woman child there be ten merchant most of whom have one two clerk rest of men be small trader shopkeeper of make living by supplying ship put in here with necessary few at ordinary time trade with rock in livestock dozen so keep store where sell english

position here be very precarious that emperor might at moment order english to be thrown into prison know that servant expect will be killed by populace have frightened mr williams nearly out of sens

hamber be wife of one of principal merchant be very kind offered to take in when mr colomb died husband life out of town mr logie have promised mr colomb that must look after until must send across besides mr hamber child be very ill with fever so brought here well will go consult bob said daresay clerk downstairs will send man with to show house mr hamber listened to bob account of mission asking question now again in straightforward decided way gave bob idea that be resolute sort of woman with plenty of common sense well mr repton said when have finished be difficult matter for anyone girl mother to form opinion upon remember hearing from mr colomb about going out bringing in fruit when scurvy be so bad two month ago have received news doubt from husband therefore seems to that must be very capable young gentleman with plenty of courage coolness fact that mr harcourt gave message a did regarding daughter show that have confidence in if girl be year two older must say must be quite out of question for to attempt to make way back to gibraltar under protection a be still mere child a posse mother confidence see that matter so much if be taken prisoner there be reason for supposing that must not be treated honourably by spaniard must have taken number of woman in vessel have captured lately suppose girl must be placed with must at rate be far better off in spanish prison than in moorish one besides really consider that life be in danger here after assault on mr logie be just a likely emperor may order to be massacred a thrown into prison might sell a slave a do at algiers there be saying think that if be in position of girl mother at gibraltar must say that be better for to run risk of capture with than to remain here where there be saying what may happen having confidence in honour young gentleman thank mr hamber have idea at present what plan will form may not see possible way of getting out if do will certainly attempt major harcourt belongs to same regiment a brother in law wife sister be great friend be why suppose have confidence in have known amy now for year half be very often at sister will take care of just same a if be young sister of own see how must go back tell mother that left here with thing in state be only hope may not turn out so badly a fear at worst moor will only hand over a prisoner to spaniard bob went back to consulate told amy result of conversation with mr hamber consider have taken responsibility off shoulder amy referred to mr hamber a lady knew best here be of opinion that if be mother must advise trying to get away with so now have only to decide how be to be done be if still wish to try certainly do girl said anything be better than waiting here expecting moor to rush in a did other day carry one off to prison kill one mr parrot be gentleman saw downstairs said that must stay here ordered room to be prepared for dinner be ready be sure must be terribly hungry bob remembered now that have have nothing to eat save biscuit on board boat piece of bread at wine shop since left gibraltar that really be desperately hungry amy have already have dinner sat by talked about friend at rock now said when have finished let have regular council of war be intention to get passage to malaga if must because know something of road back from there must not do that with why not bob because voyage be too long someone must be certain to speak to before got across a ca talk spanish cat must be out of bag directly if possible must manage to cross to tarifa be only few hour across to there even if go in open boat now that spaniard be friend with moor there ought to be difficulty in getting passage across there to algeciras of course ca go a be said looking at rather ruefully of course not said be not so silly a must think have better dress up like boy bob must be great deal best plan if must not mind bob said greatly relieved that suggestion came from be only thing can think of there did seem story one must invent to account for spanish girl being over here ship boy will be natural enough if asked question of course story will be that have be left behind here there must be lot of reason for might have be on shore vessel gone on without might have be sent ashore ill might have be left to nurse must be bad story what must do when get to other side must depend upon where land mean whether try to get straight in by boat to wait about until chance come once over there will have to pretend to be deaf dumb then can dress up a spanish girl of course peasant will be much more pleasant than going about a boy better in lot of way so if be must take bundle of thing with so that must have nothing to buy there be very well buying disguise for must never go into shop to ask for sort of girl clothes amy went off in fit of laughter at thought of bob having to purchase feminine garment be very well to laugh bob said be sort of little thing be so difficult to work in be easy enough to make general plan difficulty be to get everything to fit in will have talk with mr parrot in morning about boat will know what boat have be trading with rock what men to trust can talk to now if like girl said mr logie other clerk have top storey of house oh then will go up see at once sooner be arranged better if thing be in state that everyone say might all be seized imprisoned day bob went up at once to mr parrot room have long talk with clerk quite agreed that anything must be better than for young girl to be shut up in moorish prison did not see how be possible for to find way across to gibraltar many of fisherman be most courageous fellow have run great risk in taking letter from mr logie across to gibraltar suppose that blockade be very much more strict than be indeed fact that got through show that with good luck thing be possible enough be not difficulty strictest order have be issued that boat be to take englishman across to rock be to cross strait on pretence whatever that anyone evading law will be executed good forfeited to state be how be mr logie have be able to send letter for last month why none of merchant here have tried to get across to rock bribe must be sufficient to tempt boatman must mean not only death to if ever returned vengeance of authority must fall on relation here be afraid that there be nothing to be done way at there be three men who brought across morning bob said might be bribed to take back governor authorized to offer hundred pound own that like look must have difficulty in finding to begin with mr parrot said think hundred pound must be likely to tempt to run risk must not mind giving two hundred more bob said have got that money of own at gibraltar be sure if be necessary major harcourt must gladly pay a much more to get daughter back three hundred must be ample if must not run risk for hundred apiece nothing must tempt must say best plan must be to go down early tomorrow see if can find one of be likely to be loitering about by quay a have boat there question be be to be trusted know that have be sent out by governor that be here on special business may very well think that spaniard will give higher reward for than can give to be taken back will by time know of order against boat crossing might betray to moor if be going by of course must take sort of risk with young lady under protection must be different yes see that mr parrot rather than run risk must prefer being put ashore at spanish port by one of ship in harbour if give name of spanish merchantman who be here say fortnight ago story that be left behind owing to one of being ill must be so simple that there need be suspicion whatever excited tarifa algeciras must of course be best place a must only be on board few hour miss harcourt must very well pretend to be still ill weak must lie down in corner must cover up with blanket till got there once across so much mind even if be detected must simply be two fugitive from here trying to make way to gibraltar think there must be question of being spy must probably be sent to wherever keep english prisoner have taken in ship there must be nothing very dreadful in even for must probably be exchanged before long there have be several batch sent in to rock in exchange for prisoner taken in prize brought in by privateer well really think that must be best way mr repton a say there will be nothing very dreadful in detention for while with spaniard while there be saying what may happen here if like will send one of consulate servant out first thing in morning to inquire what port spanish craft be bound for when be likely to sail seldom stop more than two three day here most of be taking livestock across for use of spanish army though algeciras must be awkward place for to land at because if detected there must be more likely to be treated a spy still in busy place like one must notice couple of young sailor must be no great distance for to walk over to tarifa of village on strait how do propose to get in from there be what seems to great difficulty well got in before bob said think that there ought to be much difficulty in getting hold of boat if did must sail round point keeping well outside line of cruiser come down on coast other side of gibraltar so work along at night just a did before if found absolutely impossible to get boat of course must not with girl with try to swim across from head of bay to rock be what must have done have be alone so must then go to authority give up say that being afraid that moor intend to massacre english at tangier have come across with young lady who be daughter of officer of garrison to put into spanish hand knowing that there must receive honourable treatment till must be passed in at next exchange of prisoner think must be very best course to pursue unless find everything turn out just a must wish mr repton when bob came down in morning at once went into office below mr parrot told that one of spanish craft must start for algeciras at noon then must ask to send one of servant out to buy clothes such a be worn by spanish sailor boy mr parrot have own suit upstairs will go off arrange for passage across directly after breakfast will see to mr parrot said ship deck will be crowded up with cattle be small craft hear will take a many a can be packed on deck be alongside now taking in there be not much likelihood of attention being paid to companion amy turned little pale when bob told that attempt be to be made at once said bravely be glad there be to be waiting do so long to be out of town daresay will be little nervous at first will try not to show sha' be really frightened for know that will take care of a soon a breakfast be over bob changed thing went down to quay stopped at vessel taking cattle on board be polacre brig of about hundred fifty ton captain be smoking cigar aft while mate be seeing to storing of cattle went on board told story to captain be left behind in charge of cabin boy from esmeralda fortnight ago boy have fever captain thought might be infectious put ashore soon got well want to be taken across a friend live not many mile from tarifa will pay dollar apiece for passage captain nodded be on board by noon will not be minute later bob went ashore told amy that everything be arranged without slightest difficulty then went down to inspect clothes will do very well said except that be great deal cleaner than anything ever seen on spanish sailor canvas trouser will never do a be accordingly took ash rubbed well into canvas got grease from kitchen poured two three large patch over trouser be more like said shirt will do well enough there must be patch two of grease upon jacket smear of dirt of kind when have done to satisfaction took upstairs what horrid dirty looking thing amy exclaimed in disgust be clean enough inside child be quite new have be dirtying outside to make look natural must be dressed by half past eleven can tuck hair up under red nightcap must manage to dirty face neck hand really ought to have brown stain suppose be to be got will speak to mr parrot there be stain that know of mr parrot said know mr logie paint little think will find box of colour upstairs if mix vandyke brown in water paint with let dry on must think must do very well though of course must stand washing bob found paintbox soon mixed paint at half past eleven amy came into room laughing little shyly will do very well bob said encouragingly except that be great deal too fair clean look here have be mixing paint think wash of will make difference now sit down while colour will do capitally said when finished think when dry will be just about right shade for spanish sailor boy have got bundle be right now here be bag couple of black moorish blanket will bring mr parrot up to say goodbye have told servant said nothing to about must make such terrible fuss there must be getting away from must ask mr parrot to tell after vessel have set sail mr parrot pronounced disguise excellent said that must not have slightest suspicion that be anything what seemed to be amy felt very shy a sallied out with bob gained courage a saw that one noticed when arrived at brig cattle be nearly on board bob led way across gangway went up on to fo'castle there laid one of blanket down against stanchion wrapped amy in other so that face be almost hidden told to sit down close eye a if weak asleep then took up post beside in quarter of hour last bullock be on board gangway be at once hauled in hawser thrown off sail let drop in minute vessel be gliding away from wharf wind be nearly due west sheet be hauled in a be headed across strait be hour before sailor work be done several of came up on to fo'castle began twisting cigarette one at once entered into conversation with bob be boy ill said yes have be ill be better now must have be better if must have stopped few day longer be pining to get home wo have far to go when get to algeciras doubt will be able to get lift in cart will be bringing provision to camp talk at once turned on siege sailor expressing certainty that rock must soon be taken bob have moved away from amy a if to allow to sleep undisturbed by conversation there be brig running down strait at good speed one of sailor said when be half way across be nice breeze for bob looked at craft be about mile away by course be steering almost at right angle must come very near to there be something familiar in appearance looked at intently examining sail shroud then doubt became certainty a eye fell upon small patch in one of cloth of topgallant sail be antelope one of spanish shot have passed through topgallant sail a be only injury that sail have received bit have be cut out fresh one put in before sailed again from gibraltar be flying spanish colour heart beat fast must overhaul pas without taking notice of seeing that polacre be small one not likely to be valuable prize vessel approached other quickly course antelope be taking must carry length two behind spaniard bob hesitated whether to hail a came along if hail be not heard must of course be detected plan entirely spoilt with wind blowing straight across in bow must be by mean certain that hail must be distinguished suddenly to delight when brig be within hundred yard of polacre saw head come up while crew began to haul upon sheet exclamation of surprise alarm broke from spaniard a in minute antelope be running parallel with cable length to windward then porthole be opened eight gun run out spanish flag be run down british hoisted to peak summons to strike flag shouted to spaniard a latter carried only four small gun resistance be out of question spanish flag be lowered in obedience to gesticulation rather than word of officer on board english brig halliard be thrown off sail came down with run spanish sailor be frantic with rage swearing by saint in calendar bob have moved at once across to amy lie still amy be going to be captured by english ship be same privateer be in before make sign until come on board in fury that spaniard be in might stick knife into if knew be english brig have be thrown up into wind a soon a polacre sail have be lowered in three minute boat came alongside then joe lockett followed by dozen sailor armed with pistol cutlas scrambled on board now follow amy descending ladder bob made way along narrow gangway between line of cattle then mounted to poop well joe how be first mate of antelope started back in astonishment why bob repton exclaimed what on earth be doing here masquerading a spanish sailor be trying to get across to gibraltar said why be fellow bound for gibraltar in case have not got prize a fancied be fair prize joe be bound for algeciras be going to make way in from there a best must be right then what have got on board nothing beyond cattle vegetable expect be worth lot of money on rock well will be able to tell about thing bob will hail captain to send croft on board with dozen men to take charge here then will take on board have friend here bob said turning to amy who be standing timidly behind so must take with right joe said carelessly in five minute bob stood again on deck of antelope hearty greeting be exchanged between captain lockett before tell anything captain cabin be to have will tell why afterwards suppose will be old one yes be one spare cabin bob know why be in such hurry about will tell presently bob laughed led way below there amy said can go in there put on own thing again thought must be more comfortable for for not to know until be properly dressed in own clothes have brought frock of course yes thought have better bring one in case must be made prisoner be right when be dressed come upon deck will explain about before appear bob a briefly a possible told story to captain lockett joe who be much amused to find bob friend be young lady be coming out in quite new light bob a squire of dame wo laugh at now want to hear last news overhauled craft not so much to capture a to get last news there be report before started that moor be joining spaniard port be closed to what say confirms that be one of point wanted to know a must not tell whether must run in there safely be chased now a to getting into rock be cruiser active at present well there be lot of about think best plan will be to run in close to point hold on a if be going into algeciras in way wo suspect then when get right up bay haul across to town wind be in favour because will have to tack to work up bay if make pretty long tack wo suspect when start across until have got pretty well away with breeze there will be chance of catching before be under gun that seems hopeful enough at rate will try will send six more men on board polacre will want to be handy with sail will go give croft order have better keep ahead of for if be chased by gunboat can protect just a sail be again got up two vessel be under way amy harcourt came on deck be soon laughing chatting merrily with captain at four in afternoon rounded point polacre few hundred yard ahead flying spanish colour there be several spanish cruiser gunboat outside paid attention to movement beat up bay keeping close into spanish shore holding somewhat farther out at tack now captain lockett said when be within mile of algeciras will run out tack there be two gunboat in way see must take chance of go wave handkerchief from bow joe mr croft will be on lookout for signal two vessel held away on port tack a polacre approached gunboat sudden bustle be observed on board begin to smell rat captain lockett said topgallant sail for brig have be under easy sail to enable to hold place with polacre men be already at quarter port be opened gun run out just a gunboat nearest polacre finding hail for to bring to unheeded fired shot into brig head paid off poured broadside into two gunboat one of be struck amidships for minute there be great confusion on board then made for companion evidently in sinking condition several shot be now fired from fort though fell near brig be uninjured second gunboat did not venture to attack so formidable opponent hour later antelope prize dropped anchor off mole bob have already run down put on usual clothes amy be at once rowed ashore made way to major harcourt quarter delight of amy father mother a rushed into room be extreme bob did not enter with left to tell own story proceeded straight to governor to whom reported state of affair at tangier be bad news governor said however be extremely obliged to for valuable service that have rendered a have pleasure of before doing when brought in orange will place name in order of day for having a volunteer rendered signal service by carrying despatch at great risk across to barbary coast bob then returned home captain lockett have already be to house informed o'hallorans of arrival there see carrie bob said after sister first greeting be over there be nothing to have be so terribly alarmed about be because got through safely bob that there be danger sister replied be very foolish thing to do nothing will change opinion a to captain lockett tell brought amy harcourt back with dressed up a boy never heard of such thing bob idea of boy like not eighteen yet taking charge in way of young girl well there be nothing else to do carrie must see went to mr hamber who be mr colomb most intimate friend asked opinion a to what have better do advised to get amy away if possibly must do so ca see what difference make whether be boy girl seems to that people be always so stupid about sort of thing carrie laughed well never mind bob amy harcourt be very nice girl little too boyish perhaps suppose be natural being brought up in regiment be very glad that have brought back again will be immense relief to father mother mother have be here three four time during two day have be away be in way surprised at anxiety will be in here evening certainly to thank very well then will be round smoking cigar with doctor bob said be very glad to have be of use to to have got amy back again want to be thanked tell so hate being made fuss about so beyond warm grasp of hand on part of major harcourt two three word of hearty thanks on of wife next time met bob escaped expression of gratitude occurrence drew two family together more closely amy often came round with father mother in evening there be many little confidential talk between carrie mr harcourt be time before anxiety a to fate of english inhabitant at tangier be allayed be at beginning of december forced to remove to marteen few mile from tetuan abandoning house property be estimated at value of sixty thousand pound three day afterwards be handed over a prisoner to spaniard be then put on board ship taken to algeciras where be kept for nearly month prisoner on board ship be on th of january sent across to gibraltar next five month passed slowly heavily occasionally privateer other craft ran through blockade of spanish cruiser succeeded in getting into port of brought wine sugar of of garrison be extremely short occasionally few head of cattle other provision of be sold by public auction governor considering to be fairest way of disposing of on th of april great convoy under admiral darby entered port consisted of about hundred merchantman under protection of powerful fleet joy of garrison inhabitant be intense although among latter be mingled with certain feeling of uneasiness deserter have at various time brought in report must gibraltar be again relieved be purpose of spaniard to bombard town hope be entertained that so wanton act of cruelty must not be carried out for entire destruction of town must not advance in smallest degree progress of siege at quarter to eleven just a van of convoy came to anchor off new mole fort san philip opened fire upon town at signal whole of battery in fort line followed suit hundred fourteen gun mortar rained shot shell upon town gun of battery of garrison at once responded several of officer of th wife have come up to captain o'halloran to enjoy from terrace view of great convoy entering port be in highest spirit at thought of abundant supply must now be at disposal in belief that spaniard seeing that garrison be again amply provisioned must abandon siege have now lasted for twenty two month suddenly there came upon air deep sound of gun of san philip followed by prolonged roar a whole of spanish battery opened fire hum of shot must be heard followed by explosion of shell fall of masonry scream cry bombardment have begun at last captain o'halloran exclaimed greatest consternation reigned among lady several of have left child in quarter although barrack be so placed a to be to great extent sheltered from enemy fire from land side be still terribly anxious a to safety two of have like o'hallorans quarter in town husband of lady accompanied by captain o'halloran bob at once set out to bring child up to house be perfectly sheltered scene in town be pitiful one men woman child be flying in wildest alarm towards gate looking south thence out to hut that more prudent one have erected many month before near europa point shot shell be raining down while chimney portion of masonry fell clattering in street sick people be being carried out on door plank most of inhabitant be laden with what few article of value must snatch up at first alarm child be soon brought up to o'hallorans then for time there be nothing to do to listen to roar of artillery officer bob ascended rock to point near one of battery whence must command view of spanish line flash of smoke be bursting forth almost incessantly be answered shot for shot from english battery have already almost silenced san carlos battery mounted large number of mortar against fire of english gun be concentrated between one two o'clock spanish fire abated soon ceased altogether inhabitant took advantage of lull to hurry back to house whence removed lighter more portable article heavy store of now appeared many of have large quantity concealed be of course unable to take away discovery of store excited much indignation among troop inhabitant have be constantly representing a reduced to last point of hunger have frequently received provision from scanty supply of garrison soldier be exasperated on finding that time possessed great store of wine flour other article be hoarding to produce sell when price must rise to even more exorbitant height than have already reached at five o'clock enemy battery opened again firing continued without intermission night a several casualty have taken place in barrack quarter marquee be on following morning served out to officer whose quarter be exposed to fire be pitched near europa point a be also large number of tent for use of inhabitant considerable body of troop be kept under arm near northern gate in case spaniard must attempt to make assault under cover of fire five hundred officer men be told off to assist in work of getting supply up from wharf a fast a be landed from transport bombardment continued during whole of next two day mortar still poured shell upon town gun be now directed at battery fire be remarkably accurate on th unloading party be increased to thousand men strong detachment of troop be told off to extinguish fire in town a enemy be now discharging shell filled with composition burned with great fury igniting everything with came in contact troop engaged upon duty be not long in broaching cask of wine found in such abundance in many of ruined house for two year have be living almost entirely on salt provision wine have be selling at price vastly beyond mean be scarcely surprising then that must take advantage of opportunity store be practically lost for whole town be crumbling to piece beneath fire of enemy mortar be on fire in several place little if of liquor store consumed must in case have be saved however for time insubordination reigned troop carried off liquor to quarter barricaded there got drunk be two three day before discipline be restored up to time conduct of soldier have be most exemplary have borne prolonged hardship without murmur outbreak be due a much to spirit of revenge against inhabitant for hiding away great store of provision liquor with view to making exorbitant profit a from desire to indulge in luxury of have be so long deprived on th enemy fire be hotter than ever gun be withdrawn from battery a produced little effect upon spanish battery men working suffered good deal from besieger fire two officer be dangerously wounded in one of casemates of king bastion fire be so heavy around of barrack troop who must not be disposed of in casemates bomb proof be sent out of town encamped southward next day woman child who have gone with husband father into casemates be also removed placed under canvas gave incessant work to troop for there be level ground upon tent must be pitched a be therefore necessary to level ground into terrace be day before camp be ranged in anything like order day enemy sent out gunboat to harass merchantman be always driven back by gun of fleet on th besieger shell set fire to spanish church have be used a storehouse strong party be sent down to remove provision consisted largely of barrel of flour be carried up piled so a to afford protection to casemates have be frequently entered by enemy shot several men having be killed there proved valuable defence afforded moreover great amusement to soldier who whenever barrel be smashed by shell carried off content quickly converted into pancake until so many cask have be emptied that whole structure came toppling down on th shell came through arch of one of casemates killing two wounding four men in consequence good many more of troop be sent under canvas on th work of unloading greater portion of transport be completed admiral who be most anxious to take advantage of easterly wind be blowing to sail out of strait gave signal for departure many of merchantman whose cargo be consigned to merchant trader on rock carried back to england a merchant having place whatever in to store good for town be now almost entirely destroyed refused to accept transport with ordnance store be brought in behind new mole to be discharged at leisure while several collier be run close in scuttled so that cargo must be removed a required great many of inhabitant of officer wife family embarked on board fleet before left enemy fire still continued very heavy gun mortar boat on rd came boldly out opened fire upon working party who be stacking barrel store at south end of rock wife of soldier be killed several men wounded on th governor determined sternly to repress drunkenness still prevailed owing to soldier going down among ruin of town where occasionally discovered uninjured cask of wine order be therefore issued on day that soldier convicted of being drunk asleep at post marauding must be immediately shot on th convoy of twenty ship in charge of brilliant three other frigate came in from minorca where governor have ordered provision to be purchased in case convoy expected from england did not arrive arrival of ship largely added to store at disposal of garrison chapter cruise in brilliant while bombardment continued bob have be constantly occupied have time before put down name a volunteer for service if required several others who have similarly enrolled have be appointed to assist in looking after removal of soldier wife child to tent erected for to seeing to comfort there have also be in charge of body of labourer employed by governor in work of levelling ground transporting store captain o'halloran be constantly away on duty soon after bombardment began be found necessary to drive whole of poultry into lower part of house spaniard retaining only one room for own accommodation have not step be taken chicken must speedily have be stolen by marauder a in absence of captain o'halloran bob there be one to protect after issue of governor proclamation discipline be speedily restored there be longer occasion to keep under shelter bombardment be followed by heavy rain caused very great discomfort to troop water pouring in torrent down face of hill swept away newly raised bank brought down tent soldier having to turn out in wet a troop owing to heavy duty be only one night out of three in bed discomfort annoyance be very great great quantity of provision too be damaged a be stacked in open air with other covering than afforded by sail of collier be cut off used for purpose until end of month downfall of rain be incessant be accompanied with heavy storm of thunder lightning battery required constant repair labour of troop be very severe since departure of admiral darby fleet enemy appeared to have given up hope of compelling place to surrender by hunger convoy from minorca have not be interfered with on nd of may two native craft came in from algiers with sheep wine brandy unmolested by enemy cruiser enemy fire have never entirely ceased since commencement of bombardment now amounted to about fifteen hundred round twenty four hour gunboat generally coming out day sending missile into town battery latter being specially mark of enemy land gun reached even highest battery on rock through may june enemy fire continued dropping towards end of latter month to about five hundred shot shell day gunboat be specially annoying directing fire against south end of rock causing great alarm distress among fugitive from town encamped there occasionally directed fire towards house have escaped fire of land battery several shot shell fell near o'hallorans fortunately without hitting house volunteer have now be released from duty bob be free to wander about a pleased a since exploit in fetching in fruit have become known to officer in garrison be privileged person be able to enter of battery to watch effect of fire against enemy fort line often spent day on board brilliant at end of june frigate went away for fortnight cruise captain invited bob to accompany will expect great thing from mr repton a managed to capture fifty thousand pound worth of prize when be on board that privateer brig ought to put frigate into way of taking at least four time a much be easy to turn brig into anything captain langton there be making one of majesty frigate look other what be mere sight of topsail be enough to send spanish craft into port for three four day frigate sailed along coast keeping well out during day closing with land in evening two three small coaster be picked up by boat be scarcely worth sending into gibraltar on fifth day large barque be seen making in from south sail be made barque have weather gage crossing ran into shore anchored under shelter of battery must be prize worth having bob jim sankey said wonder what have got on board perhaps be like craft captured full of lead silver from lima think can tell what be full of bob who have be examining through glass have borrowed from third lieutenant replied how do mean can tell bob have not got bill of lading stuck upon broadside suppose have not jim can tell without well what have got on board have got very strong crew jim twenty four gun why how on earth did know that bob asked staring at friend in surprise because jim have be on board counted gun be craft swam off to nearly two year ago hunted for then know suppose have gone into one of port be can almost swear know whether there be better glass than on board if there be must be glad to have look through yet feel certain without that stern be of rather peculiar shape that stern gallery look a if be pinched out of instead of being added on particularly noticed that when be sailing with ca be mistaken about think captain ought to know then jim said will speak to mr rawdon be in charge of watch jim went up on to quarterdeck touched hat informed second lieutenant what bob have told mr rawdon went up at once to captain who be talking to first lieutenant examining barque battery through glass mr sankey have reported to sir that mr repton be very strongly of opinion that barque there be spanish ship of war boarded by night just after beginning of hostility told about sir spent two three day in looking for of course remember captain said have kindness to pas word for mr repton to come aft bob soon stood before captain mr rawdon tell that be of opinion that barque in there be disguised spanish sloop boarded two year ago yes sir be almost sure of must like to have look at through glass before speak with certainty captain handed glass be remarkably good one to bob be bob said after minute examination must swear to anywhere then pointed out to captain peculiarity have noticed can make out figurehead too said be saint though know what saint if notice sir will see that instead of standing nearly upright lean much more forward than usual remember captain saying looked a if be going to take header so with stern gallery there be possibility of mistaking captain again examined barque through glass yes notice point mention well be much obliged to for news be very important be thinking of cutting out tonight must have fallen into same error so nearly did in privateer bob bowed retired must have caught tartar mr lyon if have sent force be talking about to cut out think must have somehow hope so sir have have very dull time of with nothing to do to exchange shot occasionally with gunboat to get under sail now then to escort craft other into port navy have done much to boast of during siege have be very hard on being cooped up there in gibraltar while fleet over world be picking up prize fighting french spanish why have made enough prize money in last two year to pay for pipe clay powder yes feel that mr lyon have certainly be terribly out of luck that privateer mr repton be on board did more in week cruise than majesty ship in gibraltar have done in last two year must take craft inshore if can there be doubt be ably commanded for be so well disguised that never suspected for moment therefore there be not least chance of catching napping be formidable craft to cut out with boat even if have aid of battery there be doubt about sir think mr repton reported before carried twenty four gun heavy metal a far a can make out with glass battery mount twelve gun yes be number besides see dare not take frigate in nearer than mile mile quarter must be safer so that must not be of assistance beyond annoying battery with long shot seems to that there be only one chance what be sir must land strong party distance along shore make attack upon battery carry by surprise can make out hut behind suppose must have le than hundred soldier there perhaps hundred fifty if can drive off capture battery can open fire down upon ship at distance must fairly sweep deck with grape rest of boat must be lying ahead astern of a soon a battery opened must make dash for crew of barque must be so disorganized by fire of battery that must hardly be able to make very much of fight of seems capital plan sir only question be number of hand suppose send eighty to take battery must only have a many more to spare for boat attack on ship must leave with only hundred on board must think must carry fighting crew of two hundred at least spaniard be always very strongly manned must think must be about be long odds not too long think mr lyon at rate will try lay off land mr lyon then will go into cabin make arrangement there be much talk excitement among crew for general opinion be that captain must try to cut out craft lying under spanish battery navy have for long time be very sore at inactivity have fretted that attempt have be made to cut out spanish vessel across bay admiral have steadily set face against such attempt considering that benefit to be gained did not justify risk for have of small squadron be damaged sunk by gun of battery consequence must have be very serious a spanish gunboat must then have be able to carry on operation without check must have be next to impossible for vessel to run blockade information bob have given be soon known to officer be not long before permeated through crew added to anxiety to cut spaniard out for although prize money must be le than if have be richly laden merchantman honour glory be proportionately greater undertaking must be serious one prospect of danger be never deterrent to british sailor there be great satisfaction when presently became known that crew of whole of boat be to muster arm be inspected cutlass ground everything prepared be early in morning when spanish barque have be first discovered ten o'clock when frigate have sailed away from land a if considering spanish craft too strongly protected to be attacked when five mile away from land course be laid east under easy sail maintained same distance on coast plan of operation be that first lieutenant with thirty marine a many sailor must land at spot two mile from battery must make way inland come down upon position from rear hundred men in rest of boat must make for barque direct party be to act in two division under second third lieutenant respectively be to lie one to east other to west of barque remain there until gun of battery opened upon then be to row for at speed blue light being burned by division when be within hundred yard of enemy a warning to friend in battery who be then to fire round shot instead of grape frigate be to venture in a closely a dared anchor broadside on open fire at enemy jim sankey be told off to landing party bob went up to captain requested leave to accompany a volunteer see sir said may fall in with peasant be challenged by sentry a approach battery ability to speak spanish might be advantage must undoubtedly captain said well mr repton will be very glad to accept service at four in afternoon frigate head be again turned west at ten o'clock boat for landing party be lowered men taking place in rowed away for shore be two mile distant night be dark mr lyon have with pocket compass have before embarking taken exact bearing of battery from spot where must land be therefore able to shape course to point mile in rear strictest silence have be enjoined little body of sailor made way inland until came upon road running parallel with shore followed for about mile then struck off inland again country be highly cultivated with orchard vineyard orange grove progress be slow for have many time to cut passage through hedge of prickly pear at last reached spot where believed to be directly behind battery here there be path leading in direction wished to follow in quarter of hour made out light ahead of lieutenant halted men again repeated order have before received be to go straight at hut a approach be to break up into party of ten a already formed party be to attack one hut cut down who resist seize carry away arm never mind men if have once got arm can not trouble afterwards waste time directly have got firelock in one hut make for a soon a have be cleared out make for battery now let officer told off to command party fall in at head of ten men mr repton will keep beside to answer challenge be within fifty yard of hut when sentinel challenged who go there soldier of king bob answered in spanish with reinforcement for halt till call officer sentry said lieutenant gave word whole party dashed forward at run sentry hesitated in surprise for moment then discharged piece sailor gave cheer rushed at hut taken utterly by surprise spaniard at first offered resistance whatever a sailor rushed in indeed few of attempted to get out of bed blue light with one man in party be provided be lighted a entered arm be collected without moment delay be off again before spaniard be fairly awake to what have happened there be ten hut containing twenty men two three shot be fired a entered last two hut spaniard be overpowered in instant a be here vastly outnumbered officer be made prisoner ten men being placed over rest of force now carrying three musket ran down into battery sentry here threw down arm at once be allowed to go where pleased pile arm have captured lieutenant lyon ordered run ramrod down see if be loaded spaniard be not likely to rally if do can give hot reception now gunner break open magazine there load with grape by time drum be beating to arm in vessel below shot fired having given alarm light be seen to flash along deck in two minute gun be loaded opened with fire of grape upon deck of vessel be near enough to be distinctly seen by glare of blue light a first gun be fired answering flash came from sea a frigate also opened fire for five minute gun be worked fast then two light burst out in close succession ahead astern of barque cease firing grape load with round shot lieutenant shouted moment later loud cheer broke from sailor a by light in boat spanish ensign be seen to run up to peak of barque then at once to fall again to deck barque have surrendered now gunner spike gun lieutenant ordered then tumble off carriage be soon done now let man take one of musket throw rest of over parapet down rock be right now fall in sailor fell in marched back to hut spanish officer be placed in midst twenty men be told off to fire hut be soon done lieutenant waited until be well alight then gave order to march took coast road time for two mile then struck off to shore saw few hundred yard away lantern have be hoisted on one of boat a signal be challenged by boat keeper who have moored boat twenty yard from shore cheer broke out a answer be given grapnel be pulled up boat be soon alongside party embarking rowed out in direction where knew frigate to be a soon a be fairly out from shore saw three light have hoisted a signal in hour be alongside need not ask if have succeeded mr lyon captain said a boat came up for have seen that have not have many casualty hope only one sir one of marine have ball in shoulder there be only five six shot fired in one else have a much a scratch be truly glad to hear captain said have be most successful surprise think boat can have suffered either think there be shot fired at sir lieutenant said spaniard ran up colour dropped again directly boat showed light fancy must have suffered very heavily from fire see be almost under gun must have pretty well torn up deck will soon hear captain said boat be towing spaniard out will be alongside in few minute wind have entirely dropped now in short time spaniard be brought close alongside frigate mr rawdon came on board to report ship be san joaquin mounting twenty four gun with crew of two hundred twenty men sir casualty be very heavy men have just poured up on deck seems when battery opened captain first lieutenant fifty six men be killed there be forty three wounded have casualty flag came down just a got alongside then a far a be concerned captain said be one of most bloodless victory on record there will be death promotion time gentleman be sure wo mind that have be most admirably managed affair altogether be sure that will be appreciated by lord of admiralty will take command of at present mr lyon with crew now on board dr colfax assistant will go off with to attend to wounded will remain on board until get into gibraltar mr rawdon will be acting first can only say that hope will be confirmed frigate prize at once sailed for gibraltar on arrival there captain took pain by sending up larger yard by repainting broad white streak showing porthole to restore prize to proper appearance a ship of war must not get half so much credit for capture if took into portsmouth looking like lubberly merchantman captain said to mr lyon care about patching up shot hole in bulwark give appearance of having be taken after sharp action deck look almost like ploughed field will give fifty men mr lyon ca spare more than will do sir nothing smaller than be likely to interfere with if large frigate engaged must not have more chance with hundred men on board than with fifty in case will have to trust to leg of course if fall in with two three of enemy ship must run up spanish flag will find out if can from prisoner what be private number if hoist that spanish flag ought to deceive will get back to england if possible sir will of course take home report mr lyon be sure to give step think next day san joaquin sailed six week later sloop of war brought despatch to admiral among be letter from admiralty to captain langton expressing gratification at very able arrangement by have captured silenced spanish battery cut out sloop of war san joaquin anchored under gun without loss of life be said feat almost without parallel stated that have in accordance with recommendation promoted mr lyon to rank of commander confirmed mr rawdon in rank of first lieutenant third lieutenant becoming second senior passed midshipman mr outram being promoted to of third lieutenant change of importance have taken place at gibraltar during absence of brilliant except that governor have determined to retaliate for nightly annoyance of gunboat accordingly six gun be fixed at very considerable elevation behind old mole shell fired from reached enemy camp caused a must be seen from height great alarm confusion be determined that in future when enemy gunboat bombarded camp hut must retaliate by throwing shell into camp day after brilliant returned helena sloop of war with fourteen small gun be seen working in towards rock wind however be so light that scarcely moved through water fourteen spanish gunboat came out to cut off for time maintained gallant contest against odds seemed overwhelming although garrison gave up a lost when wind suddenly freshened sailed through opponent into port where be received with ringing cheer by soldier lining battery week after week passed in minor hostility there be constant exchange of fire between battery of enemy gunboat continued operation in return shelled camp fresh work be erected on side casualty took place almost daily troop inhabitant be now so accustomed to continual firing that went about ordinary avocation without paying attention to shot shell unless one of latter fell close at hand november came in in spite of heavy fire maintained by battery enemy work continually advanced towards rock when in middle of month be seen that new battery be being armed placed in readiness to open fire governor determined to take offensive accordingly after gunfire on evening of twenty sixth order be issued for grenadier light infantry company with th hardenberg regiment to assemble at twelve o'clock at night with party of engineer two hundred workman from line regiment for sortie upon enemy battery th th regiment be to parade at same hour to act a support to attacking party hundred sailor from ship of war be to accompany attacking party numbered rank file besides officer noncommissioned officer be exclusive of two regiment forming support attacking force be divided into three column at quarter to three in morning column moved out enemy picket discovered advance a soon a passed outlying work known a forbes barrier after firing fell back lieutenant colonel hugo column be in front pushed on rapidly entered enemy line without opposition when pioneer began to dismantle work hardenberg regiment central column attacked carried tremendous work known a san carlos battery enemy be unable to withstand for moment fierce attack of troop in very short time whole of advanced work be in hand leading corp formed up to resist attempt enemy might make to repel sortie working party began to destroy enemy work faggot dipped in tar be laid against fascines gabions in short time column of fire smoke rose from part of work occupied in hour object of sortie be effected train be laid to magazine troop fell back just a reached town principal magazine blew up with tremendous explosion enemy appeared to have be wholly confounded at sudden attack upon advanced work fugitive from created panic throughout whole army although main spanish line mounting hundred thirty five heavy piece of artillery be few hundred yard behind work attacked not single shot be fired at troop engaged battery continued burning for three day when ceased to smoke nothing heap of sand remained of work have cost enemy month of labour to erect be day before spaniard appeared to come to definite conclusion a to next step then large number of men set to work to reestablish battery thing fell into old routine again day shot be exchanged occasionally vessel made way in out being sometimes briskly chased by enemy gunboat sometimes passing in with little interference for by time spaniard must have recognized that there be hope whatever of reducing gibraltar by blockade there be great deal of sickness in garrison comparatively little of be due to scurvy for available corner of ground be now cultivated supply of vegetable if not absolutely sufficient to counteract effect of so long monotonous diet of salt meat be yet ample to prevent serious outbreak of scurvy recurring in february fresh activity be manifested among besieger vast number of mule be seen bringing fascines to work at end of march vernon store ship arrived few hour later four transport with th regiment under convoy of two frigate came in singular series of casualty be caused by single shot entered embrasure in willis battery took leg off two men one leg off wounded man in leg thus four men have seven leg taken off wounded by one shot casualty be caused by inattention of men to warning of boy who be looking out for shot there be two boy in garrison whose eyesight be so keen that must see enemy shot coming be employed in battery especially exposed to enemy fire to warn men to withdraw into shelter when shot be coming quickness of eyesight be altogether exceptional standing behind gun knowing therefore exact course shot will take be comparatively easy for quick sighted man to follow there be few indeed who can see shot coming towards in respect ear be far better index than eye person possessed of fair amount of nerve can judge to within few yard line that shot coming towards will take when first heard sound be a faint murmur increasing a approach to sound resembling blowing off of steam by express engine a rush through station at first keenest ear must not tell direction in shot be travelling a approach difference in angle becomes perceptible to ear calm listener will distinguish whether will pas within twenty thirty yard to right left must require extraordinary acute ear to determine more closely than angle of flight being so very small until shot approach almost within striking distance garrison have be trying experiment with carcass red hot shot carcass be hollow shot shell pierced with hole instead of being charged with powder to explode by mean of fuse by percussion be filled with fierce burning composition so upon falling will set on fire anything inflammable near red hot shot be fired by putting wet wad in over dry wad next to powder red hot shot be then run into gun rammed against wet wad gun fired in usual way carcass several time set fire to enemy work use of red hot shot be reserved for pressing emergency number of furnace be constructed in various battery for heating shot necessarily required considerable amount of time to bring to white heat news came in april that great preparation be making at cadiz other mediterranean port for fresh vigorous attack on gibraltar that duc de crillon who have lately captured minorca must bring twenty thousand french spanish troop in addition to at present engaged in siege that large fleet must also be present that principal attack must be made by mean of ship turned into floating battery protected by immense thickness of cork other wood on th of may ship began to arrive among be seven large vessel appeared to be old men of war large number of workman immediately went on board began to lower topmast confirmed news in respect to floating battery about time three store ship fortunately arrived from england with powder shell other store a there must be no longer doubt that attack be time to be delivered on sea face strong working party be employed in strengthening water battery in erecting line of palisade to prevent landing from boat in building furnace for heating of shot in battery also at time engineer began to drive gallery through rock facing neutral ground in order to place gun there work be carried on to end of siege battery thus erected be now among strongest of defence of gibraltar at end of month great fleet consisting of upwards of hundred sail entered bay anchored off algeciras nine ten thousand troop be landed from time scarce day passed without fresh vessel laden with store material for siege arriving in bay early in may twelve gunboat have be sent out in piece from england be completed launched carried one gun be manned by twenty one men six of drew crew from brilliant five from porcupine one from speedwell cutter craft have be specially designed for purpose of engaging enemy gunboat for convoying ship into port on th of june shell from enemy burst just at door of one of magazine of willis battery instantly blew up explosion be so violent that seemed to shake whole rock fourteen men be killed fifteen wounded great deal of injury done to battery strong party at once set to work to repair few day later french convoy of sixty sail three frigate anchored in bay from five thousand french troop landed at end of month duc de crillon arrived took command of besieger private letter be brought in by privateer have captured merchantman on way gave garrison idea of method in attack be to be made stated that ten ship be to be fortified six seven foot thick with green timber bolted with iron covered with cork junk raw hide be to carry gun of heavy metal to be bombproof on top with descent for shell to slide off vessel supposed must be impregnable be to be moored within half gunshot of wall with iron chain large boat with mantlet be to lie off at distance full of troop ready to take advantage of occurrence that mantlet of boat be to be formed with hinge to fall down to facilitate landing there must by time be forty thousand men in camp principal attack be to be made by sea to be covered by squadron of men of war with bomb ketch floating battery gun mortar boat etc that comte d'artois brother to king of france with other great personage be to be present at attack at time enemy fired little garrison be able to turn whole attention to strengthen point most threatened activity of enemy on offensive work on neutral ground continued in one night strong lofty work five hundred yard long with communication thirteen hundred yard long to work be raised be calculated that ten thousand men at least must have be employed upon le than million half sandbag used in construction there must be doubt now that critical moment be approaching that ere long garrison must be exposed to most tremendous fire ever opened upon besieged place chapter floating battery in spite of unremitting work of daily cannonade of illness hardship life on rock have not be unpleasant to o'hallorans although many of officer wife have at one time taken advantage of ship sailing from port to return home rather to endeavour to do so for considerable number of vessel left be captured by spaniard before getting through strait there still remained sufficient for agreeable society o'hallorans be more than other house general meeting place from position in hollow be sheltered from fire of shore battery whose long distance shot searched lower part of rock while resource of establishment enabled o'hallorans to afford open handed hospitality must have be wholly beyond mean of others have long since given up selling of produce distributing surplus egg among family where there be illness sending up to hospital doing same with chicken vegetable greatest care be bestowed upon poultry fresh brood being constantly raised so that must kill eight ten couple week still keep up stock to full strength thus with gathering two evening week at own house usually a many at house of friend while captain o'halloran bob frequently dined at mess of own other regiment time passed pleasantly while carrie be fully occupied with care of house general superintendence of what called farm bob be never at loss for amusement there be always something to see fresh work being executed fresh development in defence while be on term of friendship with almost officer in garrison be two year half since have come out be now eighteen constant intercourse with people older than with officer of garrison together with exceptional position in found made in respect seem older than be still retained liveliness love of fun spirit never flagged be general favourite with who knew on th of august boat with flag of truce brought in complimentary letter from duc de crillon to governor informing of arrival of comte d'artois duc de bourbon in camp sending present of ice fruit partridge other delicacy governor returned letter in similar complimentary term thanking duke for letter present declining with thanks supply have be offered saying that never received for anything beyond what be common to garrison sailor of ship of war now pitched tent ashore for use when must be ordered to land to take part in defence heavy gun be for most part moved down from upper battery to sea line day after day passed bombardment being constantly expected damage inflicted by fire on enemy work by carcass delayed attack on th of september tremendous fire be suddenly opened with red hot shot carcass upon enemy work mahon battery be burned while san carlos san marten battery be so damaged that have almost to be rebuilt enemy a on previous occasion showed extreme bravery in effort to extinguish fire to repair damage be afterwards known that french troop alone have hundred forty killed wounded damage done probably convinced duc de crillon that advantage must be hoped for by trying further to increase work at half past five next morning volley of sixty shell be fired by mortar battery followed by discharge of one hundred seventy piece of heavy artillery tremendous fire be kept up for time while nine line of battle ship supported by fifteen gun mortar boat passed to fro along sea face pouring in fire upon at enemy gun ceased firing mortar kept up shell fire night next day ship of war renewed attack a did land battery in course of day brilliant porcupine frigate be scuttled by navy alongside new mole crew landed on following day enemy fire be principally directed against barrier chevaux de frise in front of land port in afternoon barrier palisade be in flame troop at end of rock got under arm in case attack must be made on morning of th combined fleet of france spain consisting of thirty eight men of war three frigate number of smaller craft sailed into bay anchored near algeciras fleet now consisted of forty seven men of war ten battering ship considered invincible carrying two hundred twelve gun innumerable frigate small ship of war while on land side be battery mounting two hundred heavy gun army of forty thousand men tremendous odds indeed against fortress whose garrison consisted of seven thousand effective men including marine brigade for day past bob have be engaged with landlord hired labourer in bringing in earth filling up lower room four foot deep in order to render cellar bomb proof bed furniture be taken below so that carrie servant spanish family must retire there in case enemy shell fell thickly round house be noticed a curious incident just a combined fleet entered bay eagle after circling round perched for few minute upon summit of flag post on highest point of rock omen of victory must have be considered decisive by roman did in fact help to raise spirit confidence of garrison on morning of th enemy battering ship got under way with gentle breeze from northwest at little past nine o'clock anchored in admirable order in line of sea face nearest be about nine hundred yard from king bastion most distant being about eleven hundred yard not shot be fired before enemy anchored then whole of battery commanded opened fire to battering ship artillery in line at once replied bob be standing on roof of house with sister what magnificent sight carrie exclaimed be well worth waiting to be here to see be terrible carrie said be like one great roar of thunder how awfully men must be suffering in battery suppose be a bad a look bob said at rate need be uneasy about gerald troop except working gun be in shelter wo be called out unless enemy attempt to land wonder fleet come across to help battery suppose be afraid of carcass red hot shot well there be one comfort carrie none of shot be coming way floating battery evidently be firing only at battery by water a to others know that be safe enough from though certainly shot do make most unpleasant noise a fly overhead wish there be little more wind to blow away smoke so that must see what effect fire be having on hulk must think that have begun with red hot shot yet take three hour to get hot enough a far a can see whenever wind blow smoke away little shot shell roll off roof side without doing damage to speak of about noon enemy mortar boat ketch attempted to come across assist battering ship wind have changed have worked round to southwest blowing smart breeze bringing in heavy swell so that be prevented from taking part in action own gunboat be hindered by same cause from putting out opening flanking fire upon battering ship northern battery by water suffered heavily from fire of spanish line took in flank indeed of battery in reverse causing many casualty artillery however refused to let attention be diverted from battering ship by two o'clock furnace have heated shot in battery although of have be firing missile for upwards of hour be not until two that use became general soon afterwards when wind cleared away smoke from ship men must be seen on sloping roof directing stream of water from pump upon small wreath of smoke curled up here there up to time defender have begun to fear that craft be indeed a invulnerable a spaniard believed to be evidence that red hot shot be doing work greatly roused spirit cheer frequently rose a men toiled at heavy gun a afternoon went on smoke from upper part of spanish admiral flagship rose more more thickly although number of men continued to bring up throw water over roof working with extraordinary bravery in spite of hail of projectile poured upon be clear that fire be making steady progress bob have long before gone down to work by sea face where considerable body of troop be lying in bombproof casemates in readiness for action if called upon from time to time went out with captain o'halloran other officer to see how matter be going on in sheltered place behind battery of surgeon be at work temporarily binding up wound of artilleryman struck with shell splinter after be carried by stretcher party of infantry up to hospital dr burke be thus engaged in battery where regiment be stationed have since first bombardment commenced ceased to complain of want of opportunity for exercising in professional work have be indefatigable in attendance on wounded among be immense favourite have word joke for man who came under hand while confident manner cheery talk kept up spirit of men be too very skilful operator many of poor fellow in hospital have urgently requested that if must lose limb must be under hand of dr burke be much better to make men laugh than to make cry must say to bob be battle gained when can keep up patient spirit be wonderful how of stand pain hard work have be doing be in favour bob several time went out to assisted a far a must by handing bandage sponge etc ought to have be assistant from beginning bob said by time must have be quite decent surgeon only have silly way of turning pale there hand that bandage all right man will have patched up in time think can go back to gun again will have to eat drink bit make fresh blood before will be much use at thirty two pounder again what be scalp wound splinter of shell eh well be lucky for lad that have be hardening skull bit before enlisted few clip from blackthorn be capital preparation think will come to much harm be not more hurt than must be in good lively faction fight there have better put down sponge bob go into casemate for bit be getting white again think be over worst now for if a tell smoke be beginning to come up from of floating battery fire will soon slacken bit a long a keep out shot defence of theirs be first rate a soon a shot begin to embed in roof be worse than nothing for can neither dig out shot get at with water once establish fire be pretty sure to spread bob be glad to get back again into bombproof casemates for there be comparative quiet while outside constant roar of gun howl of shot explosion of shell crash of masonry created din be almost bewildering presently cheer be heard in battery bob went out to see what be returned with news that ship next to spanish admiral be also smoking in several place a afternoon went on confusion be apparent on board several of battering ship by evening fire have slackened considerably before eight o'clock have almost entirely ceased except from one two ship to northward of line being somewhat farther from shore have suffered le than others at artillery in battery be relieved naval brigade taking place fire be continued without relaxation a soon a became dark rocket be fired by several of battering ship be answered by spanish men of war many boat rowed across to floating battery by ten o'clock flame began to burst out from admiral battering ship by midnight be completely in flame light assisted gunner who be able to lay cannon with a much accuracy a during daytime whole rock be illuminated by flame presently burst out vigorously from next ship between three four o'clock point of light appeared upon six of other hulk at three o'clock brigadier curtis who commanded naval brigade encamped at europa point finding that sea have gone down manned gunboat rowing out for distance opened heavy flanking fire upon battering ship compelling boat be lying in shelter behind to retire a day broke captured two of enemy launch finding from prisoner there be still number of men on board hulk rowed out to rescue while be employed at work at five o'clock one of battering ship to northward blew up with tremendous explosion quarter of hour later in centre of line also blew up wreck be scattered over wide extent of water one of gunboat be sunk seriously injured brigadier fearing other explosion ordered boat to draw off towards town on way however visited two of other burning ship rescued more of left behind landing in nine officer two priest three hundred thirty four soldier seaman besides one officer eleven frenchman have floated ashore evening before on shattered fragment of launch while boat in navy be thus endeavouring to save foe land battery have ceased firing on previous evening again opened on garrison a from of camp boat must be perceived at humane work order be despatched to battery to cease fire dead silence succeeded din have gone on for nearly twenty four hour of six battering ship still in flame three blew up before eleven o'clock other three burned to water edge magazine having be drowned by spaniard before left ship in boat garrison hoped that two remaining battering ship might be saved to be sent home a trophy of victory about noon one of suddenly burst into flame presently blew up other be examined by men of war boat found to be so injured that must not be saved be accordingly set fire to also destroyed thus whole of ten vessel be considered by constructor to be invincible be destroyed loss of enemy in killed prisoner be estimated at two thousand while casualty of garrison be astonishingly small consisting only of one officer fifteen non commissioned officer men killed five officer sixty three men wounded very little damage be done to work be supposed that smoke enveloping vessel prevented accurate aim chief object of attack be to silence king bastion upon two of largest ship concentrated fire while rest endeavoured to effect breach in wall between battery battery next to enemy have three hundred heavy cannon engaged while garrison have hundred six cannon mortar distance at battery be moored from shore be greatly in favour of effort of artillery a range be almost point blank gun did not require to be elevated thus necessity for using two wad between powder red hot ball be obviated gunner be able to fire much more rapidly than must otherwise have done number of spanish soldier on board battery ship be in addition to sailor required to work ship great activity be manifested by spaniard on day following failure of bombardment large number of men be employed in bringing up fresh ammunition to battery many of men of war also got under way major harcourt doctor burke two three other officer stood watching movement from o'hallorans terrace must have thought that have have enough of doctor burke said if battering ship must withstand fire what chance must men of war have see be just a busy on land side st have be ordered to send down extra guard to land port must have thought have given up a bad job time have doubt have given up doctor major harcourt said be not likely to say so just yet after preparation have be made certainty expressed about capture by allied army navy of france spain having two three royal prince down here to grace victory suppose be going to acknowledge to world that be beaten must have thought must have known human nature better than doctor will see de crillon will send pompous report of affair saying that battering ship be found owing to fault in construction to be of far le utility than have be expected that therefore have be burned have however inflicted enormous loss upon garrison defence siege must now be taken up by army fleet vigorously pushed to successful termination will be sort of thing must bet month pay last thing spanish commander will confess be that be beaten think likely enough that will carry on siege for month yet so a to keep up appearance in fact committed a be to see how can give up without making laughingstock of europe now that find have chance of getting object for went to war fancy will see before very long will begin to negotiate for peace major anticipation be verified for time siege be carried on with considerable vigour from thousand to twelve hundred shot being fired daily into fortress work on neutral ground be pushed forward attempt be made at night to blow out portion of face of rock by placing powder in cave attempt be detected position of garrison became more comfortable after british fleet arrived with two more regiment large convoy of merchantman nothing of importance took place till on d of february duc de crillon sent in to say that preliminary of general peace have be signed by great britain france spain three day later blockade at sea be discontinued port of gibraltar again open bob repton however be not present at concluding scene of great drama satisfied after failure of bombardment that there must be no more serious fighting that interest of siege be at end took advantage of arrival of antelope in bay few day after engagement to return in to england have now be two year eight month on rock felt that ought to go home to take place with uncle have benefited greatly by stay in gibraltar have acquired spanish language thoroughly in other respect have carried on study under direction of doctor burke have employed much of leisure time with instructive reading mixing so much with officer of garrison have acquired good manner address have be present at most memorable siege of time have gained credit of having though volunteer name twice placed in general order for good service have landed school boy be now well built young fellow of medium height powerful frame have retained boyish frank good humour love of fun trust that will be back in england before long sister said to everyone expects spain will make peace before many month be over be likely that regiment who have gone through hardship of siege will soon be relieved so hope that in year two may be ordered home again there be great deal of regret expressed when be known that bob repton be going home for have always be ready to do act of kindness in power especially to child of whom be very fond be not forgotten that daring enterprise in going out alone to fetch in fruit have saved many of life amy harcourt eye be very red when went up to say goodbye to mother hour before sailed farewell be spoken with quivering lip antelope evaded enemy cruiser near rock made quick passage to england without adventure have made two three good prize up spanish coast before put into gibraltar on way home captain lockett therefore did not go out of way to look for more on arriving
