of cane followed sometimes by dead silence when recipient of blow be of sturdy spartan disposition more frequently by shriek cry that hathorn boy hated master be almost matter of course at same time be far from regarding a exceptional monster of cruelty for knew from friend that flogging prevailed almost everywhere accepted a necessary portion of woe of boyhood indeed in respect when not smarting under infliction be inclined to believe that lot be in comparison with of others fortunate one for whereas in many school diet be so poor bad that boy be half starved at hathorn if food be simple coarse be at least wholesome abundant mr hathorn in fact intended a quite believed with success to do duty by boy be sent to to be taught taught through medium then recognized a most fitting for

placidly ned seized mug of milk water took impatient drink of be there anything have better do for face asked father presently think anything can do ned will make presentable for next few day believe that raw beefsteak be best thing to put on eye be not such thing in house if there be think must be justified in wasting for purpose must say next best thing must be to keep cloth soaked in cold water on face will probably take down swelling to extent after tea ned repaired to kitchen where abijah with much scolding commiseration applied wet cloth to face fastened handkerchief over to keep in place then boy went into little room father called study where used to read paper to follow doings of british army in field above to smoke pipe in quiet laughed a ned entered look like wounded hero indeed

light infantry must scatter like chaff irish rebellion thirteen year ago be vastly more formidable affair there may be said that whole country be in arm element of religious fanaticism came into play in spite of that resistance opposed to troop be absolutely contemptible however be just a well that did not see drill because now if by chance lad must die inquiry be made about there must be occasion for to allude to subject at must be able to say truthfully that finding that be hurt went off happened to come upon four men on moor brought to assistance promised to go up to see boy father suppose

wakefield then asked magistrate if must like to hear further witness a to state of thing in schoolroom said that what have heard be quite sufficient then addressed on merit of case pointing out that although in case one of party be master other pupil in way removed in eye of law from category of other assault in case said worship affair have arisen out of long course of tyranny provocation on

discharged client a have doubt will do at once will advise to apply for summons for assault against man hathorn magistrate consulted together for time then squire who be senior said be of opinion that master sankey by aiding rebellion against master have done wrongly that erred grievously in discharging heavy missile at master at same time think that provocation that received by tyranny have be proved to have be exercised by mr hathorn toward boy under charge especially by unjust punishment for offense complainant conceived without sufficient warrant indeed without warrant at that have committed to great extent justifies excuse conduct of master sankey therefore with reprimand a to behavior caution a to consequence might have arisen from allowing temper to go beyond bound discharge

punch head of boy who spoke so that have gone off to sleep in very short time stout ivy grew against wall fallen leaf on ground showed that have climbed down with assistance of stem why must have gone what on earth possessed to run away none must imagine news ran rapidly through other bedroom brimful of excitement went down when bell rang for prayer before breakfast list of name be called out by

lent money when must not repay according to promise to threatened to report case to be to prevent matter coming to ear that took thing let be warning to boy through life never borrow money never spend more than mean afford extravagance may seem to small fault see crime disgrace may follow upon think well over be lenient in heart to late schoolfellow be tempted see none of can tell what may do when temptation come unless have god help to enable to withstand to do what be right now let fall to at breakfast be strangely silent meal scarce word be spoken even in whisper came a shock to everybody there that after dictionary must have be taken by one of number that master kindness on occasion must have be requited by robbery seemed disgrace to whole school that mather too always loud noisy overbearing must have be thief be surprising indeed have be quiet little boy sort of boy others be given to regard a sneak there must have be le surprise that mather must do thing be astounding be probably first reflection occurred to boy a sat down to breakfast next impression be how good mr porson have be about might have given mother in charge have punished by law might have given terrific flogging public expulsion before school instead of that have sent quietly away seemed sorry for rather than angry with by time meal be finished there be probably not boy have taken inward resolution that there be nothing must not do for master although such resolution be generally transient mr porson found that good effect of treatment of mather be considerable permanent lesson be more carefully learned obedience be not perhaps more prompt be more willing boy lost opportunity of showing how anxious be to please in respect ned brother be not present when mr porson explained cause of mather absence to others be surrounded by schoolfellow eager to tell news upon arrival in playground few minute before school began before breaking up in june porson played first cricket match with strong village team beat handsomely although a boy said be to master bowling that success be due still eleven batted fairly made so long score that won in one inning mr porson promised that before season

marsden to meet increased demand upon teaching power mr porson engaged two usher of young men who have just left durham be pleasant gentlemanly young fellow a mr porson insisted that own mode of teaching must be adopted change did not alter pleasant state of thing have prevailed during past half year usher be fond of cricket one turned out to be at least equal to mr porson a bowler therefore boy looked forward to match with marsden with confidence captain sankey saw with great pleasure steady improvement be taking place in ned temper be not to be expected that boy must at once overcome fault of such long standing outburst be far le frequent be evident that be putting steady check upon so that father looked forward to time when must entirely overcome evil consequence engendered by unchecked undisciplined childhood chapter vii terrible shock ned have be looking forward with great anticipation to michaelmas day upon great match be to take place for be one of eleven being youngest

that mother be more uncertain in temper than usual abijah confided to in secret that thought thing be not going on smoothly between engaged couple be mr mulready have discovered to surprise indolent silly a mr sankey be in many respect be not altogether fool be keen enough where own interest be concerned have suggested something about settlement hoping that must at once say that be wholly unnecessary to surprise replied in manner showed that have already thought matter over have very fixed idea on subject of course said will be necessary know nothing about business be done before poor husband insisted that little fortune must be settled so a to be entirely at own disposal by mean suited mr mulready view hitherto want of capital have prevented introducing new machinery into mill competition with firm have already adopted be injuring seriously have reckoned confidently upon use of mr sankey four thousand pound although kept temper admirably under circumstance gave distinctly to understand in pleasantest way that arrangement be most admirably suitable in respect in case of lady marrying officer in army to whom capital must be of possible advantage be altogether unsuitable in case of manufacturer see love argued that be for benefit a well a mine that business must grow flourish by addition of new machinery little fortune of yours must purchase profit must be doubled trebled must look forward ere long to holding head a high a richest manufacturer at leeds bradford while mere interest in money invested in consols a at present must be absolutely useless to mr sankey acknowledged force of argument be firm in determination to retain hold of money so parted not in anger for mr mulready altogether disclaimed possibility of being vexed with sense that something like barrier have sprung up between went on for few day although subject be not mooted mr sankey felt that unless concession on part be made be likely that match must fall through have not slightest idea of permitting rather than must happen must have married without settlement at for really loved in weak way man who have be so attentive deferential to so one day subject be renewed at last understanding be arrived at mr sankey money be to be put into business in own name must not survive husband be to have option of paying money to child of allowing sum of eighty pound year from business must not survive mill be to be settled upon child might have after marriage must there be child be to be hers absolutely be only arrived at after several long discussion in of mr sankey protested that knew nothing of business that be most painful to to be thus discussing money matter that must be far better to leave in hand of solicitor to arrange in friendly manner with nevertheless stuck to view drove bargain a keenly shrewdly a solicitor must have done for to surprise exasperation of mr mulready have known that really loved must if have be driven to have sacrificed everything rather than lose must have obtained very different term having heart to speak of be ignorant of power possessed over bankruptcy stared in face unless must obtain increase of capital dared not by pressing point risk loss term told be not altogether unsatisfactory be not likely that must survive be of about same age have never known what be to be ill although not invalid a fancied be still not strong if did not survive must have whole business subject only to paltry annuity of two hundred forty pound year to three child if most unlikely thing in world did survive well mattered not jot in

porson guessing that such might be intention have talked matter gravely over with have pointed out to ned that absence must in first place be act of great disrespect to mother that in second place

together boy not a master pupil a two friend know boy how thoroughly have interest at heart if have other friend whom must consult must rather have given advice for there be more serious matter than to say anything might influence career of young fellow just starting in life terrible harm often result from well intentioned advice opinion carelessly expressed to young men by elder be matter few men be sufficiently careful about a know that have friend to consult ned a regard with more than interest may say with affection think must be well for to tell that there be in mind before take step may wreck whole life have be waiting for month in hope that must open mind to for have seen that be unhappy be not for to force confidence know that there be much to tell ned said wearily everything

treatment assume that doe not actively ill treat mother ned said with angry look in face 'd better not yes ned have better not doubt mr porson said soothingly what want to know what be essential must know if be to give advice worth having be what mean by ill treatment be rough violent in way with doe threaten with violence be coarse brutal ned said somewhat reluctantly be not that sir be always snapping snarling finding fault be bad ned doe not amount to ill treatment when man be put out in business thing go wrong with be unhappily too often custom to vent ill temper upon innocent person fancy from what hear know in little place like one business be more le known mr mulready have good deal to put out have erected new machinery dare not put to work owing a hear for have lain document before magistrate for having received threatening letter warning against doing so be very trying to man then ned will excuse saying that perhaps be somewhat tried at home be pleasant thing for man to have young fellow like in house taking up attitude of constant hostility say that conduct may may not justify will not deny that from first be prepared to receive a enemy rather than a friend heard story week ago in town emanated doubt from servant that have actually struck hit charlie sir ned exclaimed that may be mr porson went on gravely have doubt ned that considered then that consider now that be acting rightly in interfering on behalf of brother must question much whether in such matter be best judge unfortunately began with very strong prejudice against man took up strongest attitude of hostility to be prepared to find fault with everything said did put in position of champion of mother brother sister against under such circumstance be hardly possible that thing must go on well now suppose ned that idea have in mind in deciding to give up profession have chosen be that may remain a champion protector here yes sir ned said father told to be kind to mother happened quite so boy question be be being kind ned looked surprised that intend to be so ned be sure question be be going right way to work be championship that have taken upon increasing happiness be not ned be silent think that be ned mother must be really fond of man must not have married do think that conduces to comfort of home to see constant antagonism prevails between be not fact that ill temper under suffers be result of irritation caused to by attitude do not add to burden rather than relieve ned be still silent have so thoroughly persuaded that be protecting mother brother sister from mr mulready that have never considered matter in light doe mother take part yours in quarrel ned take part sir said ned indignantly very well ned that show in that doe not wish for championship that in eye trouble in house be in fact caused by must remember that when woman love man make excuse for fault of temper irritable mood sharp expression what call snapping snarling seem so bad to a do to third person especially when third person be partisan instead of adding to happiness by renouncing idea of going into army of deciding to remain here in position other to take care of a suppose be intention result will be just contrary a to sister think same thing must happen mother be certainly greatly attached to owing to changed habit for understand that be now far more active may say ned more sensible woman than before marriage see reason why lucy must not be happy with especially if element of discord mean be out of way a to charlie at worst think that must suffer from absence stepfather temper will be le irritable a charlie be away at school day have to prepare lesson in evening there be really slight opportunity for stepfather treating with active unkindness even must be disposed to do so did think boy that presence here must be likely to benefit family must be last person to advise to avoid making sacrifice of private wish to what consider duty upon contrary be convinced that line have with best intention taken up have be altogether mistake that stay at home doe vastly more harm than good that thing must go on very much better in absence be bitter mortification for ned who have hitherto nursed idea that be performing rather heroic part be sacrificing for sake of mother know fellow a do said sullenly at last ned know human nature know man must show at worst under such circumstance a in hare placed be painful to have to say be sure that have done harm rather than good thing will get on much better in absence believe be quite capable of killing ned said passionately if wanted out of way be hard thing to say ned even be so have reason for supposing that doe want out of way come sankey be sure have plenty of good sense hitherto have be acting rather blindly in matter have viewed from one side only with very best intention in world have done harm rather than good be convinced that when come to think over will see that in following out own father intention wish a to future career will really best fulfil last injunction will show truest kindness to mother give answer now take time to think over try see case from point of view think will come to conclusion that what have be saying although may seem rather hard to at first be true that have best go into army a have intended be sure in case will know that what have said even if seems unkind have be for good thank mr porson ned replied be quite sure of perhaps be right have be making fool of along anyhow will think over chapter xi new machinery be rather hard for lad who think that have be behaving somewhat a hero to come to conclusion that have be making fool of be result of ned sankey cogitation over what mr porson have said to perhaps arrived more easily at conclusion because be not altogether unwilling to do so be very mortifying to allow that have be altogether wrong on other hand there be feeling of deep pleasure at thought that must in mr porson deliberate opinion go into army carry out original hope plan heart have be set upon a long a must remember have be bitter disappointment to when have arrived at conclusion that be duty to abandon idea did not now come to conclusion hastily that mr porson view of case be correct one after fortnight consideration went down on new year day to school told master that have made up mind see sir said now

on evening of mr mulready death seems only too plainly to account for affair still without further evidence question if jury will find guilty be certain have rope when went out unless prosecution can

see tomorrow morning will tell of scheme on behalf be sure will be grateful be pretty certain that will not avail of if will come down tomorrow evening will let know exactly what say a mr porson expected ned although much moved at offer of humble friend to free by force altogether declined to accept be just like bill said ready to get into scrape to help must stand trial know that even if can not prove guilty can not prove be innocent still to run away must be acknowledgment of guilt be not going to do on day appointed ned be again brought up before magistrate examination be time in public justice room be crowded ned whose face be now recovering from mark of ill usage be pale quiet listened in silence to evidence proving finding of mr mulready body next witness put into box be one of engineer at factory proved that rope have be used in upsetting gig have be cut from one have short time before be using for moving portion of machinery have used rope about hour before mr mulready came back in evening be then whole after have be done with be thrown outside mill to be out of way a must not be required again after have given evidence mr wakefield asked did hear one outside mill when mr mulready be there sir heard nothing one might have entered yard suppose found rope yes gate be open a be at work must rope be visible to one who entered yard must not be seen plainly because be dark night one prowling about outside mill might have stumbled against have reason for supposing that be mr edward sankey who cut rope more than anyone else sir charlie be next witness boy be a white a sheet eye be swollen with cry glanced piteously at brother exclaimed with sob oh ned mind charlie ned said quietly tell whole story exactly a happened ca do harm old boy so encouraged charlie told whole story of quarrel arising in first place from stepfather ill temper at tea table brother meant nothing specially unpleasant in calling stepfather foxey mr wakefield asked sir have always called so even before knew that be going to marry mother be name believe men called ned got from believe that stepfather have received threatening letter have not yes sir several be afraid to put new machine to work because of thank will do mr wakefield said have letter in possession went on to magistrate be proof that deceased have enemy who have threatened to take life will produce now be hardly worth while mr wakefield though can be brought forward at trial may say indeed that have seen of already for be on account of letter that applied for military to be stationed here be not thought necessary to call mr mulready servant gave evidence a to what have heard of quarrel a to absence of ned from home night unless be in position to produce evidence mr wakefield proving clearly at time murder be committed prisoner be at distance from spot be prepared to commit for trial mr wakefield intimated that must reserve evidence for trial ned be then formally committed examination in way altered tone of public opinion general opinion be that ned have followed stepfather to mill intending to attack that have stumbled onto coil of rope idea occurred to of tying across road upsetting gig on return charlie evidence a to savage assault upon brother have created stronger feeling of sympathy than have before prevailed have line of defense be that smarting under injury ned have suddenly determined to injure stepfather by upsetting gig without idea of killing general opinion must have be that under such provocation a ned have received lengthened term of imprisonment must have be ample punishment more than one indeed be heard to say well if be on jury verdict must be served right still although there be greater sympathy than before with ned there be few indeed who doubted guilt after ned be removed from court be taken back by chief constable to house ten minute later be summoned into parlor where found charlie lucy waiting lucy who be now ten year old sprang forward to meet lifted for awhile lay with head on shoulder arm round neck sobbing bitterly while charlie clung to brother disengaged hand cry lucy cry little woman will come right in end lucy tear be not to be

where to go to then mr porson have talk with told that be of greatest importance must tell everything exactly word for word just a happened said one knew there have be quarrel that if did not tell everything must seem a if be keeping something back in order to screen must do great deal of harm that a really be not to blame in quarrel evidence must be in favor rather than against say knew that must wish to tell exactly what took place certainly charlie there be nothing must want hid be wrong to speak of a foxey to let fly a did about there be nothing intended to offend in because of course have idea that must hear only thing have to blame very much for be for getting into wild passion think one must say did wrong in going out of house after being knocked about so if have not got into passion have gone straight to bill to abijah to mr porson must have be best of to have stopped night must not have come upon let get into blind passion stopped in for hour be being punished for be natural that must get in passion charlie said stoutly think one must have got in passion think must charlie ned said smiling charlie replied then see be not way must have cried night then be not great

people be dead must never speak ill of want to lucy said did want to be fond of when be fond of charlie mother seems to be fond of mother yet doe nothing cry ca make out can ned did not answer mother infatuation for mr mulready have always be puzzle to must at present think of reply must be satisfactory to lucy constable now came in said that there be other visitor waiting to see ned then withdrew leaving lad to say goodby to brother sister alone ned kept up brave countenance strove to make parting a easy a possible for others be cry bitterly a went out ned next visitor be dr green mr porson have only minute two boy mr porson said for gig be at door chief constable be going to drive to york will go halfway sleep on road tonight be very good of a in way one will suspect that be pair of ordinary traveler keep up spirit boy have sent to london for detective from bow street to try ferret out something of mysterious business even if succeed have faith that will come right in end now goodby boy will see in fortnight for of course will come over to york to trial to give evidence a to character so will ned patient must get on without for day two doctor said mr wakefield be waiting to see have something to tell may help to cheer say be of legal value seems to important chapter xv not guilty a soon a mr porson doctor have left mr wakefield appeared well sankey hope be not downcast at magistrate decision be certainty that must have to commit a must not prove satisfactory alibi never mind think jury will find against on evidence have got especially in face of threatening letter fact that several men in mulready position have be murdered by luddite wo be much consolation to sir to be acquitted if ca be proved to satisfaction of one be innocent tut tut boy first thing to do be to get out of hand of law after that will have time to look about see if can lay hand on right man curious thing have happened today while be in court little boy left letter for at office here be ill written scrawl a see certainly important ned took paper on be written in scrawling hand sir maister sankey be innocent of murder of foxey doa want to put neck in noose if so be a find guilty in coort be going to hang will come forward say a how did bea agoing to let be hung for job loife for loife saes oi so tell to keep up heart there be signature to paper ned looked up with delight in face wo letter clear mr wakefield show that be not one else who did sankey pray cherish false hope on ground letter be valueless in legal way to to friend may be satisfaction can have effect on court there be nothing to prove that be genuine may have be written by friend of yours with view of obtaining acquittal of course will put in at trial can not be accepted a legal evidence in way still thing of sort may have effect upon of jury ned looked again at letter shade came over face now that looked at carefully recognized in moment bill handwriting have instructed by setting copy at time be laid up with broken leg bill have stuck to so far that be able to read write in rough way ned first impulse be to tell mr wakefield who have written note thought that might get bill into scrape be evidently written by friend solely to create impression in favor wondered that such idea must have entered bill head be by mean imaginative one a to young fellow having killed mr mulready did not even occur to ned for moment a seated by side of chief constable drove along afternoon ned turned over anxiously in mind whether must be honest to allow letter to be produced in court knowing that be only device of friend finally decided to let matter take course be innocent said to what have got to live for be to clear from charge mr wakefield said letter must not be of value one way other if be to say bill wrote might insist upon bill being arrested might find just a hard to prove innocence a do assize be to come on in three week ned be treated with more consideration than be generally case with prisoner in day when jail be terribly mismanaged mr simmonds have written to governor of prison asking that indulgence must be granted must be shown to ned mr porson have also before lad left marsden insisted on accepting sum of money must enable to purchase such food comfort a be permitted to be bought by prisoner able to pay for awaiting trial thus ned obtained boon of separate cell be allowed to have book writing material to have meal in from outside prison day however passed slowly ned be heartily glad when time for assize be at hand suspense be to come to end case came on for trial on second day of session on previous evening received visit from mr wakefield who told that mr porson dr green charlie have come over in coach with will be glad to hear that mother will not be called lawyer said prosecution suppose thought that must have bad effect to call upon mother to give evidence against son besides must prove no more than brother will be able to do if have called green must have given certificate that be confined to bed must not possibly attend however be glad did not call for absence of witness called against prisoner supposed to be favorable to always count against have clue a who did mr wakefield not shadow lawyer replied have have man down from town ever since have be away have done good went up to varley tried to get into confidence of cropper somehow suspected to be spy sent down to inquire into luddite business have pretty narrow escape of life be terribly knocked about before must get out of public house chased way down into marsden luckily be pretty good runner have advantage of having lighter shoe on than have must have killed to certainty lad can prove nothing simply take ground that did do that be threatened man unpopular with hand there be not shadow of proof against except fact that have ill treated just before be known to bear ill will ned said sadly yes of course be unfortunate lawyer said uneasily of course will make point of prof nothing most boy of age do object to stepfather of course will put to jury that there be nothing uncommon about oh think have strong case mr grant who be leader who be considered best man on circuit be convinced will get verdict what do people think at marsden mr wakefield do people generally think be guilty pooh pooh mr wakefield said hastily what doe matter what people think most people be fool question have to concern with be do jury think at rate with what think be proved mr grant say doe not believe jury must find guilty upon evidence will work up know be wonderful fellow for working up mr grant experience of jury turned out to be well founded ned a stood pale firm composed in dock felt that case be well nigh desperate when heard speech for prosecution long notorious ill will against deceased one of most genial popular gentleman in part of great county of yorkshire be dwelt upon evidence must be brought to show that even on occasion of mother marriage happiness of ceremonial be marred by scowl menacing appearance of most unfortunate ill conditioned lad how time after marriage young fellow have violently assaulted stepfather have used word in hearing of servant must only be interpreted a threat upon life indeed be not first time that boy have be placed in dock a prisoner upon former occasion have be charged with assaulting threatening life of schoolmaster although upon occasion have escaped consequence of conduct by what must now be considered a ill timed leniency of magistrate yet fact be undoubted undenied then counsel proceeded to narrate circumstance of evening up to point when mr mulready left house beyond point gentleman of jury counsel said nothing certain be known rest must be mere conjecture yet be not hard to imagine fact prisoner be aware that deceased have gone to mill be situated mile half from town will be told word prisoner used 'it will be turn next time when come will kill brute ' with word on lip with thought in heart started for mill what plan intended to adopt what form of vengeance intended to take matter not assuredly be with thought of vengeance in heart that followed that dark lonely road to mill once there must have hung about waiting for victim to issue forth may be that have picked up heavy stone may be that have open knife in hand while be waiting probably foot struck against coil of rope a will hear have be carelessly thrown out few minute before then doubtless idea of surer method of vengeance than of have before thought came into mind piece of rope be hastily cut off with prisoner stole quietly off until reached spot where two gate facing other on opposite side of lane afforded suitable hold for rope whether after fastening across road remained at spot to watch catastrophe have brought about whether hurried away into darkness secure of vengeance can not tell doe matter will understand gentleman that be not in position to prove detail of tragedy be telling theory of prosecution a to how happened murder be not generally done in open day with plenty of trustworthy witness looking on be seldom that act of slaying be witnessed by human eye evidence must therefore to extent be circumstantial prosecution can only lay before jury antecedent circumstance show ill will animus lead jury step by step up to point when murderer victim meet in spot at time when none seeing eye of god be upon case be a see exception to general rule have shown that between prisoner deceased there be what may be termed long standing feud came to climax two three hour before murder up to that fatal evening think will show that prisoner be wholly in fault that deceased acted with great good temper self command under long series of provocation upon evening temper appears to have failed will admit frankly that seems to have committed very outrageous brutal assault upon prisoner still gentleman such assault be justification of crime took place unhappily supply cause doe not supply excuse for crime duty in case will be simple will have to say whether not murder of william mulready be accounted for upon theory have laid down to on other must entertain doubt upon subject will be duty to bring in verdict of guilty if feel absolutely certain will of course give prisoner benefit of doubt evidence called added nothing to what be known at first examination two servant testified to fact of unpleasant relation have from first existed between deceased prisoner detailed what knew of quarrel charlie evidence be most damaging a have to state threat ned have

pleasant man to deal with did not at pleasant charlie replied heartily always snapping snarling finding fault be yes sir always now about threat of have heard so much on part of brother did impress much be frightened at did think that brother intended to kill stepfather sir be sure did just said in passion have be knocked about until must hardly stand just said first thing came into head like fellow do think that went out with deliberate idea of killing stepfather sir be sure only went out to walk about till got over passion just a have done before be way be when anything put out very much to go walk about till got cool again yes sir for defense mr simmonds be called produced threatening letter mr mulready have laid before stated that gentleman be much alarmed have asked that military force must be called into town that colleague have considered danger so serious that have applied for obtained military protection luke marner several of hand at mill testified to extreme unpopularity of employer among men said that must never have be surprised morning at hearing that have be killed dr green mr porson testified very strongly in favor of ned character be evidence produced mr grant then addressed jury urging beyond fact of unfortunate quarrel in deceased appeared to have be entirely to blame to have behaved with extreme brutality there be nothing whatever to associate prisoner with crime young gentleman before a have heard from testimony of gentleman of highest respectability bore excellent character that have fault in temper admitted such fault being result of lad having be brought up among indian servant dr green mr porson have told that have made greatest effort to master temper that believed that ordinary provocation must arouse after what did what have heard amount to simply lad mother have be married second time to man who bore outward reputation of being pleasant jovial man leading character among townsman popular fellow in circle in moved have be proved however by evidence of who knew best of workpeople servant of poor lad whom prosecution have placed in box a witness against brother that man life be long lie that smiling pleasant a appeared be tyrant petty despot in family hard master to hand cruel master in house what wonder between lad stepfather a there be love lost there be score ay thousand of boy in england who similarly hated stepfather be to be said that if of men came to sudden violent death boy be to be suspected of murder in present case although be not in position to lay finger upon man who perpetrated crime need not go far to look for have not heard that be hated by workpeople evidence have be laid before to show that be marked man that have received threatening letter from secret association have a be notorious kept south of yorkshire indeed that part of country be seat of manufacture in state of alarm so imminent be danger considered that magistrate have requested aid of armed force at tame murder be committed there be soldier actually stationed in mill besides strong force in town for protection of man from enemy counsel for prosecution have given theory a to action of prisoner believed that theory be altogether wide of truth be known that accident have taken place to machinery for mill be standing idle for day must be probable that deceased must go over late in evening to see how work be progressing a effort be being made to get machinery to run on following morning what so probable then that enemy of deceased know that have enemy who have sworn to take life must choose opportunity for attacking a drove to from town that enemy be prowling round mill a have be suggested to admit readily enough that stumbled upon rope that idea occurred to of upsetting gig on return that cut off portion of rope fixed between two gatepost across road that rope caused death of william mulready allow submit to that man who did be member of secret association be terror to land be terror of william mulready there be proof not even shadow not even shadow of proof to connect lad with crime be not speaking without warrant when assert conviction that be emissary of association known a luddite who have hand in matter for be in possession of document unfortunately be not in position to place before a be not legal evidence professes to be written by man who perpetrated deed who appears although obedient to behest of secret association of be member to be yet man not devoid of heart who say that if innocent young man be found guilty of crime will come forward confess that did therefore gentleman of jury there be reason to believe that slayer of william mulready be indeed within wall assuredly be not most unfortunate ill treated young man who stand in dock awaiting verdict to set free summing up be brief judge commenced by telling jury that must dismiss altogether from mind document of counsel for defense have spoken to a have not be put into court indeed must not be put into court be highly irregular improper for to have alluded must said dismiss altogether from mind duty be simple be to consider evidence before have heard of quarrel have taken place between deceased prisoner have heard threat used by prisoner that must kill deceased if have opportunity have to decide whether have in accordance with theory of prosecution carried that threat into effect whether on other hand a defense suggested deceased have fallen victim to agent of association have threatened life be bound to tell that if entertained doubt a to guilt of prisoner at bar be bound to give benefit of doubt jury consulted together for short time then expressed desire to retire to consider verdict be absent about hour on return foreman said in reply to question of judge that found prisoner not guilty perfect silence reigned in court when jury entered box something like sigh of relief followed verdict be expected indeed there be surprise when jury retired for general opinion be that whether guilty innocent prosecution have failed to bring home unmistakably crime to prisoner that might have committed be certain that have committed be probable be assuredly not proved that none other have be perpetrator of crime of person in court accused have appeared least anxious a to result received almost with indifference assurance mr wakefield who be sitting at solicitor table below rose to give that jury must not find verdict against expression of face be unchanged when foreman announced verdict be at once released from dock solicitor dr green mr porson warmly shook hand charlie threw arm round neck cried in joy excitement be all right suppose ned said a surrounded by friend left court must just a lief verdict have gone other way oh ned how can say so charlie exclaimed well charlie ned corrected be glad for sake lucy that be acquitted must have be awful for if have be hung be only for care verdict only mean that have not be able to prove guilty have got to go on living life knowing that be suspected of being murderer be not nice sort of thing know laughed drearily come come ned mr porson said cheerily must take too gloomy view of be natural enough that must do so now for have gone through great deal be overwrought worn out will pas off will find thing be not a bad a think be true that there may be not many hope who will be of opinion that verdict be like scotch verdict proven ' rather than 'not guilty be sure great majority will believe innocent have got doctor here on side be host in mr simmonds told when jury be out of court that be convinced be innocent opinion will go long way in marsden must hope trust that time will come when innocence will be not only believed in proved to satisfaction of by discovery of actual murderer ah ned said if ever find that out will be all right unless can do so will have dreadful thing hanging over life have scarcely reached hotel where mr porson doctor charlie be stopping when mr simmonds arrived have come to congratulate boy said shaking hand with ned can see at present verdict doe not give so much satisfaction to a to friend be natural enough have be unjustly accused have have very hard time of be naturally not disposed to look at matter in cheerful light give time boy time be everything be hard for that innocence have not be fully demonstrated have life before must hope that day will be triumphantly vindicated be what will live for in future ned said of course now mr simmonds there be end of idea of going into army man suspected of murder even if have failed to bring home to can not ask for commission in army know there be end to that mr simmonds agreed hesitatingly fear that for present plan have better remain in abeyance can take up again later on when matter be put straight may be never ned said decidedly so need say more about now boy mr porson said try eat lunch have just ordered post chaise to be round at door in hour sooner start better fresh air change will do good will have plenty of time to talk on road chapter xvi luke marner sacrifice not until have left york behind did ned ask after mother knew that if there have be anything pleasant to tell about must have heard at once silence of friend warned that subject be not agreeable one how be mother asked at last abruptly well ned dr green replied have be expecting question be sorry to say have nothing agreeable to tell be sure of ned said with hard laugh a have received message from from day be arrested guessed pretty well that doubt other people might feel mother be positive that have murdered husband fact be ned dr green said cautiously mother be not at present quite accountable for opinion shock have undergone have think unhinged mind worthless a believe to have be man have entirely gained affection have not risen from bed since died sometimes be absolutely silent for hour at others talk incessantly painful a be to tell so first impression that be responsible for death be one still remains fixed on mind be wholly incapable of reason of argument at time appears sane sensible enough talk of other matter coherently moment touch on topic becomes excited vehement have be great comfort to be sure will be to that old servant abijah have returned taken up position of housekeeper a soon a mother first excitement passed away asked if must like eagerly assented woman be in town having come over on morning after gave up to great relief at once consented to take up former position be great thing for sister who be of course entirely in charge a mother be not in condition to attend to anything be afraid at first that must not remain so indignant be at mother believing guilt when assured that poor lady be not responsible for what said that mind be in fact unhinged altogether by calamity overcame feeling be comic to see struggling between indignation at mother irresponsible talk consciousness that be necessary to abstain from exciting by contradiction dr green have spoken a lightly a must knew how painful must be to ned to hear of mother conviction of guilt how much must add to trial of position ned have listened in silence sighed heavily when doctor have finished abijah will be great comfort said quietly wonderful comfort a to poor mother will of course be trial still wonder that when heard say word when went out think that did however suppose that be part of punishment have thought anything of future plan ned mr porson asked after have driven in silence for distance yes have be thinking good deal ned replied time be shut up have nothing else to do did not believe that must find guilty of course have to settle what must do afterward if be only think must go away take name in case there must be chance of ever clearing for father sake for sake of charlie lucy must not throw away chance of that must be awfully against life if people must say of that brother be fellow who murdered stepfather perhaps will always say so now still be evidently duty to stay if be only on chance of clearing up mystery in next place feel ought to stay for sake of money matter think in present state of thing with luddite burning mill threatening master one must give anything like real value for mill now know that did not pay with old machinery be not one who must care to run risk of working with new by term of settlement be made before mother married again mill be now hers charlie lucy have nothing else to depend upon a be not capable of transacting business fall upon to take place intend to try for time at rate to run mill of course know nothing about a hand know work foreman will be able to carry on actual business of mill till master detail a to office business clerk will know about there be man who used to travel about to buy wool know mother husband have confidence in must go on just a before a to sale book will tell name of firm who dealt with suppose business with will go on a before at rate can try for time of course have quite made up mind that will have personal interest whatever in business may think that murdered mulready will not say have profited by death must suppose that mother can pay very small salary just sufficient to buy clothes so will go on till charlie get to age when can manage business a master then if clue have be obtained a to murder will be able to give up go abroad leaving with hope good business for lucy think be a good plan a mr porson said however there be occasion to come to sudden determination at present must advise change of scene thought before decide anything finally have brother living in london must be sure very gladly take in for fortnight show sight of london thank sir be very kind ned said quietly have got to face out at marsden must rather begin at once mr porson saw by set steady look upon ned face that have thoroughly made up mind a to part have to play that further argument must be of avail be not until postchaise be approaching marsden that further allusion be made to ned mother then doctor after consulting mr porson by various uplifting of eyebrow returned to subject ned boy be speaking little time ago of mother think be best must tell frankly that consider longer responsible for action tell in order that may not be wounded by reception since fatal day have not left bed declares that have lost power in limb of course be nonsense result be same keep bed a far a can see be likely to keep be perhaps le to be regretted a will thereby avoid being thrown into contact with for tell plainly such contact in present state of mind must only be unpleasant to be to meet must probably at least bring on frightful attack of hysteric in present state might be serious matter therefore boy must make up mind not to see for awhile have talked matter over with old nurse who will remain with mother a housekeeper with girl under will of course take place a master of house with brother sister with until mother be in position to manage if ever must be trust at rate that will ere long so far recover a to be able to receive a good son have ever be to thank ned said quietly understand doctor ned did understand that mother be convinced of guilt refused to see be what expected yet be heavy trial very cold hard looked a postchaise drove through street of marsden people glanced at curiously a saw ned sitting by side of men who be known a champion hurried away to spread news that young sankey have be acquitted hard look died out of ned face a door opened lucy sprang out threw arm round neck cried with delight at seeing abijah cry too greeted inside with motherly welcome feeling of relief came across mind a entered sitting room dr green who be one of trustee in marriage settlement have in inability of mr mulready to give order taken upon to dispose of much of furniture to replace with of entirely different fashion appearance parlor be snug cosy bright fire blazed on hearth comfortable armchair stood beside room looked warm homely ned two friend have

general dissent to ned view why did not tell when came home to breakfast yesterday charlie asked because thought be sure to hear sooner later saw hand in mill have got to know about somehow other be sure must soon get over place must rather must say if one asked that have not talked about to one be in way responsible for absurd story have got about have be talked about enough in marsden goodness know be disgusting that just a must think must be getting tired of subject here be something fresh for to begin upon again a be at tea servant brought in note have just be left at door be from mr thompson saying that in consequence of rumor be current in town must be glad to learn from ned whether there be foundation for must therefore be obliged if must call at eight o'clock evening colleague mr simmonds must be present ned gave exclamation of disgust a threw down note be there answer sir servant asked boy said be to wait tell to say to mr thompson will be there at eight o'clock that will do must be civil said to charlie a door closed behind servant to say that wish to goodness must let affair alone look to own when ned reached magistrate at appointed hour found that inquiry be of formal character besides two justice major browne who commanded troop at marsden be present justice clerk be there to take note mr simmonds greeted ned kindly mr thompson stiffly be one of who have from first be absolutely convinced that lad have killed stepfather officer who be of course acquainted with story examined ned with close scrutiny will take seat ned mr simmonds who be senior magistrate said have asked here to explain to meaning of certain rumor be current in town of attack upon mill will answer question that may ask ned said quietly seating while magistrate clerk dipped pen in ink prepared to take note of statement be case that luddite made attack upon mill night before last be true sir will please state exact circumstance there be not much to tell ned said quietly

quietly made statement then there be silence for minute two did really mean to carry out threat mr sankey certainly ned said must of course have be killed naturally ned said dryly must have be of great consequence to one else a country be lately about to take life at own expense must not greatly disapprove of doing so at own especially a lesson to luddite must have be so wholesale one that service of troop in part of country might have be dispensed with for time did recognize of men concerned be glad to say did not ned replied of be masked others be so far a must see among such crowd of face in not very bright light stranger to must not recognize of again be to see must not ned replied none of stood out prominently among others speak mr sankey mr thompson said a if sympathy be rather on side of men who must have burned mill probably have murdered than against sympathize with measure men be taking to obtain redress for what regard a grievance do sympathize very deeply with amount of suffering be undergoing from introduction of machinery high price of provision be not surprised desperate a be ignorant a be must be led astray by bad advice be there other question that wish to ask nothing at present think mr simmonds said after consulting colleague by look will of course forward report of affair to proper authority may say that although appear to take in very quiet matter of fact way have evidently behaved with very great courage coolness in manner most creditable to think however that ought immediately to have made report to of circumstance in order that might at once have determined what step must be taken for pursuit apprehension of rioter ned made reply rising bowed slightly to three gentleman walked quietly from room singular young fellow major browne remarked a door closed behind quite know what to make of think must have committed that murder be cowardly business although believe might have hand in desperate affair a indeed story have just told show must lay life must not do cowardly one agree with mr simmonds said though own have never be quite able to rid of vague suspicion that be guilty believe be so still mr thompson said to there be something almost devilish about lad manner manner be pleasant enough mr simmonds said warmly before affair of mulready be a nice lad a must wish to see till mother be fool enough to get engaged to man who by way never liked wonder manner be queer now so must yours be mine if be tried for murder though acquitted knew there be still general impression of guilt yes by jove officer said must be inclined to shoot be wrong mr thompson take word for that young fellow never committed cowardly murder think told mr simmonds that have intended to go into army have not be for affair well majesty have lost good officer for be just sort of fellow who must lead forlorn hope though knew breach be mined in dozen place be pity terrible pity chapter xviii ned be attacked a ned have foreseen resented affair at mill again made chief topic of talk in neighborhood question of guilt innocence of murder of stepfather be again debated with a much earnestness a have be when murder be first committed there be difference however whereas before have found few defender for impression that be guilty be almost universal there be now many who took other view one side argued that lad who be ready to blow two three hundred men into air be so desperate character that must not have be likely to hesitate moment in taking life of man whom hated who have certainly ill treated other side insisted that one with so much cool courage must not have committed murder in so cowardly way a by tying rope across road enemy have to traverse one party characterized conduct at mill a of captain of pirate ship other likened to of great deed of devotion told in history death of leonidas three hundred devotion of mutius scaevola have ned chosen now might have gathered round strong party of warm adherent for there be many who have have least encouragement must have be glad to shake by hand to show partisanship openly warmly ned did not choose doctor mr porson strongly urged upon that must show sort of willingness to meet advance many be anxious to make people be willing to admit that have be wrong ned really anxious to atone a far a can for mistake in assuming that be guilty now be time boy what believe today others will believe tomorrow be first step toward living down always said must come hardly ventured to hope that must come so soon ca do mr porson must if must if only for sake of others ca talk smile look pleasant when man know that mother lying at home think that be murderer how be to go about like other people have told over over again ned that mother be hardly responsible for action have never be very reasonable being be le so than ever at present make effort boy mix with others show at cricket match next week know boy be firm champion warrant people there will flock round make much of if will give chance ned must not did not went on way a before living a if marsden have existence for intent upon work at mill unbending only when at home with brother sister new friend cartwright be of course one of first to congratulate on escape mill have have of destruction be wondering what must do if came said be inclined to think be fool for not following example having of hand to sleep at mill plan be best be ready to allow be to say be best for one who be ready to carry out threat if driven to must be tell fairly if mill be attacked will fight will take chance of being shot must not blow up in cold blood suppose must have done so either in old time ned said with faint smile blood used to be hot enough good deal too hot think anything must get up to boiling point now so see if thing have to be done at must have be in cold blood by way sankey wish must come over one day next week dine with there will be one else there except daughter ned hastily muttered excuse oh be nonsense mr cartwright said good humoredly be not afraid of need be afraid of daughter be only child of fifteen of course take at estimate be disposed to regard a remarkable mixture of martyr hero to admire accordingly pooh pooh lad ca be living like hermit life at rate if make up mind to have few friend must be closer more intimate with know dine with porson green be not going to let keep at arm length must come else will be seriously offended so ned have resource left have to consent to dine at liversedge once there often repeated visit with kind hearty manufacturer be perfectly at home although at first be uncomfortable with daughter gradually became at ease with especially after have driven over with father to make friend with lucy again short time afterward to carry away for week visit at liversedge for ned be really grateful lucy life have be very dull one have friend of own age in marsden for naturally at time of mr mulready death intimacy with few acquaintance have in place have be broken off for few cared that child must associate with family among whom terrible tragedy have taken place charlie be better off for have friend at school boy at porson believed in ned innocence a point of honor in first place must have be something like reflection upon whole school to admit possibility of first boy being murderer in second ned have be generally popular among be best cricketer life soul of game never bullying putting down bullying among others with strong hand championship showed in shape of friendship for charlie at midsummer following mr mulready death have received invitation from many of to stay with during holiday have indeed spent that time on series of short visit among must have have choice have remained at home with ned for knew how lonely brother life be that only pleasure consisted in quiet evening ned must not hear of must go charlie for sake own change will do good if be to stop at home refuse to go out people must say that be ashamed to be seen that be crushed down with weight of guilt have got to keep up honor of family now charlie have proved failure be september now six month have elapsed since death of mr mulready getting in of harvest have made difference in price of food general distress be a great a ever people shook head said that there must be bad doings when winter with long night be at hand mill be flourishing under new management good turned out by new machinery be of excellent quality finish ned have more order on hand than must execute profit be large hand well paid contented ned have begged dr green other trustee of mother property to allow to devote considerable part of profit to assist during hard time of winter numerous hand in varley other village round marsden who be out of employment trustee said be unable to permit mr mulready absolutely refused to hear anything about mill to discus question connected with money therefore have resource to allow profit after deducting expense of living to accumulate until at rate lucy youngest of child came of age ned however be not to be easily thwarted quietly reverted to old method of giving out large quantity of work to men to be performed by hand loom in own cottage while still keeping new machinery fully employed there be indeed clear loss upon yard of cloth so made a have of course to be sold at lower price machinery have brought about still profit from mill be large enough to bear drain mean of support must be given to large number of family throughout winter ned told dr green what have done see doctor said be altogether beyond province mr lovejoy appointed a senior representative of family to manage mill of course can manage in own way a long a profit be sufficient to keep in position have hitherto occupied see that have reason to grumble be a obstinate a mule ned doctor said smiling be glad enough to let have way so long a be not clearly duty to thwart indeed know how poor people at varley at of other village must get through winter without such help be very glad hit upon plan got luke marner to draw up list of men who have family depending upon indeed find have be able to set pretty nearly loom in neighborhood at work of course will give employment to spinner cropper have made close calculation find that with profit mill be making will just be able to clear household expense winter after selling at loss cloth can be made in loom round at rate ned doctor said plan will be relief to in one way hitherto have never gone to bed at night without expectation of being awakened with news that have be shot on way out to mill at night fellow frightened away last month must have strong grudge against in addition to enmity against a employer will be safe enough in future can leave mill to take care of at night if like will have blessing of poor fellow in neighborhood may henceforth go where will by night day without slightest risk of danger be right doubt ned said though did not enter mind when took step only fear be that by helping for time might be injuring in future hand weaving spinning cropping be doomed nothing can save sooner men learn take to other mean of gaining livelihood better still price can give be of course very low just enough to keep from starvation must hope that ere long new mill will be erected in present hand worker will gradually find employment hardly le warm than satisfaction that announcement that sankey be about to give out work to hand loom excited in village round marsden be that abijah felt at news hitherto have kept to herself disapprobation felt at ned using new machinery have seen in own village suffering have be caused by change sympathy be wholly with luddite except of course when attempted anything against life property of boy strong in prejudice of class among whom have be born reared looked upon new machinery a invention of evil one to ruin working class have be deeply grieved at ned adoption of use nothing trouble in be must have compelled to keep opinion on subject to herself be main glad maister ned b'lieve now a may find out about other affair never have hope before war likely a thing must come about a wanted when be flying in face of providence by driving poor folk to starvation with noisy engine of yours war likely felt a be wrong to hope for said prayer night be reasonable to expect answer a long a mill be grinding men to powder think be a bad a abijah in ten year there will be twice a many hand employed a ever there be there be saying how large trade may not grow abijah shook head a if to imply belief that enlargement of trade by mean of new machine must be clearly flying in face of providence however be too pleased at news that hand work be to be resumed in district to care about arguing question even invalid upstairs took feeble interest in matter when abijah told that master ned have arranged to give work to score of starving people through winter a rule abijah never mentioned name to mistress for be always signal for flood of tear caused excitement agitation did not calm down for hour lately have noticed that mistress began to take greater interest in detail gave of what be passing outside spoke more cheerfully when lucy brought in work sat by bedside have even exerted sufficiently to get up two three time lie upon sofa in room be charlie who full of news have rushed in to tell about ned defense at mill have made comment whatever face have flushed lip trembled have be very silent quiet day altogether abijah thought that be mending dr green be of same opinion although setting to work of hand loom spindle relieved dire pressure of want immediately about marsden in other part thing be worse than ever that winter military be kept busy by many threatening letter be received by mill owner from king lud one day mr cartwright entered ned office at mill have heard news sankey have heard news in particular horsfall have be shot say so ned exclaimed yes have be threatened again again be over at huddersfield yesterday afternoon started from 'george on way back at half past five seems that friend eastwood of slaithwaite knowing how often life have be threatened offered to ride back with though horsfall laughed at offer rode off alone eastwood have horse saddled rode after unfortunately did not overtake about six o'clock horsfall pulled up horse at warren house inn at crossland moor there gave glass of liquor to two of old work people who happened to be outside drank glass of rum water a sat in saddle then rode off farmer named parr be riding about hundred fifty yard behind a horsfall came abreast of plantation parr noticed four men stooping behind wall then saw two puff of smoke shoot out horsfall horse started round at flash fell forward on saddle parr galloped up jumping off caught a be falling horsfall must just say who be ask to be taken to brother house be near at hand there be lot of people in road for be market day in huddersfield know folk be on way home so be soon put in cart taken back to warren house be found that ball have struck one in right side one in left thigh hear be still alive morning can not live out day be bad business indeed ned said be indeed horsfall be fine generous high spirited fellow be specially obnoxious to luddite whose doings be always denouncing in most violent way whose turn will be next wonder success of attempt be sure to encourage may expect to hear of more bad doings of course there will be reward offered for apprehension of murderer laborer saw a be hurrying away from plantation say must know again if saw fellow hang together so that doubt if will ever find out after mr cartwright have gone ned told luke what have happened hope luke that none of varley people have have hand in business oi hoape not luke said

stomach be full wish must stop ned said thoughtfully might get constable sent up to be present at meeting constable here be too well known if be to get one from place sight of stranger there must be so unusual that must put on guard at once besides a say must be very difficult to prove that expression applied to luddite although one may understand what mean one must have clear evidence in such case however hope will catch tripping one of day be fellow who ought to be punished not poor ignorant men who be led away by feeling of gratitude respect with ned be regarded by workpeople of district owing to action regarding hand frame did something toward lightening load caused by suspicion still rested upon although still avoided intercourse with of own station no longer felt pressure so acutely hard set expression of face softened somewhat though be still strangely quiet reserved in manner toward with whom business necessarily brought in contact no longer felt absolutely cut off from rest of kind ned have continued practice of occasionally walking up with bill swinton to varley on way to mill there be now little fear of attempt upon life by hand in neighborhood since failure on mill have incurred special enmity of men who have come from distance on occasion knew that night might be waylaid shot by be therefore safer to go round by varley than by direct road one evening when have be chatting rather later than usual at luke marner luke said oi think there be something ' t ' wind oi heerd at t ' cow evening that there be straangers village be at t ' dog oi think there be soom sort ov council there oi heers a be from huddersfield be headquarters o ' general lud in part however maister oi doa think a there be fear of attack on thy mill war too badly scaared noight vor

took work sat down to watch sleeper during night luke taking stick hat set off to guard mill till daylight ned woke first just a daylight be breaking felt stupid heavy with splitting pain in head tried to rise found that must not do so accordingly told george to go down in hour time to marsden to leave message at house saying that be detained must not be back to breakfast probably might not return that night doctor kept head enveloped in wet bandage day be on following morning able to go down to marsden although still terribly pale shaken appearance excited liveliest wonder commiseration on part of charlie lucy abijah told that have have accident have got nasty knock on back of head kept room for day two at end of time be able to go to mill a usual bill swinton be longer away broth jelly soon built up strength again in three week be able to resume work although be long before ugly scar on face be healed secret be well kept although in time truth of affair became known in varley never reached marsden ned escaped talk comment must have excited have be known what be worse official inquiry must have followed huddersfield men naturally kept own council have hastily buried dead comrade on moor although several of be so severely knocked about that be unable to go to work for time rumor of affair got about outside circle of conspirator need hardly be said that incident drew ned bill even more closely together than before that former henceforth regarded bill swinton in light of brother at end of christmas holiday mr porson brought home mistress to schoolhouse be bright pleasant woman having heard from husband particular of ned case did best to make feel that fully shared in husband welcome whenever came to house although ned be little time in accustoming to presence of one whom have at first regarded a intruder in little circle of friend feeling wore away under influence of cordiality kindness be not shocking said to husband one day to think that for nearly year that poor lad must never have seen own mother though be in house with still worse to know that think murderer do think must be of good if be to go see tell how wicked wrong conduct be dear mr porson said smiling think that course must be at likely to have good effect green tell that be sure that conviction have of ned guilt be deep terrible grief to think that weak silly a be have really strong affection for ned a well a for other child be because be so that feel so terribly what belief to be guilt suffers in way just a much more than doe in have business occupies mind prevents from brooding over position besides knowledge that few of be perfectly convinced of innocence enables to hold up have distraction nothing to turn thought from fatal subject green say have several time asked whether person must be tried twice for same offense after have be acquitted first time belief that fear be ever present in mind that fresh evidence may be forthcoming may unmistakably bring guilt home to have talked over with ned several time now take same view of a do idea of guilt have become sort of monomania with nothing save most clear convincing proof of innocence must have effect upon mind if be ever forthcoming may recover two may be brought together again at same time think that might very well call upon introducing by saying that a be friend of captain sankey of son be desirous of making acquaintance especially a heard that be such invalid have friend whatever be never very popular woman line one know have taken in reference to murder of second husband have set who must otherwise have be inclined to be kind against other people may be convinced of ned guilt see seems to one to be shocking that mother must take part against son accordingly mr porson called on first occasion when did so mr mulready sent down to say that be sorry must not see that state of health did not permit to receive visitor mr porson however be not to be discouraged first made friend with lucy when knew that girl be sure to have spoken pleasantly of to mother opened correspondence with mr mulready at first only wrote to ask lucy might be allowed to come spend day with next letter be on subject of lucy music girl have long gone to day school kept by lady in marsden music have be neglected mr porson wrote to say that found that lucy have taste for music that having be well taught must be happy to give lesson twice week that if mr mulready felt well enough to see must like to have little chat with on subject broke ice lucy backwardness in music have long be grievance with mother who a lay in bed listened to girl practicing below have fretted over thought that must obtain good teacher for in marsden mr porson offer be therefore too tempting to be refused a be necessary to appear to reciprocate kindness of lady determined to make effort to receive meeting went off well having once made effort mr mulready found to surprise that be pleasant to after being cut off for so many month from intercourse with world except such a gained from doctor two child old servant to be chatting with visitor who exerted to utmost to make agreeable talk be at first confined to ostensible subject of mr porson visit after be satisfactorily arranged conversation turned to marsden neighborhood many people have called upon mr porson a of be more le known to mr mulready visitor asked many question concerning invalid be soon gossiping cheerfully over family history personal peculiarity of neighbor have done world of good said when mr porson rose to leave never see one doctor be worst person in world for gossip ought to know everything somehow seems to know nothing will come again wo will be real kindness have taken so much interest in daughter that quite seems to a if be old friend so visit be repeated not too often for mr porson knew that be better that patient must wait long for coming now that ice be once broken mr mulready soon came to look forward with eagerness to change in monotonous existence for time ned name be never mentioned between then one day mr porson in careless manner a if have idea of state of relation between mother son mentioned that ned have be at house previous evening saying husband have wonderful liking respect for son be greatest friend though of course there be good deal of difference in age between know one of whom john think so highly mr mulready turned very pale then in constrained voice said mr porson have always be very kind to son then sighed deeply changed subject of conversation wife be doing patient great deal more good than have ever be able to do dr green said one day to schoolmaster have become quite different woman in last five six week be always up on sofa now when call notice that begin to take pain with dress again that know be always first rate sign with woman think must be able to go downstairs again soon be not for feeling about ned must not meet be sure see sign of change in quarter suppose mr porson replied last time mentioned name said bey son be most unfortunate young man subject pain too much to discus therefore if please mr porson must rather leave alone ' so be afraid there be chance of making progress there chapter xix attack on cartwright mill ned still slept at mill be sure that there be chance of renewal of attack by workpeople near assault might be again organized by party from distance murder of mr horsfall have caused greater vigilance than ever among military at of mill use of new machinery have be discontinued cropping by hand resumed be case at mill at ottewells

le determined there still resisted then went upstairs renewed firing from upper window fight have now continued for twenty minute fire of luddite be slackening supply of powder ball be running short determined resistance when have hoped to have effected easy entrance by surprise have discouraged several have fallen more be wounded at time soldier might be upon who have be forced by fear to join association formed small part of whole have long since begun to slink away quietly in darkness others now began to follow groan cry of wounded men added to discomfiture many eagerly seized excuse of carrying away to withdraw from fight gradually firing ceased shout of triumph rose from little party in mill at failure of attack defender gathered in lower floor think be gone now ned said will go

usual in morning large reward be offered for information must lead to apprehension of concerned in attack a well a notice offering two thousand pound for apprehension of murderer of mr horsfall met with response score of men must have known who be concerned in affair fidelity to cause fear of consequence of treachery kept silent mr cartwright be anxious to offer handsome reward to mary powlett for service have rendered ned told that be sure must not accept anything mr cartwright however insisting on point ned saw mary sounded upon subject be indignant at idea master ned said must not take money not ever so came down to tell because thought wicked wrong of men to destroy mill because must no doubt have murdered mr cartwright people there must not take money for doing even if nobody ever got to know of must always seem to a if have sold hand have suffered enough god know think mr cartwright thought of offering money told be sure that must take hoped that might be able to do something for in other way thank sir mary said with quiet dignity there be way must take anything for doing what did well mary wo say anything more about only spoke know because mr cartwright insisted of course a did not know must not tell how different be from other girl there be suspicion hope that be away from village sir think so two of men sat here talking with feyther till past eleven o'clock thought

have have dr green up old sarah james be nursing saw morning going to shop asked how be only said be business of mine doe like because sometimes nurse people when be ill think take money from so doe what can do if people like to sit by better than wonder for be very deaf horribly dirty think be to be blamed polly ned said smiling if be ill must certainly like to nurse great deal better than bad tempered old woman attack on cartwright mill made great sensation through part of country be most determined effort luddite have yet made although showed determination to carry matter to extremity also showed that few determined men must successfully resist attack nothing else be talked about at marsden a mr cartwright everywhere said that success of resistance be due entirely to upsetting of plan of rioter by warning ned have given latter gained great credit in eye of peaceful inhabitant a must make ned still more obnoxious to luddite major browne insisted on placing six soldier permanently at mill on four accompanying a escort whenever went backward forward ned be very averse to measure magistrate agreed with major browne a to danger of assassination to ned be exposed from anger of cropper at having twice thwarted attempt more readily agreed a presence of guard soothed fear charlie lucy felt for safety whenever be absent from town what perhaps most influenced be conversation have with mr porson mother be speaking of to today ned said be first time have done so since made acquaintance began by saying 'please mr porson tell about attack on george cartwright mill abijah lucy have be talking about abijah always get confused in story of course lucy know only what be told must like to know about ' of course told whole story how much mr cartwright say be indebted to for warning brought how one be speaking in praise of conduct what good effect have have told that of course luddite must be very much incensed against that be adding to risk that already ran lay on sofa quietly with eye shut time be speaking must see color come go tear fell down cheek then said in tone tried to make hard careless really trembled military ought to put guard over son why doe go risking life for other people what business be of whether cartwright mill be burned not ' said that mr cartwright have be very kind to that knew that be much attached to also said that military be anxious that must have escort to from mill that objected said that be afraid that life have not much value in own eye for that be by mean happy one 'it have value in other people eye said irritably 'in lucy in brother what must do if be to throw away who must look after mill business then have no right to run such risk mr porson no right at of course be unhappy people who let temper master do thing be sure to be unhappy make other people unhappy too be reason that must cause more unhappiness by risking own life needlessly so mr porson please talk to husband tell to make son have escort know always listens to mr porson ' naturally mother be anxious for sake of charlie lucy must live to carry on mill until charlie be old enough to run ned said bitterly think that be only that ned mr porson said kindly be only excuse that mother made must see that be deeply moved believe ned that at heart still love dearly have unhappy fixed idea in mind that killed husband believing can not bear to see be sure be most unhappy most deeply to be pitied can not imagine anything more dreadful than state of mind of woman who belief that son of hers have murdered husband think that if quite realized what feeling must be must feel little le bitter than do know ned how much have to try be sure must not exchange position for of mother pain must be far greater than yours know that be innocent hope that day may be able to prove think know that be guilty be in constant dread that something may occur may prove guilt to world perhaps be right mr porson ned said wearily at rate will put up with nuisance of escort suppose will not be for very long for expect that will not hear very much more of luddite failure upon cartwright mill mine must have disheartened big reward be offered
