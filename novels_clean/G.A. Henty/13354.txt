riding up to castle of earl of evesham casual observer glancing at curling hair bright open face a also at fashion of dress must at once have assigned to purely saxon origin keener eye must have detected sign that norman blood ran also in vein for figure be lither lighter feature more straightly shapely cut than be common among saxon dress consisted of tight fitting jerkin descending nearly to knee material be light blue cloth while over shoulder hung short cloak of darker hue cap be of saxon fashion wore on one side little plume of heron in somewhat costly belt hung light short sword while across knee lay crossbow in almost sure sign of bearer being of other than saxon blood boy looked anxiously a party after party rode past toward castle must give something said to know what wind blow knave here from petty castle in earl feu retainer seem hurrying here be bent wonder on settling once for quarrel with baron of wortham can be intending to make clear sweep of wood ah here come gossip hubert may tell meaning of gathering leaping to foot speaker started at brisk walk to meet jovial looking personage coming down from direction of castle newcomer be dressed in attire of falconer two dog followed at heel ah master cuthbert said what brings so near to castle be not often that favor with presence be happier in wood a well know be on way thither now when paused at sight of trooper flocking in to evesham what enterprise have sir walter on hand now think earl keep own counsel said falconer methinks shrewd guess might be made at purport of gathering be three day since forester be beaten back by landless men whom caught in very act of cutting up fat buck a thou knowest lord though easy well disposed to not fond of harassing driving people a be many of neighbor be yet to full a fanatical anent forest privilege a worst of tell that when news came in of poor figure that forester cut with broken bow draggled plume for varlet have soused in pond of not over savory water swore great oath that must clear forest of band may be indeed that gathering be for purpose of falling in force upon evil disposed most treacherous baron sir john of wortham who have already begun to harry of outlying land have driven off hear many head of cattle be quarrel will have to be fought out sooner later sooner better say although be man of war love looking after falcon giving food to dog far more than exchanging hard blow yet must gladly don buff steel coat to aid in leveling keep of robber tyrant sir john of wortham thanks good hubert said lad must not stand gossiping here news have told a know touch closely for must not that harm must come to forest men let not out beseech thee cuthbert that news came from for temperate a sir walter be at most time must methinks give short shift did know that wagging of tongue might have given warning through outlaw of chase must slip through finger fear not hubert can be mum when occasion need can tell further when band now gathering be likely to set forth in brief breathing space falconer replied who first arrived left swilling beer devouring pie other provision cooked for last night from what hear will set forth a soon a last comer have arrived whichever be quarry will try to fall upon before news of arrival be bruited abroad with wave of hand to falconer boy started leaving road striking across slightly undulated country dotted here there by group of tree lad ran at brisk trot without stopping to halt breathe until after hour run arrived at entrance of building whose aspect proclaimed to be abode of saxon franklin of importance must not be called castle be rather fortified house with few window looking without surrounded by moat crossed by drawbridge capable of sustaining anything short of real attack erstwood have lately passed into norman hand be indeed at present owned by saxon sir william de lance father of lad who be now entering portal be friend follower of earl of evesham soon after lord have married gweneth heiress of fair land given to by will of king to whom by death of father became ward sir william have married editha daughter heiress of franklin of erstwood cousin dear friend of new countess of evesham in couple must marriage at first have be called one of inclination on part of lady love came after marriage although knight baron of norman invasion must doubt be considered rude rough in day of broadcloth civilization yet manner be gentle polished by side of of rough though kindly saxon franklin although saxon maid be doubtless a patriotic a father mother yet female mind be greatly led by gentle manner courteous address thus then when bidden forced to give hand to norman knight speedily accepted lot for most part grew contented happy enough in changed circumstance be pleasanter to ride by side of norman husband surrounded by gay cavalcade to hawk to hunt than to discharge quiet duty of mistress of saxon farmhouse in many case of course lot be rendered wretched by violence brutality of lord in majority be well satisfied with lot mixed marriage did more to bring people together weld in one than law decree of norman sovereign have certainly be case with editha whose marriage with sir william have be one of greatest happiness have lost three year before story begin fighting in normandy in one of innumerable war in first norman king be constantly involved on entering gate of erstwood cuthbert have rushed hastily to room where mother be sitting with three four of maiden engaged in work want to speak to at once mother said what be now son said mother who be still young very comely waving hand to girl left mother said when be alone fear that sir walter be about to make great raid upon outlaw armed men have be coming in morning from castle round if be not against baron de wortham that preparation be intended methinks be not must need be against landless men what must do cuthbert mother asked anxiously will not do for to be found meddling in matter at present stand well in favor of earl who love for sake of wife to whom be kin of father who did good liegeman service mother have many friend in wood there be cnut chief own first cousin many others of friend good men true though forced by cruel norman law to refuge in wood what must do again mother asked must take ronald pony ride to warn of danger that threatens have best go on foot son doubtless men have be set to see that none from saxon homestead carry warning to wood distance be not beyond reach for have often wandered there on foot can evade eye of watcher one thing son must promise be that in case must earl band meet with outlaw will take part in fray struggle will willingly mother said have cause for offense against castle forest blood kin be with must fain save shedding of blood in quarrel like hope that time may come when saxon norman may fight side by side may be there to see few minute later having changed blue doublet for one of more sober le noticeable color cuthbert started for great forest then stretched to within mile of erstwood in day large part of country be covered with forest policy of norman in preserving wood for chase tended to prevent increase of cultivation farm cultivated land be held by saxon who although nominally handed over to noble to whom william successor have given fief saw little of norman master stood indeed much in position in landlord stand to tenant payment being made for most part in produce at edge of wood tree grew comparatively far apart a cuthbert proceeded further into recess tree in virgin forest stood thick close together here there open glade ran across other in sharp eye accustomed to forest must often see stag starting away at sound of footstep be full hour journey before cuthbert reached point for be bound here in open space probably cleared by storm age before overshadowed by giant tree be group of men of age appearance be occupied in stripping skin off buck hung from bough of one of tree others be roasting portion of carcass of deer few sat apart talking others busy in making arrow while few lay asleep on greensward a cuthbert entered clearing several of party rose to foot ah cuthbert shouted man of almost gigantic stature who appeared to be one of leader of party what brings here lad so early be not wont to visit till even when can lay crossbow at stag by moonlight cousin cnut cuthbert said thou canst not say have ever broken forest law though have looked on often often while have done so abettor be a bad a thief laughed cnut if forester caught in act wot must make little difference whether be shaft of longbow quarrel from thy crossbow brought down quarry again lad why comest thou here for see by sweat on face by heaving of side that have run fast far have cnut have not once stopped for breathing since left erstwood have come to warn of danger earl be preparing for raid cnut laughed somewhat disdainfully have raided here before trow have carried off game landless men of forest can hold own against handful of norman knight retainer in own home ay said cuthbert will be common raid morning band from hold within mile round be riding in at least five hundred men at arm be likely to do chase to day be so said cnut while exclamation of surprise not of apprehension broke from standing round if be so lad have done good service indeed with fair warning can slip through finger of ten time five hundred men if came upon unawares hemmed in must fare badly with though must doubt not give good account of before battle ax mace ended strife have idea by road will enter forest be intention know not cuthbert said that gathered be that earl intended to sweep forest to put end to breach of law not to say of rough treatment that forester have met with at hand have best methinks be off before sir walter heavily armed men be here forest large a be will scarce hold methinks have best shift quarter to langholm chase until storm have passed to langholm be then said cnut though love not place sir john of wortham be worse neighbor by far than earl against latter bear malice be good knight fair lord must free of norman notion that bird of air beast of field fish of water belong to norman that saxon have share in must have quarrel with grind not neighbor be content with fair tithe of produce a between man man be fair judge without favor baron be fiend incarnate did not fear that must lose by so doing must gladly cut throat burn drown hang saxon within twenty mile of hold be disgrace to order day when band gather little stronger will burn nest about ear will be hard nut to crack cuthbert said laughing with such arm a have in forest enterprise must be something akin to scaling sky ladder ax will go far lad norman men at arm have learned to dread shaft enough of baron if must be neighbor for time so be have heard mate said turning to comrade gathered around what cuthbert tell be of opinion that be better to move away till storm be past than to fight against heavy odds without much chance of booty victory general chorus proclaimed that outlaw approved of proposal for move to langholm chase preparation be simple bow be taken down from bough on be hanging quiver slung across back short cloak thrown over shoulder deer be hurriedly dismembered joint fastened to pole slung on shoulder of two of men drinking cup of be of silver looking strangely out of place among rough horn implement platter be bundled together carried short distance dropped among thick bush for safety then band started for wortham with cordial farewell many thanks to cuthbert who declined invitation to accompany retreat to langholm commenced cuthbert not knowing in direction band be likely to approach remained for awhile motionless intently listening in quarter of hour heard distant note of bugle be answered in three different direction cuthbert who knew path glade of forest be able pretty accurately to surmise by various band be commencing to enter wood knowing that be still long way off advanced a rapidly a must in direction in be coming when by sound of distant voice breaking of branch knew that one at least of party be near at hand rapidly climbed thick tree ensconced in branch there watched secure hidden from sharpest eye passage of body of men at arm fully hundred strong led by sir walter accompanied by half dozen of knight when have passed cuthbert again slipped down tree made at speed for home reached so far a knew without having be observed by single passer by after brief talk with mother started for castle a appearance there must divert suspicion might arise must also appear natural that seeing movement of so large body of men must go up to gossip with acquaintance there when distant mile from evesham came upon small party on white palfrey rode margaret little daughter of earl be accompanied by nurse two retainer on foot cuthbert who be great favorite with earl daughter for whom frequently brought pet such a nest of young owlet falcon other creature be about to join party when from clump of tree near burst body of ten mounted men without word rode straight at astonished group retainer be cut to ground before have thought of drawing sword in defense nurse be slain by blow with battle ax margaret snatched from palfrey be thrown across saddlebow of one of mounted men who then with comrade dashed off at full speed chapter ii rescue whole of startling scene of abduction of earl of evesham daughter occupied few second cuthbert be so astounded at sudden calamity that remained rooted to ground at spot where fortunately for unnoticed by assailant have stood when first burst from concealment for short time hesitated a to course must take men at arm who remained in castle be scarce strong enough to rescue child whose captor must doubt be reinforced by far stronger party lurking near main body of sir walter follower be deep in recess of forest lay altogether out of line for wortham there must be chance whatever of bringing up in time to cut off marauder on way back there remained only outlaw who by time must be in langholm forest perhaps within mile two of castle road by horseman must travel must be far longer than direct line across country resolved at once to strain nerve to reach friend in time to get to interpose between captor of lady margaret stronghold for instant hesitated whether to run back to erstwood to get horse decided that must be a quick to go on foot far easier so to find outlaw thought occupied few moment at once started at top of speed for long run across country have cuthbert be running in race of hare hound must assuredly have borne away prize from most boy of age at headlong pace made across country foot of a far a edge of langholm chase knew by heart distance to wood be twelve mile in hour half from moment of starting cuthbert be deep within shade where must be likely to find outlaw knew not putting whistle to lip shrilly blew signal must knew be recognized by of band within hearing thought that heard answer be not certain again dashed forward almost a speedily a if have just started five minute later man stood in glade up be running recognized at once a one of cnut party where be band gasped mile so to right replied man guided by man cuthbert ran at full speed till panting scarce able to speak arrived at spot where cnut band be gathered in few word told what have happened although have just be chased by father of captured child there be not moment of hesitation in promising aid to rescue from man whom regarded a far more bitter enemy of race fear will be too late to cut off cnut said have so long start at least will waste time in gossiping winding horn to call together of member of band who have scattered leaving one at meeting place to give instruction to rest cnut followed by assembled there went off at swinging trot through glade toward wortham castle after rapid calculation of distance allowing for fact that baron men knowing that sir walter retainer friend be deep in forest even if heard of outrage must not be on trace for hour must take matter quietly cnut concluded that have arrived in time turning off made way along edge of wood to point where road from evesham ran through forest scarcely have party reached point when heard faint clatter of steel here come exclaimed cuthbert cnut gave rapid direction band took up post behind tree on side of path remember cnut said above thing be careful not to hit child pierce horse on be riding instant fall rush forward must trust to surprise to give victory three minute later head of band of horseman be seen through tree be thirty in number closely grouped a be together watcher behind tree must not see form of child carried in midst when came abreast of concealed outlaw cnut gave sharp whistle fifty arrow flew from tree bush into closely gathered party of horseman more than number fell at once drawing sword endeavored to rush at concealed foe while others dashed forward in hope of riding through snare into have fallen cuthbert have leveled crossbow have not fired be watching with intense anxiety for glimpse of bright colored dress of child soon saw horseman separate from rest dash forward at full speed several arrow flew by one two struck horse on rode animal however kept on way cuthbert leveled crossbow on low arm of tree a rider came abreast of touched trigger steel pointed quarrel flew true strong against temple of passing horseman fell from horse like stone well trained animal at once stood still by side of rider cuthbert leaped forward to delight child at once opened arm cried in joyous tone cuthbert fight be still raging fiercely cuthbert raising from ground ran with into wood where remained hidden until combat ceased last survivor of baron band have ridden past toward castle then cuthbert went forward with charge joined band of outlaw who absorbed in fight have not witnessed incident of rescue now received with loud shout of joy triumph be good day work indeed for cuthbert said will make of earl firm friend instead of bitter enemy doubt not that better day be dawning for evesham forest litter be speedily made with bough on margaret be placed on shoulder of two stout forester started for home cnut cuthbert walking beside few of band keeping at short distance behind a sort of rearguard must baron attempt to regain prey there be now cause for speed cuthbert in truth must scarce drag one foot before for have already traversed over twenty mile greater portion of distance at highest rate of speed cnut offered to have litter made for also cuthbert indignantly refused however in forest came upon hut of small cultivator who have rough forest pony be borrowed for cuthbert use be late in afternoon before came in sight of evesham castle from distance must be seen body of armed men galloping toward be clear that only now party be returning from wood have learned news of disappearance of earl daughter of finding of body of attendant presently met one of mounted retainer riding at headlong speed have heard seen anything shouted a approached of lady margaret be missing foul play have taken place here be rudolph cried child sitting up on rude litter horseman gave cry of astonishment pleasure without word wheeled horse galloped past back at headlong speed toward castle a cuthbert party approached gate earl surrounded by knight follower rode out hastily from gate halted in front of little party litter be lowered a dismounted from horse daughter sprang out leaped into arm for few minute confusion babble of tongue be too great for anything to be heard cuthbert a soon a order be somewhat restored stated what have happened earl be moved to fury at news of outrage have be perpetrated by baron of wortham upon daughter at very gate of castle also at thought that must have be saved by bravery devotion of very men against whom have so lately be vowing vengeance in depth of forest be not time said to cnut for talk making promise be assured that henceforth deer of evesham chase be a free to men a to forest law forest law will no more lift hand against men to whom owe so much come when will to castle friend let talk over what can be done to raise outlawry restore to honest career again cuthbert returned home tired delighted with day work dame editha be surprised indeed with tale of adventure have to tell next morning went over to castle heard that grand council have be held evening before that have be determined to attack wortham castle to raze to ground immediately on hearing of arrival earl after again expressing gratitude for rescue of daughter asked if must go into forest invite outlaw to join force with of castle to attack baron cuthbert willingly undertook mission a felt that alliance must further strengthen position of forest men when arrived there be considerable consultation discussion between outlaw a to expediency of mixing in quarrel between norman baron however cnut persuaded that a baron of wortham be enemy oppressor of saxon be in fact own quarrel that be fighting rather than of earl therefore agreed to give aid promised to be at rendezvous outside castle to be attacked soon after dawn next morning cuthbert returned with news gave great satisfaction to earl castle be now scene of bustle business armorer be at work repairing headpiece breastplate sharpening sword battle ax while fletcher prepared sheaf of arrow in courtyard number of men be engaged oiling catapult ballista other machine for hurling stone be discussing chance of assault for be easy matter have set to do wortham hold be extremely strong one needed more than machine at disposal to undertake so formidable operation a siege garrison too be strong desperate baron knowing what must follow outrage of day before must have be sure to send off messenger round country begging friend to come to assistance cuthbert have begged permission of mother to ask earl to allow to join a volunteer must not hear of must suffer to mingle with forester utmost that must obtain be that might go a spectator with strict injunction to keep out of fray a far a possible beyond bow shot of castle wall be force of four hundred strong that issued from wood early next morning to attack stronghold at wortham force consisted of ten twelve knight baron one hundred fifty one hundred sixty norman men at arm miscellaneous gathering of other retainer two hundred strong eighty of forest men last be not to fight under earl banner be to act on own account there be among outlaw escaped serf men guilty of bloodshed earl then must not have suffered men to fight under flag until purged in way of offense arrangement suited forester well strong point be shooting by taking up own position following own tactic under leadership of cnut must be able to do far more execution that with le risk to than if compelled to fight according to fashion of norman a approached castle trumpet be blown herald advancing demanded surrender stigmatized baron of wortham a false knight disgrace to class warned within castle to abstain from giving aid countenance to submit to earl sir walter of evesham representative of king richard reply to summons be burst of taunting laughter from wall scarcely have herald withdrawn than flight of arrow showed that besieged be perfectly ready for fray indeed baron have not be idle already dispute between earl have come to point that be certain that sooner later open hostility must break out have therefore be for time quietly accumulating large store of provision munition of war strengthening castle in way moat have be cleaned out filled to brim with water great quantity of heavy stone have be accumulated on most exposed point of wall in readiness to hurl upon who might try to climb huge sheaf of arrow pile of crossbow bolt be in readiness in save number of men have for week be prepared for siege on day when attempt to carry off earl daughter have failed baron seeing that bold stroke to obtain hostage must have enabled to make own term with earl have be thwarted knew that struggle be inevitable fleet messenger have be sent in direction to gloucester hereford stafford even oxford men have ridden with letter to baron friend beseeching to march to assistance can said defend hold for week be only by aid from without can finally hope to break power of baggart transcriber note sic earl many of to whom addressed call have speedily complied with demand while at distance might be expected to reply later to appeal there be many among baron who considered mildness of earl of evesham toward saxon in district to be mistake who although not actually approving of tyranny brutality of baron of wortham yet looked upon cause to extent a own castle of wortham stood upon ground very slightly elevated above surrounding country deep wide moat ran round must by diverting rivulet be filled at will from edge of moat wall rose high with strong flanking tower battlement there be strong work also beyond moat opposite to drawbridge while in center of castle rose keep from whose summit archer machine for casting stone dart must command whole circuit of defense a cuthbert accompanied by one of hind of farm took post high up in lofty tree where at ease must command view of proceeding marveled much in what manner attack upon so fair fortress must be commenced will be straightforward work to attack outwork said once won see not how be to proceed against castle machine that earl have will scarcely hurl stone strong enough even to knock mortar from wall ladder be useless where can not be planted if garrison be a brave a castle be strong methinks that earl have embarked upon business will keep here till next spring there be little time lost in commencing conflict forester skirmishing up near to castle taking advantage of inequality in ground of bush tuft of high grass worked up close to moat then opened heavy fire with bow against men at arm on battlement prevented using machine against main force now advancing to attack upon outwork be stoutly defended impetuosity of earl backed a be by gallantry of knight serving under carried obstacle narrow moat encircled work be speedily filled with great bundle of brushwood have be prepared previous night across assailant rushed thundered at gate with battle ax while others placed ladder by although several time hurled backward by defender finally succeeded in getting footing on wall once there combat be virtually over defender be either cut down taken prisoner in two hour after assault began outwork of wortham castle be taken however be commencement of undertaking have cost more than twenty life to assailant be now indeed little nearer to capturing castle than have be before moat be wide deep drawbridge have be lifted at instant that first of assailant gained footing upon wall now that outwork be captured storm of arrow stone other missile be poured into from castle wall rendered impossible for of new master to show above seeing that sudden attack be impossible earl now directed strong body to cut down tree prepare moveable bridge to throw across moat must be work of fully two day in meantime cuthbert returned to farm chapter iii capture of wortham hold upon return home after relating to mother event of morning conflict cuthbert took way to cottage inhabited by old man who have in youth be mason have not heard gurth said that helped to build castle of wortham young sir said old a be be child when castle be built father worked at cost many others life how be that prithee asked cuthbert be with several others killed by baron grandfather of present man when work be finished why be that gurth be saxon swine said gurth bitterly few of more le mattered not be then serf of baron mother fled with on news of father death for year remained far away with friend in forest near oxford then pined for native air came back entered service of franklin why must mother have taken away cuthbert asked always believed master cuthbert that father be killed by baron to prevent giving news of secret of castle others have be kept in wall for many month be engaged in making of secret passage be just what came to ask gurth have heard something of story before now that be attacking wortham castle earl have sworn to level to ground be of importance if possible to find out whether of secret passage lead beyond castle if so where almost castle have have be told exit by garrison can at will make sortie escape thought that maybe might have heard enough to give clue a to existence of such passage at wortham old man thought for time in silence then said may be mistaken methinks diligent search in copse near stream might find mouth of outlet what make think that be so gurth have be with mother to carry clothes to father on last occasion on saw a neared castle saw father three other of workman together with baron coming down from castle toward spot a mother did not wish to approach while baron be at hand stood within tree at edge of wood watched what be being done baron came with down to bush then again came out crossed river one of cut willow peeled erected white stave in line toward castle walked for bit on side seemed to be making calculation then went back into castle never saw father again why did not go in at once according to intention because mother said that thought important work be on hand that maybe baron must not like that woman must know aught of for be of suspicious evil mind more than know not castle have already be finished most of mason discharged there be however party of serf kept at work also mason rumor have that be engaged in making secret passage whether be so not can not say know that none of party ever left castle alive be given out that bad fever have raged there none believed report went about be doubt not true that have be killed to preserve secret of passage cuthbert lost time in making use of information that have gained early next morning at daybreak started on pony to wortham a did not wish earl follower to know fact that have learned until be proved made way round camp of besieger by mean of whistle called one of forester to where be cnut asked be with party occupied in making ladder go to cuthbert said tell to withdraw quietly make way here have important matter on wish to speak to cnut arrived in few minute somewhat wondering at message brightened greatly when cuthbert told what have learned be indeed important said will lose time in searching copse speak of together with two of most trusty men with ax to clear away brush will do at present thing of sort have best be kept between a few a may be started at once soon came down upon stream ran at point in little valley twenty thirty foot deep on bank not far from castle grew small wood be in cuthbert hoped to find passage spoken of by gurth tree brushwood be so thick that be apparent at once that if passage have ever existed have be unused for year woodman be obliged to chop down dozen of young sapling to make way up from water toward steeper part of bank wood be fifty yard in length a be uncertain at point passage have come out very minute search have to be made what do think must be like cnut cuthbert asked like enough to rabbit hole more likely still there must be hole whatever must look for moss greenery for be likely that such must have be planted so a to conceal door from passer by while yet allowing party from inside to cut way through without difficulty after search of two hour cnut decided that only place in copse in be likely that entrance to passage must be hidden be spot where ground be covered thickly with ivy trailing plant look level enough with rest cuthbert said ay lad know not what lie behind thick screen of ivy thrust in staff one of woodman began to probe with end of staff among ivy for time be met by solid ground presently butt of staff went through suddenly pitching on head amid suppressed laugh from comrade here be if anywhere said cnut with billhook at once began to clear away thickly grown creeper five minute work be sufficient to show narrow cut two foot wide in hillside at end of stood low door here be said cnut with triumph castle be ours thanks cuthbert for thought intelligence have not be used lately be clear went on creeper have not be moved for year will go tell earl of discovery what think cuthbert think have better not cuthbert said might not succeed in getting in a passage may have fallen further along will speak to tell that have something on hand may alter disposition for fighting to morrow cuthbert made way to earl who have taken possession of small cottage short distance from castle what can do for sir walter said want to ask sir not to attack castle to morrow until see white flag waved from keep how on earth be white flag to be raised from keep may be cuthbert said have friend inside who will be able to make diversion in favor however sir can do harm if will wait till then may save many life at what hour do mean to attack bridge other preparation to assist across moat will be ready to night will advance then under cover of darkness a soon after dawn a may be attack in earnest very well sir cuthbert said trust that within five minute after bugle have sounded white flag will make appearance on keep can not do so until after have commenced attack at least pretense of attack two three hour before daylight cuthbert accompanied cnut twenty five picked men of forester to copse be provided with crowbar carried heavy ax door be soon pried open opened silently without creak may be cnut said that door have not be opened a say for year be certain placed torch to hinge that have be well oiled within last two three day doubt baron intended to make escape way must worst arrive now that have door open have better wait quiet until dawn commences earl will blow bugle a signal for advance will be ten minute before be fairly engaged will be enough for to break open door that there may be between castle to force way inside seemed long time waiting before dawn fairly broke still longer before earl bugle be heard to sound attack then band headed by cnut two three of strongest of party entered passage cuthbert have have misgiving a to mother injunction to take part in fray can not be said that in accompanying forester obeyed letter of instruction at same time a felt sure that effect of surprise must be complete crushing that party must gain top of keep without serious resistance considered risk be so small a to justify in accompanying forester passage be five foot high little more than two foot wide be dry dusty save mark on ground of human foot going returning doubtless that of man who have oiled lock day before passage appeared to have be unused from time that left hand of builder passing along for distance came to strong oaken door like last yielded to effort of crowbar of forester again advanced presently came to flight of step must now be near castle cnut said in fact methinks can hear confused noise ahead mounting step came to third door be thickly studded with iron appeared of very great strength fortunately lock be upon side be enabled to shoot bolt upon other side door be firmly secured by large bolt be fully five minute before forester must succeed in opening be not without good deal of noise that at last did so several time paused fearing that alarm must have be given in castle a however door remained closed supposed that occupant be fully engaged in defending from attack of earl party when door gave way found hanging across in front of very thick arras pressing aside entered small room in thickness of wall of keep contained merest slit for light be clearly unused door time unfastened led into larger apartment be also at present unoccupied must hear now shout of combatant without loud order given by leader on wall crack a stone hurled by mangonel struck wall ring of steel a arrow struck against steel cap cuirass be fortunate that be so well engaged must certainly have heard noise of forcing door must have brought of upon a be be in heart of keep have now to make rush up winding step methinks will find on battlement will be so surprised that real resistance can be offered to now let advance so saying cnut led way upstairs followed by forester cuthbert a before allowing five six of to intervene between leader carried short sword quarterstaff weapon by mean to be despised in hand of active experienced player presently after mounting fifty sixty step issued on platform of keep here be gathered thirty forty men who be so busied in shooting with crossbow in working machine casting javelin stone other missile upon besieger that be unaware of addition to number until whole of forester have gathered on summit at order of cnut suddenly fell upon with loud shout taken wholly by surprise by foe who seemed to have risen from bowel of earth by magic soldier of baron of wortham offered feeble resistance be cast over battlement of keep driven down staircase others cut down then cuthbert fastening small white flag have prepared to quarterstaff waved above battlement even now combatant on outer wall be in ignorance of what have happened in keep so great be din that struggle have there taken place have passed unnoticed be not until fugitive rushing out into courtyard shouted that keep have be captured that besieged became aware of imminence of danger illustration cuthbert fastened small white flag to quarter staff waved above battlement hitherto battle have be going well for defender of castle baron of wortham be indeed surprised at feebleness of assault arrow have fallen in cloud upon first day attack upon castle among soldier be now comparatively few ineffective besieger scarcely appeared to push forward bridge with vigor seemed to that coldness have fallen upon that disagreement must have arisen between forester earl completely crippling energy of attack when heard word shouted from courtyard below must not believe ear that keep behind must have be carried by enemy appeared to impossible with roar called upon bravest of men to follow rushing across courtyard rapidly ascended staircase movement be observed from keep cnut few of men stationed with battle ax at top of various stair leading below signal shown by cuthbert have not passed unobserved earl who have given instruction to follower to make mere feint of attacking now blew signal for real onslaught bridge be rapidly run across moat ladder be planted garrison being paralyzed confused by attack in rear a well a hindered by arrow now flew down upon from keep above offered feeble resistance assailant led by sir walter poured over wall now there be scene of confusion desperate strife baron have just gained top of stair be engaged in fierce conflict with cnut men when news reached that wall be carried from without with execration again turned rushed down stair hoping by vigorous effort to cast back foe be however all too late follower disheartened alarmed fought without method order in scattered group of three four made last stand in corner passage knew there be little hope of mercy from saxon forester against fought to last to norman retainer however of earl offered le determined resistance throwing down arm surrendering at discretion baron when fiercely fighting be slain by arrow from keep above with fall last resistance ceased short time be spent in searching castle binding prisoner carrying off valuable that baron have collected in raid then light be set to timber granary be fired in few minute smoke wreathing out of various loophole opening told country round that stronghold have fallen that be free from oppressor at last chapter iv crusade warm thanks much praise be bestowed upon cuthbert for share in capture of castle earl

fighting with extraordinary bravery small army of christian knight of temple of st john be annihilated king of jerusalem be made prisoner christian power be crushed then saladin who commanded turk advanced against jerusalem forced to capitulate such boy be last sad news have reached wonder that have stirred heart of monarch of europe that effort will be again made to recapture holy sepulcher to

believe that when have again wrested holy sepulcher from hand of infidel will be able to maintain against assault doubtless great misfortune have fallen upon christian army have be punishment from heaven because have not gone to work in right spirit be not enough to take up lance shield to place red cross upon shoulder who desire to fight battle of lord must cleanse heart go forth in spirit of pilgrim rather than knight mean not that must trust wholly to spiritual weapon for in truth infidel be foe not to be despised mean that must lay aside thought of worldly glory rivalry one against think father that such be spirit with king richard other king noble now preparing to go to holy land be animated father francis hesitated be not for son to judge motif to speak well ill of instrument who have be chosen for great work be of work most praiseworthy most holy be horrible to think that holy shrine of jerusalem must be in hand of men who believe not in redeemer hold to be duty of man who can bear arm matter what rank station to don armor to go forth to battle in cause whether success will crown effort whether god will otherwise be not for man to discus be enough that work be there be duty to do think father that will do good to england do son whether gain holy land methinks that will do good service to nation that saxon norman must fight together under holy cross hitherto race have stood far too much apart have seen other bad quality rather than good methinks when saxon norman stand side by side on soil of holy land shout together for england must need bind together lead to feel that be no longer norman saxon englishman intend to preach on village green at evesham next sunday morning on subject a know be in communication with forest men must cuthbert that must persuade

that be fond of drawing arrow at buck doe not make one whit worse christian will do best to move heart if will agree together to take cross must make goodly band of footman to accompany earl be earl going cuthbert asked eagerly know not for certain said father francis think from what hear from chaplain father eustace that mind turn in direction then father if go will go too cuthbert exclaimed promised to take a page first time went to war father francis shook head fear cuthbert be far from spirit in awhile ago agreed that men must go to holy war cuthbert hung head little ay father francis men be boy said after boy be fond of adventure for adventure sake however father said with smile doubt eloquence on green will turn mightily to project for must allow that story have told morning be not such a to create very strong yearning in one mind to follow million of men who have perished in holy land go to said francis smiling thou art pert varlet will do best on sunday to turn to better frame of mind chapter v preparation next sunday large number of people from mile round be gathered on green at evesham to hear father francis preach on holy sepulcher forest men in green jerkin mingled with crowd look of attention seriousness be on face of for news of loss of holy sepulcher have really exercised great effect upon mind of people in england a elsewhere be day of pilgrimage to holy place when belief in sanctity of place thing be overwhelming when men believed that journey to holy shrine be sufficient to procure for pardon for misdeed very word infidel in day be full of horror thought that holy place of christian be in hand of moslem affected christian throughout europe with feeling of shame a well a of grief among crowd be many of norman retainer from castle from many of hold around several knight with lady of family stood little apart from edge of gathering for be known that father francis must not be alone that must be accompanied by holy friar who have returned from east who must tell of cruelty christian have suffered at hand of saracen father francis at ordinary time tranquil preacher be moved beyond by theme on be holding forth did not attempt to hide from who stood around that task to be undertaken be one of grievous peril trial that disease heat hunger thirst must be dared a well a sword of infidel spoke of grand nature of work of humiliation to christian of desecration of shrine of glory awaited who joined crusade whether lived whether died in holy land word have strong effect upon simple people who listened to feeling so aroused be a naught to enthusiasm greeted address of friar meager pale with worn anxious face a one who have suffered much friar holding aloft two piece of wood from mount of olive tied together in form of cross harangued crowd word poured forth in fiery stream kindling heart stirring at once devotion anger of listener told of holy place spoke of scene of holy writ have there be enacted then depicted men who have died for told of knight men at arm of whom proved again again match for score of infidel spoke of holy woman who fearlessly bravely a knight have borne share in horror of siege in terrible time have preceded told that misfortune have befallen christianity because of lukewarmness have come upon profited asked if few knight who remained to defend holy sepulcher be hero few hero can not withstand army if christendom after making mighty effort to capture holy sepulcher have not fallen away conquest have be made with so vast expenditure of blood must not have be lost be work in mere passing fervor will avail bravery at first endurance afterward be needed many men must determine not only to assist to wrest holy sepulcher from hand of infidel to give life so long a might last to retaining be scarce to be expected that men with wife family will take view like indeed be not to be desired there be single men men of tie who can devote whole life a did knight of order of cross to great object when life have come to end doubtless others will take up banner that hand can no longer hold for life be indeed that many of humble a well a of princely class must bind to take defend to death holy sepulcher so gradually raising tone of speech friar proceeded until at length by intense earnestness wild gesticulation impassioned word drew whole of listener along with when ceased mighty shout of to holy land burst from hearer falling upon knee crowd begged of to give sign of cross to bestow blessing upon sword upon effort father francis have prepared in contemplation of such movement large number of small white cross of cloth friar now fastened to shoulder of men a crowded up to receive holding hand aloft kissing cross that friar extended to swearing to give life if need be to rescue holy shrine from infidel when have received holy symbol father francis again ascended bank from have addressed crowd now go to home son said think of oath that have taken of course lie open to when time come when king richard be prepared to start then will be called upon to fulfill vow may be that who have sworn may not be called upon to go need that land here must be tilled need that there must be protector for woman child need that england of ours must flourish can not give son however willing might be to take cross willingness will be sure show to go if need be to redeem vow will be sufficient must go must stay be matter to be decided hereafter for time let separate will hear when hour for action arrives fortnight later earl of evesham who have be on long journey to london returned with full authority to raise organize force a contingent to holy war be now bustle activity in castle father francis informed of willingness of such of forest men a deemed fit to enlist under banner earl be much gratified at finding that rank of heavily armed retainer whom must take with be to be swollen by addition of so useful contingent a of one hundred skillful archer cuthbert be not long in asking for interview with earl have indeed great difficulty in persuading dame editha that be old enough to share in fatigue of so great expedition have francis on side between influence of confessor importunity of son opposition of good lady fell to ground cuthbert be already for age well trained to arm many of old soldier at castle who have known loved father have be ever ready to give lesson in use of arm to cuthbert who be enthusiastic in desire to prove a good knight a father have be friend outlaw have taught use of bow of quarterstaff cuthbert strong well built for age having little to do save to wield sword bow have attained very considerable amount of skill with have too be unusual certain amount of book learning although true to say have not be acquired so cheerfully willingly a skill at arm father francis have however taught to read to write accomplishment be at time rare except in cloister in day if knight have firm seat in saddle strong arm keen eye high courage be thought to be of little matter whether must must not do more than make mark on parchment whole life of young be given to acquiring skill in arm unless intended for convent idea of education must in great majority of case have be considered a preposterous to do cuthbert justice have protested with might against proposition of father francis to mother to teach clerkly knowledge have yielded most unwillingly at last to entreaty backed a be by sound argument good sense of father francis earl of evesham received cuthbert application very graciously certainly cuthbert said will accompany first on account of promise to secondly because from readiness displayed in matter of daughter of attack on wortham will be notable aid addition to party thirdly from friendship for father dame editha point being settled cuthbert at once assumed new duty there be plenty for to do to see that order of earl be properly carried out to bear message to knight who followed earl fortune at various hold to stand by watch armorer at work preparation of store of arm missile must be necessary for expedition sometimes must go round to summon tenant of various farm land who held from earl to come to castle here sir walter must a far a might be without oppression beg of to contribute largely to expedition in appeal be in slight way assisted by father francis who pointed out loudly to people that who stayed behind be bound to make a much sacrifice of worldly good a who went to war might make of life life land be alike at service of god must land be sold must be good deed to sell a must not be must at least sell that must pledge property if must find lender in order to contribute to need of lord fitting out of great enterprise preparation be at last complete gallant band gathered at castle ready for starting consisted of two hundred men at arm led by six knight of one hundred bowman dressed in lincoln green with quilted jerkin to keep out arrow of enemy country from around gathered to see start dame editha be there by side stood earl little daughter earl be in armor beside rode cuthbert in gay attire of page just at moment however face did not agree with costume for although strove best to look bright smiling be hard task to prevent tear from filling eye at departure from mother good lady cried unrestrainedly margaret joined in tear people who have gathered round cheered lustily trumpet blew gay fanfaronade squire threw to wind earl color be mere pleasure trip on be starting for knew that of preceding crusade not one in ten of who have gone so gladly forth have ever returned must not be supposed that whole of present be animated by strong religious feeling doubt there existed desire be carefully fanned by preaching of priest monk to rescue holy sepulcher from hand of saracen far stronger feeling be to be found in warlike nature of people in day knight men at arm indeed men of rank be full of combative spirit life in castle hut be alike dull monotonous excitement of war adventure be greatly looked for a mean of obtaining glory booty for change afforded to dreary monotony of life there be little to tell of journey of earl of evesham band through england to southampton at place took ship crossed to france rather to normandy for in day be regarded a indeed formed part of england cuthbert a be natural to age be full of delight at varying scene through passed town be to especial source of wonder for have never visited other than of worcester to have once twice be taken on occasion of high festival havre be in day important place being landing place of great portion of english band be full of bustle excitement day ship brought in noble following king of england be already in normandy hastening preparation band a landed marched down to meeting place on plain of vezelay already began to experience taste of hardship be to endure in day there be regular supply train for army division band supported by purchase pillage a case might be from surrounding country a english troop be marching through friendly country pillage be of course strictly forbidden while many of leader paid for have must be owned that among smaller leader be many who took anything that required with without payment country be eaten up population in day be sparse movement of so large number of men along certain route completely exhausted resource of inhabitant although willing to pay for that men required earl of evesham have frequently to lie down on turf supperless if be case now said to cuthbert what will be after have joined french army methinks whatever may do if reach holy land that have fair chance of being starved before sail after long succession of march arrived in sight of great camp at vezelay be indeed rather canvas town than camp here be gathered nearly one hundred thousand men vast host at time in day far greater in proportion to strength of country than at present tent of leader noble other knight gentleman rose in regular line forming street square great mass of troop however be contented to sleep in open air indeed difficulty of carriage be so great that be only leader who must carry with canvas abode before tent stood lance color of owner side by side in center of camp stood royal pavilion of philip of france richard of england round must be seen gonfalons of noble of western europe nothing must be gayer than aspect of camp a party rode into be rather late great body of host be already assembled cuthbert gazed with delight at varied color gay dress martial knight air of discipline order reigned everywhere be indeed war in most picturesque form form a far a beauty be concerned have be altogether altered indeed destroyed by modern arm in day individual prowess bravery went for everything handful of armored knight be match for thousand of footman battle be decided a much by prowess bravery of leader immediate following a by of great mass of army earl have day before sent on messenger to state that be coming a party entered camp be met by squire of camp marshal who conducted to position allotted to earl tent be soon erected with four five grouped around for knight one being set aside for squire page when be done cuthbert strolled away to look at varied sight of camp military officer in day must be scandalized at scene be going on strict hard military discipline of modern time be then absolutely unknown camp be moving town to flocked country people with good smith armorer erected forge minstrel troubadour flocked in to sing of former battle to raise spirit of soldier by merry lay of love war simple countryman woman came in to bring present of fowl cake to friend in camp knight rode to fro on gayly caparisoned horse through crowd newly raised levy in many case composed of woodman peasant who have not in course of life wandered league from birthplace gaped in unaffected wonder at sight around while last by mean least maiden good wife of neighborhood fond then a now of brave men gay dress thronged street of camp joined in be cause of merry laughter jest here there little apart from main stream of traffic minstrel must take up position playing gay air soldier lad lass must fall to foot merrily to strain sometimes there must be break in gayety loud shout perhaps fierce oath must rise then maiden must fly like startled fawn men hasten to spot though quarrel might be purely private one yet must happen between retainer of two noble friend of must be sure to strike in serious fray must arise before marshal of camp with posse must arrive to interfere sometimes indeed quarrel became so serious desperate that alliance be broken up great intention frustrated by quarrel of soldiery here there on elevated platform even on top of pile of tub be friar occupied in haranguing soldier in inspiring with enthusiasm for cause upon be embarked conduct of listener showed easily enough motif have brought to war stood with clasped hand eager eye listening to exhortation of priest ready a might be seen from earnest gaze to suffer martyrdom in cause more however stood indifferently round after listening to few word walked on with laugh scoff indeed preaching have already done lay in power who must be moved by exhortation of kind be there upon rest discourse sermon be thrown away several time in course of stroll round camp cuthbert observed beginning of quarrel be in case only checked by intervention of knight other person in authority coming past observed that in instance occurred between men of english of french army between saxon contingent of king richard army french soldier there must indeed be quarrel for saxon understood word of language with norman case be different for norman french be spoken by noble retainer in britain be a nearly a possible same a in use in france seemed however to cuthbert watching narrowly what be going on that there existed by mean good feeling between men of different army thought that divergence so early in campaign boded little good for final success of expedition when returned to tent earl questioned a to what have seen cuthbert frankly acknowledged that appeared to that feeling between men of two army be not good have be earl said to royal camp from what hear cuthbert methinks that there be reason for what say king richard be most loyal gallant of king be haughty hasty in speech norman too have be somewhat accustomed to conquer neighbor may well be that chivalry of france love not however must be hoped that feeling will die away that will emulate other only in deed on battlefield chapter vi list third day after arrival of earl of evesham there be great banquet given by king of france to king richard principal noble among present be earl of evesham cuthbert a page followed to great tent where banquet be prepared here at top of tent on raised dais sat king of france surrounded by courtier earl of evesham having be conducted by herald to dais paid compliment to king be saluted by with many flattering word sound of trumpet be heard richard of england accompanied by principal noble entered be first time that cuthbert have seen king richard be man of splendid stature of enormous strength appearance be in respect rather saxon than norman for hair be light complexion clear bright wore mustache pointed beard at time in fashion although expression be generally that of frankness good humor there might be observed in quick motion piercing glance sign of hasty temper unbridled passion went far to wreck success of enterprise upon be embarked richard possessed most of quality make man great king render idol of subject especially in time of semi civilization when personal prowess be placed at summit of human virtue in dominion there be not one man who in personal conflict be match for king except during fit of passion king richard be generous forgiving royal in mood be incapable of bearing malice although haughty of dignity be entirely free from personal pride while must maintain to death right privilege against monarch must laugh joke with humblest of subject on term of hearty good fellowship be impatient of contradiction eager to carry out whatever have determined upon nothing enraged so much a hesitation procrastination delay be experienced in course of crusade angered more than opposition offered by saracen than hardship through christian host have to pas at flourish of trumpet took seat at dinner place being marked for by herald whose duty be to regulate nicely various rank dignity earl of evesham be placed next to noble of brabant cuthbert took place behind lord served with wine meat brabant being attended by tall youth who be indeed on verge of manhood a dinner went on buzz of conversation became fast furious in day men drank deep quarrel often arose over cup from time that dinner began cuthbert noticed that manner of sir de jacquelin barras count of brabant be rude offensive might be that be accustomed to live alone with retainer that manner be rude coarse to might be that have special hostility to english at rate remark be calculated to fire anger of earl began conversation by wondering how norman baron must live in country like england inhabited by race little above pig earl at once fired up at for norman be now beginning to feel english to resent attack upon people for whom grandfather have entertained contempt angrily repelled attack upon by brabant knight asserted at once that saxon be bit a civilized in respect superior to norman french ill feeling thus began at starting clearly waxed stronger a dinner went on brabant knight drank deeply although talk be not clearly directed against english yet continued to throw out innuendo side attack to talk with vague boastfulness greatly irritated sir walter presently a cuthbert be about to serve master with cup of wine tall page pushed suddenly against spilling portion of wine over dress what clumsy child said scoffingly be rough ill mannered loon cuthbert said angrily be in other presence must chastise a deserve tall page burst into mocking laugh chastise said why must put in pocket for little hop of thumb a be think said sir jacquelin for boy voice rose loud to earl have better send that brat home order to be whipped sir count said earl manner be insolent be not engaged upon crusade must please much to give lesson on score higher higher dispute rose until angry word caught ear of king amid general buzz of voice king philip rose speaking word to king richard moved from table thus giving sign for breaking up of feast immediately afterward page touched earl sir jacquelin upon shoulder told that king desired to speak with in tent of king of france two noble strode through crowd regarding other with eye much like of two dog eager to fly at other throat lord lord said king philip when entered be against law reason for shame to be brawling at table must not say aught openly methinks be early indeed for knight noble engaged in common work to fall to word majesty said earl of evesham regret deeply what have happened seemed from time sat down to meal that lord sought to pas quarrel upon now beseech majesty that will permit to settle difference in list king richard gave sound of assent king of france shook head gravely do forget said mission upon be assembled here have not knight noble in army taken solemn oath to put aside private quarrel feud until holy sepulcher be taken will at very going off show that oath be mere form of word will show before face of christendom that knight of cross be unable to avoid flying at other throat even while on way to wrest holy sepulcher from infidel sir must lay aside feud must promise good brother here that will keep peace between until war be over whose fault be that quarrel began know not may be that lord of brabant be discourteous may be that earl here be too hot whichever be matter not quarrel sire said sir jacquelin arose from dispute between page who be nigh coming to blow in majesty presence desired earl to chide insolence of varlet instead of so doing met remark with scorn pooh pooh said king richard there be plenty of ground for quarrel without two noble interfering in squabble of boy let fight will harm one by bye majesty said turning to king of france with laugh if master may not fight there be reason in world why varlet must not be sorely dull for want of amusement let have list to morrow let page fight out for honor of master nation be scarce worth while to have list set for two boy to fight said king of france oh need not have regular list said king richard leave matter in hand warrant that if cockerel be well plucked will make sport what say gentleman brabant noble at once assented answering that be sure that page must be glad to enter list earl gave similar assent for have not noticed how great be discrepancy between size of future combatant be agreed then said king richard joyously will have piece of ground marked out on edge of camp to morrow morning will be kept by men at arm there will be raised place for king philip who will be judge of conflict will fight on foot on horse on foot on foot said king of france must be pity knightly exercise must be brought to scorn by failure on part on horseback on foot at least will be fair struggle what arm will use brabant knight asked oh sword battle ax of course said king richard with laugh before go king philip said must shake hand swear to let quarrel between drop at least until after return if still wish to shed other blood will offer hindrance thereto earl count jacquelin touched other hand in obedience to order went out of tent together strode off without word in different direction dear lad earl of evesham said on entering tent where page be waiting be serious business king have ordered little count to put aside difference till after crusade in accordance with oath a have in wise pledged in same fashion a majesty feel somewhat dull while waiting here be determined that quarrel between count between count page will be settled by fight between two in presence of king well sir cuthbert said be glad that must be seeing varlet insulted without cause purposely upset cup over what be like earl asked dost think that be fair match doubt not that be fair match enough cuthbert said a know sir have be well trained to arm of kind by father by men at arm at castle must hold own against of men with light weapon have then fear that gawky loon twenty year old though seems to be will bring disgrace upon discredit upon nation if thou thinkest so earl said matter can go on have be otherwise must have gone to king protested that advantage of age be so great that must be murder to place in list together there be cuthbert said at most greater difference between than between strong man weak one in ordeal of battle have to meet in list indeed doubt if difference be so great for if be foot taller than methinks round shoulder must have advantage of send armorer earl said must choose proper suit for fear that mine must be of little use doubtless there be smaller suit among friend simpler lighter better cuthbert said 'd rather have light coat of mail steel cap than heavy armor helmet must press down visor through must scarce see lighter better for after if sword can not keep head sooner later armor must fail to do so too armorer speedily arrived knight follower of earl being called in case stated there be soon found coat of fine linked mail fitted cuthbert well a to steel cap there be difficulty must have plume at least earl said took feather from own casque fastened in will want light sword battle ax cuthbert said arm be pretty well used to of men at arm must wield father sword be heavy one lightest of earl weapon be chosen be agreed that be now ready for conflict to morrow in morning there be slight bustle in camp news that fight be to take place between english brabant page by permission of king of england france that majesty be to be present that be to be conducted on regular rule caused stir of excitement novelty in camp nowhere be life duller than among large body of men kept together for time under canvas thought of combat of novel kind excited general interest in meadow at short distance from camp body of king richard men at arm marked off oval space of about acre upon one side of tent be pitched for king small tent be placed at end for combatant round inclosure men at arm formed ring behind dense body of spectator gathered place being set aside for noble others of gentle blood at hour fixed king of england france arrived together king richard be evidently in state of high good humor for preferred clash of arm sight of combat to other pleasure king of france on other hand looked grave be far wiser more politic king than richard although have consented to sudden proposal yet felt in heart that contest be foolish one that might create bad feeling among men of two nationality way went have reserved to right of throwing down baton when combat be to cease determined to avail of right to put stop to conflict before party be likely to sustain deadly injury when monarch have taken place trumpeter sounded trumpet two combatant advanced on foot from end of list murmur of surprise dissatisfaction broke from crowd lord of evesham king said angrily to earl who with count jacquelin be standing by royal party thou shouldst have said that difference between two be too great to allow combat to be possible frenchman appears to be big enough to take page under arm walk off with difference be indeed very striking french champion be arrayed in full suit of knightly armor of course without gold spur be distinguishing mark of rank with helmet lofty plume of feather appeared to tower above cuthbert who in close fitting steel cap link armor seemed very dwarf by side of giant be not size sire muscle pluck will win in combat like majesty need not be afraid that page will disgrace be of blood though kinship be not close be of mixed saxon norman strain will believe do discredit to either king brow cleared for in truth be very proud of english nationality must have be sorely vexed to see discomfiture of english champion even though champion be boy brother philip said turning to king will wager gold chain against yours on yonder stripling methinks that be robbery to take wager king of france said difference between bulk be disproportionate however will not balk wish chain against yours rule of fight be that be to commence with sword that must if chose use battle ax fight need scarcely be described at length for advantage be one way cuthbert be fully match in strength for antagonist although standing nigh foot shorter constant exercise however

in light attire of page cuthbert felt that blood running from wound be weakening fast that unless must gain refuge course must speedily come to end happily saw at little distance ahead of man standing by door just a arrived door opened glow of light from within fell on road showing that person entering be monk without moment hesitation cuthbert rushed through door shouting sanctuary sank almost fainting on ground monk accustomed to wild pursuit scene of outrage in warlike day hastily closed door barring securely in moment there be rush of men against from without one of monk opened lattice above door what mean said by outrage know ye not that be monastery of st john that be sacrilege to lay hand of violence even against postern begone said will lodge complaint before king assailant

at marseille how be that lad so young a can have incurred enmity of who sought life for be clear from pertinacity with urged attack that object be not plunder of indeed must get little from to take life cuthbert recounted circumstance have led to feud of count of brabant against for doubted not that truculent knight be at bottom of attack after what have happened monk said will need have caution when leave here place where have taken refuge be known to must wild noble persist in desire for vengeance against will doubtless leave of ruffian to watch monastery will keep lookout note if stranger be to be seen near gate if find that be so will consider what be best to be done must of course appeal to mayor for protection against must even have stranger ejected from town cast into prison be not likely that must succeed in capturing more than fellow who may be placed on lookout danger must be in wise lessened to yourself there be time to talk over matter before leave will be fortnight at least before will be able to pursue journey cuthbert gained strength more rapidly than monk have expected be generously fed good constitution soon enabled to recover from loss of blood at end of five day expressed hope that must on following day pursue journey monk who attended shook head thou mightst under ordinary circumstance quit to morrow for thou art well enough to take part in ordinary pursuit of page to journey be different thing may have sort of hardship to endure may have even to trust for life to speed endurance must be madness for to go until strength be fully established regret to tell that have ascertained beyond doubt that monastery be closely watched have sent of acolyte out dressed in garb of monk attended by one of elder brother in case monk who followed at distance of fifty yard be able to perceive that be watched town be full of rough men hanger on of army indeed be follower of laggard knight greater portion be men who merely pursue army with view to gain by necessity to buy plunder from soldier to rob if necessary to murder must there be hope of obtaining gold among men enemy must have little difficulty in recruiting number appeal that must make to mayor must protect from when have left wall must trust to ingenuity in smuggling out after that be upon own strength shrewdness that must rely for escape from snare may be laid for will see then at least three four day be needed before can set forth countryman be so far away that matter of few day will make little difference will in case be delayed for long time at marseille before embark whether leave now month hence must be equally in time to join before embarkation be supposing that make way through snare beset cuthbert saw justice of reasoning be week before announced a feeling absolutely restored to strength again capable of bearing a much exertion a must have done before attack long consultation be held with prior monk who have acted a leech a to best plan of getting cuthbert beyond wall of city many scheme be proposed rejected monk who ventured beyond wall have be closely scrutinized one two of short stature have even be jostled in street so a to throw back hood expose sight of face be clear then that must be dangerous to trust to disguise cuthbert proposed that must leave at night trusting solely to direction a to turning must take to bring to city wall that taking rope must there let down make best of way forward however monk must not consent to assuring that watch be so strictly kept round monastery that must inevitably be seen prior said method whatever be must be a open a possible though can not at moment hit upon plan will think over to night putting idea with of father jerome here sacristan who have shrewd head will be hard if can not between contrive plan to evade watch of robber villain who beset convent next morning when prior came in to see cuthbert latter said good father have determined not to endeavor to make off in disguise doubt not that wit must contrive mean by must get clear of wall without observation from scout of villain noble once in country must have horse armor must have hard work indeed to make way down through france even though none of enemy be on track will therefore if please go down boldly to mayor claim protection escort if will grant few men at arm for one day ride from town can choose own route riding out in mail can then take chance of finding way down to marseille will go down with son prior said to mayor two of monk will accompany assuredly insult will be offered to in street thus accompanied shortly afterward cuthbert started a arranged soon arrived at house of mayor sir john de cahors upon prior making known to knight whom have brought with mayor exclaimed peste young

down stated that page be missing that there be reason to believe that have be foully murdered a have accompanied man found wounded fortunately bulk of army have marched away at early dawn earl have only remained behind in consequence of absence of follower assured angry englishman must have thorough search made in town although in way satisfied rode off after king with force carrying with long limbed man whom have picked up two day after message came back from king richard saying that unless missing page be discovered if being killed murderer be not brought to justice punished must

might disappear without being able to obtain clew doubted not indeed that body have be thrown in river that must never hear more of be right glad that have be restored not indeed from fear of threat of king master because from what earl of evesham said be lad likely to come to great fame honor earl left in charge horse armor said wore at tournament lately in case must hear aught of cuthbert gave exclamation of pleasure purse contained few piece of silver being without arm except for short dagger mean of locomotion difficulty of journey down to marseille have sorely puzzled with good horse between knee suit of milan armor on back thought that might make way through danger threatened prior now told knight circumstance have occurred showed that be known to assailant of cuthbert that have taken refuge in convent over strict watch have be kept by cuthbert enemy if must find varlet must hang over gate of town knight said wrathfully a at present moment there be nearly a many rogue a honest men in place must be wholesale hanging indeed to insure getting hold of right people moreover be not probable that attempt upon life will be made inside wall doubtless main body of gang be somewhere without intending to assault when continues journey have left spy two here to inform a to movement will give aid in power young sir army be by time nigh marseille sooth to say have body of men at arm whom must send a escort for so long distance have small body here be needed sorely too to keep order within wall thought sir cuthbert said that if must lend party of say four men at arm to ride with for first day must then trust to myself especially if must procure one honest man to act a guide companion doubtless suppose must travel by main road south by going first day journey east west then striking southward road must get fair start of throw plan out perchance reach marseille without interruption knight willingly agreed to furnish four men at arm trustworthy guide who must at least take a far south a avignon will said tell men at arm off to night will be at western gate at daybreak with pas permitting to ride through guide will be at convent door hour earlier will send up to night armor horse here be purse earl of evesham also left for use be there aught else can do for nothing sir cuthbert said if regain army in safety will have pleasure in reporting to king richard

hostelry guide looking to two horse cuthbert be pleased with appearance of man who have be placed at disposal be young fellow of twenty two twenty three with honest face be told cuthbert son of small farmer near avignon having fancy for trade have be apprenticed to master smith having served apprenticeship found that have mistaken vocation intended to return to paternal vineyard cuthbert calculated that must make at least four day journey to south before must meet with danger doubtless exit from convent have be discovered moment gate of city be opened spy must have proceeded south to warn comrade must doubtless have taken road at distance must again take on to by cuthbert must be now traveling a however rode fast made long march day hoped that might succeed in distancing unfortunately upon third day horse cast shoe smith must be met with until end of day journey consequently short distance must be done at slow pace upon fifth day after first start arrived at small town next morning cuthbert on rising found that guide did not present a usual making inquiry found that young man have gone out evening before have not returned extremely uneasy at circumstance cuthbert went to city guard thinking that perhaps guide might have got drunk be shut up in cell news however be to be obtained there after waiting hour feeling sure that harm have befallen gave notice to authority of loss then mounting horse leaving money with landlord of hostelry to give to guide in case latter must return started at midday by southern road felt sure now that be overtaken determined to keep eye faculty thoroughly on watch road in day be mere track here there little village be to be met with country be sparsely cultivated traveling lonely work cuthbert rode fast carefully avoiding copse small wood through road ran by making circuit round coming on to again on other side horse be excellent one gift of earl have little fear with light weight of being overtaken if must once leave enemy behind at length approached extensive forest stretched for mile on side mile before reached track divided have for little time eased horse down to walk a felt that wood must be spot where must in probability be attacked needed that steed must be possessed of utmost vigor at spot where track branched man in guise of mendicant be sitting begged for alms cuthbert threw small coin sudden thought struck a heard rustling in bush near be nearest best road to avignon said right hand road be best shortest beggar said other make long circuit lead through several marsh honor will find hard to pas cuthbert thanked moved forward still at walk along right hand road when have gone about two hundred yard be hidden from sight of man have left country being rough scattered with clump of bush halted a expected heard sound of horse hoof coming on at full gallop along other road master must have thought young indeed said to try catch with transparent trick a suppose that accursed page have more than ten men with doubtless have placed five on road fellow be placed here to see track must follow have now gone to give party on left hand news have taken way have not be for must have have to run gantlet with four five of enemy a be path will doubtless be clear so saying turned horse galloped back to spot where track separated then followed left hand route a have hoped passed through wood without incident interruption arrived safely that night at small town having seen sign of enemy next day started again early rode on until midday when halted at large village at be only inn between place from started destination declined offer of servant of inn to take horse round to stable telling man to hold outside door give from sieve few handful of grain then entered inn ate hearty meal a appeared at door saw several men gathered near with single spring threw into saddle just a rush forward be made by standing round man next to sprang upon endeavored to drag from saddle cuthbert drew little dagger called misericorde from belt plunged into throat then seizing short mace hung at saddlebow hurled with force full in face of enemy page of sir philip who be rushing upon sword in hand heavy weapon struck fairly between eye with cry fell back face completely smashed in by blow sword held uplifted to strike flying far through air cuthbert struck spur into horse animal dashed forward with bound cuthbert striking with long sword at one two men who made snatch at rein in minute be cantering out of village convinced that have killed leader of foe that be safe now to pursue rest of journey on to marseille so turned out without further incident traveled through south of france arrived at great seaport speedily discovered quarter in earl of evesham contingent be encamped made toward without delay a entered wild shout of joy be heard cnut ran forward with many gesture of delight dear cuthbert dear cuthbert exclaimed can be true that have escaped gave up although did best yet have not survived must never have forgiven believing that might have somehow done better have saved from cutthroat who attacked thanks thanks good cnut cuthbert cried have be through time of peril doubt a see be hale well better methinks than be for look pale ill doubt not that wound received be mere scratch to bore down sounded indeed like blow of smith hammer upon anvil fortunately steel cap saved head somewhat cnut said head be none of thinnest tried sorely confess however now that be back will doubt not soon be a strong a ever be think that fretting for absence have kept back more than inflammation from wound there be earl at door of tent through forester retainer who have at cnut shout of joy crowded up cuthbert made way shaking hand right left with men among whom be greatly loved for regarded a being in great degree cause of having be freed from outlawry restored to civil life again earl be really affected a cuthbert rode up held out arm a page alighted embraced a father dear cuthbert exclaimed what anxiety have not suffered have be own son must not have felt more loss did not doubt for instant that have fallen into hand of of retainer of villain count from must learn from absence of dead body by side of of cnut imagined that must have be carried off be clear that chance of life if fell into hand of evil page equally vile master be small indeed very day that cnut be brought in visited french camp accused of having be cause of disappearance cnut wound affected greatest astonishment at charge have not a said be out of camp for two day accusation be unfounded malicious must answer a well a previous outrage when vow of crusader to keep peace among be at end of course have mean of proving what said must have gone direct to king charged with outrage a be gained nothing by pain have accompanied french division to genoa when meet at sicily where two army be to rendezvous will bring matter before king a fact that page be certainly concerned in must be taken a showing that be instigator must lord earl be perhaps better cuthbert said if might venture to advise to leave matter alone doubt count must say that have discharged page after tournament that latter be only carrying out private feud with must not be able to disprove story must gain satisfaction by matter earl admitted justice of cuthbert reasoning reserved to task of punishing author of outrage upon first fitting opportunity there be weary delay at marseille before expedition set sail be caused by fact of english fleet have be ordered to be there upon arrival failing to keep agreement word english fleet badly describe vessel be to carry english contingent to destination be ship belonging to maritime nation of italy venetian genoese pisans etc for england at time have few of own scarcely fitted for stormy navigation of bay of biscay king richard impatient a ever of delay at last lost temper embarked on board ship with few of chosen knight set sail by for sicily point at two army of expedition be to reunite few day after departure long looked for fleet arrived portion of english host embarked at once set sail for sicily where be to be landed ship be to return to fetch remaining contingent sea voyage of kind in day be serious matter long voyage be rare troop be carried very much upon principle of herring be be packed a close a must be without reference to comfort a voyage seldom lasted more than twenty four hour did not much matter during long voyage discomfort a may be said suffering of troop be considerable so tightly packed be galley in english set sail from marseille that there be walking about man slept where sat considered lucky indeed if must obtain room sufficient to stretch at full length most slept sitting against bulwark other support in cabin where knight page squire be placed crowding be of course le excessive even here amount of space subaltern traveling to india for first time nowadays must grumble at be considered amply sufficient for dozen knight of distinction be week after sailing when cnut touched cuthbert arm a came on deck one morning said look look cuthbert mountain standing up in water have caught fire on top did ever see such thing soldier crowded to side of vessel in intense astonishment little awe from top of lofty rugged hill rising almost straight from sea flame be roaring up smoke hung over island stone be thrown into air rattled down side of hill fell into sea with splash be fearsome sight cnut said crossing look a if be mouth of purgatory exclaimed standing by cuthbert be amazed for instruction have received from father francis be of too slight nature to include story of volcano priest however who accompanied ship in character of leech confessor explained nature of phenomenon to astonished listener told that over on mainland be mountain at time vomited forth such mass of stone of liquid rock that have swallowed up covered many great city there be also told mountain of same sort even more vast on island of sicily that have seldom a far back a man must remember done great harm sailing on in day arrived off coast of sicily sailing up strait between mainland landed at messina here considerable portion of french army have already arrived having be brought down from genoa there be news of king of england a often happens saying more haste le speed have be verified here be day later before king richard arrived having be driven from course by tempest well nigh cast ashore having besides gone through many adventure three week later whole of army of crusader be gathered around messina where be intended to remain little time before starting be gay time king vied with other in entertainment joustings tournament italian knight also made brave show might have be thought that huge army of men be gathered there simply for amusement feasting in tournament effort be made to prevent feeling of national rivalry although party of knight held own against comer be most carefully selected to represent several nationality therefore victory on side fell excited feeling of bitterness alone king richard be undoubtedly strongest cavalier of two army against ponderous strength knight must keep seat be so palpable that after many victory king richard be forced to retire from list from want of competitor to take place on dais with more peace loving king of france gayety of camp be heightened by arrival of many noble dame from italy here too came queen of navarre bringing with beautiful princess berengaria methinks earl of evesham said to cuthbert fortnight after arrival of queen unless eye deceive princess be likely to be cause of trouble in what way asked cuthbert with surprise for have be struck with marvelous beauty wondered greatly what mischief so fair being must do by way in good lord king gaze upon methinks that be like enough that broke off engagement with prince of france for sake of fair eye of damsel be indeed misfortune cuthbert said gravely for saw at once anger course must excite in mind of french king knight who must naturally be indignant in extreme at slight put upon princess a day after day passed became evident to that king of england be infatuated by princess again entered list a fresh italian knight others have arrived found fresh opponent conspicuously laid spoil of victory at foot of princess whom selected a queen of beauty sort of rumor now became current in camp violent quarrel between king bad feeling between french english knight broke out again in consequence more violently than before chapter ix princess berengaria one night chanced that cuthbert be late in return to camp road took through portion of french encampment night be dark cuthbert presently completely lost idea a to bearing presently nearly ran against tent made way to entrance in order to crave direction a to way for be wet night rain be pouring in torrent few be about of whom must demand way a be about to draw aside hanging heard word said in passionate voice caused to withdraw hand suddenly tell said voice must rather drive dagger into heart than allow own princess to be insulted by hot headed island dog be sad indeed said in calmer smoother tone that success of great expedition like have for object recovery of holy sepulcher from infidel must be wrecked by headstrong fancy of one man be even a be told by old grecian poet a when helen caused great war between people of nation know nothing voice said of helen greek of poet be shifty race can believe aught be bad of touching princess of navarre agree with friend must be righteous deed to poniard so to remove cause of dispute between two king indeed two nation insult laid upon princess be more than a french knight gentleman can brook if king say word there be not gentleman in army will be ready to turn sword against islander then smooth voice spoke again must brother be wrong useless to shed blood methinks that if apple of discord must be removed good work must be done not a friend count have suggested by stab of dagger indeed must be worse than useless surely there be score of religious house where bird might be placed in cage without soul knowing where be where might pas life in prayer that may be pardoned for having caused grave hazard of failure of enterprise in christian world be concerned voice of speaker now fell cuthbert be straining ear to listen when heard footstep approaching tent glided away into darkness with great difficulty be recovered road to camp when reached tent confided to earl of evesham what have heard be serious indeed earl said bodes little trouble danger be true that passion king richard have conceived for berengaria bid fair to wreck crusade by anger have excited in french king noble disappearance of princess must no le fatally interfere with for king must be like raging lion deprived of whelp must certainly move foot eastward until have exhausted mean in power of tracing lost lady love must not suppose cuthbert point out tent where conversation took place must not cuthbert answered in darkness one tent be like think must recognize voice of speaker did hear again indeed one voice did recognize be that of count of brabant with whom have trouble before be good earl said because have at least object to watch must never do to tell king what have heard in first place anger must be so great that must burst bound must cause likely enough battle at once between two army must have good effect for of brabant must of course deny truth of assertion must declare be merely got up story to discredit with king so to wipe out old score now standing between if be to succeed alike in preventing harm happening to princess open break between two monarch must be done by keeping guard over princess unsuspected by frustrating attempt may be made cuthbert expressed willingness to carry out instruction earl might give much disturbed by event of day earl page retired to rest to think over what plan have best be adopted princess be staying at palace of bishop of town having residence short distance outside wall have placed at disposal of queen of navarre suite first step of cuthbert in morning be to go into town to reconnoiter position appearance of building be large irregular pile communicated with two monastery lying alongside of must therefore clearly be most difficult thing to keep up complete watch on exterior of so large building there be so many way in princess might be captured carried off by unscrupulous men cuthbert in vain thought over plan by must be possible to safeguard might be seized upon returning from tournament entertainment be improbable a queen must always have escort of knight with attempt must be successful except at cost of public fracas much loss of blood cuthbert regarded a out of question that outrage of kind must be attempted fact that one of speaker in tent have used word son showed that one priest monk at least be connected with plot be possible that man might have power in one of monastery might be agent of bishop cuthbert saw that must be easy enough in night for party from one other of monastery to enter by door of communication with palace carry off princess without slightest alarm being given once within wall of convent must be hidden in dungeon secret place building of kind be sure to posse must be at once carried out by quiet entrance taken into country transferred to other building in town when cuthbert joined earl told observation that have made sir walter praised judgment have shown in conclusion earl be of opinion that must be absolutely necessary to get clew a to course abductor purposed to take indeed be possible that on after consideration might drop plan altogether for word cuthbert have overheard scarcely betokened plan completely formed finally decided upon great point considered therefore be that tent of old enemy must be carefully watched that endeavor must be made to hear something of what passed within might give clew to plan fixed upon did not of course know whether tent in conversation have be heard by cuthbert be that of sir de jacquelin barras of one of other person who have spoken cuthbert suggested that first thing must be to find out whether count after be in habit of going to other tent whether on other hand remained within be visited by others be easy of course to discover be tent cuthbert soon got position then took cnut into counsel matter be difficult cnut said see way by watch can be kept up by day after dark have several men in band who can track deer surely must manage to follow step of baron without being observed there be little jack who be bigger than boy of twelve although can shoot run play with quarterstaff if need be with bill against best man in troop warrant that if show tent will keep such sharp watch that one will enter depart without knowing where go to on dark night will be able to slip among tent to move here there without being seen can creep on stomach without moving leaf trust eye of french men at arm will look in vain for glimpse of understand cnut want to know be whether other conspirator in matter visit tent whether go to theirs understand cnut said be first point to be arrived at three day later cnut brought news that night after dark party of five men met in tent be watched that one of five always came out when have assembled took station before entrance of tent so a to be sure that eavesdropper be near cuthbert smiled be case of locking door after horse have gone what be to be done now cnut asked will talk with earl before tell cnut matter be too serious for to take step without consulting sir walter night there be long talk between earl page a to best course to be pursued be clear that old enemy be leading person in plot that only plan to baffle with fair chance of success be to keep constant eye upon movement also to have three four of sturdiest men of band told off to watch without being perceived time that princess be in palace earl of evesham left arrangement entirely in hand of page of whose good sense sagacity have very high opinion own first impulse have be to go before king denounce count of brabant ill will between be already well known for not only be there original dispute at banquet when two army have joined at sicily king richard who have heard from earl of attempt at assassination of cuthbert have laid complaint before king philip of conduct of subject sir de jacquelin barras however have denied that have finger in matter have said discharged page after encounter with cuthbert knew nothing further whatever of movement although be morally certain that page must not have purchased service of men who assisted from own purse gain by mean of persuasion that be follower of count of brabant ruffian hired with money a proof must be obtained matter be allowed to drop earl felt however that accusation against count by of intention to commit high crime merely on evidence of page must appear like attempt to injure fame of rival feeling therefore that nothing must be done save to watch left matter entirely in hand of page telling that must take a many men at arm archer a might choose use in name cnut entered warmly into cuthbert plan finally be arranged between that six of archer must nightly keep watch opposite various entrance of bishop palace of two monastery joining of course must not patrol up down without attracting attention be to take up post where must closely observe entrance be either to lie down feign drunken sleep to conceal within shadow of arch other hiding place down on seashore cuthbert made arrangement with one of owner of small craft lying there that ten of men must sleep on board night together with fisherman accustomed to use of oar cuthbert determined to be always with party night after night passed so long time went by cuthbert began to think design must have be given up however resolved to relax none of watchfulness during remaining time that expedition might stop in sicily be in january three week after first watch have be set when one of men who have be placed to watch entrance to one of monastery leaped on board craft shook cuthbert by shoulder party of five men said have just issued out from monastery be bearing burden what can not see be making in direction of water whistled to dion who be next to in lane be following came on to tell to prepare night be pitch dark be difficult in extreme to see one moving at short distance off there be two three street led from monastery stood at top of town toward sea party coming down might take of according to position in boat be seeking be placed cuthbert now instantly sent five six of men with instruction to avoid noise along line of port with order to bring in word must anyone come down take boat must hear noise in town with sailor loosed rope fastened boat to shore got out oar prepared to put off at moment notice be of course ignorant whether abductor must try to carry princess off by water must hide in one of convent of town be inclined to think that former must be course adopted for king in wrath must be ready to lay town in flame to search convent from top to bottom for princess besides there must be too many aware of secret cuthbert be not wrong in supposition soon man have sent to extreme right came running up with news that boat have embarked at further end with party of ten men on board a came along have warned others in five minute whole party be collected in craft numbering in twelve of cuthbert men six sailor instantly put out rowed in direction in boat must have gone boatman expressing opinion that probably party must make for vessel be lying anchored at little distance from shore bearing of position of ship be known to boatman night be so dark that be quite unable to find order have be given that sound whisper be to be heard on board boat after rowing a far a must boatman said be in

wise good youth princess said holding out hand to cuthbert a duty bound placed to lip request be wise most thoughtful will use poor influence may posse cuthbert must see that blood came back now to

sure that know naught of enterprise have merely carried out order of master vessel have by time brought up close to port princess determined to wait on board until first dawn be seen in sky then under escort of deliverer to go back to palace before town be moving plan be carried out soon after dawn princess be safe in palace from have be carried few hour previously chapter x pirate be not possible that matter of sort must be entirely hushed up not many hour passed before rumor be current of event have taken place though none knew what event be there be report that tire woman of princess berengaria have in night discovered that mistress ' couch be unoccupied that have found sign of struggle have picked up dagger on floor where have evidently fallen from sheath also be said that princess have returned at daylight escorted by armed party that be unable to obtain entrance to palace until one of lady of queen have be fetched down to order sentry at gate to allow to enter be news

beauty high spirit kindness have won heart on part of french on other hand there be great indignation for time be feared that army must come to open blow king philip however although much angered be politic enough to deprecate open outbreak knew that dispute now began must not only at once put stop to crusade that might lead to more serious consequence at home fiery bravery of english king backed a must be by whole strength of subject might render very formidable opponent king felt that private grievance must be laid aside where good of france be concerned still coldness between army increased camp be moved further apart during time that remained in sicily there be little commerce between two force a soon a winter have broken french monarch broke up camp in march sailed for holy land english have expected that marriage ceremony of king princess berengaria must be celebrated before left sicily be not case there be high joustings fete in honor of princess marriage be delayed fortnight after french have sailed english embarked in two hundred ship have be prepared sailed also on way to acre must not be supposed that attempted abduction of princess berengaria be unimportant

happened have expressed high approval of conduct gratification at result learn sir earl said king richard that be to that be indebted for rescue of princess tell that suspecting plot placed guard around bishop palace with strong body on shore ready to rescue from hand of who might attempt to take to sea be a say sire replied earl whole merit of affair rest upon page lad whom may remember a having fought with conquered french page of whose conduct then approved highly may also remember that escaped by display of bravery shrewdness further attempt to assassinate majesty be good enough to make complaint to king philip of conduct of one of noble on head seems that two month since lad in coming through french camp at night missed way accidentally overheard few word spoken in voice recognized a of enemy name of majesty being mentioned deemed duty to listen thus discovered that plot be on foot for carrying off princess after consultation with agreed upon course to be adopted namely to place sentry round bishop place building adjoining who must follow bring word must be taken to place in town while band be placed on shore in readiness to interfere at once to prevent being carried away by sea undertook management of detail having with trusty squire who command saxon bowman for own part thank lord king said believe will not find richard ungrateful a to page appears brave wise beyond year be not that think that must not be good for might attract envy upon part of others must at once make knight already have promise will do so on first occasion when can show prowess upon infidel bring to to morrow when princess will be here with queen of navarre at banquet must fain thank before although have agreed at princess earnest solicitation to take further notice of matter to allow to pas a if have not be yet can not forgive treachery have be used without letting know exactly what have occurred must fain by reception of page let men see that something of great import have happened of nature of doubt not that rumor will give notion upon following day therefore cuthbert to confusion found center of royal circle king expressed to in most gracious manner patting on shoulder said that must be one day one of best bravest of knight princess queen of navarre gave hand to kiss somewhat overwhelmed withdrew from royal presence center of attention in mind of envy cnut too did not pas unrewarded majesty finding that cnut be of gentle saxon blood gave gold chain in token of favor distributed heavy purse among men who have followed when british fleet

alive with light color king ship advanced in van round be vessel containing principal follower queen of navarre princess berengaria be with fleet strain of music rose from water never be circumstance of war exhibited in more picturesque form for two day expedition sailed on then change of sudden disastrous kind took place what be bustle about cuthbert said to cnut sailor be running up ladder seems confusion methinks said cnut that be about to have storm few minute ago scarce cloud be to be seen now that bank over there have risen halfway up sky sailor be accustomed to treacherous sea warning have not noticed have doubt be clear enough to with great rapidity sail of fleet came down in five minute whole aspect be changed quickly a sailor have done work storm be even more rapid in progress of ship whose crew be slower le skillful than others be caught by gale before must get sail snug great sheet of white canvas be blown from bolt rope a if made of paper blackness must almost be felt covered sea only light being that given by frothing water there be longer thought of order ship have to shift for captain to do best to save under charge without thought of what might befall others in

have thought prudent to keep spread in minute from time be struck lofty hulk be tearing along through water at tremendous speed four of best hand be placed at helm here captain took post danger be now that in darkness might run against one of consort even in war of element must hear from time to time crash a of vessel striking against other with shout cry once twice from darkness ship emerged close on one hand other steadiness of captain in case saved ship from collision a storm continued glimpse of other vessel became more more rare ship being very fast sailer captain indulged hope that be now clear of rest of fleet now attempted to lie to to storm wind be too strong ship in day too be so high out of water offered in target to wind that be useless to adopt other maneuver than to run before for two day night tempest raged what think earl said to captain of position where be where will course upon be running take can not say with certainty captain said for wind have shifted several time have hoped to gain shelter of rhodes shift of wind bore away from there much fear that from direction in have be running must be very nigh on coast of africa peste earl said must indeed be speedy end to crusade moor be pirate cutthroat to man even must avoid risk of being dashed to piece must end life a slave to one of black infidel three hour later captain prophecy turned out right breaker be seen in various point in front with greatest difficulty vessel be steered through opening between in few minute struck heavily one of mast went over side lay fast immovable fortunately outside bank of sand acted a sort of breakwater have struck upon good ship must have gone to piece instantly although wave still struck with considerable force captain have good hope that must not break up darkness came on tempest seemed to lull a there be immediate danger be exhausted by tossing have received during last forty eight hour crew of rose slept soundly in morning sun rose brilliantly there be sign of great storm have scattered fleet of england shore be to be seen at distance of four mile be low sandy with lofty mountain in distance far inland white town with minaret dome must be seen know where be earl asked a far a can tell captain said have be driven up bay called little syrtis place full of shoal willow abounding with pirate of worst kind think that ship have suffered injury whether have done so not captain said fear greatly that be fast in sand even lightening of cargo will scarce get off must try at least be little time that will have to try master captain cuthbert who be standing close said think two long ship be putting out from town will have something to say to be too true captain said be galley of moorish corsair be thirty forty oar draw little water will be here like wind what do advise asked earl falconets have upon poop can make poor resistance to boat can row around be doubt furnished with heavy metal will quickly perceive that be aground defenseless will be able to plump shot into until have knocked good ship to piece however will fight to last will not be said that earl of evesham be taken by infidel dog sold a slave without striking blow in defense cuthbert stood watching corsair be now rowing toward at speed methinks lord said presently if might venture to give opinion that might yet trick infidel a how cuthbert earl said speak out know have great faith in sagacity think page said that did send men below leaving only crew of vessel on deck must take for merchant ship have be wrecked here exercise little care how approach men on deck might make show of firing once twice with falconets pirate disdaining such foe must row alongside once there might fasten one to side with grapnel then methinks that english bill bow will render more than match for moorish pirate one of craft can scarcely carry more men than have must propose to take one of by force drive pirate overboard take possession of if possible beat off consort then take most valuable store from ship make way a best can to north well thought of exclaimed earl cordially have indeed imagined plan promise well what think captain think lord genoese said that plan be excellent one promise success if men will go below holding arm in readiness for signal mine will prepare grapnel rope first of craft come alongside will lash so securely to rose that warrant get not away preparation be soon made soldier who at first have be filled with apprehension at thought of slavery among infidel be now delighted at prospect of struggle ending in escape archer prepared bow arrow stood behind porthole in readiness to pour volley into enemy men at arm grasped pike sword while above sailor moved hither thither a if making preparation for defense in reality preparing grapnel rope one of pirate be faster than other soon coming within reach opened fire upon rose with heavy cannon carried in bow crew of rose replied with falconets sakers from poop corsair at first did not keep course direct for ship rowed once twice round firing a did so then apparently satisfied that great precaution need be observed with feebly manned ship in so great strait a rose set up wild cry of allah rowed toward in two minute corsair be alongside of rose fierce crew be climbing up side a came alongside sailor cast grapnel into rigging fastened to rose then loud shout of hurrah for england be heard port opened volley of arrow be poured upon astonished corsair from deck above assailant be thrown back into galley swarm of heavily armed men leaped down from ship upon taken by surprise indeed outnumbered resistance of corsair be slight in close fierce melee like light armed moor have little chance with mail clad english whose heavy sword ax clove defense at blow fight lasted three minute then last of corsair be overboard men who rowed galley have uttered most piercing cry while conflict have be raging be unable to take part in have be disposed to do so for be slave chained to oar scarcely have conflict ended when other galley arrived upon scene seeing what have happened that consort have fallen into hand of english at once turned head rowed back rapidly to town from have come among slave who rowed galley be many white men cry of joy at liberation greatly affected who have thus unexpectedly rescued hammer be soon brought into requisition shackle struck off scene of affecting joy took place slave be of nationality italian spaniard french greek formed principal part there be time however to be lost arm munition of war be hastily removed from rose together with most valuable of store galley slave again took place time willingly at oar place of weakest being supplied by english whose want of skill be made up by alacrity with threw strength into work in hour

started with three others at once set out in pursuit while from narrow creek two other galley made appearance there be few word of question among english whether to stop give battle to opponent to make way with speed latter counsel prevailed earl pointing out that life be now scarcely own that have right on way to holy sepulcher to risk unnecessarily fortunately have in hand to fight escape a chose for doubly banked a oar now be there be little chance of enemy galley overtaking gradually a rowed to sea pursuing vessel became smaller smaller to view until at last be seen to turn about make again for land after consultation between earl captain of lost ship be determined to make for rhodes have be settled a halting point for fleet earl thought probable that greater portion of scattered by storm must rendezvous there so proved after voyage although not very long be tedious owing to number of men cramped up in so small craft came within sight of port of rhodes be greatly pleased at seeing perfect forest of mast there showing that at least greater portion of fleet have survived storm be indeed fact number of other single ship dropped in during next day two there be great astonishment on part of fleet when long swift galley be seen approaching numerous conjecture be offered a to what message pirate must be bringing for there be mistaking appearance of long dangerous looking craft when upon approach standard of earl of evesham be seen flying on bow great shout of welcome arose from fleet king richard who happened to be on deck of royal ship shouted to earl to come on board tell what masquerading be doing there earl of course obeyed order anchoring near royal vessel going on board in small boat taking with page squire king heard with great interest tale of adventure of rose when earl of evesham said that be to cuthbert be due thought of stratagem by galley be captured crew saved from being carried away into hopeless slavery king patted boy on shoulder

by sending flight of arrow into town be answered from wall by shower of stone dart from machine there be time wasted vessel be headed toward shore a water be deep many of be able to run close alongside rocky wharf in instant regardless of storm of weapon poured down by defender english leaped ashore archer kept up so terrible rain of missile against battlement that defender must scarcely show for instant there men at arm placing ladder against speedily mounted putting aside opposition poured into town effeminate greek soldier of monarch must offer effectual resistance whatever fled from palace gained open country followed by few adherent english gained considerable booty for in day town taken by assault be always looked upon a property of captor queen of navarre princess be rescued king richard however be not satisfied with success have gained be determined to punish insolent little king accordingly english be set in motion into interior town after town speedily fell

sight of white wall of acre be on june that fleet sailed into port of town tremendous acclamation greeted arrival of english army by host assembled on shore acre have be besieged for two year in vain even arrival of french army under philip augustus have failed to turn scale inhabitant defended with desperate bravery assault upon wall have be repulsed with immense slaughter at great distance off sultan saladin with large army be watching progress of siege fame of king richard english be so great however that besieger have little doubt that arrival must change position of thing even french in spite of bad feeling have existed in sicily joined with knight army of king of jerusalem in acclaiming arrival of english philip augustus french king be of somewhat weak wavering disposition must have be thought that after dispute with king richard must have gladly done in power to carry acre before arrival of great rival to great disappointment of french however declared that must take step in general assault until arrival of richard although french have given assistance to besieger army have really remained passive for many week now however that english have arrived little time be lost for moment dissension jealousy between monarch be patched up two host naturally imitated example of sovereign french english worked side by side in throwing up trench against wall in building movable tower for attack in preparing for great onslaught french be first to finish preparation delivered tremendous assault upon wall besieged however did not lose heart with greatest bravery repulsed attempt scaling ladder be hurled backward tower be destroyed by greek fire boiling oil be hurled down upon men who advanced under shelter of machine to undermine wall after desperate fighting french fell back baffled beaten there be quiet exultation in english line at defeat of french for believed that better fortune must crown own effort such however to surprise mortification be not case when preparation be completed attacked with splendid bravery be fighting under eye of king in sight of french army who have few day before be baffled if bravery devotion must have carried wall of acre assuredly king richard army must have accomplished task be however too great for with vast loss army fell back to camp king richard raging like wounded lion many of baron have be killed in assault pikemen men at arm have suffered heavily earl of evesham have be wounded cuthbert have taken part in assault for earl knowing bravery have forbidden doing so a foresaw struggle must be of most desperate character a be not usual for page to accompany lord on battlefield cuthbert must not complain of being forbidden to take part in fight earl however permitted to accompany cnut bowman who did great service by accuracy of aim preventing by storm of arrow men on battlement from taking steady aim working machine so saved earl of evesham troop fighting near from suffering nearly a heavy loss a of engaged in other quarter while successful in beating off assault defender of acre be now nearly at end of resource emperor saladin although have collected army of two hundred thousand men yet feared to advance give battle to crusader in own line for have thrown up round camp strong intrenchment to prevent progress of siege being disturbed by force from without people of acre seeing time pas sign of rescuing force provision being utterly exhausted pestilence fever making frightful ravage in city at last determined to surrender for over two year have made resistance of most valiant description now despairing of success rescue seeing host of besieger increasing day by day hoisted flag upon wall sent deputation to king asking for term if submitted must have done well have submitted upon arrival of french english reinforcement for monarch annoyed by defeat of force by heavy loss have sustained knowing that besieged be now at last crust be not disposed to be merciful

undertook to pay two hundred thousand piece of gold to king within forty day under condition that fighting men now taken prisoner be to be put to death must ransom not be paid conquest of acre be hailed throughout christendom a triumph of highest importance opened again gate of holy land so tremendous be strength of fortress that be deemed that if stronghold be unable to resist effectually arm of crusader that if saladin with so great army did not dare to advance to rescue then rest of holy land must speedily fall under hand of invading army with fall of acre however dissension between two king have for awhile be allowed to rest while common work be to be done broke out again with renewed intensity jealousy of philip augustus be raised to highest point by general enthusiasm of combined army for valiant king of england by authority that monarch exercised in council therefore suddenly announced intention of returning to france decision at first occasioned greatest consternation in rank of crusader feeling be lessened when king announced that must leave large portion of french army behind under command of duke of burgundy wiser councilors be satisfied with change although there be reduction of total fighting force yet fact that be now centered under one head that king richard must now be in supreme command be deemed to more than counterbalance loss of portion of french army before starting on march for jerusalem king richard sullied reputation by causing defender of acre to be put to death ransom not having arrived at stipulated time then allied army set out upon journey fleet cruised along near from obtained be requisite for want yet notwithstanding advantage toil fatigue be terrible road scarcely existed army marched across rough broken country there be straggling

rank of army cloud of cavalry belonging to enemy did not content with merely menacing cutting off straggler at time when thought saw opening must dash in attack column desperately sometimes gaining temporary advantage killing wounding many then fleeing away again into desert finding that be impossible to catch wary horseman king richard ordered bowman to march outside cavalry so that when enemy horse approached within bowshot must open upon with arrow then must horseman persist in charging archer be at once to take refuge behind line of knight day after day passed in harassing conflict distance passed over day be very small suffering of men from thirst heat fatigue enormous cuthbert must well understand now what have heard of great army melting away for already men began to succumb in large number to terrible heat path traversed by army be scattered with corps of who have fallen victim to sunstroke not even at night did attack of enemy cease portion of harassed force be obliged to keep under arm to repel assault so passed time until army arrived at azotus there to delight of crusader who only longed to get at foe beheld whole force of saladin two hundred thousand strong barring way have not be for stern discipline enforced by king richard knight of england france must have repeated mistake have caused extermination of christian force at tiberias must have leveled

xiii in hand of saracen english have hoped that after one pitched battle must be able to advance upon jerusalem have reckoned without climate illness although unconquered in fray christian army be weakened by suffering to extent that be virtually brought to standstill even king richard with impetuosity dared not venture to cut adrift from seashore to march direct upon jerusalem that city be certainly not to be taken without long siege must only be undertaken by army strong enough not only to carry out so great task to meet defeat army saladin must bring up to rescue to keep open line

be unable to keep up with rapid charge of knight be necessary not only to clear way to keep open for exit king richard greater portion of knight be to lead charge party be to follow behind footman who be ordered to advance at greatest speed of be capable while rearguard by charge upon enemy kept at bay to latter party cuthbert be attached saracen followed usual tactic time with great success dividing a king with knight charged suffered to pas through with slight resistance then closed in upon track while still more numerous body fell upon footman guard again again did knight charge through rank of moslem while billmen stoutly kept together resisted onslaught of enemy cavalry in spite of bravery however storm of arrow shot by desert horseman thinned rank with terrible rapidity charging up to very point of spear wild horseman fired arrow into face of foe although number of fell beneath more formidable missile sent by english archer number be so overwhelming that little band melted away small party of knight too be rapidly thinned although performing prodigious deed of valor saracen when dismounted wounded still fought on foot object being always to stab hough horse so dismount rider king richard force though making most desperate effort to return to assistance of rearguard be baffled by sturdy resistance of saracen position of in rear be fast becoming hopeless one by one gallant little band of knight fell sea of turban closed over fluttering plume cuthbert after defending with extreme bravery for long time be at last separated from small remainder of comrade by

stillness have succeeded to din of battle shout war cry of crusader wild yell of moslem be hushed in place be quiet chatter in many unknown tongue sound of laughter feasting raising head looking round cuthbert saw that ten of comrade be lying together in midst of saracen camp that be prisoner to infidel sun streamed down with tremendous force upon there be shelter though be wounded parched with saracen of whom besought water pointing to mouth making sign of extreme thirst laughed in face signified by gesture that be scarcely worth trouble to drink when be likely so soon to be put to death be late in afternoon before change be manifest then cuthbert observed stir in camp men ran to horse leaped on back with wild cry of welcome started off at full speed evidently personage be about to arrive fate of prisoner must be solved few word be from time to time exchanged between urging other to keep up heart defy infidel one two have succumbed to wound during afternoon only six be able to stand erect when summoned to do so by of guard who made sign to that great personage be coming soon shout of horseman other sound announced that great chief be near at hand captive gathered from

imprecation of contempt hatred saladin waved hand one by one captive be led aside walking a proudly to doom a if have be going to feast wrung hand of one next to a turned then without word followed captor there be dull sound heard one by one head of knight rolled in sand cuthbert happened to be last in line a executioner laid hand upon removed helmet eye of sultan fell upon almost started at perceiving extreme youth of captive held hand aloft to arrest movement of executioner signaled for cuthbert to be brought before again be boy said knight who have hitherto fallen into hand have be men of strength power how be that see mere youth among rank wearing golden spur of knighthood king richard made knight cuthbert said proudly after having stood across when steed have be foully stabbed at battle of azotus whole moslem host be around ah said emir be one of two who a have heard defended king for time against assault be hard indeed to kill so brave youth doubt not that at present be a

jerusalem garden of palace be fair take youth to a present set to work in garden life have spared in else ben abin will be master cuthbert heard without emotion word changed fate from death to slavery many knew who be captured in war be carried away a slave to different part of asia did not seem to that change be in way boon however life be dear be natural that thought must leap into heart soon either crusader might force way into jerusalem there rescue that might in way escape sultan having thus concluded subject turned away galloped off surrounded by bodyguard who have captured christian now stripped off armor of cuthbert then be mounted on barebacked steed with four bedouin with long lance riding beside started for jerusalem after day of long rapid riding arab stopped suddenly on crest of hill with shout of joy throwing from horse bent with forehead to earth at sight of holy city cuthbert a gazed at stately wall of jerusalem noble building within felt bitterly that be not thus that have hoped to see holy city have dreamed of arriving before with comrade proud delighted at success so far confident in power soon to wrest town before from hand of moslem instead of be slave slave to infidel perhaps never more to see white face save that of other unfortunate like even now in fallen state city be so impressive at first sight a jerusalem wall magnificent in height strength picturesque in deep embattlements rising on edge of deep valley building have name history here be church built by first crusader there mighty mosque of suleiman on site of temple far away on projecting ridge great building known a tomb of moses on right beyond house rise tower on roman wall pool of bethsaida lie in hollow in center be cupola of church of holy sepulcher among fairest city of world there be none can compare in stately beauty with jerusalem doubtless be fairer city in day for long century of turkish possession have reduced many of former stately palace to ruin then a now banner of prophet floated over high place whereas at present population be poor squalid city in day contained far larger number of inhabitant irrespective of great garrison collected for defense place from cuthbert have first sight of jerusalem be that from best view be to be obtained crest of mount of olive after minute two spent in looking at city arab with shout continued way down into valley crossing ascended steep road to wall brandishing lance giving yell of triumph then riding two upon side of prisoner to protect from fanatic who might lay hand upon passed under gate known a gate of suleiman into city populace thronged street news brought by horseman that considerable portion of christian host have be defeated slain passed from mouth to mouth be received with yell of exultation execration be heaped upon cuthbert who rode along with air a quiet composed a if be center of ovation instead of of outburst of hatred must indeed speedily have be torn from guard have not shouted that be placed in hand by saladin for conduct to governor a emir be a sharp a ruthless with own people a with prisoner who fell into hand name acted a talisman cuthbert escort rode forward without molestation until reached entrance to palace dismounting cuthbert be now led before governor stern grave looking man sitting cross legged on divan surrounded by officer attendant heard in silence account given by escort bowed head at command of suleiman without addressing word to cuthbert indicated to two attendant that be to be removed into interior of house here young knight be led to small dungeon like room bread date with cruse of water be placed before door be then closed locked without found alone with thought one came near night slept a soundly a must have done in tent in midst of christian host be resolved to give cause for ill treatment complaint to captor to work a willingly a cheerfully a be in power to seize first opportunity to make escape regardless of risk of life might incur in doing so in morning door opened black slave led into garden be surrounded by very high lofty wall be large full of tree flower far more beautiful than garden that cuthbert have seen in native land there be various other slave at work arab who appeared to be head of gardener at once appointed to cuthbert work assigned to guard of arab with bow spear watched doings of slave with one glance round cuthbert be assured that escape from garden at least be not to be thought of that for present patience alone be possible dismissing idea of kind from mind set to work with steady attention to task be very fond of flower soon became so absorbed in work a almost to forget that be slave be not laborious digging planting pruning training flower giving copious draught of water from large fountain in center of garden slave be not permitted to exchange word with other at end of day work be marched off to separate chamber a might be called dungeon food consisted of water dried date bread have little to complain of in respect indeed slave in garden of governor house at jerusalem enjoyed exceptionally favored existence governor be absorbed in care of city head gardener happened to be man of unusual humanity be really in hand that comfort of prisoner be placed sometimes in course of day veiled lady must issue in group from palace attended by black slave with drawn scimiters passed without unveiling across point where slave be at work be forbidden on pain of death to look up even to approach konak pavilion where lady threw aside veil enjoyed scent sight of flower splash of murmuring water strain of music touched by skillful hand although cuthbert wondered in heart what strange wrapped up figure might look like when veil be thrown back certainly did not care enough about matter to run risk of drawing anger of guard upon by raising eye toward did ever glance up at palace be also interdicted to slave from lattice casement during day strain of music merry laughter often came down to captive if anything only added to bitterness of position by reminding that be shut off for life from ever hearing laughter of loved one have left behind for upward of month cuthbert remained steadily at work during time possible plan of escape have occurred to have indeed resigned to wait either until a hoped city must be taken by christian until might be removed from present post sent into country where although lot must doubtless be far harder chance of escape might open before one night long after slumber have fallen upon city cuthbert be startled by hearing door open rising to foot saw black slave old woman beside latter spoke first in lingua franca mistress wife of governor have sent to ask story how be that although youth be already knight how be that come to be slave to people sultan sent to lord must fain hear through how have happened be kindest of lady sight of youth have touched heart with thanks to unknown lady who have felt interest in cuthbert briefly related event have led to captivity old woman placed on ground basket containing choice fruit white bread then departed with negro a quietly a have come leaving cuthbert greatly pleased at what have taken place doubtless said to will hear again may be that through pity of lady mean of escape may open to although for little time such prospect appeared yet visit of old woman be frequently repeated be of interest to seemed to form link between world after coming regularly night for week bade young knight follow holding finger to lip in sign that caution must be observed passing through several passage be at length led into room where lady of forty year of age surrounded by several slave younger woman be sitting cuthbert felt scruple in making deep obeisance to respect shown to woman in day of chivalry be very great cuthbert in bowing almost to ground before lady who be really mistress did not feel that be humiliating young slave said story have interested have frequently watched from window have seen how willingly patiently have worked seems strange indeed that one so young must have performed such feat of bravery a to win honor of knighthood from hand of greatest of warrior richard of england what be must fain learn from lip that stir up heart of christian world that must launch army against who wish to be left alone who have grudge against city be a holy to a be to a live around country for thousand of mile be be likely that must allow to be wrested from by stranger from distance be spoken in eastern language of cuthbert understood word purport be translated to by old woman who have hitherto acted a mistress messenger cuthbert reported circumstance of fight at azotus endeavored to explain feeling have given rise to crusade then at order of lady related incident of voyage out something of life at home be more interesting even than tale of adventure to hearer a to home life of fierce christian warrior be entirely unknown after audience of two hour cuthbert be conducted back to cell mistress assuring of good will promising to do in power to make captivity a light a possible chapter xiv effort for freedom two three night afterward old woman again came to cuthbert asked in mistress name if in way must suggest method of lightening captivity a extreme youth bravery of demeanor have greatly pleased cuthbert replied that nothing freedom must satisfy longing that be comfortable not over worked that pined to be back again with friend old woman brought on following night message to effect that mistress must willingly grant liberty a be sent to husband by sultan must be impossible to free openly from what said old woman continued if must see plan of making escape must in way throw difficulty in path must not be known that harem in way connived at escape for lord wrath must be terrible be not man to be trifled with looking round at high wall surrounded garden cuthbert said that must think of plan for escaping from place that have often thought over that appeared to to be hopeless even must manage to scale wall must only find in town beyond escape from must be altogether hopeless only said if be transported to country palace of governor must ever hope to make escape next night messenger brought news that mistress be disposed to favor escape in way have pointed out that must in two three day ask governor for permission to pay visit to palace beyond wall that with must take number of gardener among cuthbert to beautify place cuthbert returned most lively hearty thanks to patroness for kind intention hope began to rise rapidly in heart be probable however that black guard of harem heard something of intention of mistress that feared anger of governor must cuthbert make escape must be discovered that be result of connivance through through other source governor obtained inkling that white slave sent by sultan be receiving unusual kindness from lady of harem two night after cuthbert have begun to entertain bright hope of liberty door of cell be softly opened be seized by four slave gagged tied hand foot covered with thick burnous carried out from cell by sound of foot heard that be passing into open air guessed that be being carried through garden then door opened be closed after be flung across horse like bale of good rope two be placed around to keep in position then felt animal put in motion heard by trampling of foot that considerable number of horseman be around for time passed over rough uneven street of city then there be pause exchange of watchword countersign creaking of door lowering of drawbridge party issued out into open country not for very long did continue way halt be called cuthbert be taken off horse on looking round found that be in middle of considerable group of men who have brought be party of governor guard be now delivered over to large band of arab of whom be mounted on camel one of creature be ordered to mount bond being loosed from arm foot arab driver with lance bow arrow other weapon took seat on neck of animal then with scarcely word caravan marched off with noiseless step with face turned southward seemed to cuthbert almost a dream few hour before have be exalted with hope of freedom now be being taken away to slavery must probably end with life although must not understand of captor repetition of name led to believe that be being sent to egypt a present to man in high authority there doubted not that governor of jerusalem fearing that might escape dreading wrath of sultan must do so have determined to transfer troublesome captive to more secure position to safer hand for three day journey continued have now left fertile lowland of palestine face be turned west be entering upon sandy waste stretch between southern corner of palestine land of egypt distance can be traveled by camel in three day occupied child of israel forty year at first watch have be very sharply kept over captive now that have entered desert arab appeared to consider that there be chance of attempt to escape cuthbert have in way endeavored to ingratiate with guard have most willingly obeyed smallest order have shown pleased grateful for date formed staple of repast have assumed so innocent quiet appearance that arab have marveled much among have concluded that there must have be mistake in assertion of governor guard who have handed prisoner over to that be one of terrible knight of king richard army cuthbert heart have not fallen for moment knew well that if once reached cairo hope of escape be at end be before reaching point that determined if possible to make effort for freedom have noticed particularly camel appeared to be fleetest of band be of lighter build than rest be with difficulty that rider have compelled to accommodate to pace of others be clear from pain took with by constant patting care bestowed upon watering feeding that rider be extremely proud of cuthbert concluded that if escape be to be made be animal on must accomplish upon arriving at end of day journey camel be allowed to browse at will short cord being tied between one of hind one of fore foot arab then set to work to collect stick to make fire not for cooking for only food be dried date black bread brought with for warmth a night be damp somewhat chilly a sat round fire talked told story before finally going off to rest went out into bush brought in camel be then arranged in circle around arab one of latter being mounted a sentry to prevent sudden surprise not indeed that have smallest fear of christian who be far distant then a now arab of desert be plundering race be ever ready to drive off other camel horse cuthbert determined that if flight be possible must be undertaken during interval after arrival at halting place before bringing in of camel therefore day upon halt have pretended great fatigue from rough motion of camel have after hastily eating date handed to thrown down covered with arab robe feigned instant sleep thus have in three day from starting come to look upon presence sleeping close to a matter of course second day after entering desert however cuthbert threw down by side of uprooted shrub of small size about own length covered a usual with long dark blue robe pretended to go to sleep kept eye however on alert through aperture beneath cloth observed particularly direction in camel upon have set mind wandered into bush darkness came on very few minute after have halted when arab have once settled round fire cuthbert very quietly shifted robe from to long low bush near then crawled stealthily off into darkness have fear of footfall being heard upon soft sand be soon on foot looking for camel be not long in finding in picking out one have selected bush be succulent close to camping ground indeed be for that halting place be always chosen be not so easy however to climb into high wooden saddle cuthbert tried several time in vain then repeated in sharp tone word have heard arab use to order camel to kneel striking animal at same moment behind fore leg with small switch camel immediately obeyed order to be accustomed knelt down making however a did so angry grumble creature appear to consider indispensable to raise when ordered to do anything fortunately noise be so frequently made camel be so given to quarrel among that although in still air might have be heard by arab sitting short hundred yard away attracted notice cuthbert climbing into seat shook cord served a rein animal rising set off at smooth steady swing in direction in head be turned that from have day arrived once fairly away from camping ground cuthbert with blow of stick increased speed of camel to long shuffling trot fire in distance soon faded out into darkness cuthbert trusted to star a guide be not unarmed for a crawled away from resting place have picked up one of arab spear bow arrow large bag of date from spot where have be placed when owner dismounted be already clad in eastern garb be so sunburnt tanned that have fear whatever of one at distance detecting that be white man steering course by star rode night without stopping doubted not that must have at least three hour start for arab be sure to have sat that time round fire before going out to bring in camel even then must suppose for time that animal upon be seated have strayed pursuit must be attempted until be discovered that have made escape might not be for long time a arab must not think of looking under cloth to see if be there hoped therefore that must reach cultivated land long before be overtaken have little fear that must then be able to journey onward without attracting attention solitary arab when traveling ride straight communication to whom meet be confined to set form of two three word may allah protect regular greeting of moslem when meet when morning broke cuthbert even when ascending to top of somewhat lofty mound must see sign of pursuer in vast stretch of desert behind in front ground be already becoming dotted here there with vegetation doubted not that after few hour ride must be fairly in confines of cultivated country gave camel meal of date having eaten again set creature in motion camel especially of good breed will go on for three four day with scarcely halt there be fear of on rode breaking down from fatigue for journey hitherto have be comparatively short by midday cuthbert have reached cultivated land of palestine here there over plain village be dotted party of men camel be to be seen cuthbert now arranged robe carefully in arab fashion slung long spear across shoulder went boldly forward at slinging trot having little fear that passer by must have suspicion a to being other than arab bent upon rapid journey soon found that hope be justified several time came upon party of men whom passed with salute who scarcely raised eye a trotted by plain be open one though cultivated here there there be large tract lying unworked there be occasion therefore to keep to road so riding across country avoiding village a far a possible stopping only at stream to give camel water cuthbert rode without ceasing until nightfall then halted camel near wood turned in to feed on young foliage wrapping in burnous be soon asleep for ached from head to foot with jolting motion have now be continued for so many hour without interval have little fear of being overtaken by party have left behind must be convinced be many hour behind be extremely improbable that must hit upon exact line have followed so that even if succeeded in coming up to must probably pas few mile either to right left so fatigued be with long journey that next day slept until after sun have risen be awakened suddenly by being seized by party of arab who roughly shaking questioned a to where came from what be doing there saw at glance that be not with party from have escaped pointed to lip to make sign that be dumb arab evidently suspected that something be wrong examined camel then person of captive whiteness of skin at once showed that be frank in disguise without more ado questioning tied hand foot flung across camel mounting own animal rode rapidly away from position of sun cuthbert saw that be making course nearly due east therefore that must not be intention to take to jerusalem be to north of line be following long day journey to cuthbert seemed interminable found on low spit of sand run along by side of dead sea behind lofty rock rose almost precipitously through cleft in arab have made way cuthbert saw at once that belonged to desert tribe over whom authority of suleiman be nominal when summoned for great effort child of desert must rally to army fight for short time at first disaster whenever became tired of discipline regularity of army must mount camel return to desert generally managing on way to abstract from farm of on route horse cattle other object must pay for labor have undergone be now near confines of own country apparently have fear whatever of pursuit soon gathered of dead wood cast on shore of sea with fire be speedily lighted earthenware pot be taken down from among baggage be filled with water from skin then grain having be placed in be put among wood ash cuthbert who be weary aching in limb from position in have be placed on camel asked by sign for permission to bathe in lake be given principally apparently from curiosity for very few arab be able to swim indeed a people object so utterly to water that idea of one bathing for amusement be to matter of ridicule cuthbert who have never heard of property of dead sea be perfectly astonished upon entering water to find instead of wading in up to neck before starting to swim a be accustomed to do at home water soon after got waist deep took off foot cry of astonishment burst from a found on rather than in fluid position be so strange unnatural that with cry of alarm scrambled over on to foot made best of way to shore arab indulging in shout of laughter at astonishment alarm cuthbert be utterly unable to account for strange sensation have experienced perceived that water be horribly salt that have got into mouth almost choked be however unaware that saltness add to weight of water so to buoyancy of object cast into saltness of fluid be moreover painfully conscious of by smarting of place on wrist ankle where cord have be bound that fastened to camel goaded however by laughter of arab determined once more to try experiment of entering strange sheet of water from unaccountable cause appeared to to refuse to allow anybody to sink in time swam about for time felt little refreshed when returned to shore soon re attired in bedouin dress seated little distance from captor who be now engaged in discussing material prepared by made sign to cuthbert that might partake of leaving for be not little grateful for felt utterly exhausted worn out with cruel ride prolonged fasting arab soon wrapped in burnous feeling confident that captive must not attempt to escape from in place where subsistence must be impossible paid further attention to beyond motioning to to lie down at side cuthbert however determined to make effort to escape for although be utterly ignorant of place in found of way back thought that anything must be better than to be carried into helpless slavery into savage country beyond jordan hour therefore after captor be asleep stole to foot fearing to arouse by exciting wrath of one of camel by attempting to mount struck up into hill on foot night wandered in morning found at edge of strange precipice falling abruptly down to river fifty foot wide ran at foot upon opposite side bank rose with equal rapidity to cuthbert astonishment saw that cliff be honeycombed by cave keeping along edge for considerable distance came to spot where be passable made way down to river bank here indulged in long drink of fresh water then began to examine cave perforated rock cave cuthbert knew have formerly be abode of hermit be supposed to be essentially sacred locality between third fourth century of christianity twenty thousand monk have lived solitary life on bank of river far away saw ruin of great monastery called mar saba have for long time be abode of religious community at present day be still tenanted by body of monk cuthbert made up mind at once to take refuge in cave speedily picked out one fifty foot up face of rock approachable only with greatest difficulty by sure foot first made ascent to discover size of grotto found that although entrance be four foot high two foot wide opened into area of considerable dimension far in corner when eye became accustomed to light discovered circle of ash conjecture that cave have be abode of men be therefore verified again descended collected large bundle of grass rush for bed discovered growing among rock many edible plant whose seed be probably sown there century before gathering of made way back to cavern grass furnished with excellent bed be soon asleep chapter xv hermit tale next day discovered on excursion plenty of eatable berry on bush now that have no longer fear of hunger resolved to stay for little time until wound have festered badly have recovered before making attempt to rejoin christian army one day when employed in gathering berry be surprised by meeting wild looking figure who appeared suddenly from one of cave be that of very old man with extremely long white beard flowing to waist hair be utterly unkempt fell to same point be thin to extraordinary extent cuthbert wondered how man must have be reduced to such state of

effect nothing without aid of heavy machine necessary for battering wall effecting escalade cuthbert be vastly grieved when heard of probable failure of expedition burned with eagerness to take part again in danger difficulty beset christian army host pointed out to extreme difficulty danger of crossing enemy line at same time offered to do in power to assist after two day stay at village

arm to defend must be needed appearance be so exactly that of horseman who be continually passing repassing that observation be attracted by through village even through camp cuthbert rode fearlessly arrived without having once be accosted near main camp of saracen extended for mile parallel to sea at distance of three league beyond must be seen white tent of christian host cuthbert felt that time of trial be now at hand dismounted for hour to allow steed to rest fed with date from wallet gave drink of water at stream then when felt that have thoroughly recovered strength freshness remounted rode briskly on a before passed unchallenged attracting more notice than person nowadays must do in walking along crowded street without hesitation passed through tent started across open country band of horseman be seen here there going coming from direction of christian camp a be doubtless supposed that be on way to join band have gone on in advance passage of solitary horseman excited comment until approached within about two mile of christian camp there be now so far a must see enemy between point so longed to gain at minute group of arab horseman gathered apparently on lookout against movement of christian shouted to halt demanding whither be going up to point cuthbert have ridden at gentle canter at challenge put spur into steed made across plain at full speed with wild yell arab started in pursuit lay at first two hundred yard on right have therefore considerable start of horse be fairly fresh for journey that have made have only be about fifteen mile inconsiderable distance to arab steed for mile did not think that pursuer gained much upon riding a have done sideways have now gathered in rear nearest be one hundred fifty yard behind quarter of mile further again looked around found that two of arab far better mounted than others have come within distance separated from when last glanced back horse be straining to utmost felt that must do more therefore prepared for desperate fight must pursuer overtake in quarter of mile be short distance behind arrow whizzing by cuthbert ear told have betaken to bow mile ahead saw riding toward group of christian knight felt that be too late for to hope to reach that only chance now be to boldly encounter pursuer main body of arab be fully two hundred yard behind short distance when going at gallop left little time to shake off pursuit of two immediately behind sharp stinging pain in leg told that be time to make effort checking horse wheeled suddenly round two arab with yell rode at with pointed lance with right hand cuthbert grasped short heavy mace hung at saddlebow being well practiced in hurling of weapon formed part of education of good knight cast with force at chest of arab approaching on side point of spear be within few yard of breast a flung mace aim be true for smote saracen full on chest hurled from horse a if struck with thunderbolt at same instant cuthbert threw flat on neck of steed lance of arab who came up on other side passed harmlessly between shoulder tearing clothes a went in instant cuthbert have wheeled horse before arab must turn steed cuthbert coming up from behind have run through body short a delay have be main body of pursuer be scarcely fifty yard away cuthbert now continued flight toward knight who be galloping forward at full speed moment afterward glancing back saw that pursuer have turned be in full flight with shout of joy rode forward to party who have viewed with astonishment conflict between what appeared to be three of infidel even louder than first shout of exultation be cry of joy raised at seeing among party to whom rode up earl of evesham who reined in horse in astonishment drew sword a supposed enemy galloped toward lord lord cuthbert said thank heaven be safe with again earl lowered sword in astonishment be mad said dreaming be really sir cuthbert be sure enough cuthbert exclaimed although truly look more like bedouin soldier than christian knight dear boy exclaimed earl galloping forward throwing arm around cuthbert neck thought be dead by what wonderful fortune have succeeded in escaping in few word cuthbert related principal incident of adventure be heartily congratulated by assembled knight there be however time for long explanation large body of saracen horse be already sweeping down to capture if possible small band of knight who have ventured so far from camp a king richard order be that none must venture upon conflict except by order party reluctantly turned horse galloped back to camp great a have be earl joy be if possible exceeded by of cnut on discovering in arab chief who rode up alongside earl lad loved so well loud hearty be cheer rang out from earl camp a news spread cuthbert be compelled to shake hand with whole party before entering earl tent to refresh give narrative of what have happened cuthbert retiring to tent with earl of evesham inquired of have taken place during absence for said although short three day march from here have be a one of dead have heard nothing whatever of what have taken place nothing must have gone worse earl said have have nothing dissension quarrel first king fell out with archduke of austria on what ground did happen cuthbert asked for once earl said king master be wholly in wrong be not generally case have just taken ascalon be hard at work fortifying place king richard with usual zeal in order to encourage army seized heavy stone bore into place archduke stood near with of knight may be that haughty austrian looked somewhat superciliously at king thus laboring do not make show of helping ' king richard said going up to 'it must encourage men show that labor upon be engaged can be undertaken by without derogation ' to archduke replied ' be not son of mason whereupon richard whose blood doubt have be excited by air of austrian struck with hand fierce blow across face nearly betook to sword on side king richard must have scattered austrian knowing that against impetuous valor must hing simply withdrew from camp sailed next day for home then king in order to conciliate at least of ally conferred crown of jerusalem upon conrad of montferat sooner have done than conrad be mysteriously wounded by whom be done none knew say that be by emissary of old man of mountain others affirm that be jealousy of of knight of holy order be that a may died of french ever jealous of valor of king ascribed to order monstrous accusation coming to ear of king richard have hot word with duke of burgundy in blame not for be beyond reason that man like king whose fault such a be arise from too much openness from want of concealment of such dislike a may have must resort to poison to free of man whom have day two before appointed king of jerusalem however be consequence be most unfortunate for result of quarrel be that duke of burgundy frenchman followed example of austrian be left alone before have marched upon jerusalem weather have be so bad train be so insufficient to carry engine of war that have be forced to fall back again king richard again advanced with much toil went a far a village of bethany why cuthbert exclaimed passed through village be three mile from holy city be so earl said many of ascending hill in front saw jerusalem even then be certain that must again retrace step when asked king richard to come to crest of hill to see holy city refused to do so saying who be not worthy of conquering jerusalem must not look at ' be short time since be now retracing step to acre be treating with saladin for peace then cuthbert said sadly hope effort be thrown away blood have be shed for nothing after three great power of europe have engaged solemnly in war be baffled have to fall back before horde of infidel partly before earl said partly a result of own jealousy passion have king richard be lesser man than be might have conquered jerusalem be so extraordinary warrior that glory throw others into shade be good general perhaps best in europe have done nothing lead assuredly must have carried out purpose see how ably maneuvered army at fight of azotus never be more complete defeat than inflicted there upon saracen although fact that generalship achieved might have caused jealousy to other commander might have died away must between battle have be general nothing more ala be in addition knight errant knight errant a europe have never seen before wherever there be danger richard will plunge into midst there be brave men in three army strongest bravest be a child to king richard alone can dart into rank of infidel cut lane for by strength of right arm more than when danger have threatened have snatched up battle ax dashed into fray without helm cuirass performing such prodigy of valor

whole army felt for be a gall wormwood to haughty austrian indolent frenchman retirement of king of france left richard in supreme command be in way unfortunate upon following day army again marched cuthbert must not notice difference not only in number in demeanor from splendid array have left acre few month before there be little now of glory of pennon banner bright helm cuirass be rusted dinted none seemed to care aught for bravery of show knight men at arm be sunburnt thin seemed weight that have be when landed fatigue hardship heat have done work disease have swept off vast number remains of army be so formidable in fighting power that saracen although following at distance in vast number did not venture attack upon few day after arrival at king gave order for embarkation of troop just a be preparing to enter ship small vessel be seen entering harbor drew up to shore knight leaped from inquiring where king richard be to be found made way to king who be standing superintending embarkation of of horse saracen sire exclaimed saracen be besieging jaffa place must be lost unless assistance arrives in day two king leaped on board nearest ship shouted to leading

sallied out from town on foot joined among be cuthbert earl of evesham having accompanied king richard in charge in seventeen knight be now rallied round king so fierce be charge of saracen that king ordered on horseback to dismount with horse in center little body knelt with lance opposed to saracen again again wild cavalry swept down upon little force in vain did attempt to break rank scene be indeed extraordinary one at last king seeing that enemy be losing heart again ordered knight to mount dashing among enemy completed defeat while have be going on news came to king that saracen from

richard must long ere have reached saxony fear much that foul treatment have befallen on way found how bitter be feeling among related to conrad of montferat against archduke john be still smarting from blow king richard struck at ascalon surely must not be so unknightly a to hinder so great champion of christendom a king richard on homeward way archduke john be crafty treacherous duke said emperor must think be not sorry to lay hand upon king of england be only to do pleasure to philip of france assuredly however anger indignation of christendom will be aroused must king passage be

resistance finding indeed that must be hopeless so to do sir baldwin have be permitted to depart without molestation believed that folk into whose hand have fallen be retainer of archduke john news although sad in be yet in degree reassuring to duke wife for felt that while follower of conrad of montferat must not hesitate to put king richard to death must fall into hand archduke john must not dare to bring upon indignation of europe by such treatment of royal captive cuthbert at once determined to return to england to see sir baldwin to ascertain what step be being taken for discovery of prison in king richard be confined for release therefrom also to establish in new dignity a earl of evesham therefore bidding adieu to duke duchess started north duke furnished with letter of introduction to prince through whose country must travel again crossing rhine journeyed through territory of duke of clef brabant reached mouth of scheldt without interruption there taking ship sailed for london be long stormy passage between mouth of scheldt london vessel in cuthbert have shipped be old somewhat unseaworthy several time in force of gale on board gave up hope for life at last however reached mouth of thames dropping up with tide reached london eight day after embarkation noble charger king of saxony have presented to cuthbert have suffered greatly feared at one time that poor animal must succumb to effect of tempest however after entering into smooth water recovered on landing near tower found that be able to support weight cnut archer be like cuthbert delighted to have foot again upon english soil although london did not now strike with same wonder must have done have first visited before starting on journey for in many respect be greatly behind of continental city yet feeling of home pleasure of being able to understand conversation of around made poor fellow almost beside with joy beyond main political incident cuthbert have heard little of what have passed in england since departure putting up at hostelry inquired of host whether sir baldwin of bethune be in london whether be away on estate landlord did not know there be said few noble at court london be never so dull a at present a cuthbert did not wish coming home to be known to john until have learned something of position of affair dispatched cnut to tower to inquire privately of of official about place whether sir baldwin be there cnut soon returned with news that have not be at court since return from holy land that be living at castle down in dorsetshire after hesitation cuthbert resolved to set out to see friend after six day travel arrived at castle of knight sir baldwin received with immense joy have not heard of since parted at zara feared that fate similar to have befallen king richard have overtaken cuthbert even if be still alive have seen aught of king master good knight inquired nothing cuthbert said know more than indeed hoped to have learned something from a to king be separated from at gortz while be taken prisoner to archduke be allowed to pursue way have many difficulty danger be week in finding way back nothing be known of king when returned indeed be first bearer of definite news concerning since day when sailed from acre three week ago a may have learned news came that be now detained in captivity by emperor who demanded delivery by archduke john into whose hand first fell where be one exactly know news have created immense excitement in kingdom be resolved to sacrifice of treasure may be demanded in order to satisfy ransom recreant emperor have placed upon king shame be indeed that christian sovereign must hold in captivity still more when other be returning through dominion a crusader coming from holy land when person must be safe even to deadliest enemy have long be suspected that be in hand of emperor of archduke throughout europe feeling of indignation have be strong doubt not now that truth be known feeling will be stronger than ever now that be known cuthbert said suppose there will be delay in ransoming king there will be delay in raising ransom sir baldwin said kingdom be very impoverished by war by exaction of prince john by of langley who held for king richard be loyal servant of king exacting rapacious prelate however doubt not that rent of english noble will soon be charged with sum sufficient for ransom if avail not not one of will grudge silver flagon vessel to melt down to make total required must not flatter ourselves that will obtain liberty so soon a money be raised prince john have long be yearning for sovereignty have long exercised real if not nominal power have be intriguing with pope philip of france for support for seizing crown will throw obstacle in way a may be sure will philip of france richard deadly enemy now about sir cuthbert tell have befallen since last met cuthbert related adventure have befallen heard of sir baldwin have not suppose latter remarked a yet seen prince john cuthbert replied thought better to come down to ask to advise on position of affair before attempted to see did well sir baldwin said when arrived found that proper official have according to king richard instruction draw up patent conferring upon land title of earl of evesham before leaving acre have received king signature to be attested by several of noble who be with who returned safely to england prince john however declared that must not give heed to document that king richard power over realm have ceased before made that must bestow earldom upon whomsoever chose a matter of fact have be given to sir rudolph fleming norman knight creature of prince king have also hear promised to hand of young lady margaret when will become of marriageable age at present be placed in convent in worcester abbess be believe friend of late earl girl have be with for time previously indeed went there think when father left england lady be ordered to give up charge to guardianship of sir rudolph refused to do so saying that must not be convenable for young lady to be under guardianship of bachelor knight having lady at head of establishment that therefore must retain in spite of order of prince prince john hear flew into fury at did not dare to provoke anger of whole of clergy by ordering convent to be violated indeed not only must clergy have be indignant many of great noble must also have taken part for there can be doubt that contention of abbess be reasonable there be among friend of king richard very strong feeling of anger at having be deprived of earldom however have so far not found much vent in word for a be uncertain whether must ever return to claim right be worth one while to embroil unnecessarily with prince on subject god know that there be subject enough of dispute between john lackland english baron without fresh one arising kingdom be in state of disturbance there have be several rising against prince john authority have be so far suppressed now that know where king richard be hope for return ere very long be probable that peace will be maintained must treachery prevail king richard return be prevented may be sure that john will not be permitted to mount throne without determined resistance of large number of noble cuthbert said john be not successor to throne prince arthur of brittany be named by king richard from first a successor be so by blood by right john can have pretense to throne so long a life be so sir baldwin said unhappily in england at present might make right may be sure that at king richard death be when may prince john will make bold throw for throne aided a will be by pope by philip of france methinks that chance be better than of young prince man power in warlike time be more than boy can intrigue promise threaten while boy must be in hand of partisan fear that prince arthur will have troubled time indeed before mount throne of england must richard survive until becomes of age to take field head army may succeed for speak well of a boy of singular sweetness of disposition while prince john be detested by save who flatter live by enough for present of politics cuthbert let now to table be long since two feasted together indeed such meal a took in holy land must scarcely have be called feast boar head good roasted capon be worthy strange dish that have there always misdoubted meat seemed to to smack in flavor of saracen never must bring to inquire whence that strange food be obtained stoup of english ale too be worth cyprus wine especially when cyprus wine be half full of sand of desert pah make throat dry to think of horrible meal so have brought cnut four archer safely back with yes cuthbert said smiling be can assure heavy weight on in spite of faithfulness fidelity ignorance of language brought most of trouble upon cnut have something of nature of bull in there be certain thing can not stomach when seeth rageth like wild beast regardless altogether of safety convenience in evening two knight again talked over course cuthbert must adopt elder knight opinion be that young friend have best formally claim title by writing to king at arm must also announce return to prince john signing sir cuthbert earl of evesham that in present state of thing must be unwise for to attempt to regain position must a be certain to be case prince john refuse to recognize be very young yet sir baldwin said not eighteen think can afford to wait at rate to see whether king richard return must come back will see wrong be righted one of first care must assuredly be to cast usurper out of stolen dignity how old be lady margaret be fifteen cuthbert said be three year younger than wish have be younger sir baldwin said at fifteen be not by custom fairly marriageable men can strain point when choose fear that news of coming will hasten prince sir rudolph in determination to strengthen claim of usurper by marriage with heiress of evesham lady margaret friend can of course claim that be royal ward that a such king alone can dispose of person estate unfortunately force override argument surely cuthbert said will never venture to take by force from convent venture great many strange thing in england now sir baldwin said worcester be perilously near to evesham with clump of twenty spear sir rudolph might break into convent carry off young lady marry by force although church might cry out cry must be of little avail when deed be done handsome present on part of sir rudolph might go far to shut mouth of many of complainant especially a will be able to say that have king sanction for what did methinks cuthbert said that if such be case must be perilous indeed to wait for king richard return assuredly sir rudolph must not tarry until attained age of seventeen may well be that two year may yet pas before king richard come back seems to wiser part will be must give prince john notice be in england a say such notice must be of avail in recovering land title must put prince upon guard assuredly minion must press forward measure to obtain possession of person of lady margaret while on other hand harm can come of maintaining silence think that be right sir cuthbert be indeed best that enemy must suppose dead in dungeon in tyrol what must then do must return to old home cuthbert said lady mother be trust still alive will not appear at house will take refuge in forest there cnut archer with be at one time outlaw living there doubt not that there be many good men true still to be found in wood others will assuredly join when learn that cnut be there that be wanted to strike blow for right will then bide time will keep strict watch over castle over convent a abbess be friend relative of lady margaret may obtain interview with warn her of danger await ask if be willing to fulfill promise of father king richard will in accepting a husband when due time will arrive whether will be willing must take such step a may to deliver from persecution of sir rudolph if a trust assent to will keep watch over convent a well a castle can then either attack latter carry off from former a occasion may appear to warrant there be plenty of snug cottage round forest where can remain in concealment in care of good farmer wife for month will be close at hand to watch over with aid of forest men sir walter took castle of sir john of wortham although evesham be far grander pile than yet methinks must be carried by sudden assault know more of war now than did then prince john may deny right of being earl of evesham methinks before many month can if choose become master be not too hasty in matter sir baldwin said might capture castle with aid of outlaw must scarcely hold prince have ere now with aid of faithful to foreign mercenary captured stronger hold than of evesham if turn favorite out must have swarm of hornet around such a wall of evesham must not keep out must therefore be worse than useless for to attempt what must be something like act of rebellion against prince john authority must give what now have excuse for ground for putting price upon head cutting off if got opportunity might now present boldly at court although might refuse to recognize title of earl yet a knight crusader who have distinguished greatly in holy land dare not interfere with person for must be resented by whole of chivalry of england still agree with that best course be to keep return secret will then be unwatched unnoticed enemy will take time in carrying design into effect two day later cuthbert attended by faithful retainer left sir baldwin castle traveled by easy stage through wiltshire confines of gloucestershire up to worcester have be supplied by sir baldwin with suitable attire for follower now rode a simple knight without arm cognizance journeying from one part to cross other crusading sign be laid aside there be nothing to attract attention to upon passage cuthbert have at first thought of going direct to convent of worcester asking for interview with lady margaret reflected that might be possible that of myrmidon of sir rudolph might be keeping watch over building to see that lady margaret be not secretly removed to other place of refuge that appearance of knight before door must excite comment suspicion therefore avoided town journeyed straight to forest where have so often roamed with cnut outlaw here found that matter have little changed since be last there many of who have fought with in holy land who have returned by sea have again taken to forest joined by many new men whom exaction of sir rudolph have already goaded into revolt cnut be received with enthusiasm when presented cuthbert to a rightful heir of evesham well known friend of forester enthusiasm knew bound at once accepted a lord master promised to obey order to lay down life if necessary in cause a knew that be who have formerly obtained pardon of forest band who have fought with in attack on wortham castle to cuthbert great delight heard that mother be in good health although have for month be grievously fretting over disappearance supposed death cuthbert hesitated whether must proceed at once to see feared that shock of appearance might be too much for that expression of joy might make retainer others aware of arrival news might in way reach ear of at castle therefore dispatched cnut to see break news to cautiously to request to arrange for time when must either see cuthbert at place at distance from house must so arrange that domestic must be absent that must have interview with there unobserved cnut be absent hour on return told cuthbert that have seen dame editha that joy on hearing of son safe arrival have caused harm rather reverse news that king richard have bestowed upon title land of evesham be new to be astonished indeed to hear of elevation having heard much of character of pretending earl have great fear for safety of cuthbert must residence in neighborhood get to ear although sure of fidelity of retainer feared that in joy at young master return might let slip incautious word must come to ear of of at castle therefore determined to meet at distance have arranged that upon following day must give out that intended to make pilgrimage to shrine of st dunstan lay at edge of forest to thank for recovery from illness to pray for safety of son must be carried thither in litter journey must excite comment must take with four of most trusted retainer must on arrival at shrine send to distance in order to pay devotion undisturbed cuthbert be to be near moment saw depart to enter arrangement be carried out joy of dame editha at again meeting son be deep indeed have left lad of fifteen now returned youth of nearly eighteen stout strong beyond age looking far older than be from effect of hot sun of syria of hardship through have gone that must win spur upon first opportunity earl have promised doubted not that must soon attain rank father have held that must return to belted earl be beyond wildest thought however be little in mind then be son not earl of evesham whom clasped in arm a interview must necessarily be short one cuthbert gave slight outline of what have happened since parted conversation then turned upon present position upon step have best be taken peril be fear a great here a when be fighting infidel in holy land said sir rudolph have not be here long have proved cruel ruthless master have driven forth many of old tenant bestowed land upon own servant retainer forest law carry out to fullest severity have hung several men who be caught infringing have laid such heavy burden on tenant remain that be fairly ruined if stay here long will rule over desert did dream of presence here must carry fire sword through forest be sad indeed to think that so worthless knave a must be favorite of ruler of england men say that be so thus be to attack even did conquer kill must have enmity of prince john to contend with spareth none man woman who stand in way will be bad day indeed for england must good king richard not return will a wish write to good cousin lady abbess of st anne will ask that may have interview with lady margaret to hear wish opinion concerning future will pray to do that can to aid suit with fair young lady to keep at event safe from clutch of tyrant of evesham three day later boy employed a messenger by dame editha brought note to cuthbert saying that have heard from abbess of st anne who must be glad to receive visit from cuthbert abbess have asked mother to accompany left for to decide cuthbert sent back message in reply that thought must be dangerous for to accompany a spy watching must report appearance inquiry be sure to be set on foot a to companion said that must call at convent on following evening after begged to send word to abbess to effect in order that might when presented be admitted at once chapter xxi attempt on convent upon following evening cuthbert proceeded to worcester left horse little distance outside town entered on foot having apprehension of attack have left piece of armor behind be in quiet garb of citizen cnut attended for worthy follower considered a responsible that harm of sort must befall young master consequence of own imprudence in tyrol be ever before mind determined that from henceforth there must be want of care on part accompanied cuthbert to within short distance of convent took up position in shade of house whence must watch must one appear to be observing cuthbert entrance upon ringing bell cuthbert told porteress a have be arranged that have called on message from dame editha be immediately ushered into parlor of convent where minute two later be joined by lady abbess have when young be frequently to convent have always be kindly received be indeed glad to see sir cuthbert said though certainly must not have recognized lad who used to come here with cousin in stalwart young knight see before be indeed changed improved who must think that gossip editha son must come to be earl of evesham lady margaret be eager to see think that exaggerate danger of residence here can not think that even minion of prince john must dare to violate sanctity of convent fear good mother cuthbert said that when ambition greed be in one scale reverence for holy church will not weigh much in other have king richard be killed upon way home so long a nothing be heard of sir rudolph might have be content to allow matter to remain a be until at least lady margaret attained age must justify in demanding that espousal must be carried out news have now positively be ascertained that king be in hand of emperor knowledge sooner later freedom will be obtained will hasten friend of usurper to make most of advantage know that king must at once upon return annul nomination of sir rudolph to earldom have previously be bestowed upon may well think that if before time can secure in marriage person of late earl daughter no small share of domain may be allotted to a dowry even if be obliged to lay by borrowed honor will unless be greatly mistaken hear from before long abbess looked grave there be much in what say sir cuthbert indeed certain confirmation be given to by fact that only yesterday received letter from sir rudolph urging now lady margaret be past age of fifteen may therefore be considered marriageable will of prince must be carried into effect that must for present be committed to charge of lady clara boulger who be wife of friend associate of sir rudolph say that must not wish to press marriage until attains age of sixteen that be well that future wife must become accustomed to outside world so a to take place a castellan of evesham with dignity befitting position wrote at once to saying that in year must in poor judgment be quite time to think about such worldly matter at present lady margaret be receiving education suitable to rank that be happy here that unless constrained by force of said must not suppose that possibility existed must not surrender lady margaret into hand whatsoever unless indeed received command of lawful guardian king richard said well holy mother sir cuthbert said see hawk scent danger from afar be moving uneasily already whether consider so pressing that will dare to profane convent know not be sure must do so will not hesitate moment at thought of anger of church prince john have already shown that be ready if need be to oppose authority of holy father may well therefore despise local wrath might be excited by action can disavow for even at worst need only inflict nominal punishment upon vassal bethink thee lady whether must not be safer to send lady margaret to care of person where may be concealed from search of sir rudolph must gladly do so abbess said did know of such person place be difficult indeed for young lady of rank to be concealed from such sharp searcher a sir rudolph must be certain to place upon track proposal that must take refuge in house of small franklin near forest can not agree to in first place must demean to be so placed in second must never be sure that report of residence there might not reach ear of sir rudolph a last resource of course such step must be justifiable not until at least overt outrage have be attempted now will call lady margaret in young girl entered with air of frank gladness be startled at alteration have taken place in former playfellow paused looked at abbess a if inquiring whether must be really cuthbert have known lady margaret be fifteen in year looked much younger quiet seclusion in have lived in convent have kept from approaching maturity a earl daughter brought up in stir bustle of castle must doubtless have attained be indeed sir cuthbert abbess said old playfellow husband destined for by father by will of king struck with new timidity girl advanced according to custom of time held up cheek to be kissed cuthbert be almost a timid a feel lady margaret said deep sense of own unworthiness of kindness honor dear lord father bestowed upon be not that many danger threaten that be difficult under circumstance to find one more worthy of must gladly resign into hand of one be for happiness believe that recollection of face have animated in many of scene of danger in have be placed although even in fancy thought scarcely ventured to rise so high yet felt a true knight might feel for lady of love always liked sir cuthbert girl said frankly better than one else next to father gladly submit to will own inclination indeed so far a be maidenly go with be troubled time said anxiously holy mother tell that fear danger be overhanging trust that danger may not be imminent cuthbert answered knowing unscrupulous nature of false earl of evesham fear that news that king richard be found will bestir to early action can rely dear lady on careful watch being kept over night day must attempt be made to carry away to put force upon be assured assistance will be at hand even must attempt succeed lose heart for rescue will certainly be attempted must be dead faithful follower crushed before can become bride of sir rudolph then turning to other subject talked to of life have led since last saw told of last moment of father of gallant deed have done in holy land after waiting for two hour abbess judged that time for separation have arrived cuthbert taking respectful adieu of young mistress receiving benediction of abbess departed found cnut on guard at point where have left have seen aught to give rise to suspicion cuthbert asked yes cnut said place be undoubtedly watched just after have entered man came from house yonder went up to gate a if must fain learn by staring at iron adornment nature of who have passed in then re entered house if mistake not be still on watch at casement if stand here for minute two perchance may come out to see what delay in dark corner in case may well give clout with ax will settle prying better not cuthbert said can retire round corner so avoid observation be body found slain here suspicion must be at once excited in mind of employer at present can have ground for report may make knight uneasy for can know that gentleman have entered remained for two hour at convent will in way connect visit with lady margaret have just turned corner cuthbert indicated when man came up rapidly behind almost brushed a passed half turning round trying to gaze into face cnut at once assumed aspect of intoxicated person stretching forth foot with dexterous shove pushed stranger into gutter latter rose with fierce cry of anger cnut with blow of heavy fist again stretched on ground time to remain quiet until have walked on passed out of sight meddling fool cnut grumbled will not methinks have much to report to sir rudolph time have thought that have seen face must have cleft skull with more hesitation than send arrow into brain of stag in forest a journeyed along cuthbert informed cnut of what abbess have told latter agreed that watch must be placed on convent that force must be kept a near a possible at hand so a to defeat attempt might be made next day one of forest men who have be peaceable citizen who have be charged with using false weight have be condemned to lose ear repaired to worcester person be unknown there a have before lived at gloucester hired house in square in convent be situated giving out that desired to open house of business for sale of silk for article from low country a paid down earnest money for rent suspicion be excited at once took up abode there having with two stout serving men 'prentice boy from time two set of watcher observed without ceasing what passed at convent of st anne at distance of mile from road leading between worcester evesham stood grange have for time be disused ground belonging to having be sequestrated given to lord of adjoining estate who did not care to have grange occupied in ten men headed by cnut took up residence blocking up window of hall with hanging so that light of fire kindled within must not be observed two month passed on without incident of importance feeling between outlaw in forest retainer of false earl of evesham be becoming much imbittered several time forester of latter attempting pursuit of men charged with breaking game law be roughly handled on making report be sent back again supported by force of footman too be driven back authority of sir rudolph be openly defied gradually came to ear that outlaw be commanded by man who have be leader in time gone by who have be pardoned have with large number of band taken service in army of crusader also that there be present stranger whose manner deference paid to by cnut proclaimed to be of gentle blood news awakened grave uneasiness on part of sir rudolph knight caused inquiry to be made ascertained that cnut have be especially attached to young cuthbert that have fought under earl of evesham banner seemed possible then that with have returned claimant for earldom in case sir rudolph felt that danger menaced for bravery of earl of evesham adopted son have be widely spoken of by who have returned from holy land sir rudolph be man of forty tall dark with norman feature held saxon in utter contempt treated a being solely created to till land for benefit of norman lord be brave fearless altogether free from superstition of time even threat of pope although prince john defied yet terrified at heart be derided by follower who feared one thing in world save perhaps return of king richard from captivity sooner have suspicion that rival be in neighborhood possessed than determined that one of two thing must be carried out sir cuthbert must be killed lady margaret must be carried off forced to accept a husband first endeavored to force sir cuthbert to declare to trust to own arm to put end to rival to end caused proclamation to be written to be affixed to door of village church at fair of evesham cnut several of follower be there quietly dressed a yeoman seeing crowd round door of church pressed forward being unable to read writing asked one of burgess what be written upon paper caused such excitement be burgess said in nature of cartel challenge from present lord sir rudolph say that having come to ear that saxon serf calling sir cuthbert earl of evesham be lurking in wood consorting with outlaw robber challenge to appear saying that will grievously although must demean by so doing yet condescend to meet in list with sword battle ax to prove upon body falseness of averment men marvel much burgess continued at condescension on earl part have heard indeed that king richard before sailed for england did at death of late good earl bestow rank domain of evesham upon sir cuthbert son of dame editha whether be true not can not say seems strange that such honor must have be bestowed upon one so young in birth indeed might aspire to rank since father sir walter be brave knight mother dame editha be of good saxon blood descended from who held evesham before arrival of norman cnut first impulse be to stride forward to tear down proclamation remembrance of solemn determination not in future to act rashly came across decided to take step until have reported fact to master taken counsel thereon cuthbert received news with much indignation there be naught must like better said than to try strength against of false traitor although have proved arm against saracen think not that be yet strong enough to cope against man who whatsoever be fault be said to be valiant knight must not deter from attempting task be craftily done on part of sir rudolph reckons that if appear will kill that if appear will be branded a coward claim brought into disrepute may be too that be mere ruse to discover if be in neighborhood rumor thereof may have reached have taken course to determine upon truth have gone too far honest men will see in cartel sign that misdoubts that claim be just for be a say saxon serf be sure that must not condescend to meet in list a proposes trust that time will come when may do so at present will submit to insult rather than imperil success of plan what be of far greater importance safety happiness of lady margaret who did aught befall must assuredly fall into hand after thought however cuthbert drew up answer to knight proclamation did not in speak in own name wrote a if document be work of cnut be worded a follows cnut free saxon leader of bowman under king richard in holy land do hereby pronounce declare statement of sir rudolph miscalled earl of evesham to be false calumnious earldom be a rudolph well know a can be proved by many noble gentleman of repute who be present with king richard granted to sir cuthbert king richard true faithful follower when time will come sir cuthbert will doubtless be ready to prove right at present right have force in england until coming of good king richard must remain in abeyance until then support title of sir cuthbert do hereby declare sir rudolph false perjured knight warn that if fall into hand will fare badly with a know will fare badly with must come into at cartel of sir rudolph be torn down from church that of cnut affixed in place reading thereof caused great astonishment in evesham rage of sir rudolph when news came to ear be very great cuthbert be sure that affair must quicken intention of sir rudolph with regard to lady margaret received confirmation of in letter abbess sent saying that have received missive from sir rudolph authoritatively demanding in king name instant surrender of lady margaret

from country people that be matter of talk that young lady of rank have be admitted by superior sir rudolph hesitated whether to go at head of strong body of men openly to take to employ sort of device be not that feared anathema of church knew prince john to be weak vacillating at one time ready to defy thunder of pope next cringing before spiritual authority therefore determined to employ of men to burst into convent carry off heiress arranging that with of men at arm must come upon in road make feigned rescue of so that if lady superior laid complaint before pope legate must deny that have hand in matter must even take credit for having rescued from men who have profaned convent that story must be believed mattered little must be impossible to prove falsity be that cared for course

being taken judged from turn taken upon leaving convent that be toward evesham have proceeded mile when trampling of horse be heard body of armed men rode up for moment lady margaret heart gave leap for thought that have be rescued by friend there be loud angry altercation clashing of sword sound of shouting cry outside litter then be placed roughly on ground heard sound of footstep of first captor hurrying away then horseman closed round litter leader dismounted be happy indeed lady margaret said approaching litter to have be able to save from power of villain fortunately word came to that outlaw in forest be about to carry off that must not hesitate even to desecrate wall of convent assembling men at arm at once rode to rescue be doubly happy to have saved first a gentleman secondly a being man to whom gracious prince have assigned a wife be sir rudolph earl of evesham a from first girl have be convinced that have fallen into power of lawless suitor came upon a surprise whether story be true sir rudolph said not god know poor weak girl will not pretend to venture to say be between conscience if a say have saved from power of outlaw demand that a knight gentleman return with at once to convent from be taken by force can not do sir rudolph said fortune have placed in hand have enabled to carry out command of prince therefore though must fain yield to wish so earn good will above thing wish to obtain yet duty toward prince command to utilize advantage fate have thrown in hand must do a will sir rudolph girl said with dignity believe not tale sought before in person to carry off failed have now employed other mean to do so tale of conduct to dame editha have reached ear hold foresworn knight dishonored man a such must rather die than become wife although a yet be child have need to talk of wedding for year to come need not parley here knight said coldly will have plenty of time when at castle litter be now lifted placed between two horse proceeded rapidly on journey although hope be faint yet until gate of castle closed upon lady margaret still hoped that rescue might reach secret have be too well kept be not until following day that man who have be placed in cottage near convent arrived in haste in forest to say that be only in morning that have learned that convent have be broken open by men disguised a archer lady margaret carried off four day elapsed before sir rudolph presented before girl have captured so fearfully be face bruised disfigured by blow from mailed hand of cuthbert three week before that did not wish to appear before under such unfavorable circumstance captive passed day gazing from casement in one of room in upper part of keep toward forest whence hoped rescue must come within forest hot discussion be going on a to best course to pursue open attack be out of question especially a upon day following arrival there of lady margaret three hundred more mercenary have marched in from worcester so that garrison be now raised to five hundred men be there way cnut exclaimed furiously by might creep into den since can not burst into openly there be way from castle cuthbert said for dear lord told of one day when be riding together in holy land said then that might be that must never return that be well that must know of existence of passage few besides earl knew of be approached by very heavy slab of stone in great hall be bolted down a stand under great table pass unnoticed appears part of ordinary floor told method in by touching spring bolt be withdrawn stone must be raised thence passage quarter of mile long lead to little chapel standing in hollow being hidden among tree must be unobserved by party besieging castle of course be contrived in order that garrison messenger thereof might make exit in case of siege if must escape cnut asked why not enter by way stone be of immense weight strength cuthbert replied must not be loosed from below save with great labor noise there be moreover several massive door in passage of be secured by heavy bolt within be therefore out of question that must enter castle by way be once in must easily carry off lady through passage large force sir rudolph have collected be not intended merely for defense of castle for knight considered that with own garrison must hold against force tenfold rival must collect be determined if possible to crush out outlaw of forest for felt that so long a formidable body remained under enterprising leader like sir cuthbert must never be safe for moment must be prisoner in own castle cuthbert have foreseen that attack be likely to be made have strengthened band to utmost felt however that against so large force of regularly armed men although might oppose stout resistance kill many yet that in end must be conquered cnut however suggested to happy idea eagerly grasped must be rare sport cnut said when armed force come out to attack if must turn table by slipping in taking castle very thing cuthbert exclaimed be likely that will use greater portion of force that will not keep above fifty sixty men at outside in castle when sally out will at first oppose stout resistance to in wood gradually falling back then at given signal save twenty men will retire hastily sweeping round make for castle absence will not be noticed for in thick wood be difficult to tell whether twenty men two hundred be opposing among bush twenty who remain must shoot thick fast to make believe that number be great retiring sometimes leading enemy on into heart of wood supposing sir cuthbert that must have closed gate lifted drawbridge must not gain entrance by storming even if only twenty men held wall until long after main body must have returned cuthbert thought for time then said cnut will undertake enterprise will fill cart high with faggot in will conceal dozen of best men dressed a serf will drive ox when reach castle will say in answer to hail of sentry that be bringing in tribute of wood of master franklin of hopeburn will then lower drawbridge open gate when have crossed bridge be under portcullis spring out suddenly cut loose ox so that will not draw cart further in

encamped in tent outside wall for spacious a be evesham must hardly contain four hundred men in addition to usual garrison men at arm be provided with heavy ax to cut way through bush carried bundle of straw to fire wood must be found practicable to do so a be now summer wind be blowing high sir rudolph hoped that dry grass bush must catch must do more even than men at arm in clearing forest of whom designated villain infesting have too with several fierce dog trained to hunting deer knight hoped must do good service in tracking outlaw knight men at arm with be dismounted for felt that horse must in forest be incumbrance be determined to lead way to men at arm when reached forest be saluted by shower of arrow a be clad in mail at distance effected little harm a came closer however clothyard arrow began to pierce coarse ill made armor of foot soldier although finer armor of knight kept out shaft struck against sir rudolph knight leading way entered forest gradually pressed invisible foe backward through tree dog did good service going on ahead attacking archer one by one be soon shot assailant left to own device several attempt be made to fire wood failed fire burning short time then dying out of in addition to fighting men sir rudolph have impressed into service serf of domain armed with ax be directed to cut down tree a force proceeded sir rudolph declaring that must not cease until have leveled whole forest though might take month to do so assailant gained ground steadily resistance being le severe than sir rudolph have anticipated several small hut clearing in forest have be used by outlaw round small crop have be planted be destroyed seemed to promise well for success of enterprise be about two hour after have left castle when heavy cart filled with fagot be seen approaching gate garrison who have not least fear of attack paid attention to until reached edge of moat then warder seeing that contained fagot lowered drawbridge without question raised portcullis opened gate from whom do bring wood asked a man driving ox began to cross bridge from franklin of hopeburn be well said warder for be in arrear now must have sent in firewood two

chamber where lady margaret be confined joy at deliverance be great indeed so unlimited be faith in sir cuthbert that have never lost confidence although did not seem possible that in face of such disparity of number must rescue from power of sir rudolph yet have not given up hope joy of farmer daughter who have be carried off to act a attendant be little inferior to own for once in power of reckless baron girl have small hope of ever being allowed to return again to parent flag of sir rudolph be thrown down from keep that of late earl hoisted in stead for cuthbert although have assumed

upon castle cuthbert said knight be silent for minute at time said at length thought of so doing have occurred to castle be strong surprise must be difficult indeed if baron be lulled in security at present cuthbert said deems afar off watch be likely to be relaxed with sudden onslaught might surely obtain possession blondel be not pressed for time delay of few day can make little difference if therefore think must be of assistance to in attempt sword be sure that of friend must be at disposal knight sat for time in silence thanks generous knight said at last be sorely tempted to avail of offer fear that enterprise be aid however of arm knowledge of war must greatly add to chance if plea will ride to morrow to point where can obtain sight of baron castle when see will judge how far such enterprise a propose be possible be own castle intact cuthbert asked wall be standing said breach have be made in at present be wholly deserted do think cuthbert asked that if succeeded in surprising defeating garrison of castle that must then regain own hold against enemy think must sir adelbert said baron domain be little larger than own many of retainer still live upon estate must be sure gladly join if be to raise flag baron too be hated by neighbor must inflict crushing blow upon methinks must be so long time before must assemble force might regain castle put in attitude of

in day mountain be clad with forest descended nearly to riverside here there upon craggy point be situate fortalices of baron little village nestled in wood stood by river bank fairer scene must not be witnessed in europe be knight said pointing to fortress standing on crag rose high above wood around that said pointing to four mile away similarly placed be own cuthbert examined closely fortress of rotherheim be large building with tower at angle seemed to rise almost abruptly from edge of rock inside rose gable round turret of dwelling place of baron only access be by steep winding path on riverside be indeed strong place cuthbert said difficult to take by surprise watch doubt be always kept over entrance there can hope for success only plan will be to scale wall by mean of ladder how ladder be to be got to so great height own at present pass comprehension after much thought cuthbert went on might methinks be practicable for archer to approach wall to shoot arrow over angle of castle so that must pas inside turret there fall in forest beyond if to arrow be attached light cord must be gained by one on other side stronger cord hauled over to must be attached rope ladder so must be raised to top of wall if sentinel be anywhere near might hear rope pulled across battlement if a may hope watch be kept only over entrance operation might be performed without attracting notice knight be delighted with project seemed perfectly feasible be agreed that attempt must be made will need sir adelbert said archer with strong arm indeed to shoot arrow with cord attached to however light over corner of castle methinks cuthbert said that can do for a lad be used to strong bow of country first thing however will be to obtain such bow doubtless one can be purchased in one of town if not so strong a to be accustomed will at rate suffice for party bivouacked in wood for night for horse have already done very long journey needed rest before starting back for black forest

hour of rest in order that might have full strength for undertaking task before during day cuthbert guided by knight made way through wood to foot of rock on castle stood be extremely steep must be mounted by active men if unopposed from above cuthbert measured height with eye from top of castle wall to place selected a most fitting from to shoot arrow announced to knight that thought there must be difficulty in discharging arrow over angle at whole party made way silently through wood three men be sent round to side of castle opposite that from cuthbert be to shoot length of light string be carefully coiled on ground so a to unwind with greatest facility so offer a little resistance to flight of arrow a might be then being in readiness cuthbert attached end to arrow drawing bow to full compass let fly arrow held breath sound followed discharge be sure therefore that arrow have not struck wall that must have passed clear over hour elapsed before felt that cord be pulled knew that men upon other side have succeeded in finding arrow string attached stronger cord be now fastened to arrow have carried gradually disappeared in darkness party now stole up rock posted at foot of castle wall took with coil of rope ladder end of rope at rope tightened to end attached ladder again ascended until end only remained upon ground knew that must have reached top of wall now held fast knew that on other side following instruction given must have fastened rope to tree upon opposite side be now joined by rest of party sir adelbert leading way followed by cuthbert blondel began cautiously to ascend rope ladder time sound from castle proclaimed that intention be suspected that alarm have be given in silence gained top of wall here remained quiet until whole band be gathered there then made way along until reached stair leading to courtyard descended then raising war cry sir adelbert sprang upon men who round fire be sitting by gate be cut down before must leap to foot party then rushed at entrance to dwelling house retainer of castle aroused by sudden din rushed from sleeping place taken completely by surprise be unable to offer resistance to strong force have a if by magic taken possession of castle surprise be complete with scarce blow struck found in possession baron be seized a rose from bed rage at finding in power of enemy be so great a for time to render

rich voice when blondel ceased sang out second stanza of poem with difficulty blondel cuthbert restrained from extravagant exhibition of joy knew however that men on prison wall be watching a sat singing blondel with final strain taken from ballad of knight who having discovered hiding place of lady love prepared to free from oppressor shouldered lute started on homeward journey there be delay now at time sang indeed at castle only when store be exhausted for upon occasion blondel must be presented with handsome goblet other solid token of owner approval sale of at next city must take far

to testify to falsity of charge fact that richard have placed conrad of montferat upon throne have possible interest in death be alone more than sufficient to nullify vague rumor brought against
