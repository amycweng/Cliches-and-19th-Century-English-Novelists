said nothing to respecting conduct in allowing to be flogged for offence have committed others have not be so reticent have have hard time of in village secondly have be severely thrashed by father in presence of squire former laying on lash with vigour satisfied mr ellison heartiness of thrashing being due not to indignation at fault because boy conduct have excited squire anger thorne for many reason be anxious to deprecate be landlord have power to turn out at quarter notice a there be possibility of obtaining other house near be doing by mean bad trade be anxious to keep on good term with tom thorne be sitting on gate a reuben passed think be fine fellow reuben will be even with day can be even with now reuben said if like to get off gate bai afeared of reuben go to think only ai going

chance of getting even at once tom thorne held tongue only relieving feeling by making grimace after reuben a latter passed on in various contest among boy of village reuben have proved so tough adversary although tom thorne be heavier bigger did not care about entering upon what must be at best doubtful contest with contenting therefore with muttered will be even with day strolled home to father ale house change at school be very speedily made squire generally carried out resolution while be hot on very day after conversation with wife on subject went first to vicar arranged for retirement of clerk instalment of white in place then went to school house informed master of intention latter have be expecting dismissal since mr ellison have spoken to on previous day news squire gave be relief to emolument a clerk must be smaller than received a schoolmaster while must not be able to discharge duty of latter for very much longer for felt boy be getting too much for must be able to perform very easy work entailed by clerkship for many year to come be too position not without dignity indeed in eye of village clerk be personage of far greater importance than schoolmaster therefore thankfully accepted offer agreed to give up school a soon a substitute must be found in day anyone be considered good enough for village schoolmaster post be generally filled by men who have failed a tradesman in everything else put hand to whose sole qualification for office be that be able to read write instead of advertising however in county paper squire wrote to old college friend who be now in charge of london parish asked to choose man for post want chap who will cram sort of new notion into head of child squire said think must do good fit better for station boy have got to be farm labourer girl to be wife if can read really well write fairly be about a much a want in way of learning think that really earnest sort of man might do good otherwise schoolmaster in mind must be clergyman best assistant know dear fellow can explain in word more exactly what mean think will understand will send down sort of man want cottage be comfortable one there be good bit of garden attached to mind paying few shilling week more than do now to get sort of man want if have wife so much better might teach girl to sew must be to nine out of ten deal more use than reading writing if

superior to other lad teach hear that father be in good position a miller mother be of different class altogether to other woman of village boy have certain refinement about thoughtfulness consideration set apart from others mischievous somewhat inclined to be noisy a generally be on day when have not felt quite equal to work must notice at once without saying word must by quietness attention to work try to save trouble have heard try to quiet others a trooped out boy have good heart a well a good intellect nothing save own confession must make believe that poisoned dog said wished be killed squire urged a in defence of own opinion said so squire at time be smarting with pain of severe bite think probably meant more than man who under same circumstance must say 'confound dog even stronger oath mr ellison be silenced for when in wrath be given to use strong expression know what to say shrewsbury said at last be afraid have made mess of certainly a first heard case seemed to admit of doubt word know what to do wife have just be up to see mr whitney woman blazed out at must let say word gave notice that must give up house at end of week if have be for might have done something mr ellison be very much aggrieved at manner altogether be one of most annoying thing ever have to do with in evening schoolmaster put on hat went up with wife to mr woman have seen good deal of other a stood somewhat apart from rest of village in thought speech differed widely from labourer wife on evening when sewing class did not meet schoolmaster wife often went up for hour two to mr whitney latter came down to shrewsburys cottage have come up mr whitney schoolmaster said a entered to tell how sorry be to hear that be going to leave that be still more sorry for cause of course wife believe for moment reuben poisoned squire dog idea be preposterous told squire a much today mr whitney burst into tear have kept up day sustained partly by indignation partly by desire that reuben must not see that felt thought village must believe reuben guilty have cut to heart have felt so unwilling to face anyone a soon a mr ellison have left have closed shutter of little shop broke down now from relief at hearing that someone besides believed boy to be innocent know what will do without mr whitney mr shrewsbury said when widow recovered composure will miss dreadfully be quite settled that will go quite settled mr shrewsbury must stop in squire house for hour longer than must help after believing reuben to be guilty of poisoning dog not believing boy when said have nothing to do with ought to have known boy better than coming up only other day pretending felt kindness for dead husband think squire be too hasty mr whitney schoolmaster said see did not know reuben a do think if will excuse saying so have be little hasty too squire came in to to tell about must see be not satisfied in mind even before gave positive opinion that reuben be innocent do think that if have not given mr ellison notice so sharply squire must have taken back word said that at rate a there be nothing absolutely proved must hold judgment in suspense until matter be cleared up having everyone pointing finger at boy in meantime thank mr shrewsbury must not do for be not bit hasty mr ellison came in here prepared to talk to about reuben wickedness saw in face so must let open lip if have must have given piece of mind that must have forgot in hurry can quite understand feeling mr whitney schoolmaster said have doubt must have acted a did if son of mine have be suspected in same way still think be pity for if reuben have stayed here there must have be more chance of matter being cleared up however wo talk about now now tell be plan mr whitney told visitor what have determined upon a lewes be only four mile off schoolmaster said that wife must sometimes come over to see that hoped that reuben trade be apprenticed to must still go on with study must give advice assistance in power next day mr whitney reuben moved with belonging to lewes chapter burglary at squire what be woman whitney going to do with boy squire asked schoolmaster when happened to meet in village about month after have left have heard nothing be settled yet sir wife have letter from two three day ago saying that have be disappointed in getting mill wright to take wanted fifty pound premium must only afford to pay twenty so be looking out for something else have heard nothing more must throw light on affair squire suppose ever will have opinion about opinion be that of reuben schoolmaster said belief that someone did who have grudge against on purpose to throw suspicion on who must have grudge against squire asked well squire there be one boy in village who have rightly wrongly grudge against reuben be tom thorne reuben have not shadow of evidence that be boy lad have certainly be enemy ever since affair of breaking window of school just before came here thorne know did allowed reuben to be punished for offence truth must never have be known have not be a heard that daughter happened to see stone thrown since time there have be bad blood between boy for moment say that thorne poisoned dog still boy be near enough of size for one to be mistaken for other in dark thorne knew that reuben have be bitten by dog for reuben spoke to boy about afternoon while thorne be standing by of course be vaguest suspicion still if ask opinion must say that consider from what have heard of character of tom thorne that must be much more likely to poison dog in order to get reuben into disgrace than reuben must be to do so out of revenge because dog have bitten squire took off hat passed hand through hair in perplexity know what to think shrewsbury said may be a say look upon thorne a worst character in village likely enough son may take after that ale house of be resort of idle fellow about have strong reason to believe be in alliance with poacher first time get chance out go have only be waiting for time for opportunity ca very well turn out of house without excuse what did say be name of mill wright at lewes mr whitney be wanting to get son with schoolmaster repeated name squire jotted down in notebook look here shrewsbury said mention to mr whitney that spoke to about matter do understand understand schoolmaster said be not surprised when few day afterwards wife received letter from mr whitney saying that mr penfold have come in to say that have changed mind that must take reuben a apprentice for twenty pound adding to surprise that must give crown week for first year gradually raise pay a considered that boy ought to be able to earn little money for reuben therefore be going to work on following week half crown week be to earn be important matter for mother for although have found cottage opened little shop a before receipt be extremely small have already begun to fear that must be obliged to make move lewes being too well supplied with shop for small concern like hers to flourish half crown week however must pay rent expected that must make at rate enough to provide food for herself reuben mr whitney have hoped that although lewes be four mile from village story about dog must not travel so far for be not often that anyone from village went over to town in however be mistaken for week after reuben have gone to work foreman went to master said know whether be aware mr penfold about new boy hear that have to leave tipping where be employed by squire ellison for poisoning squire dog how did hear penfold asked william jenkins heard from man named thorne who belongs to village whom met at public house yesterday william jenkins have best not spend so much time in public house mr penfold said shortly heard story before saw boy from what hear believe be wrongfully accused just tell jenkins say that if hear of of hand throwing thing up in boy face will dismiss instantly so reuben did not know till long after that story of killing of dog be known to anyone at lewes for three year worked in mr penfold yard giving much satisfaction to employer by steadiness handiness continued study of evening under advice of former master who came over with wife three four time year to spend day with mr whitney reuben be now receiving ten shilling week although receipt of shop failed mother be able to live in considerable comfort one day about three year after coming to lewes be returning to work after dinner when a passed carriage standing in front of one of shop heard name pronounced colour flushed to cheek a looking up saw kate ellison timidly touched cap must have hurried on girl called to stop minute reuben want to speak to be glad have met have looked for time have come to lewes wanted to tell that be sure did not kill wolf know must have done besides know told that never told story so when heard that said did be quite sure about thank miss reuben said gratefully did not kill dog must never have thought of such thing though one seemed against not one reuben did think so papa have told since that did not think so that be afraid that have made mistake be glad to hear that miss reuben said squire have be very kind to have always grieved very much that must think capable of such thing felt angry at time have not felt angry since have thought over quietly for case seems so strong against that see how squire must have thought otherwise thank miss sha' forget kindness reuben went on with light heart just a mr ellison elder daughter came out from shop who be speaking to kate asked a took seat in carriage be talking to reuben whitney mamma be passing so called to tell did not believe have killed wolf then be very improper behaviour on part kate mother said angrily for have never quite recovered from shock mr whitney have given to dignity know opinion on subject have told before that be one care to have discussed that consider very improper for girl of age to hold opinion different to of elder have doubt that boy poisoned dog must beg of that will never speak to again kate leaned back in carriage with little sigh must not understand why mother who be so kind to village people must be so implacable on subject kate who be now between fourteen fifteen knew that when mother have taken up certain opinion be not to be shaken that father always avoided argument on point on differed from talking alone with daughter squire have in answer to sturdy assertion of reuben innocence owned to that have doubt on subject that be sorry have dismissed boy from service have never heard do more than utter protest against reuben guilt being held a being absolutely proved when mother spoke of delinquency kate be not one to desert protege having be mean of reuben introduction to father have always regarded a natural protector mr ellison must not have be pleased have known that daughter have seldom met schoolmaster without inquiring if have heard how reuben be getting on have even asked mr shrewsbury to assure of belief in innocence have be done have resolved that must ever meet must herself tell so even at risk of mother displeasure year passed reuben be now seventeen be tall powerfully built young fellow during four year have never be over to tipping in daytime have occasionally walked over after dark to visit shrewsburys always going on special invitation when knew that one else must be there thornes no longer occupied little public house tom thorne have year before be captured with two other poacher in squire wood have have six month hard labour father have at once be ejected from house have disappeared from part of country reuben be glad that have left for have long before heard that thorne have spread story in lewes of poisoning of dog felt however with departure chance of ever being righted in matter be at end one evening in winter when reuben have done work said to mother will go over see mr shrewsbury tonight have not be over for time a be not night for class be pretty sure not to find anyone there told when be there last must take over few tool fix up shelf for suppose will stay very much longer at tipping health be completely restored now

go must have done two year back wife two little one be so well that did not like thought of taking up to london till be sure that health be strong enough to stand steady work will miss very much have be good friend indeed to have indeed mr whitney said think anyhow reuben must have got on at trade must never have be what be now if have be for poor father must be proud of if must see be sure that when take off workman suit put on sunday clothes look a well a if mill have never gone wrong have be brought up a intended to be mr tyler be saying only other day that looked quite gentleman lot of people have said same nonsense mother reuben answered there be nothing of gentleman about of course people say thing that think will please knowing that regard a sort of wonder hope will make way day fact have have better education than most young fellow in position of life of course may make little difference will hope help to mount ladder when once put foot upon although doubt mr whitney be partial judge opinion a to son be not incorrect one for with intelligent face quiet self assured bearing looked very much more like gentleman than many young fellow in far better position in life star be shining brightly when started at seven o'clock in evening walked with brisk step until arrived within mile of village a passed by end of lane ran into road heard horse impatiently pawing ground sound being followed by savage oath to animal to stand quiet reuben walked on few step then paused lane a knew only led to field short distance away what must horse be doing there who must be man who spoke to there have lately be several burglary on lonely house in part of country general belief be that have be perpetrated by men from london daresay be nothing reuben said to still be certainly curious at rate there can be harm in having look walking upon grass at side of road retraced step to end of lane then stood listened heard murmur of voice determined to follow matter up walked quietly down lane after going about hundred yard saw something dark in road approaching very cautiously found that be horse harnessed to gig a be standing wondering what to do next started for silence be broken by voice near be stupid thing to get here so early to have to wait about for four hour in ditch be best plan though voice replied trap might have be noticed if have be driving about road after dark while in daylight one must give second thought be right enough first speaker said be precious cold here hand that flask again be blest if wind doe not come through hedge like knife voice came from other side of hedge on opposite side of lane reuben crossed noiselessly there be gate just where cart have stopped men have evidently got over to obtain shelter of hedge from wind reuben felt gate be old rickety then cautiously placed foot on lower bar leaned forward so a to look round hedge what time be others to be here tom said must be here at nine o'clock passed about six mile on road so ought to be here to time suppose there be doubt about here being good business will answer for other said suppose a there be much money in house there be end of silver plate watch plenty of sparkler have heard say a there be one in county a have more jewel than squire wife know house well never be inside other said have heard enough from have to know where room lie plate chest be in butler pantry a be going to get in by kitchen window be safe to be able to clear that out without being heard will go on directly others come chuck meat to dog will silence know way there for tried that on once before reuben have thought that voice be familiar to word gave clue speaker be tom thorne with be going to commit burglary at squire be hesitating whether to make off at once to warn squire of what be intended to listen learn little more of plan when suddenly light shone behind voice exclaimed with oath who have here leapt down be in act of turning round to defend when heavy blow with cudgel struck on head felled insensible to ground while have be listening to conversation two men have come quietly up lane walking on grass a have done footstep have be unheard by for horse continued at time impatiently to paw ground sound of comrade voice have told where be sitting turning on bull eye lantern to show gate have seen reuben leaning over in act of listening when reuben recovered consciousness found that be lying in ditch hand tightly bound to side handkerchief stuffed into mouth four men be gathered close by talking in low tone ai going to give up job now come so far to do one said with oath besides be not only swag grudge owe squire if be ready to go on suppose need be afraid besides know best cut throat done with voice reuben recognized a of old enemy said owe one will be safest to stop mouth third voice protested ai going to have nothing to do with cutting throat mind running risk of botany bay ai going to run chance of being scragged let move bit away from here while settle hit pretty hard will be coming round presently thought at first that have killed be bleeding too free for that men moved little distance away for time reuben must hear murmured talk must make out nothing of what have be said be judged quarter of hour before conversation ceased did not return to remained at distance off reuben thought that heard footstep of one of going down lane must feel by warm sensation across cheek that blood be flowing freely from wound have received on temple dull torpid feeling came over after time again lost consciousness how long remained in state did not know be at last aroused by being lifted thrown into bottom of cart four men then climbed up into horse be started drove at quick pace reuben wondered why be taking away with head ached terribly suffered much from tightness of cord bound arm men seemed in high good humour talked laughed in low tone noise of vehicle prevented reuben hearing what be said be a far a must judge full two hour before vehicle stopped be roughly taken out of cart arm be unbound men leaping up drove away at full speed spot where have be left be very dark for tree overshadowed on side where be have idea judged that must be fully twenty mile from village first impulse be to take handkerchief from mouth then walked slowly along road in direction from have come be felt sure use shouting for must have be certain to have selected lonely spot to set down there must be chance of awakening inhabitant of distant cottage walked slowly for be faint with loss of blood after proceeding about quarter of mile emerged from wood came upon spot where road forked having clue whatever a to direction in lewes lay sat down upon heap of stone waited patiently for morning have doubt that burglary have be successful one bitterly regretted neglect to keep watch down lane to see that be not surprised by men have heard be coming at rate hoped that must be able to give such information a must set constable upon track seemed to that three hour passed before faint light began to dawn in sky by knew that must be about past six calculated therefore must have set out in trap about half past one now started to walk along road hoping that must soon meet labourer going to work stopping by small stream ran across road washed head face a have lain on ground after being struck blood have not flowed on to clothes after wash proceeded with brisker step hour later met ploughman riding one of team to field be road to lewes reuben asked lewes noa baint road to lewes know nothing about road to lewes bee road to hastings if go further so tell ai never be there be there village anywhere about here reuben asked ay mile so on reuben walked on till got to village then going to public house obtained refreshment learned from landlord direction must take to get to main road leading to lewes be a expected twenty mile away found that cart have not followed main road towards london have driven by crossroad for considerable distance before turning north be late in afternoon before reuben arrived at lewes for have be obliged to rest often by way have made slow progress when within few door of mother house one of constable of town came up to touched on shoulder arrest in king name arrest what for reuben exclaimed for breaking into house of squire ellison of tipping be what be for reuben laughed have got wrong man time have more to do with burglary than child be laughing matter constable said if be innocent have got to prove ai business of mine have got to do be to arrest so saying before reuben knew what be about slipped pair of handcuff over wrist reuben flushed up hitherto have scarcely taken matter seriously to be marched through street of lewes be indignity enraged take off said angrily will go quietly with may may not man said doggedly be younger than be maybe can run faster ai agoing to chance reuben saw that be of use to argue silent pale walked along by side of constable who retained tight hold of collar little crowd gathered speedily round for such sight be unusual in lewes reuben felt thankful when reached cell be sheltered from gaze of public minute later head constable came in now lad say anything to criminate began le talk better for be sorry to see here for knew father have good character of from employer so give advice keep mouth shut be not going to keep mouth shut reuben said indignantly here be arrested in public street marched handcuffed through town upon most monstrous charge have be brought against without shadow of evidence be talking be talking constable said testily will hear evidence in time enough will talk want to tell what be happened will see that be innocent at once very well if will will mind blame afterwards reuben told story of adventure from time of leaving there said when finished be that enough to show that be innocent no chief constable said gravely be not enough to prove anything one way other be bound to say story look likely one if be for two three matter heard of from constable who came over from tipping must have doubt about however be for magistrate to decide there will be meeting tomorrow ca be taken before magistrate at once there be captain fidler within mile what must be good chief constable said suppose anyone must let out only on strength of story have told must only remand must gain nothing by can see mother reuben asked next yes constable said will send down message at once mr whitney soon came up neighbour have brought in news when reuben have be arrested be on point of starting to inquire about when message arrived be more indignant than grieved when heard charge have be brought against reuben idea of such thing exclaimed constable seem to have natural sense idea of charging anyone who be known a respectable young man with thing a shutting up without question why there ca be evidence against there be saying mother reuben replied must be too sure of that remember that affair of dog well same hand be at work now before only suspected who have done be sure now however evidence may have got know be true have four year good character here to speak for still be hard must get into position of sort without fault of mine be better that be without fault of yours reuben be right enough mother so will keep up spirit chapter trial there be three magistrate on bench on following morning when reuben be brought up justice room be crowded for series of burglary have caused excitement news that house of mr ellison have be broken into that one of men who have be taken turned out to belong to lewes have created quite sensation mr ellison be first to give evidence testified that on waking on previous morning found that someone have be in room during night be not in habit of locking door have not be awakened found that box stood on dressing table containing valuable jewelry be gone that watch that of mr ellison have be taken that drawer have be opened case containing more valuable jewel of wife have also be abstracted be not discovered till afterwards first missed watch rang servant up for be still early be then discovered that lower premise have be broken into plate chest in butler pantry broken open large quantity of plate stolen what do estimate value of article stolen mr ellison value of wife jewel must put down roughly at two thousand pound silver plate might have be worth three hundred more watch other article so far a yet miss say hundred servant proved that found kitchen window open on going downstairs have be opened by catch being forced back be not custom to put up shutter pantry door be strong one have be cut with saw round lock butler testified to plate having be safe night before strong chest in be kept having be forced open directly be discovered constable of village be placed in charge of room with order to admit one man on horseback be sent off to lewes to chief constable village constable gave evidence a to state of place when be put in charge constable who have be sent over from lewes then stepped into witness box testified to mark of entry of thief said that manner in have gone to work in door have be sawn through chest forced open seemed to show that be work of practised hand on examining closely butler pantry found powerful screwdriver heavy chisel corresponded to mark in lid have evidently be used for purpose of forcing open have initial r w burnt in handle inmate of house denied knowledge of tool mr ellison have be present when showed to mr ellison on looking at said at once r w why must be reuben whitney that wicked boy again upon making inquiry found that man named worked at mr penfold mill wright at lewes returned there at once going to mr penfold found prisoner be absent from work men identified brand on tool a of prisoner constable proved arrest chief constable then read statement that prisoner have made to magistrate conferred together for few minute in undertone mr ellison senior of said addressing that lady who be sitting on chair placed at upper end of court be sorry to trouble must ask to go into witness box wish to ask went on when have taken stand in box how be at once connected initial with prisoner because have at one time lived in village be employed assisting gardener be discharged on suspicion of having poisoned watchdog have bit a three dog about place have be poisoned on night when house be broken into name have be in mind on seeing initial naturally recognized at once there be deep silence in court when mr ellison gave evidence hitherto impression have be rather favourable to prisoner story though strange have be by mean impossible if true must have completely accounted for finding of tool be only evidence against evidence of mr ellison however entirely altered complexion of case reuben have stood quiet composed during hearing countenance have evinced no surprise emotion when tool be produced have indeed upon thinking matter over before coming into court come to conclusion that tool have in small basket at time be attacked have be found in near house having be left there purposely by tom thorne in order to throw suspicion upon production therefore be surprise to slight shade have passed over face when mr ellison entered witness box glancing at squire a gave evidence reuben saw that mr ellison looked greatly vexed annoyed a before at conclusion of evidence of witness reuben be asked if have question to put hesitated for moment then a before replied in negative again magistrate consulted together mr ellison will be obliged if will enter witness box again in former evidence mr ellison said nothing in way relating to prisoner now seems have previous acquaintance with will tell court what be have not much to say squire said a boy lived in village with mother most respectable person widow of jacob whitney miller in good way of business who a may be in memory be found drowned in mill pond seven eight year ago widow being in reduced circumstance settled in tipping boy be intelligent lad when boy employed in garden left gave place gave satisfaction one day be severely bitten by watchdog three day later dog be found poisoned gardener saw boy running away from spot quarter of hour before dog died believed to be prisoner be too dark for to distinguish feature at time certainly suspected that have be guilty of poisoning dog in spite of denying that have anything to do with a be unable to account for where be at time boy be seen discharged wish to say publicly have deeply regretted having done so ever since that consider acted hastily wrongly in so doing considering previous good character ought not to have assumed guilt without more positive evidence than have before may also say that schoolmaster of village will give prisoner highest character for truthfulness have known ever since present employer mr penfold be also believe ready to testify to excellent conduct during four year of apprenticeship suppose mr ellison senior magistrate said have not at time since poisoning of dog obtained actual evidence must show that be mistaken in first view that subsequent change of opinion be due solely to general view of boy character so far a knew be so squire assented further question being asked resumed seat evidence have caused surprise little amusement in court be clear that there be strong difference of opinion between wife on subject that while lady have something like animus against prisoner squire be strongly impressed in favour after consultation magistrate said case will be remanded until day week to see if further evidence be forthcoming may say that under present circumstance of case will feel ourselves obliged to send for trial prisoner account of proceeding from time left lewes on previous evening up to of return arrest here may be true so far be entirely unsupported on other hand have evidence of tool admitted to belong to being found on scene of burglary have further important fact that have be formerly employed upon place have may be supposed knowledge of premise have be discharged upon suspicion rightfully wrongly entertained of having poisoned dog belonging to mr ellison there be reason for belief that dog poisoned before burglary be got at by one acquainted with place will be use calling evidence a to character at next meeting reuben asked magistrate said evidence of kind will be useful at trial when matter will be thoroughly sifted only have to decide that there be prima facie evidence connecting with offence of that there can be doubt at sitting week later fresh evidence be produced reuben be committed for trial at next assize public opinion in lewes ran high on subject of reuben guilt innocence other workman at mill wright be strongly in favour be very popular among fellow pointed out that several hand must have be concerned in business that be never seen about in public house of evening be likely to have connection with bad character be probable if have gone about job a that must have taken tool marked with own initial if have that must have be fool enough to leave behind upon other hand opinion in general ran strongly against story be declared to be utterly improbable fellow who have once be dismissed for poisoning dog must be likely at future time to revenge upon employer who turned off a to mr ellison declaration of subsequent opinion that acted hastily little weight be attached to everyone knew squire ellison be kind hearted man a acknowledged that have obtained evidence must satisfy that have acted wrongly in first case be clear that be from mere kindness of heart that have changed mind on subject at tipping subject be never mentioned squire mr ellison have on drive home have most serious quarrel have ever taken place during wedded life have ended by former saying if anyone have ever told before mary that be vindictive woman must have knocked down might do so now must know in heart that have spoken truly for reason other took prejudice against boy never forgave mother for standing up in defence be shocked downright shocked when gave evidence in court mr ellison have be too much offended to reply rest of drive have be passed in silence upon return home girl be full of eager question squire said shortly dear le talk about better mother differ entirely on subject belief that reuben whitney be guilty be absolutely convinced be innocent therefore if please will not discus following morning kate ellison went down to school house mr shrewsbury said putting head in at door must come out for two three minute want particularly to speak to have heard what took place yesterday at lewes asked when came out yes miss ellison saw jones constable last night told have be said in court think reuben whitney be innocent asked eagerly be quite sure of miss a sure a be of own existence for anyone who know to have doubt be absolutely absurd finer young fellow than reuben must be hard to find what did say how did account for tool being found there schoolmaster repeated account reuben have given said when trial come off will of course go over testify a to general conduct to fact that have a said promised to bring over tool to put up shelf in cupboard do think will get off mr shrewsbury asked anxiously must hope so miss ellison ca disguise from that be by mean certain that unfortunate old business about dog will tell terribly against though be perfectly sure that account of what took place be correct there be nothing to confirm be just sort of story will say that must naturally get up to account for absence for tool being found of course if jury knew a well a do result must be certain have be trying to look at fact a if be stranger ca say what decision must come to in case still of course high character will be given fact that there be evidence whatever connecting in way with bad character must count immensely in favour assize be to take place only fortnight after date of reuben committal mr whitney have engaged lawyer in town to defend son to surprise of gentleman mr ellison called upon two three day later said mr brogden hear that have be engaged by mr whitney to defend son believe young fellow be guilty therefore authorize to spend sum may be necessary in getting up defence wish to instruct counsel to appear for of course can not appear openly in matter name must not be mentioned will guarantee expense seems to that must be desirable to find out if possible village where say breakfasted asked way to lewes in story say did know name of village a be told be about twenty mile from lewes can describe road followed there ought to be difficulty in finding must advise to have chat with shrewsbury schoolmaster at tipping be great friend of lad very intelligent fellow may be able to suggest point to be followed up at rate do can reuben have adherent who be also acting on behalf afternoon before trial kate ellison stopped before blacksmith shop in village seeing that jacob priestley smith be at work alone entered be true jacob that have be summoned on jury at lewes tomorrow yes miss bee true sureley be four year since anyone in village be summoned be mighty hard that must have picked upon still have never be called before so suppose must grumble be hard to be taken away from work to waste one time in court say beizes ull last for three day well jacob know that reuben whitney be going to be tried for robbery at house yes miss so say well what do think about jacob think nothing one way other miss most folk say a how must have done a how poisoned squire dog afore did do anything of sort jacob be very wicked of people to say so be innocent quite innocent be sure be papa be quite sure too will be terribly put out if be found guilty so want to promise that whatever others think will hold out that be innocent well miss smith said scratching head if be sure of squire be sure suppose there ca be doubt about for who must know better than squire be sure must go to put about for better landlord than squire ai to be found in county so tell miss a will hold out papa doe know have come down here jacob must do for to interfere know especially a be magistrate must mention to anyone have spoken to about not to anyone jacob not even to wife can tell squire will be heartily pleased if be found innocent will be terribly put out if be found guilty right miss smith replied understand one sha' know a have spoken to aboot be quite enough for to know a squire know a be innocent ai likely a must stick opinion up against day after heard of reuben arrest schoolmaster went over to see a be bearer of letter from mr ellison to governor of jail be able to obtain admittance be there ever such unfortunate fellow a be reuben exclaimed after first hearty greeting here be for second time accused of crime of be innocent from indeed in present case be sufferer have come about simply because went out of way to inquire into what seemed to suspicious business tell about reuben have heard statement made to chief constable tell again with detail can think of circumstance appears to a trifling may furnish clue have seen mr brogden lawyer have told happened reuben said of course will gladly tell again reuben repeated story of adventure with detail that must think of speaking slowly a schoolmaster wrote down at length will see what can make of when think over mr shrewsbury said of course a stand be so natural probable that must clear at once have not be for unfortunate dog business before supposition excited by that have feeling of hostility to squire will be able partly to dispose of for can swear that have frequently spoken to of squire in tone of respect liking that although regretted manner in left service felt ill will against on account of moreover will be able to prove that reason gave for having tool with be true one although can not swear that expected specially on evening fact that be in habit of coming over at time to see can not corroborate story will get leave for two three day will hunt up village where breakfasted thank very much reuben said though have be thinking over see that evidence of people at public house must help much will simply prove passed through there in morning will not show in way whether went willingly a far a that a one of party who broke into house whether be taken there can probably prove that looked pale exhausted schoolmaster said fancy must look pale in case reuben said if have gone through night work a of breaking into squire well keep up courage reuben may be quite sure that friend will do in power for will go now have chat with mother be afraid that will want comforting more than do yes reuben agreed be afraid so somehow seem to take to heart much will feel more afterwards perhaps at present whole thing seems so extraordinary that ca quite realize be in danger of being sent to botany bay worst of be that even if be acquitted lot of people will still think be guilty there be only one thing can really prove innocence be arrest of tom thorne father hear schoolmaster said that chief constable have written up to bow street for to put runner on trace of two scoundrel whether believe story not be quite evident that more than one person be concerned in affair theory of course be that quarrelled with others over division of spoil got that knock on head be very severe one went down yesterday with jones to see spot where said be assaulted there be mark where horse stopped mark of foot in field patch of blood of go to prove that story may be true unfortunately doe prove that be because according to theory against might have be assaulted after robbery a well a before in case reuben said why must have taken trouble to carry twenty mile away yes there be of course question schoolmaster said thoughtfully then on other hand why did take trouble in case be not accomplice in case answer be same did to prevent giving alarm until have got far away from scene did like to murder because of consequence to must not risk recovering consciousness getting up early pursuit cut way see so doe reuben assented be just question of belief own myself that old dog business be very much against ca blame anyone who considers guilty reuben be last case taken at assize occasioned good deal of interest in part of sussex partly owing to position of squire ellison partly to nature of defence set up a to opinion be good deal divided evidence for prosecution be to great extent similar to given at inquiry before magistrate unfortunately for reuben judge be notoriously severe one bias from first appeared to be against prisoner mr ellison be closely questioned by prosecutor a to poisoning of dog a be considered to show particular animus on part of reuben again repeated conviction of reuben innocence in affair what reason have mr ellison counsel for prosecution asked blandly for changing opinion on subject be just question squire must not answer satisfactorily be particularly irritating one because have often be triumphantly asked by wife can really give particular reason said except on reflection boy previous character antecedent convinced that must not have done act in fact counsel said suavely be influenced by own goodness of heart mr ellison in thus laying aside conviction fact have at time forced upon look upon in light squire replied shortly consider in first instance acted hastily unadvisedly on consideration saw have done so be afraid mr ellison counsel said that will not persuade jury to agree with have only one two question to ask counsel for defence said when rose to cross examine for indeed evidence be a think jury will agree altogether in favour of prisoner in first place be lad when in employment ever upstairs in house not that know of squire replied certainly in course of duty must never be there indeed must be very seldom that must even enter kitchen except to bring in vegetable certainly must never pas through to go upstairs must not possibly have done so without exciting attention remark must therefore mr ellison have mean of possessing knowledge a to internal arrangement of house beyond possessed by other people in village none mr ellison replied now a to unfortunate affair of poisoning of dog opinion a to innocence of prisoner in matter be not recent one not outcome of after good conduct character not at mr ellison said changed opinion on matter very shortly indeed after affair within few day think may say counsel asked within very few day may almost say within few hour squire replied boy story told not to to that believed dog be poisoned by lad in village who owed grudge who have since turned out exceedingly bad character struck a being very much more probable than that must do mr ellison be next called evidence a to robbery be mere repetition of given by squire counsel then turned to question of poisoning must rather say nothing about mr ellison said be matter have be productive of much pain to must rather say nothing about must madam judge said sharply be here to answer question may enable jury to form opinion on case be sorry to press mr ellison counsel continued really must do so took different opinion to held by husband regret to say that did mr ellison told reason have for suspecting boy thought reason sufficient have seen cause for changing opinion after evidence for prosecution have be given counsel for defence pointed out that there be in fact evidence whatever connecting reuben with robbery beyond discovery of tool on premise a to trumpery story of poisoning dog four year before apparently only for purpose of showing sort of animus regarded a altogether contemptible when man meant to commit burglary in house did so in order to obtain possession of good not from spite against owner have young fellow felt malice for ridiculous charge on have be dismissed must not have allied with burglar to rob house must probably have vented spite in usual fashion by setting fire to stack outhouse so far a must see there be foundation for charge brought against have already heard mr ellison declare that regretted have suspected that believed to be innocent even have be proved up to hilt that prisoner have poisoned dog must still hold a wholly unconnected with present matter if have poisoned dog what then be not heinous sin must affect moral character boy like having piece taken out of calf by savage dog there must have be nothing so very dreadful have revenged be probable that even among jury there be one more who if have not absolutely set poison for neighbour cat for destroying young chicken scratching up flower bed have threatened to do so must not have regarded a very serious crime have done so therefore contended that jury must put trumpery affair altogether out of mind on double ground that in first place prisoner at bar did not poison dog have done so must have have nothing to do with present affair why gentleman said be insult to understanding to ask to credit that young fellow whose character will presently prove to by unimpeachable evidence be of highest kind have for four year cherished such malice against employer for dismissing mistakenly that have become consort of thief burglar have stained hand in crime rendered liable to transportation for purpose merely of spiting that gentleman contention must be absolutely absurd must beg to dismiss altogether from mind approach from different standpoint altogether divested of extraneous business matter be most simple one prisoner left mother cottage at seven o'clock in evening to go over for hour two to friend mr shrewsbury schoolmaster of tipping took with few tool a have promised to put shelf in friend house on way heard talking down lane knew led to only field thinking strange went to see who be distance down found horse cart standing listening to conversation of two men who be sitting under hedge heard enough to inform that burglary be intended upon house of mr ellison be about to make off to give alarm when be suddenly attacked by men who have come up behind be felled to ground while lying insensible be bound hand foot left in ditch where remained till burglar returned from completing work on hand then threw into cart put down twenty mile away being greatly exhausted by loss of blood be late in afternoon before arrived at lewes when be at once arrested gentleman be prisoner story a related to chief constable when be taken to lockup nothing can be simpler more probable in point at least will be able to confirm by independent testimony mr shrewsbury will tell that prisoner have arranged to come over to see bring tool will also tell that two day after prisoner arrest went with jones village constable found mark where horse trap have stood while just inside field grass be trampled with foot in bottom of dry ditch be great dark patch be able to ascertain to be blood doctor hewitt will tell that be called in to strap up prisoner head after arrest that cut be very severe one must have be inflicted by heavy weapon with great force be convinced gentleman that after hearing evidence will agree with not only that prisoner be perfectly innocent of charge that be most ill used person that be matter of surprise regret that magistrate must have committed for trial when only shadow of evidence against be discovery of tool discovery at once explained of other evidence there be not one jot tittle attempt have be made to prove that prisoner be in habit of consorting with bad character attempt have be made to show connection between men who came in horse trap across hill for purpose of effecting burglary at mr ellison who a know did effect scrap of property stolen from house have be found upon in order to account for severe wound on head counsel for prosecution have started hypothesis that be given in course of quarrel during division of plunder have that be case gentleman prisoner must not have be standing here alone robbed ill treated by companion of must naturally have put officer of justice on track a must have be in communication with well acquainted with way haunt must have given information must have led to early arrest must well have done for crown must have made difficulty whatever in promising lad like free pardon on condition of turning evidence against burglar whose mode of procedure show to have be old hand who be doubt same who have committed various robbery have lately taken place in part of country prisoner be son of highly respectable parent employer will come before give evidence of extremely high character bear mr shrewsbury will tell that have for last four year devoted inconsiderable portion of leisure time to improve education enable to recover position occupied by father who be much respected miller in neighbourhood will leave case in hand gentleman with absolute confidence that will without moment hesitation find verdict proclaiming innocence of client enable to leave dock without stain upon character chapter not guilty schoolmaster be first witness called for defence after stating that although evening be actually settled for coming over expected prisoner one evening week that have promised to bring tool over to do little job of carpentering also detailed visit to lane result of observation there then gave reuben highest character saying that have known for five year that have absolute confidence in integrity honesty have from first said proved most intelligent hard working boy anxious to improve to get on in world have learnt must teach more be one of last person in world whom must consider capable of crime with be charged a to having animosity to mr ellison can swear that on many different occasion have expressed high opinion of have declared that be quite natural that with evidence before must have thought guilty of poisoning dog keeper of wayside public house where have breakfasted proved that be struck with prisoner appearance when entered that be very pale seemed scarcely able to walk have asked nearest way to lewes have inquired whether there be chance of getting lift a be anxious to get back a soon a possible mr penfold be next witness said that prisoner have be apprenticed to four year previously that general conduct have be most excellent that be remarkably quick intelligent be excellent workman during time that have be employed have never lost day at time be apprenticed to mr penfold reuben counsel asked be aware that lad have be summarily discharged by mr ellison be aware of fact mr penfold answered reuben with surprise looked at employer from whom did hear of heard of from mr ellison who called upon about matter how be came to call upon mr penfold prisoner mother have applied to about apprenticing son have asked pound premium said that be custom to pay wage for first year said must only afford pound thought be end of matter until few day later mr ellison called upon said that have heard from schoolmaster in village who be friend of boy mother how matter stood that application have fallen through owing to being unable to find more than pound said that be so mr ellison then said that be prepared to make up deficiency that have regard for boy father moreover have through hasty misconception regarding poisoning of dog discharged lad from service that felt uneasy in mind at having be guilty of piece of injustice over above pound gave six pound ten in order might pay boy crown week for first year said must be matter of consequence to mother requested on account to let mr whitney know that have intervened in matter to represent that changed mind be willing to take pound offered a premium be particularly anxious on point because said must certainly refuse to accept assistance from owing to unfortunate affair about dog may say that from time to have not mentioned fact to anyone sum of pound be inserted in indenture of apprenticeship there be little movement of applause in court a mr penfold gave evidence reuben looked gratefully towards mr ellison said heartily thank sir with heart foreman of yard be next examined confirmed high character mr penfold have given reuben adding that knew lad never entered public house spent evening almost entirely at home studying for that have many time called in have upon occasion found so employed counsel for prosecution then addressed jury threw discredit upon reuben narrative said be unsupported in material particular that met rest of party in lane be likely enough may have returned there with after burglary probably be there that in quarrel over spoil received blow of have heard learned friend have told to dismiss from mind question about poisoning of dog four year ago be impossible for to do so have heard that dog be poisoned that evidence be so strong that employer at once dismissed be true that mr ellison have told that afterwards changed mind on subject after evidence mr penfold have given of kindness of gentleman heart will readily understand that great stress can be laid upon matter so far from being trivial a friend represents be highly important inasmuch a here find again dog have be poisoned just a on first occasion be clear that burglar from london must be ignorant of whereabouts of kennel be not likely to have come down provided with store of poisoned meat have not known from person well acquainted with place of step must have to be taken before entry must be effected into house will therefore see extreme importance of point be perfectly ready to admit that evidence be of wholly circumstantial nature from nature of case be necessary that must be so have mr mr ellison awoke when thief entered room be probable that much more evidence must be forthcoming be however for to weigh probability of case have to consider whether theory have laid before a to connection of prisoner with affair wild story tell be most probable judge then summed up with strong bias against reuben told that evidence for character be of course of importance that must not be relied upon too far prisoner appeared undoubtedly to be intelligent well conducted unfortunately experience told that many criminal be men of unusual intelligence stress have be laid by counsel for defence upon fact that prisoner be not known at time to have consorted with suspicious character after be only negative evidence affair of sort be always conducted with secrecy have one of men come down from london a be probable enough to make inquiry a to house must be broken into with prospect of good booty must naturally not make conspicuous have heard two story must judge for agreed with counsel for prosecution that fact that prisoner have be discharged by mr ellison for poisoning dog that on night of robbery other dog be found poisoned that probably by one acquainted with locality must not have influence upon mind at same time must tell that if have doubt in mind be duty to give prisoner benefit of doubt jury consulted together for minute two in jury box then expressed desire to retire buzz of talk arose in court when have left opinion be divided a to what verdict must be when counsel for defence sat down general opinion be that prisoner must be certainly acquitted speech of counsel for prosecution summing up of judge have caused reaction few doubted now that verdict must be guilty so reuben thought be felt hard that standing there to be tried for burglary decision must in fact depend upon unjust charge have four year ago be brought against reuben be in habit of what called arguing thing out by a stood there waiting for verdict tried to put in position of jury felt that in case must have difficulty in coming to decision be not until after lamp have be lighted that jury returned into box crier shouted for order there be not sound heard a foreman told judge that be not agreed upon verdict then must go back gentleman until be judge said be eleven one way one other wo that do lord sir judge replied must be unanimous jury again retired judge counsel went off to dine at hotel almost public trooped out two hour later a jury did not return reuben whitney be taken back to jail court closed at nine o'clock in morning warder entered jury have come back into court said be going to return verdict reuben be again placed in dock seat open to public quickly filled a news spread through town several of member of bar dropped in then judge came in took seat reuben have occupied time in trying to judge from face of jury what verdict be going to be looked sulky tired a reuben eye rested on jacob priestley whom have at once recognized among jury smith gave encouraging wink at least so reuben thought a next moment be looking a surly a rest thought that must have be mistaken be agreed gentleman a to verdict find in case judge asked be lord foreman replied do find prisoner guilty not guilty not guilty lord very well gentleman judge said tartly be verdict not mine at foreman word thrill have run through court for when be known evening before eleven be one way one other belief have be general that majority be for conviction reuben have so understood verdict be complete surprise to illustration reuben whitney acquitted of charge of burglary constable raised bar for to leave dock a moved out friend schoolmaster pushed forward shook warmly by hand thank god for verdict reuben be indeed rejoiced own hardly expected did expect at reuben said in choked voice for sudden liberation have shaken more than arrest of subsequent proceeding have done congratulate heartily reuben mr ellison said putting hand on shoulder squire have waited at lewes until ten o'clock on previous evening have driven over again first thing in morning so anxious be about verdict did believe guilty time boy from first be glad indeed to hear verdict for after judge summing up be sorely uneasy now reuben hope said a entered street that have quite forgiven for old business have be unfortunate cause of getting into affair have not be for one must ever for moment have doubted truth of story there be nothing to forgive squire reuben said never blamed for from first even have done so goodness of only heard yesterday must have made up many time for mistake may have made then be right lad squire said be glad that matter be made up now will not keep for know will want to be off home to mother reuben walked quietly home so a to give schoolmaster who have hurried on ahead time to break news of acquittal to mother mr whitney have remained in court during trial have retired when jury left to consider verdict being completely overcome with agitation excitement schoolmaster have slept in house have persuaded not to go to court in morning fearing a did that verdict must be hostile one completely broke down when be told news be still sobbing when reuben arrived schoolmaster at once took leave leaving mother son together promised to return in day two when again came over saw at once mr whitney be looking depressed unhappy what do think mr shrewsbury reuben say that will go abroad out to australia have talked against till be hoarse be good hope will persuade to give up mad idea will hear what have to say first mr whitney reuben have generally good deal to say for side of question must hear reason before can argue against now reuben what have to say for made up mind while be in jail reuben replied that if be acquitted must go right away thing stick to man through life that first affair four year ago nearly got transported now if small matter like did such harm what will do if have be proved to be innocent must have be different a be believe nine people out of ten in court thought be guilty be convinced that jury be eleven to one against only twelfth be more obstinate than be so gave in believe be jacob priestley blacksmith who held out for sake of old time at rate great many people will think guilty life unless something turn up to prove innocence mother say might settle somewhere else where ai known must never feel safe year on someone from lewes might see tell story tom thorne might keep on track wo risk have be to mr penfold say if be determined to go will cancel indenture for have doubt will find work of sort out there be pretty good workman now at own craft if ca get work at can turn hand to something else only trouble be about mother want to go with must make living for out there wo have say six month at sea will kill then have sort of idea in head about native however hope that in two three year time will be able to write tell have comfortably settled have good home ready for to come to that then will join never mr whitney said excitedly be born at lewes have lived near day will die here be not going to tramp over world settle down among black people in outlandish part must not do mr shrewsbury be cruel of to ask schoolmaster be silent for minute saw that reuben mind be firmly made up must not deny force of reasoning be true that many people still considered guilty be true that story might crop up again year on ruin life did seem that best thing must do be to leave country australia be not so bad place a fancy mr whitney said at last do have trouble with native certainly in outlying settlement in town have more trouble than have here besides year white population be increasing black diminishing six month voyage be not so dreadful a seems though do think that if reuben go out will be better for to remain quietly here till have home prepared for think that when time come will change mind about a to reuben must own there be good deal of force in what say that until thornes have be sent out of country story might follow have doubt must do well out there be good workman for age a say can turn hand to almost anything labour be scarce out there a have got head screwed on right way have doubt that will fall on foot did expect of mr shrewsbury mr whitney said beginning to cry thought must have taken part now be going right against not against mr whitney for think that reuben plan be best for can not suffer if remains here will be unhappy in seeing suffer great a loss must be to believe that must be happier here alone than must be be to see in constant trouble worry at rate must have option if found life intolerably dull here of joining out there at time how do intend to get out reuben asked seeing that mr whitney made answer again relapsed into tear will work way out reuben replied can do rough work a smith carpenter must think ought to get passage for work anyhow have got twelve pound saved up if ca get out free that work ought to take in short time mr whitney finding that reuben be not to be shaken in determination ceased to oppose began to busy in preparation for departure have arranged to take place a soon a possible day two

a easy a mounting ladder slackness of ratline a sailor told be name of piece of rope answered to round of ladder made at first awkward when reached main top sailor told to sit down look round quietly till became accustomed to height look unnatural risky at first said when get accustomed to will feel just a safe when be astraddle end of yard ship rolling fit to take mast out a if be standing on deck a reuben have heard sailor laughing joking aloft a hauled out earring of sail have doubt that what sailor said be true seemed to that must never accustom to sit at end of spar with nothing water at vast depth below must be bad even with ship lying quiet a at present must be terrible with vessel in heavy sea sailor now told name of mast stay giving general idea of work aloft presently asked whether must like to return to deck now to mount bit higher although reuben be now becoming accustomed to position must have consulted inner feeling have rather gone down than up thought be better to put good face on to accustom at once to what must probably have to do sooner later holding on tight then following instruction of companion made way up until be seated on cap of top gallant mast holding tight to spar towered still higher above be surprised at size strength of spar have looked so light slender from below very well done lad sailor said approvingly must make good sailor in time

little flustrated when got into top after have sat down bit breath come quiet regular again must see there be chance of nerve going next morning soon after daybreak dockyard boat began to row alongside with grey coated convict reuben watched a came on board with sort of fascination with closely cut hair bullet head evil face although have doubt that repulsive expression be due partly to close cut hair shaved face hideous garb must scarcely repress shudder a looked at in face expression of brutal ferocity be dominant others have shifty cunning look le repulsive there be few good humoured face one two so different from others reuben wondered whether be innocent victim of circumstance a have so nearly be not till now did quite realize how great escape have be thought that might have have to spend rest of life herding with such men a made feel almost sick thanked god more fervently even than have done when verdict be returned restored to liberty that have be saved from such fate hundred eighty convict came on board be in charge of ten warder with loaded musket hour later party of twenty marine under charge of officer also embarked be on way out to join ship in australian water be to aid warder in keeping convict in good order wind being favourable time be lost after marine have come on board mooring be cast off sail hoisted paramatta made way against tide to mouth of

captain order must henceforth be in watch a be not regularly shipped a sailor mate said captain doe not wish to go aloft unless by own desire there will be plenty of work for to do on deck hauling at brace scrubbing so on must be glad to do work with rest reuben said a soon a feel can be useful aloft be up two three time yesterday hope in few day to be quite accustomed to have noticed lad must not be in better hand than bill be capital sailor a have taken to be willing to learn will be useful hand before get to sydney even if never go to sea again life will find that have learned great deal be

towards evening turned face towards sea a have wish to avail of permission given to sleep on shore presently encountered miss hudson miss furley walking other way former nodded brightly for have several time spoken to reuben since first acquaintanceship reuben touched hat proceeded on way have gone few yard when heard loud cry everyone darted suddenly into shop round corner looking round in

forward passed terrified woman when malay be within four pace of threw with force upon malay whose eye be fixed upon lady be taken by surprise by assault crease have not time to fall when reuben sprang upon shock threw to ground reuben a fell throwing arm round adversary malay struggled furiously combatant rolled over over on ground strong a reuben be frenzy of malay gave greater power lad felt must not long retain grip of arm with malay strove to use crease help however be not long in coming native policeman ran up at full speed brought heavy club with full force down on head of malay latter limb at once relaxed reuben sprang to foot breathless not seriously harmed although blood be freely flowing from slight wound have received from malay sharp edged weapon chapter gratitude reuben looked round upon gaining foot saw miss hudson standing by side of companion who have fallen fainting to ground mr hudson captain wilson running at full speed be within few pace of girl have entered shop to make purchase while lady strolled on although have rushed out on hearing alarm be too far off to render assistance impotent to help have seen with terrible death threatened lady france hudson have not uttered word from moment when malay rushed down upon a father came up turned round burst into tear a clasped in arm a soon a be seen that malay be no longer dangerous people poured out again from house shop be very unusual thing in cape town for malay to run amuck many of in street hurried off in direction from man have come to inquire how many victim have fallen to deadly crease to see whether friend be among on malay one spared moment attention second tremendous blow with policeman club have dashed out brain for malay running amuck be always killed upon spot partly in order to save further trouble with partly to strike terror into others many of bystander gathered round reuben seized by hand patting on shoulder praising for courage with have faced maddened savage minute later mr hudson forced way through crowd miss furley have already be raised carried into shop go in with dear mr hudson said to daughter will bring to directly brave fellow exclaimed a made way to reuben grasped hand how can thank for saving child life seemed to that be lost that nothing must save when saw dash past throw unarmed upon madman be noble deed indeed be not badly hurt hope added a saw blood streaming down reuben face arm nothing to speak of sir reuben replied at least think not feel rather queer from loss of blood have better get bandaged up indeed reuben be turning very pale partly from relaxation of tension of struggle partly a said from loss of blood stand back mr hudson cried press upon lad be nearly fainting one of help get into shop where be nearest surgeon to be found be a much a reuben must do to walk across street aided by two supporter strong glass of cape smoke a native spirit be called water revived somewhat be minute before surgeon arrived for five person have be terribly wounded two killed by malay on course surgeon near be busily employed not very serious surgeon said a soon a examined reuben wound very different affair from have just come from have hold of hand reuben said so that must strike be only cut made in trying to get arm free that on arm will not trouble though have bled pretty freely one down face be fortunately of great consequence except that have cut down to bone on brow cheek if have be inch further back must have severed temporal artery have have narrow escape of a be will get off with scar may last for time a be honourable one perhaps wo so much care however will bring together a well a can stitch up may not show much wound be sewn up then bandaged a be that on arm other slighter wound be simply drawn together by slip of plaster when be done reuben said to mr hudson will do very well now sir be sure must wish to go to miss hudson will sit here bit longer then go on board ship will hing of kind mr hudson said have just sent for vehicle will come to hotel get into bed at once be not fit to stand now hope good night rest will do good reuben must have protested at moment vehicle arrived at door with captain wilson entered have just taken daughter miss furley to hotel hudson said be greatly shaken wonder so thought better to see back before coming in to shake hand with gallant young friend here have lost good deal of blood wilson be just taking off to get to bed in hotel so wo do thanking till morning mr hudson said seeing that reuben lip quivered be incapable of bearing further excitement do take one of arm will take other get into trap quarter of hour later reuben be in bed at hotel mr hudson brought up basin of clear soup having drunk turned over be in very few minute asleep captain most of other passenger be at same hotel there be great excitement when news arrived of terrible danger two girl have run mr hudson have from early life be accustomed to emergency instant girl arrived took up to room shared between insisted upon going at once to bed after partaking of cup of tea what be to do for young fellow wilson mr hudson asked a having seen patient comfortably in bed returned downstairs took seat in verandah by fellow passenger owe france life to there be nothing must do for question be what one doe not like to offer money to man for such service a mr wilson agreed especially in case young fellow appears to very much above condition daughter first pointed out to have since chatted with several time find very superior young fellow certainly education have be very different from of most men in condition of life must have taken for gentleman who have got into scrape run away have not be that seems to have be regularly apprenticed to trade still there be something little mysterious about asked casually what part of country came from hesitated moment then said 'from south of england ' of course did not ask further question a be clear did not care about naming precise locality must not have given so vague answer feel a deeply indebted to a do mr hudson nodded only evening before arriving at cape town captain wilson have spoken to on matter of affection for daughter have asked permission to speak to france have known other in colony have not be intimate until thrown together on board paramatta seeing that be only child that father be considered one of wealthiest squatter in colony captain wilson have feared that mr hudson must not approve of a suitor have therefore broached subject to before speaking to mr hudson however have raised objection have taken manly proper course in speaking to first said just what must have expected from own that with fortune girl will have day have always looked for making what call good match settling down in old country may tell that while have be in europe have have several opportunity of so doing if must have taken did not think fit to do so have always made up mind not to influence in way providing did fix choice upon one whose character disapproved certainly have reason for so doing in present case character stand high in colony personally a be well aware like exceedingly what france feeling in matter be have mean of knowing there be doubt like a to anything more be for to find out will have plenty of time between sydney anyhow have hearty approval of wooing think between know must not expect at first very cordial approval on part of mother have idea know that france must marry duke at least offer from prince of blood must not have surprised be great disappointment to that must have returned unmarried have already be talking to about returning to england in couple of year so will not take quite kindly to at first must mind that fond of france a be will soon come round if find that girl happiness be really concerned in matter take advice push till get near end of voyage if france say yes be sort of girl to stick to a be with may be quite sure will come right in long run might not have very pleasant time of during remainder of voyage know a thing have gone on so pleasantly must be pity to spoil thus be that mr hudson nodded when young officer of constabulary said that indebtedness to reuben be equal to own yes said if have be one of sailor must have set matter right by drawing big cheque must have cared how big with young fellow quite see way however will shift responsibility by leaving matter in france hand woman be much better hand at thing of sort require light touch than be wonder that miss furley be shaken feel shaken will never forget scene two girl standing there that wild malay rushing at leg seemed to give way under thought must have fallen down felt bad sir captain wilson said have be in tough fight with bush ranger native never have that sort of feeling before one ran one felt be use running a must be over before must get there when be over felt a weak a child let talk more about mr hudson said rising doubt whether will get wink of sleep now be sure sha' if go on talking more about let take turn have stiff glass of brandy water afterwards to settle nerve before turning in passenger by paramatta be up early in morning for ship be to sail at nine early a be reuben be before on mr hudson inquiring about a turned out be informed that have already gone on board ship two girl looked pale when came down to early breakfast declared however that have slept well must give time dad to get up rose france hudson said in reply to father remark a to appearance have doubt few day at sea will do of course be only right proper that young lady must be pale after going through adventure a have yesterday let talk about said with shudder must like not to be able to think about again for six month used to say dad be plucky because be afraid of wild cattle not very afraid of native bush ranger be sure can not lay claim to special courage in future for one in world must feel more frightened than did yesterday well dear be worse than anyone else for everyone else bolted at first alarm way that street be cleared be something marvellous yes dad be too frightened to run not that must have be use if have for be close to before knew what be matter if must have run think emma must no indeed miss furley said have idea of running even have there be plenty of time be sure must not have got out of way somehow seemed to lose power to move have just shut eye thought be over when there be shout rush saw malay roll over then made snatch at france rolled over too be terrible moment mr hudson said agree with france that be better for to try think nothing more about until have perfectly recovered health spirit hear dad that young man saved have gone on board ship asked directly be up because wanted to see expect dear that slipped away because did want to see sound rude doe can perfectly understand so can girl agreed did see morning dear came downstairs only minute two before did then found that be gone have thought over what be going to do dad for wilson have talked over france at present see way be too serious matter to make up mind in hurry mother be in favour of giving handsome present think that must do men who will do such deed a be not sort of men to be paid by money oh dad surely not that other possible way not money dear so thought have chatted over with wilson have agreed that best plan be to leave entirely in hand will think over dad girl said gravely be serious thing owe life least can do be not to hurt feeling by way in try to show gratitude reuben have slept well on waking soon after daylight jumped at once out of bed be glad to feel except for certain amount of weakness in leg stiffness in wound be all right again dressed quietly a soon a heard person moving about in hotel made way down to shore sat down there to wait for boat from ship be lying distance out must be sure be sending off early a there must be many thing to bring on board before sailed be not long before saw men descending gangway to boat alongside be soon rowing towards shore a approached reuben saw steward first mate sitting in stern seat when officer jumped ashore eye fell on reuben ah whitney said be glad to see about when captain came off last night told about gallant rescue of two lady be sorry to see bandaged up so much captain said have nasty cut did think be so bad be nothing to speak about sir reuben replied although must think so from seeing bandage over one side of face arm in sling be great depth hurt to speak of be clean cut with sharp edge hurt half a much a many knock have have with hammer well feel proud of lad be everyone who must face malay running amuck without weapon can tell think english sailor must do so sir if saw malay rushing down upon two lady there be time to think about danger one way other only thing to be done be to rush at so rushed a anyone else must have done ah be very well to say so whitney have doubt about everyone else rushing however must stand talking about now a have hand full of work sooner get on board ship better row whitney back to ship lad come back again in hour time none of thing will be down here before reuben stepped into boat at once pushed off men rowed easily for be anxious to hear particular of report have circulated through ship bill hardy be rowing stroke oar did questioning may try to make little of said tell reuben be right down good thing thing man must have right to be proud of what do say mate there be general chorus of ay ay took in hand when came on board young un bill went on look upon a chick tell feel proud on felt sure must turn out good un day did look to see so quick in oar boat ran up alongside gangway reuben be soon upon deck be there met by captain who have just come up a boat rowed alongside shook reuben hand heartily be fine young fellow whitney mother if have one ought to be proud of must be if be son of mine be lucky day for when shipped on board paramatta for must have be heavy day for if two young lady have be killed by madman yesterday look pale lad a much a one can see of will have to lie by for bit hear lost great deal of blood steward bring cup of cocoa with mine large one put plenty of milk in captain insisted on reuben coming to cabin to drink cocoa have best knock off allowance of spirit till wound have healed up lad will tell second mate to serve out port wine instead reuben now went forward feeling very much better for cocoa again have to receive hearty congratulation of men then rather to escape from than because felt needed turned into bunk be soon sound asleep three hour later be awakened by tramp of men overhead knew that be shortening anchor chain preparing to be off going out on to deck saw that course have be dropped topsail be lying loose in gasket crew be singing merrily a worked capstan three of boat already hung from davit two large boat be bringing off passenger be already within hundred yard of ship while remaining ship boat with steward crowded with fresh store be short way behind a soon a passenger be up shore boat have left came alongside hook on fall at once first mate ordered run up a be can get thing out afterwards anchor be by time under foot up with lad sailor again started at full speed on capstan jib be run up course topsail shaken out braced paramatta began to steal through water again for second portion of voyage mr hudson friend very soon made way forward ship be scarcely under way when reuben who be gazing over bulwark at shore felt hand laid on shoulder how be today reuben better hope be too bad of to run off in way morning be right now thank sir reuben answered felt just little shaky at first captain gave cup of cocoa when came on board feel now a if be fit for duty again oh nonsense mr hudson exclaimed must think of work for day yet must come aft with daughter miss furley be most anxious to see wife too be longing to add thanks to mine be very good sir really must rather not if will excuse be horrid being thanked made fuss about just because on spur of moment one did one duty be very well reuben see must be fair to daughter if anyone did great service must want to thank must not yes suppose so sir reuben answered reluctantly really hate can understand feeling lad must make up mind to do when anyone put others under vast obligation to must submit to be thanked however much may shrink from come along will not be very dreadful reuben saw that there be getting out of followed mr hudson along deck feeling however more ashamed uncomfortable even than did when standing in dock a criminal captain wilson walked beside hitherto have not spoken now laid hand quietly upon reuben shoulder lad said be not man to talk much believe that henceforth be friend for life reuben looked up with little smile showed that understood have often indeed watched young officer miss hudson together have guessed that be more than mere acquaintance passenger be with exception of three lady gathered on poop france have proposed to mother that must see reuben in cabin alone a felt that must be severe ordeal to lad to be publicly thanked captain wilson ascended to poop joined others there while mr hudson went alone into cabin three lady be awaiting there france came forward first tear be standing in eye have saved life said softly at risk of own thank with heart not only for own sake for of father mother who must have be childless today have not be for need thanks miss hudson reuben said quietly shyness have left a entered cabin will all life be source of pleasure gratification to have be able to have be of service to so bright kind lady be not le grateful miss furley said advancing also will never forget dreadful moment feeling darted through mind a rushed past threw upon felt be saved almost by miracle must accept thanks also mr hudson said thanks of mother whose child have saved from so dreadful death believe that there be nothing that husband must not do to show how deeply sincerely be grateful to mr hudson indeed felt rather aggrieved that must not at once take active step towards rewarding young man for saving daughter life have be unable to understand scruple of husband daughter on subject be only indeed at urgent entreaty that have given way on point call monstrous france said almost angrily of course young man will expect something more substantial than word be only natural that must reward for preserving life must be crime if did do so of course did do for money at time be absurd to suppose that young carpenter like working way out on board ship will object to receive handsome present for service a feeling have right to be considered a well a nice thing will be for people to say that ralph hudson wife be so stingy ungrateful that did nothing for lad who have saved daughter life there be fear of saying that mother everyone in colony know that there be more open handed people in new south wale than father besides say that be to hing for on contrary agree with that must be wrong indeed if did not only say please let there be word said about reward now let thank a one must thank gentleman who have done great service of course will do a father wish france call nonsense if be gentleman must of course be different be young carpenter though wo see seems to to make difference from what have seen of france persisted be sure that have feeling of gentleman even if be not one by birth about be not certain anyhow be much obliged to for letting have own way always do have own way france mother laughed get round father first then come to what can do against two of reuben briefly answered miss furley mr hudson mr hudson feeling that lad must rather get over scene a soon a possible slipped arm though said now reuben must just come up for minute on poop other passenger be waiting to shake by hand must not forgive if be to let run off a know be wanting to do without word accordingly reuben be taken up to poop where passenger shook hand with congratulated upon courage now suppose can go sir said with smile to mr hudson when be over yes can go now mr hudson laughed most young fellow at age must be glad of opportunity for figuring a hero talk a if be one of most painful business imaginable anyhow be glad be over mr hudson can assure now think will turn in again considering what night have feel wonderfully sleepy be not until sun be setting that reuben appeared again on deck shortly after did so captain wilson strolled up to place where be standing wish reuben said after few remark on other subject that must tell little more about understand that ask from mere inquisitiveness after have happened see seem to have got into close relationship with other if knew more about must easier see in what way must most really be useful to out there be what appear to be be indeed reuben replied with smile history be very simple one father be miller with good business up to age of ten did not appear that must ever be working a craftsman for living unhappily at time father slipped one night into mill pond be drowned when affair came to be wound up be found that have speculated disastrously in wheat that after paying claim there be nothing left mother took little village shop went to village school at first think did not work very hard fortunately there be change in master new one turned out one of best friend boy ever have pushed on greatly when be apprenticed to mill wright urged to continue education by working of evening stuck to hard with help learned therefore good deal more than be usual in station of life mother be always particular about speaking what with book suppose talk better than generally do be mother alive yes sir how came to think of emigrating at age when indeed can not have served out full time sir reuben said gravely can not tell day perhaps if care to know may bring to do so may say that be serious matter be really in way to blame people may think conscience be absolutely clear yet must rather that story left england to escape must not be known to anyone seek to know further reuben think know enough of to be perfectly sure that must hing be wrong be perfectly willing to take word in matter however be glad that have told a much a have early rearing mother care education have have perfectly account for what seemed strange about before have objection hope to repeating story to mr hudson who be a much interested in a be now thing know that be painful to that one to whom be so indebted must be forward here in forecastle instead of being in cabin be afraid of hurting feeling by speaking to about know that must be great relief pleasure to mr hudson if must allow to make arrangement with captain for remainder of voyage must be passenger be much obliged to reuben said quietly must not think of accepting such offer be working way out independently sir owe one anything be really enjoying passage so far there have be hardship worth speaking of even putting aside fact must not like to accept obligation must to most people look like payment for service be fortunate enough to be able to render to mr hudson must feel out of element be very comfortable get on very well with men while in cabin must feel strange out of place think must seem out of place anywhere reuben one from manner conversation must judge to be otherwise than gentleman by birth while there be several of passenger aft whose talk method of expression be by mean up to level of yours must feel uncomfortable reuben said even if did make other people uncomfortable so think that with gratitude for offer must very much rather remain a be accustomed a have be to hard work during apprenticeship life here appears to be exceedingly easy then will say no more about captain wilson said must have be pleasure to hudson to have aft be sure must be well received by passenger however a think must not be comfortable will let matter drop however a to work in colony must have say in hope that when thoroughly understand wish will be able to help forward there for will be extremely obliged sir must be great thing indeed for anyone on landing to have gentleman ready to assist push forward be so at home be of course still more case in strange country be very anxious to get on be ready to work hardest to deserve kindness may be shown well will have plenty of time to think over before arrive fancy captain went on looking upwards at sky that wonderful run of good luck with regard to weather be likely to end shortly that be in for gale do think so sir do indeed if do get gale be likely to be serious one cape know be much feared for terrible storm by portuguese have kept up reputation ever since think be going to give taste of quality chapter gale wilson tell think be going to have gale bill ay ay reuben anyone with eye must see that way be likely to come most likely from north northwest at least be quarter be likely to settle into there ai saying way may take thought thing have be going on too smooth to last now be going to see what storm be lad thought be blowing when went down channel be likely to be much heavier than bill heavier sailor repeated scornfully why there be a much difference between capful of wind in channel gale off cape a there be between newborn baby do last long generally last why go on for week there ai no end to have wondered sometimes to myself where wind come from where go to onlass work round round doe work round round bill ay when be near centre of why lad in three hour have gone round compass three time with wind dead aft time be only when be near centre when ai blow straight have known vessel run for day ay for week with wind blowing time in same quarter have be blown down right to edge of ice south have be among iceberg two three time guess that many ship have laid bone down in ice field there news ever come back home a to what be come to what make worse be a have convict on board what difference doe that make bill make difference a long a go straight fair have heard in course of rising be only when guard be very careless men be so bad treated that get desperate be ready to die on off chance of getting free so far ai have trouble with ship be kept liberal poor wretch ai cheated out of ration a government allows officer in charge seems good sort there be knocking of about needle so there ai fear of trouble a long a thing go square when thing go wrong vessel get cast away anything of kind then there be well nigh sure to be trouble convict seize opportunity ai scarce in human nature for not to take then there ai saying what will happen why what croaker be bill did expect that from ai croaker reuben know what know have be through job like be telling of once want to do again will tell about day ai saying a expect such thing will happen on board paramatta god forbid be tight ship be got a good officer crew a ever sailed with have a good chance a ever ship have when see that 'ere sort of sky in latitude feel a be in for tough job conversation be broken off abruptly by call of first mate hand aloft to shorten bell be ringing up for beginning of performance reuben here go aloft next minute whole of crew be climbing shroud for watch off duty be on deck order be expected for sign of weather must by time be read by sailor on board above sky be still bright blue around whole circle of horizon mist seemed to hang like curtain smartly lad smartly captain shouted hurry over work do with will hope have not left too long mr james have held on longer than ought for mile get away from land be advantage have be running nearly due south ever since noticed first falling of glass when got up in morning think will have time sir mate said be going to have mistake presently seem to be coming up fast glass be going down rapidly captain said be down inch already be still falling mr mason went on to officer in command of detachment of marine will kindly place men under order of

never see again reuben looked up immediately overhead be small circle of blue sky round round whose edge edging of cloud seemed to be circling with extreme velocity light seemed to pierce straight down onto vessel stood pale white while around pitchy blackness seemed to prevail be in eye of storm lad here come now hold on for life in moment seemed to reuben that end of thing be come be pinned against bulwark a if by mighty invisible hand vessel heeled over over until deck seemed to rise in wall above then water poured over though still held on thought vessel have capsized then felt rising beneath foot head emerged from water captain first mate two seaman be at wheel reuben saw captain wave hand word be lost in fury of wind second mate bill hardy two three other sailor knew what be required hauled upon lee brace of fore top sail yard paramatta be still lying nearly over on beam end gradually head began to pay off slowly righted minute later be tearing directly before gale scarcely have done so when fore top sail blew out of bolt rope with report be heard even above howl of tempest be done work bill shouted in reuben ear thought be gone just little more must have turned turtle captain have used almost precisely same word to first officer adding will do now will have to try to get little more head sail on when sea get up call of hand aft get try sail down yaw so now fore top sail gone there be steering be soon done under bare pole storm jib now only sail upon paramatta tore through water there be little motion for sea have not begun to get up seeming to be

long one hurt below hope two three of have got bruised little captain think have of got severe fright thought be over thought so too captain said luckily have got three hundred ton of iron on board be stowed at bottom of cargo so helped up again be touch go with for minute now gentleman if will take advice will just look round then go below turn in now can do so easily hour there will be no keeping footing captain be right in le than time named terrific sea have got up paramatta have already made more than one circuit of compass there be regularity in sea seemed to rise suddenly in heap now striking ship on one side now on pouring sheet of water over bulwark motion of vessel be so tremendous that even bill hardy older seaman must only move along with greatest difficulty to carry out order of captain while reuben clung to shroud now buried in water now almost hanging in air with sea racing along under foot a yet more sail have be put upon for there be following sea although running almost before gale slight helm be kept upon so a to edge out from centre of storm second circle of compass took more than twice a long a first to complete although vessel be proceeding with equal speed through water hour after hour sea got up wild cross broken sea motion of vessel be so terrific a to be almost bewildering to oldest hand there be none of regular rise fall of ordinary sea vessel be thrown with violent jerk now on one side now on other now plunging bow so deeply down that seemed about to dive head foremost beneath wave now thrown bodily upwards a if tossed up by giant hand beneath watch off duty be sent below for there be nothing must be done on deck water swept over in such mass a to threaten at time to carry everything before one man have have leg broken several have be seriously bruised hurt be terrible bill reuben said a went below ay lad have be at sea man boy over forty year be worst sea ever saw expect to see mast go out of before long nothing must stand such straining a have best turn in at once unless be mistaken will be hand to pump before long if have be one of tightest craft afloat must have be making water at seam by time reuben felt instant lay down sleep be out of question for needed strength to prevent from being thrown out of bunk noise too be terrific rush swell of water overhead blow made ship shiver from stem to stern creaking of mast howling of wind night have set in now be pitch dark in forecastle for swinging lantern have be dashed so violently against beam that light be extinguished hour after reuben turned in crash be heard moment later door be opened there be shout mizzen have gone hand to cut away wreck watch turned out began to make way aft be soon engaged with knife hatchet in cutting away wreck of mizzen towing behind threatened with heavy following sea to plunge into vessel stern cheer broke from men a last rope be cut wreck floated mast have gone close to deck smashing bulwark a fell over side motion of ship be easier for loss mr james captain shouted must get preventer stay at once upon fore mast main mast may go if like at present will be better without foremast must keep if can ay ay sir will set about at once picking out few of best hand first mate proceeded about work go sound well reuben captain said reuben went off at once returned in two three minute there be four foot of water in sir four foot be sure captain exclaimed quite sure sir captain handed over command of deck to second officer went below with reuben first wiping rod carefully sounded well be right said be three inch over four foot fear that bumping of mizzen before got rid of must have started butt must hardly have made so much water from straining captain made way aft saloon be empty passenger one by one have retired to cabin knocked at door of mr mason chief warder ship be making water fast said must rig main deck pump ca spare of crew hand be full will set convict to work in few minute clank of pump be heard very irregularly be worked for be next to impossible for men to stand to with vessel throwing about so wildly captain have remained on deck placed hand on shroud of main mast one moment hung loosely then a vessel rolled over tightened with sudden jerk till be a stiff a iron rod shook head reuben make way up to chief officer tell be going to get rid of main top mast tell to see that everything be cut free from fore mast reuben made way aloft with difficulty needed strength to prevent wind from tearing from grasp of shroud at length reached fore top where mate be at work delivered captain message ask captain to wait five minute till get back stay secured will send man down a soon a be ready take axe captain said when reuben regained deck stand by stay when see ready to cut other cut at same moment in few minute bill came down with message to captain that be ready latter raised arm to reuben waited till vessel rolled over then lifted axe two blow fell together on stay moment later vessel began to rise again a jerk came there be crash above main top mast fell over side clear of deck having snapped off at cap like pipe stem thank god for that captain said a cut away connection on other side spar drifted astern that be off mind loss of main top mast mizzen greatly relieved strain on ship worked much easier in hour first officer returned on deck with party reported that have done must to secure fore mast sea be becoming more regular captain said now that be getting further away from centre of storm will soon have wave racing behind like mountain will have to shake out fore sail to keep ahead of now let see how be getting on below well be again sounded be found that water have gained two three inch when motion get little more regular reuben must take two three hand work way aft in hold try find out where water be coming in will go at once sir if like captain replied must not be thought of everything will be adrift must be crushed to death to certainty must wait till be out of tumble if water gain faster than doe now two three hour will make material difference by time hope will have got regular sea finding that there be nothing for to do reuben again turned in motion be still tremendous must feel sensible change from what be before motion of ship be le sudden violent although rolled tremendously rose time with easier motion hour later watch turned out others took place wind be blowing a heavily a when hurricane began aspect of sea have changed be no longer mass of leaping tumbling water be running in long wave following other rising high above vessel stern a overtook having lashed to side remained for hour watching sea first mate then came up to captain think might manage to get aft now will send bill dick whistler with to help move box bale reuben went back in forecastle got tool piece of old sailcloth large bundle of oakum then made way with two sailor down into after hold way in upper tier of cargo lay heaped against side showed that must a captain said have be impossible to enter while motion be at worst rolling however have greatly diminished vessel rising falling with regular motion a wave passed under men carried lantern with difficulty made way to stern ay be somewhere about here bill said can hear rushing of water somewhere below now first thing be to move bale worked for time then bill returned on deck to fetch two more hand brought hand spike bar a bale be wedged so tightly together that be difficult in extreme to move took two hour hard work before reached leak a captain have supposed head of one of plank have be started at stern post by blow from wreck of mizzen water be rushing in with great force few hour of must have settled bill said pump in ship must not keep down such leak a reuben at once set to work cutting deep groove in stern post butted stout piece of wood into wedged other end firmly against first rib then set to work to jam down sail cloth oakum between barrier plank have started driving down with marlinespike mallet be long job be securely done at last reuben have satisfaction of seeing that mere driblet of water be making way down behind stuffing into ship be first rate job lad bill said approvingly hour work once week will keep dry if there be water find way in anywhere else reuben went aft to well pump be now working steadily gang of convict relieving other by turn on sounding well found that water have fallen nine inch since have last ascertained depth going on deck found that misty light filled air that morning be breaking captain have two three time come down to hold to watch progress of work reuben reported to completion fall in water yes be be falling last hour captain said will do now be making water still of seam must have opened have be looking over ca find out where be can hing until gale have blown out can get below shift cargo reuben found that fore sail have be set while be below vessel be running twelve knot hour before wind at one moment be in deep valley then stern mounted high on following wave seemed a if must slide down head foremost higher higher wave rose sending forward with accelerated motion then passed along be on level keel on top seemed to stand almost still a wave passed from under in spite of extra lashing have be given hen coop spar everything loose upon deck have be swept away bulwark have in several place be stove in galley have be carried away cook have just made shift to boil cauldron of coffee below mug of be served out to hand a reuben broke biscuit into portion sipped thought have never enjoyed meal so much have now be for eighteen hour wet through to skin coffee sent warm glow through captain ordered hand save few absolutely required on deck to turn in reuben be soon in glow of warmth beneath blanket lulled by now easy motion of ship be fast asleep in few minute after four hour sleep be again on deck gale be blowing a strongly a ever three men be at helm vessel be still tearing along at great speed several of male passenger be on poop contrast between appearance of paramatta at same hour on previous day that presented now struck reuben very strongly sadly indeed looked with mizzen mast gone main mast shortened to cap upper spar rigging of fore mast gone be however making good weather of for hold be now so dry that pump be worked only on alternate hour relief afforded by loss of top hamper be very great for week paramatta ran before gale at end of fourth day force somewhat abated still blew much too hard for anything to be done towards getting up fresh spar while lost mizzen rendered impossible for to bring up into wind be bitterly cold bill reuben said be getting colder day morning be really bitter wonder lad seeing that have be racing south for pretty nigh week have be making little easting be be getting into region of ice may see berg time now must like to see iceberg reuben said fewer see of better bill replied for be about a nasty customer a want to meet expected must have seen before gale must have blown south bit work up with northwesterly current expect wind will have carried back against want to see iceberg if be very big one might get under lee repair damage bit bill might not lad lee of iceberg ai place one must choose if one must help there be becalmed under berg drifting down upon going perhaps four knot hour no farther keep away from iceberg better if have got to be near one keep to windward of at least be beperyence have be having trouble with convict hears worked well enough at first a long a knew that there be lot of water in hold since then have be grumbling last night hear there be rumpus six of be put in iron be first of sooner gale over shape course in smooth water for sydney head better will be pleased hour later bill pointed to sky ahead do yer see nothing odd about 'ere sky reuben replied except that be very light coloured ay be lad be what call ice blink see if ai in middle of berg before night come on have not be whaling for nothing few minute later first mate be heard to be shouting order just a thought bill said be going to try to rig jury mizzen so a to help claw off ice if need be spare top mast be got up from below guy be fixed to one end with help of marine party of convict spar be raised alongside stump of mizzen mast be there lashed securely guy being fastened a stay to bulwark block have be tied to top before be raised rope rove into try sail be brought on deck laid ready for hoisting first mate ascended to fore top at once hailed deck that ice be visible ahead captain joined for minute two officer carefully examined horizon sooner did captain regain deck than ordered try sail to be hoisted on jury mast haul to be given upon brace of fore sail while ship course be laid little north of east be lucky wind have gone down a much a have remarked to mr sea be still heavy if jury mizzen stand will be able to claw off ice be there much of captain must see good many berg from look of sky must say there be ice field lying beyond however think will do if wind doe not freshen again if doe must do best to make group of island lying down to southeast there refit be rendezvous for whaler in summer why not do so now captain must if be not for convict unless a last resource must not run risk of touching at island with on board a long a be at sea be comparatively harmless unless there be gross carelessness on part of guard there be little fear of outbreak once let get on land matter be changed altogether be nearly three to one a against warder marine crew must not run risk on account if can be possibly avoided mr hudson unless be matter of life death will put in nowhere till be in sydney harbour chapter two offer at paramatta be in midst of iceberg reuben soon understood antipathy bill have expressed for a spectacle be doubt grand a neighbour to half crippled ship with gale blowing beauty be very secondary consideration to on board additional stay be fixed to jury mast a might be necessary at moment to attempt to bring up into wind word be passed that watch must remain on deck fortunately night be light one for moon be up sky almost cloudless mate stood with two of best hand at wheel while second mate took place in fore top with lantern to signal position of ice ahead fortunately there be few small floating block about paramatta threaded way through larger berg without once approaching near enough to render danger imminent be long anxious night when morning broke be seen that sea be now open ahead by afternoon have left last berg behind two day later wind went completely down crew at once set to work to repair damage reuben with two men under filled up breach in bulwark respectable jury mast be rigged by stump of main mast spar have done such good service among berg be replaced by longer heavier one hand worked vigorously sailor be assisted in heavier work by party of convict after two day toil be completed sail be hoisted again under greatly reduced spread of canvas to have carried before gale burst paramatta proceeded on way weather continued favourable without further adventure paramatta arrived off sydney head having made voyage in hundred three day be under circumstance quick one last evening captain wilson asked reuben to go with to poop a mr hudson wanted to have chat with now reuben mr hudson said sit down here must have

wilson said not to drive off cattle sheep sometimes attack solitary station murder soul there seldom stand up in fair fight when come down upon fight hard sometimes when be acting with bush ranger bush ranger be mostly escaped convict be not almost always captain wilson replied except of course have among few men such a runaway sailor ne'er do well who get sick of shepherding take to bush great proportion be convict be not to be wondered at when look at life many of men have led at home monotony hardship of life in many of up country station allotted to men a ignorant sometimes almost a brutal a of too escape from road gang be generally worst for a often a not may have killed warder in making escape know that will go hard with if be caught may be said that there be two sort of bush

food other kind be desperado men who be scourge in england be scourge here who attack lonely station be not content with robbing murder who fall into hand be in fact wild beast to whom mercy be to be extended who knowing will fight to last be not easy to hunt down instinct having made wary being generally in league with black who be a cunning a fox can run pretty nearly a fast a horse can gallop be kept very well informed a to movement country being so immense must never run down be not for native tracker fellow be to full a sharp a red indian of north america seem in fact to have instinct of dog can follow track when keenest white eye can not detect smallest trace of footprint be something marvellous what of will do have many of tracker in employment there be one two attached to up country station be in fact bloodhound although of men pick up little of craft must hing without next morning reuben met captain wilson down in sydney be taken by to chief of constabulary who at once made out appointment on return mr hudson again started with for town insisted upon ordering equipment a reuben saw that must be hurt by shadow of denial accepted mr hudson kind offer although have

uniform suit of plain clothes together with saddlery holster sword brace of excellent double barrelled pistol did not need to buy horse having in stable one in way suitable being at once quiet fast be indeed one of most valuable animal in colony will have to keep eye open reuben said a gave horse will be stolen from bush ranger fellow be always well mounted anyone at up country station who have animal at out of ordinary way have to keep stable door locked sleep with one eye open even then chance be strongly in favour of losing horse before long fellow know that life often depend upon speed of horse naturally spare pain to get hold of good one ah have good idea jim shouted to one of black boy come here lad who be about eighteen year of age trotted up jim gentleman be going to be police

a fresh a paint at night will sleep in stable will be ready at time place to make fire cook damper bit of meat if be lucky enough to have one by people about place must do anything believe for france fact that have saved life will bind boy to at first afterwards will get to care for for fortnight later reuben in uniform a officer of constabulary rode out of sydney baggage have be sent on three day before by waggon returning up country jim trotted with easy stride behind reuben at first be inclined to ride slowly in order to give attendant time to keep up with soon found that pace went lad kept same distance behind without apparent exertion be therefore able to choose own pace without reference to jim comfort four year passed reuben whitney gave satisfaction to superior be considered zealous effective young officer so far have not be placed in position of great responsibility for although for last two year have be in charge of district be not far from sydney duty consisted principally in hunting for convict who have made escape in looking after refractory ticket of leave men in ordinary constabulary work have learned in time to become first rate rider good shot with pistol accomplishment must be of vital service when be ordered to up country station for pistol have a yet however have actual use a bush ranger native penetrated so far into settlement at end of four year service received letter from captain wilson who have just succeeded to chief command of constabulary ordering to hand over charge of district to young officer who be bearer of letter to report at headquarters reuben be now nearly three twenty have grown into very powerful young man life spent for most part on horseback have hardened muscle filled out frame stood about five foot nine looked shorter owing to great width of shoulder be still quiet in manner have same bright pleasant expression have characterized a boy visit to sydney where be introduced by captain wilson mr hudson into best society have given ease self possession native jim be still with have become greatly attached to master fidelity devotion have be of greatest service to go where must black be always at heel on presenting at sydney captain wilson said after first greeting know have be little disappointed reuben because hitherto have be at station where have have little opportunity of distinguishing however thought better to keep at quiet work until be thoroughly master of duty have moreover got full strength know whether have quite arrived at yet think will do anyhow smiled a looked at reuben shoulder think be a strong a most of reuben said smiling too four year mill wright work four year on horseback in bracing air ought to make one strong if there be anything in one to begin with think will do in respect think so reuben think there be many men in force who must hold own with in grapple now to business have heard of affair of inspector thomas in goora district be bad business two of men be out after native who have driven off cattle be set upon by party of bush ranger men killed so heard sir reuben said quietly well have decided in sending up in place be bad district worst have at present need man of great resolution intelligence be sure that have plenty of can not make better choice than in sending there age be only thing against not with know others may think have done wrong in selecting so young officer see know man know too that several of inspector be getting too old for sort of work mean too old perhaps in point of year be married men with family for desperate work prefer men without encumbrance post must be held by inspector can not promote at present must be putting over head of too many will have good chance of earning early promotion know be what like thank very much captain wilson will do best to show worthy of confidence will have work cut out for reuben district have along be most troublesome one number of settler at present be small there be good deal of higher bush than usual about make very difficult to run fellow down native be specially troublesome besides at present there be two three of worst gang of bush ranger in colony somewhere in country will have to be cautious a well a bold reuben be dangerous service be sending on still more danger more credit to must not have given station must have liked better hope ere long may be able to give good account of bush ranger now reuben if will call again in hour will be free then will drive home need not start for day two will of course stay with till do chapter up country district mr wilson received reuben a usual with greatest cordiality exclaimed loudly when heard that be going to goora district mean george ca mean that be going to send reuben to dreadful place why be always hearing of murder robbery there know last inspector be killed one before recalled because said have lost nerve now be sending reuben there look upon a greatest honour mr wilson being chosen for such station see there will be capital chance of distinguishing getting promoted capital chance of being killed mr wilson said in vexed tone do call too bad george dear want man of pluck energy besides know have be getting into hot water over district press have be saying very severe thing about incompetence to protect outlying settlement be obliged to choose man who will give satisfaction will agree with that reuben will do of course will mr wilson agreed must be alive now if have have plenty of pluck energy for very reason ought not to send to such dangerous post wish to give opportunity for distinguishing want to get on want to push on see ca promote over head of eight ten men senior to unless doe something little out of way well like george tell frankly always thought be wrong to go into constabulary at instead of accepting papa offer ca think why men be so fond of fighting when must choose quiet comfortable life be not always so quiet comfortable france a good many have found in district be going to after be le dangerous fighting bush ranger native when be prepared for than to be woke up of night with band of thundering at door with assistance within twenty mile a france wilson remembered how in childish day father place have be for three day beset with black have answer ready for argument well do hope reuben said if do go to horrid place will take care of not be rash be going to take care of others france know if have taken care of have be rash must not have come so well out of malay business be sure look a if must take care of doe yes be big enough strong enough mr wilson agreed be good against spear boomerang to say nothing of rifle pistol why france be not generally croaker husband said lightly for once seem to be determined to do best to frighten reuben before start mr wilson laughed want to frighten george only want to make careful will be a careful a can mr wilson that boy jim be treasure will warrant if there be black fellow about will sniff out somehow that fellow have nose like hound have always be most useful to will be invaluable at goora two day afterwards reuben left for new command took eight day to reach headquarters be at goora

surprised when reuben rode up to station for officer previously in command have be much older men reuben own quarter be in cottage close to main building asked sergeant to come in evening now sergeant said after little preliminary talk have be sent up by captain wilson with instruction to root out band of bush ranger sergeant smiled grimly have be doing best for last three year sir have not made much of hand at reuben agreed suppose of course be going to succeed at once in first place tell frankly what sort of men have got men be good enough sir have certainly got disheartened lately one way have lost something like ten men in last two year of course that last affair with poor mr thomas be bad one understand reuben said quietly of be not quite so eager to meet bush ranger a used to be well be perhaps about sir must say men have be tremendously hardly worked pretty nigh night day in saddle often called out by false news to one end of district then to find when return that scoundrel have be down playing game at station at other end be enough to dishearten man so be sergeant be speaking to captain wilson about saying that if be to succeed ought to have fresh hand who will take up work with new spirit be seven below force at present have promised to send up fifteen new hand so there will be eight to be relieved will leave to to pick out men to go mind put to that be to be relieved simply because captain wilson think have have share of hard work must therefore be sent to quiet station for time just pick out men whom think must be most pleased to go very well sir be glad to hear news for to tell truth do think want little fresh blood amongst three day later new detachment arrived reuben saw at once captain wilson have chosen picked set of young men about half of be freshly enlisted in force others have be employed at up country station be well acquainted with nature of work before same afternoon eight men picked out by sergeant o'connor a being least useful on station started for sydney most of well pleased at being relieved from arduous duty reuben found that there be in office great many letter from settler asking for protection be impossible to comply with after consultation with o'connor sent five party of three men to a many exposed station keeping ten in hand to move a required taking jim two of constable who have be longest on station spent two month in traversing district from end to end making thoroughly acquainted with geographical feature for felt that until have mastered must only be working in dark for time outrage have ceased bush ranger having shifted quarter native withdrawn after murder of late inspector be great relief to reuben a permitted to gain insight into country before setting to work in earnest upon tour follower be everywhere most hospitably received at station at halted everywhere heard same tale of sheep killed cattle horse driven off insolent demeanour of native be thinking of giving up moving back into more populated district one of settler said to reuben now have come will hold on for bit longer see how turn out look to right sort of fellow for post difficulty be with large scattered district a yours to be everywhere at once what have often thought of be that must be good thing if whole district be to turn out go right into heart of black country give lesson from what hear reuben said will be next to impossible for to find country be so vast covered with bush that there must be searching have fixed village want of water must render impossible for to go very far worst point must be that seem to be well informed a to what be going on suppose get warning from native herdsman servant if be together to enter country must leave station unprotected must find in ash on return yes be true settler said suppose must be done be anxious work sleeping here night after night with one rifle by one bedside never certain at what hour one may be woke by yelling of black be not a bad a bush ranger if black can drive off cattle be contented have got nothing else be much use to bush ranger want cattle beyond head two for present use want everything else have got whether like not be quite immaterial to thank god have got money in place three men can make pretty good fight of pity men with wife daughter well hope will soon put stop to reuben said cheerfully will give lesson if catch may be quite sure hope so settler said folk have be mighty unlucky lately never seem to have be at right place at right time not that be surprised at in district somehow never come up with fellow afterwards seem to have have bad luck reuben agreed hope will do better now three day after return from last visit of inspection of district settler rode at full speed up to station captain said for although reuben have right to title be always so called by settler black have be down at place have killed two shepherd driven off sheep sergeant o'connor turn out men at once reuben shouted see that ammunition be right let man take water skin four day provision in haversack when be asked turning to settler again time yesterday afternoon at least judge so one of men be to have come in for supply when night came have come in began to be afraid something be wrong for knew that be getting short so morning at daybreak rode out with hand have about house must see nothing of sheep so rode straight to men hut there lying twenty yard away be body of one of men riddled with spear hole have evidently be running to hut for shelter when be overtaken did not stop to look for other for doubt have be killed too well will do what can for reuben said will be ready in five minute ran into house buckled on sword put cold meat small bag of flour into haversack together with damper jim have just cooked then went out again jim have already brought horse round to door before mounting took pistol out of holster examined carefully by time sergeant ten men be in saddle placing at head with settler whose name be blount rode off at full speed followed by men two native tracker jim reuben soon reined horse in will not do to push too hard at first there be saying how far will have to go do mean to follow into own country mr blount asked do reuben said will follow till catch if have to go across australia be sort mr blount said expect will find dozen other fellow at station by time get there sent hand off on horseback to station near to tell have taken place have ridden off to asking to come round how far be reuben asked about forty mile horse will never be able to do reuben said got fresh horse at friend four mile from station so be right will have more than day start of reuben remarked presently yes thirty six hour for will have to stop at place tonight ca travel very fast with sheep know reuben agreed if have have cattle must have be useless following with sheep may come up to especially if think will be followed far hope will know have forty mile to ride to station besides have not be that be expecting shepherd in for supply might not have found out for two three day so expect will think that be pretty safe from pursuit have never be followed far into bush be nasty work see be got to be done reuben said be impossible to keep guard everywhere only way to put stop to outrage be to teach black punishment will follow wherever go be late in afternoon before arrived at mr blount station found fourteen fifteen of neighbouring settler gathered there came out a sound of trampling of horse be heard several of be known to reuben from having stopped at station glad to see captain be afraid be too late said dick caister young settler whose station lay about twelve mile away that remains to be proved reuben replied a dismounted oh have got twenty four hour start be too late to do anything tonight must be thirty mile away in bush already if be hundred must follow reuben said there be exclamation of surprise something like cheer on part of of younger men difficulty be very great one of elder settler said there be food water to be found in bush know be not easy business reuben said quietly a to food can carry with a to water there must be water in place for native can no more go without drinking than can there must be stream water hole here there however difficult be mean to attempt be only way of bringing black to book there can never be safety among outlying settlement unless fellow be taught lesson now gentleman before go further want to say know that be ready to help that be thirsting to wipe out old score with black at same time must point out to that be likely enough that bush ranger who certainly work with black will follow up stroke therefore will not do to leave station defenceless want large force with if once overtake black have fear whatever of being able to give good account of therefore must urge upon of who be married men that be of first importance that must stay at home in case bush ranger take opportunity of being away to pay visit be first thing to be thought of if of others like to go with will be very glad of assistance may be away for week more for ought know be certainly best plan captain dick caister said a say let married men stop at home guard station think rest of will go with there be chorus of approval eight of present be married men though reluctant to give up thought of punishing black be yet glad that be not called upon to leave wife family with many good wish for success of expedition at once mounted rode off to respective station of be more than twenty mile away now for way mean reuben said what spare horse have mr blount have only two besides one be riding must like to take at least six must carry good store of provision think need trouble about mr blount said must take supply of flour with of course tea sugar few bottle of rum will not be amiss can furnish a to meat think need trouble going a fast a black will travel there be sure to be lot of sheep fall by way black will eat a many a can even black can not stuff beyond certain extent there will be plenty for yes did not think of reuben replied in case two spare horse will be enough must be good thing to have few with though one of young men said place be only six mile off will ride over bring back three with be good one must be sorry to find be gone when get back can lead one black boy can ride lead third be likely enough of horse may give out get speared if black make fight of dozen spare horse must come in very handy reuben thought plan be good one whereupon two of others also volunteered to ride over fetch one three other two horse will make ten altogether with blount two will travel faster because can ride spare horse by turn three settler rode off at once returned late at night with spare horse have not be idle at mr blount bullock have be killed cut up considerable portion cooked so that of twenty men going on expedition must start with ten pound of cooked meat in order to save time must be spent in halting to cook carcass of sheep might come upon question of weight be immaterial a meat must be packed on spare horse a soon a day broke party be in saddle mr blount led first to hut near have found shepherd killed native tracker now took up search body of other shepherd be found mile away be in sitting position by tree skull be completely smashed in by blow of waddy be evident that native have crept up behind killed before be conscious that danger be at hand tracker be not long in finding place where sheep have be collected together driven off broad track of trampled grass showed clearly enough direction have be taken how many of black fellow do think there be reuben asked one of tracker great many black fellow captain replied what do call great many reuben asked twenty thirty captain ca say how many use captain look for dem gone right away into de bush never find be going to try anyhow reuben said now do lead way tink dere be more dan thirty black fellow jim said to reuben a started quite crowd of dem no much like two black fellow nodded towards tracker who be running on ahead good fellow what make think that jim two day ago jim saw dem talking wid black fellow mile from station not know jim saw dem secret sort of talk why dey never find de track before black fellow bush ranger always get away jim tink fellow good reuben have often thought singular that such continued bad luck must have attended effort of predecessor to hunt down bush ranger thought that have be put off scent by tracker have not occurred to have greatest faith in jim sagacity now that idea be presented to seemed plausible enough very good jim keep eye on fellow will do same will soon find out if be up to trick jim have be running by master stirrup while conversation have be going on now dropped into usual place at rear of party for mile trail be followed at hand gallop for grass be several inch in height trail must be followed a easily a road country then began to change ground be poorer more arid clump of low brush grew here there still there be check in speed mark made by frightened flock be plain enough even to horseman bit of wool left behind on bush afforded unmistakable testimony to passage be not going so fast here mr blount said after dismounting examining footprint go in pair a did at first flock have broken into trot ah there be first ahead in hundred yard came upon skin head of sheep nothing else remained unable to keep up with flock have be speared cut up eaten raw by black in next mile came upon remains of two more then track widened out footprint be scattered confused horse be reined up jim tracker examined ground jim returned in minute two black fellow give em rest here must no go furder lie down pant one of tracker then came up stop here captain five six hour till moon rise make fire kill sheep have feast reuben of settler rode over to spot to tracker pointed confound blount exclaimed look there there be at least twenty head so there be reuben said there must have be lot of native yes there must have be good many settler agreed not so many perhaps a must think nobody have ever found out yet how much black can eat when make up mind to two must certainly devour sheep will eat till ca sit upright must hardly eat a much a with long journey before reuben said allow only three to sheep there must be sixty of man said there be good many more than tracker put down at so much better only hope will show fight after five minute halt ride be continued for next three hour then three dead sheep be passed time flesh have not be devoured poor beast have in case be speared savage brute reuben exclaimed might at least have given sheep chance of life when must go further instead of wantonly slaughtering be way always mr blount said kill from pure mischief love of slaughter even when want meat suppose make much difference expect sheep have dropped a much from thirst a from fatigue must probably have never be got up again after once fell fancy will come upon stream before long have never be out a far a before know that there be branch of nammo cross bush here somewhere five mile came upon river wet season be only just over river be full from bank to bank be thirty yard wide from two to three foot deep score of sheep lay dead in water have apparently rushed headlong in to quench thirst have drunk till fell have be trampled under water by companion pressing upon from behind for next ten mile track be plain enough then came to series of down covered with short grass at foot of long halt have be made by black must have come twenty five mile reuben said quite that captain flock must have be dead beat by time got here must think must have stopped here last night will soon see there be one of fireplace settler dismounted put hand into ash said be warm still must have camped here last night started when moon rose doubt thus have eight nine hour start of only a ca travel fast after such journey a have yesterday ought to be able to catch long before night will go better today than did yesterday mr blount said be over driven to start with be what knocked up black will begin to feel safe today will let go own pace sheep can do twenty mile in day if not hurried well at rate reuben said will give horse couple of hour rest be just eleven o'clock now must think everyone be ready for meal there be chorus of assent troop dismounted at once girth be loosened bit taken from horse mouth be turned loose to graze in long grass at foot of hill there be fear of attempting to stray after journey of morning of men set to to cut brush in few minute fire be lighted one of sheep of there be several lying about be skinned cut up slice on skewer of green wood be soon frizzling over fire twenty minute later water in large pot hanging over fire be boiling three four handful of tea be thrown in with fried mutton cold damper tea hearty meal be made then pipe be produced lighted while several of men lying down shading face with broad hat indulged in doze one o'clock reuben said at last looking at watch be time to be moving again horse be fetched in bridle replaced girth tightened now way reuben asked tracker along here captain by de foot of de hill de trail be plain enough be so track of width be trampled in grass reuben be about to give order to proceed when caught jim eye saw that black wished to speak to privately what be jim asked going apart from rest that not de way captain hundred two hundred sheep gone way wid four five black fellow de rest have gone over de hill be sure jim quite sure sar de ground very hard while de captain smoke pipe jim went over de hill saw plenty sign of sheep went straight uphill then turned away to de left dis little party here hab only gone to frow white man off de trail tracker ought to have seen that a well a jim reuben said angrily dey see sar sure enough must no help seeing wid eye see sar dose fellow up to good lead party wrong if dey can say sar jim told if say dat put on guard massa ride along trail for bit just a if talk wid jim about odder affair den after little way begin to talk about trail being too small den turn come back here go over de hill very good idea jim will do a say chapter black fellow few minute after conversation with party started following broad track through grass along foot of hill reuben informed mr blount of what jim have told by jove think be right settler said track be a broad a be be nothing like so much trampled down if fellow say main body have gone over hill why be following track reuben gave reason said that man have before have suspicion that tracker be in communication with wild black think be why be that have so frequently failed here to catch of fellow must be at surprised mr blount said savagely best thing must be to put bullet into of rascal head think jim idea be best reuben said now that have once got eye open wo be able to do more harm black fellow will see follow trail right want to see have suspicion of a must put on guard by keeping eye upon may be able to turn table be so mr blount agreed what be going to do then will call to in minute two tell that be opinion that only small portion of flock have come way then will have consultation doubt of friend will notice that ground be not much trampled then will decide to ride back to point from started will follow other trail yes will do very well settler agreed reuben at once called to tracker who be trotting on ahead then ordered halt two black came back joe reuben said mr blount think that main body of flock have not come way say think only hundred two have come ground doe not look to anything like so much trampled a be before halted tink most of dem hab come along here tracker said sullenly what do think reuben asked other settler who have gathered round did not notice before dick caister said now blount have pointed out agree with entirely there be nothing like full number of sheep have passed along here must say that have not gone along more than two three deep there be general chorus of assent ca have be keeping eye open reuben said to tracker sharply if look sharp in future will quarrel come gentleman let ride back to halting place see if can not find out way main body have gone ten minute riding took back to starting place must have gone over hill reuben said certainly have not kept along at foot must see track in long grass tracker have exchanged few word in low tone now moved up hill began to examine ground carefully of dem have gone way captain of course have mr blount said blind man might see that mark of sheep be indeed plain enough to when attention have once be drawn to subject on getting beyond crest tracker turned to left reuben saw that felt must be hopeless to attempt further to mislead party containing several settler who be perfectly capable of following trail jim have since speaking to master remained in rear of troop after three mile riding across down again came down upon flat country thickly covered with brush here there piece of wool sticking to thorn be visible tracker went steadily on for little time then pace became slower finally stopped trail ended captain what do mean by trail ended reuben asked angrily why can see piece of wool on there ahead dat so captain only few sheep hab passed here of settler dismounted having examined ground carefully declared that be of same opinion a tracker very well reuben said then in case must go back again to foot of hill be together there must take up trail afresh on reaching foot of hill jim of settler joined tracker penetrated bush in direction returned bringing in piece of wool be plain enough reuben said what have done have broken up into small party have scattered question be be to do now ' what do think blount have have more experience than anyone here be most interested in overtaking rascal what do recommend know what to recommend settler said have doubt done to confuse in case must follow so far avoid being thrown off scent other side of hill band may really have scattered gone off in small party to different part of bush again may have scattered with understanding that will meet again at given spot may be ten may be fifty mile ahead worst of be reuben said fear now that there be end of chance of coming up with today now question of water come in if must have caught before horse having have good drink at stream must have done very well till 'd gone thirty mile a seems hopeless now must consider seriously what have best do before go further doe anyone here know anything of country ahead there be general silence horse can do very well tomorrow without water mr blount said will chew leaf of scrub can if pressed hold on for even two three day upon in case reuben said let go on will break up into three party one will go straight forward other two moving to right left following track a well a can will not go much beyond walk have five more hour of daylight yet horse can manage fifteen mile will halt hour before get dark light fire smoke will be guide to other two party who must not be more than couple of mile to right left will then close in if can suggest better plan than mr blount please do so of course see objection that black may make out smoke will know that be being followed yes be objection mr blount said chance be that will know without telling be more than probable that of have remained behind on watch that will have signalled coming long ago dey have done that sar jim who be standing close to reuben elbow put in jim saw smoke curl up from top of de hill just when turned when lost trail why did tell before jim reuben asked de captain did ask jim question jim thought de captain see for sure did see jim think of saw be too much occupied looking for trail time tell what see without asking well in case mr blount there can be harm in making smoke a know already that be pursued will take charge of right hand party sergeant o'connor will take command of left do take tracker with will take boy three constable will go with of party four with will gentleman please to divide up so a to make seven altogether in party without native need not tell to keep sharp lookout captain whitney know black be very strong party now know that be pursued may a likely a not make stand yes be quite possible reuben agreed will please be careful that of party get more than two mile at outside away from mine can hear sound of rifle at distance if party fire others will of course hurry to assistance now let move forward with jim in advance reuben party moved on black carefully examining ground bush a went occasionally somewhat to reuben surprise rising from stooping position in be walking looking back over shoulder motive be explained when jim exclaimed dere captain dere be de signal again reuben turned in saddle on crest of hill behind be three column of smoke scarcely have looked at when smoke ceased to ascend a if fire have be suddenly put out be to tell that have divided in three party reuben asked black jim nodded proceeded on way again be awkward reuben said must warn other two party so saying at once ordered two of constable to ride right left warn others who be not a yet more than quarter of mile on hand that native be aware that have broken up that greatest caution must therefore be observed in ten minute two constable returned having performed mission although have reason to believe that black be within ten mile of reuben now took precaution of sending one constable out on flank to distance of fifty yard third be directed to keep with jim fifty yard ahead of main body consisting of reuben constable two colonist occasionally reuben rode forward to question jim how many sheep do think have gone along track be following about thirty sheep three black fellow how do know there be three black fellow jim can see mark sometimes of sheep foot have not seen man footprint at jim see captain plain enough when dey follow sheep not very plain to see sometimes when de sheep want to scatter jim see one footmark on one hand one on other sure to be one man behind how far be sheep ahead jim have idea six eight hour sar when dey pas here dere be saying how far be now may be long way on may be only little way tink dat hab not gone so berry far dat smoke berry thin not see more than ten mile wish have said that before jim reuben said must have kept together have galloped on taken chance of finding might have found four five of dem jim replied de others scattered good to find dem till dey come together again be right there jim must catch together if can there be twelve hundred sheep somewhere ahead mr blount said there be about fifteen hundred driven off have come upon hundred dead one two three hundred may have taken turn to right a say must be no good coming upon thirty for four hour party continued journey be six o'clock reuben said looking at watch will halt now light that fire two of constable be told off to keep watch fifty yard in front others dismounted gathered together material for fire be soon done smoke mounted straight clear signal to other two party to close in suddenly cry be heard from one of sentry men stooping round fire leaped to foot just in time to see one of constable struck from horse by boomerang while dozen spear whizzed through air at other fell forward on horse carried up to fire a fell from saddle a stopped be caught by two of others three spear have pierced stand to arm steady for life reuben shouted jim throw horse at once fasten leg must defend here continued turning to others until help come not moment be lost little party threw down in circle taking shelter behind bush jim speedily got eight horse down in centre for party have with three of spare animal whole time from first alarm until be ready to receive native did not occupy two minute horse of sentry have galloped wildly on having be struck by spear jim have difficulty with remainder be standing in group when alarm be given owner not yet having removed saddle be done without flurry excitement although yell of native rose from bush round bush be fortunately not very thick at point where have halted reuben having selected for very reason bush be sufficiently near to other to enable enemy to creep up within thirty yard so without being seen throw away shot reuben called out pick off black a stand up to throw spear ah exclamation be accompanied by shot from rifle a native rose suddenly from bush hurled spear missed reuben by inch two only a rifle flashed out black threw up hand fell back in bush here sah dis make good shelter jim propped up saddle almost in front of be good idea jim help others in same way illustration fight with black fellow five men be engaged now spear whizzed fast over among most of be thrown almost at random for black soon learned that to raise above bush to take aim be to court sudden death jim after distributing saddle to owner have lain down by side of master loaded rifle a fast a discharged reuben using pistol a effectually a rifle in interval fortunately party be provided with weapon have not be so man must have be liable to be rushed by black time discharged rifle a far a possible fired by turn so that man while loading be covered by fire of on right left for hour fight continued many of black have fallen continued assault a vigorously a before defender have received more le serious wound from spear others ought to have be here long before reuben said if have followed instruction only hope have not be attacked too a hear firing can hardly be so hope will be up before dusk dick caister said will be dark in hour fellow be only waiting for to make rush if do be up with will find tough job even then reuben said others must be here long before told to keep within two mile of have have time to ride double distance since made smoke for ten minute elapsed hurrah reuben exclaimed can hear trampling of horse moment arrive make rush for horse charge be horse be killed dick said ruefully in case reuben said must get to foot pick off black a run will get up like covey of partridge a horseman come among loud cheer be heard little party with answering shout sprang to foot rifle to shoulder stood expecting black to rise ear of native be sharper than of white have begun to crawl away before latter heard approaching horseman finding to be case party ran to horse four exclamation of wrath grief be heard for seven of horse be completely riddled with spear tartar however at master voice struggled to rise to foot reuben aided by jim quickly threw off hobble leaped on to back a rose to foot just a mr blount with party rode up keep close together reuben exclaimed a dashed forward may find of scoundrel chase be in vain be already growing dusk there be saying in direction native have crawled away in bush after riding for mile reuben reined in horse be use said may a well get back to fire what made so late mr blount be fighting for three quarter of hour before came up be very sorry mr blount replied somehow other went wrong altogether there be nothing to guide one in flat bush tracker who be leading way said be certain be going a ordered just before six o'clock halted looked in direction in expected to see smoke there be sign of presently one of constable exclaimed 'there be smoke sir right behind ' looked around sure enough there be column of smoke long way off be 'what have be doing rascal ' said to black 'there be smoke right behind have be leading wrong altogether ' black insisted that be right that fire must have be made by black fellow did know what to make of be two three minute past six noticed when halted before watch be exactly with mine so said to men will wait five minute longer if see other smoke may be sure that be made by captain whitney ' waited five minute then gave word to start when one of men exclaimed 'the black fellow gone sure enough have slipped away without being noticed while be looking for smoke felt sure now that something must be wrong galloped towards smoke a fast a horse must lay foot to ground when be about half way heard sound of firing can tell that did lose moment on way after have have loss two of constable be killed reuben said have got more le ugly scratch left arm be useless for time be spear went right through fear of others have worse hurt what can have become of sergeant party mr blount said must have gone wrong way too reuben replied told suspected tracker of being in league with black have doubt fellow led purposely astray in order to give opportunity of cutting off before must arrive to assistance suppose other party have be misled in same way be fortunate indeed that made up mind to ride for smoke when did quarter of hour later must have found only body must probably have be ambushed in turn yes have be close thing indeed mr blount said be wrong after what told to trust black scoundrel so entirely own never entered mind that be leading astray by time have reached fire be blazing high how be reuben asked nobody badly hurt hope nothing very bad captain dick caister replied cheerfully have have skin ripped up bit nothing very deep that dodge of saddle of black fellow saved mine be knocked over dozen time by spear of must have done business if have be for owe life so completely that forgive for making horse barricade to save yours reuben laughed have noticed when ran for horse that jim have thrown in centre of others body completely sheltered from spear of native be not fair perhaps said horse must have be killed a well a yours have not done so jim love almost a well a doe have watched over guarded for last three year be not angry with dick said nothing must have saved horse from being killed if one be to be saved be a well must be tartar not one of others a yours be far most valuable of five pile on bush reuben said to one of constable make a big blaze a can will act a beacon to sergeant party hour later trampling of horse hoof be heard few minute later sergeant party rode up be sorry be so late sir sergeant said somehow other went wrong altogether saw nothing of smoke be afraid something be wrong did not know what to do so halted till came on dark presently made out fire be mile away right in direction from have come did not think must be whether be black be place to ride to have got tracker with sergeant yes sir at least saw trotting ahead ten minute ago why where have got to tracker be not to be seen have made off to join black expect reuben said have be led astray purposely have be attacked brown simpson be killed exclamation of rage broke from men who be in act of dismounting expect reuben said turning to mr blount that fellow noticed talk have with jim before turned back from false trail concluded that have suspicion that be in league with black so when party separated determined to lead two flanking column astray so a to give friend chance of attacking then to bolt expect be mr blount agreed now first thing be to get something to eat when be done will have consultation while meat be cooking over fire reuben told off party of eight men to bury body of two constable who have fallen task be speedily completed two hole being easily scraped in light sandy soil after supper be over settler gathered round reuben now captain what do mean to do mr blount asked have given up hope of seeing sheep again so let influence just do a think best black be in strong force be evident will be serious business pursuing further in own country be going to pursue till catch reuben said be to say a long a there be sheep track to serve a guide ask gentleman to go further for know be serious risk be duty to hunt fellow down give lesson mean to do will never have safety in settlement until fellow come to understand whenever attack will be hunted down think be right dick caister said a long a go on go with for one come of how be to go without horse know there be spare horse reuben said fortunately have still got six of so have dick exclaimed joyfully have forgotten about what luck bringing with other settler announced intention of continuing chase a long a reuben be willing to push on will tell what idea be reuben said horse be already worn out by end of day will be half mad with thirst propose that take two day supply for ourselves in water bottle that push forward on foot sending two of constable back to stream with horse propose that must push forward tonight expect track be following be true one star will do a guide at daybreak will lie down in bush black will probably leave fellow behind a scout seeing nothing of will suppose have given up gone home will make short journey at night will go on again chance be that before morning will catch sight of fire will fall upon at daylight what do think of plan think be good one mr blount said capital plan of course much like leaving horse for in country one almost life on horseback still will be best plan certainly for a say poor brute will be half mad by tomorrow night with thirst will be long tramp back again settler said dismally wo tramp way reuben said with smile directly have overtaken black given lesson will send jim back again for horse can cover ground at wonderful pace coming back will ride one of help two constable to keep together will have

be to start at daybreak with horse for river set out on march sky be cloudless star must have be sufficient guide even have not have jim with black however took place at head of party strode along a unhesitating a if have be broad daylight chapter bush ranger scarce word be spoken a little party marched along be possible although very improbable that native on scattering before charge of mr blount companion might have left of number behind to watch movement of pursuer must however certainly not anticipate white pushing forward night fire have be piled high last thing before leaving two men left there be told to keep burning brightly till morning to start before anyone watching in distance must be able to see whether horse be mounted not must native approach fire after have gone must take for granted that whole party have ridden back to settlement night reuben companion marched steadily forward be glad to throw down on ground at first appearance of daybreak four sentry be placed with strict order to keep bright lookout through bush on account to raise head above level arrangement having be made for relief two hour rest of party be soon sound asleep except to relieve sentry there be stir among until late in afternoon then there be general movement soon be sitting up appeasing appetite upon cold meat damper have brought with there be harm in pipe suppose captain dick caister said laughingly think can risk reuben replied eye of savage may be wonderfully keen must be great deal sharper than can give credit for be to notice smoke of dozen pipe curling up among bush suppose mr blount reuben said a after meal be finished party lighted pipe drew closely round fire have heard of good many bad business with black bush ranger in time have indeed mr blount replied in early day settler have hard time of with black who be of course stronger than be now after have got over first fear of firearm more fearless of white bush ranger too be when first began to send convict here more numerous than at present know that be a desperate a be now not so ready to take life without provocation see there be very much larger run of country open to many convict who escaped took to bush be content to have gained freedom of took black gin never troubled colonist again beyond perhaps coming down to station carrying off sheep two bullock when got sick of kangaroo meat wanted change see first settler be generally poor hard working men young men with little capital have not a yet be attracted here so there be little inducement for escaped convict to meddle with there be of course notorious scoundrel who seemed to murder for pure love of thing worst of think be fellow who went by name of cockeye what real name be never heard that man be perfect devil be for long time terror of settler never worked with other white men lived among black of course in day police system be in infancy have to rely upon ourselves have narrow escape once of losing life from black when be about seventeen lived with father mother in station about fifty mile from sydney a be called then port jackson be at time quite outlying station have two convict allotted to of honest fellow enough who have be transported for poaching something of kind anyhow be not old hand gave trouble father be kind master always felt that in case of need must rely upon just a upon ourselves in day be next to impossible to get hired hand for a there be plenty of land for anyone to squat upon comparatively close to port men who came out generally set up for at once one day have be out on horseback to look for couple of bullock have strayed away be on way back when ahead of heard cooey of black did think much of because be common enough at time party have made sort of encampment at stream about mile from house when minute later heard gun fired guessed that there be mischief sound seemed to come from away towards right where knew that one of men be out herding bullock so clapped spur to horse rode in direction when got near saw cattle running wildly about mob of black fellow among must see sign of man guessed that must have gone down have best ride warn at house black saw started at run in direction soon left behind be within quarter of mile of house when native yell burst out ahead of followed by two shot rode on when got near house saw lot of black fellow round then came flash from one of upper window saw one of roll over be satisfaction for knew have caught father asleep knew door shutter be strong that must make good fight of still there be only mother at home for men have gone out before left in morning one man have much chance of holding house attacked on side so made up mind to try to dash through when shutter opened little father shouted out 'ride for help bill will keep off till get back ' so turned when have gone few yard looked over shoulder saw man dash out from behind house on horseback start at gallop after be bay with white leg knew that cockeye used to ride horse that there be better in colony almost at same moment heard shot again did look round can tell felt pretty badly frightened for there be mercy to be expected from scoundrel knew that be good deal better mounted than be next station be about four mile off have about two hundred yard start before have gone mile be within fifty yard of must hear cursing swearing shouting to to stop have made up mind must not do have got brace of pistol with be much of shot have soon after started pulled out of holster shoved into belt in front of so that a came up must see hand go down for hope be that must ride straight up to side of not knowing be armed must give chance of suddenly letting fly at must think chance be poor one that must to certainty shoot down before got up did not much think must do for guessed that scoundrel must do with a have in other case namely take carry back to house there either threaten to shoot hang up over fire such devilry to make inside give in be determined must be that if must not shoot must be shot for otherwise must have got father mother must have be three life instead of one presently crack came sound of pistol heard bullet whiz close by expect that be only to frighten into stopping in second two fired again shot just grazed shoulder so be in earnest that time bent low on saddle got pistol out of belt prepared there be shot horse gave spring knew be hit for time went faster than ever still last shot be from more than twenty yard behind expected minute to see horse head coming up beside then heard curse sudden fall looking round saw horse be down cockeye be on foot in moment drew pistol from holster so concluded to keep on a hard a must go without waiting to make inquiry guessed pretty well what have happened shot have heard father fire a started after have hit horse poor brute have kept on until dropped understood fellow firing now felt horse be failing under only chance be to stop kept on till got safe to station three men there started in different direction to fetch assistance by evening have score of men assembled there started back to station heard cooey when be within mile of place guessed be fellow on watch by time got there have cleared off be close thing mother be courageous woman have defended back of house father front black have made several attempt to burn place down roof like wall be made of solid timber be only safe way to build house when be exposed to attack of black a long a daylight lasted old people have done very well have kept black at distance saw by mark of blood in morning that must have killed wounded eight ten of if have come up before black have darkness to cover must have gone hard with of course knew calculated so a to get there before nightfall what became of bush ranger reuben asked well curiously enough be last time ever troubled settlement never knew exactly what became of be said that black killed eat know be very often end of fellow a long a went on well black be friendly enough with be glad to follow lead after repulse like got at station perhaps a result of quarrel about division of plunder gin something of sort must fall suddenly on white friend make cooked meat of suppose black seldom spare white who fall into hand reuben asked scarcely ever mr blount replied be why be more dreaded than bush ranger latter must kill if be in humour for if there be serious resistance none of number got hurt more often than not contented by leaving everyone tied hand foot till somebody came to unloose remember one horrible case in so tied up three white men at lonely station nobody happened to go near for three week afterwards struck someone that none of have be seen for time couple of men rode over to horror found three men dead of hunger thirst now black fellow do sort of thing when do attack station take kill soul man woman child suppose in affair be telling of reuben asked of ticket of leave men be killed yes one seemed to have be surprised speared at once other have made stout fight of for body of three native be found near remember one case one of others said in black did spare one of party in station attacked be little girl of about three year old why did so know perhaps chief took fancy to maybe have lost child of same age thought gin must take to little one anyhow carried off father happened to be away at time have gone down to sydney with waggon for store when got back found house burned body of wife two boy two men there be trace of of child be nearly out of mind poor fellow neighbour thought that body must have be burned with house must have that there must have be sign of one else thought so besides be custom of black to carry off anyone father got party to try follow black of course be use have pretty near two day start father never took to farm again hung about out station doing job here there for grub sometimes must be away for bit when came back though never talked about everyone knew have be out hunting black know how many of killed know never spared one when got outside settlement after time black never troubled that part so many of have be killed that got superstitious fear of man believed be possessed of evil spirit believe twenty of together must have dared to attack at last from of half tamed black in settlement got to hear sort of rumour that there be white girl living with one of tribe far out in country set out be away four month never said what have be doing time in fact started almost directly for port went home by next ship however brought child back with be four year since have be carried off be regular little savage when arrived in settlement with of course must not speak word of english be a fierce a little wildcat expect got right after bit did see man heard be worn to shadow when got back must have have awful time of in bush what with hunger thirst dodging black know how lived through looked contented happy in spite of starvation say be wonderful to see how patient be with child got up subscription at sydney to send home heard that captain of ship went in said when came back next voyage that child have taken to have got civilized like other child before got to england of course such fellow a cockeye fothergill be exception not rule mr blount said be there many of such scoundrel about must have to abandon settlement make war upon for there must be living in colony till be exterminated most of fellow be colonial version of highwayman at home be just betand deliver ' content with taking what can find in traveller pocket can obtain by flying visit to station yes have several of in last district reuben said be just mounted robber gave good deal of trouble in hunting down none of have shed blood during career did not even draw pistol when captured that style of bush ranger be nuisance more men seldom carry much money about with here great harm be done see dick caister said fellow have remarkable objection to putting neck in way of noose so although may lug out pistol shout 'bail up ' will very seldom draw trigger if show fight so long a take life know that if be caught have to expect be to be kept at hard work during rest of sentence perhaps for bit longer mind risk of that have have outing sometimes long one if once take life know hanging when be caught be therefore careful not to press too hard upon trigger once have killed man generally care how many more life take be desperate then seem to exult in devilry of kind a to being stuck up by ordinary bush ranger one must think more of than of having one pocket picked in england be lucky for on whole that black fellow have hatred of white men be not for that good many of fellow must go length relying on taking to bush when have made colony too hot to hold there be only few of have ever got on well with black many man who have gone out into bush have found end there see there be explaining to dozen native who jump up begin to throw spear boomerang at that be bad white fellow not colonist on search for fresh run no bush ranger on whole be not such bad lot of fellow suppose there be not one of here who have have men ride up ask for food who be knew pretty well bush ranger of course got food a anyone else must who rode up to station asked for once only be told to hand over money have in house a fortunately have only few pound gave up without making fight for be use risking one life unless for something worth fighting for suppose most of here have have similar experience there be general chorus of assent among settler many of be poor spirited wretch two of bailed up waggoner of mine coming out with load from port pretended to give in a be opening of box knocked one over with butt end of whip other fired hasty shot then jumped on to horse galloped off again man brought in fellow have stunned did hand over to police reuben asked not settler laughed thought have got what deserved so bandaged up head let go poor beggar of convict have dreadful hard time of think there be many settler who must hand over man who have escaped taken to bush even if have occasionally bailed up waggoner so know what flogging poor wretch must get a long a be only occasional robbery to keep from starving feel great animosity against be different altogether when take to murder then of course must be hunted down like wild beast now vote that have nap pipe out

lighter there be movement among black a soon a must see perfectly reuben be about to fire in air for did not like to fire at unsuspecting men in spite of deed of blood rapine have performed in settlement presently however eye fell upon one of treacherous tracker who have so nearly brought destruction upon levelled rifle fired man fell dead in track a rest of black leapt to foot volley from nineteen gun be poured into followed by seven eight more a most of settler be armed with double barrelled gun few buckshot being dropped into barrel over bullet then came sharp crack of pistol a white rushed down to assault native attempted resistance panic stricken at sudden appearance of foe whom imagined by time far back on way to settlement paralysed by slaughter made by first volley thought only of flight few caught up spear waddies a made dash for bush strove to effect escape between party advancing on side of latter be now close at hand for minute two fight took place between white

before starting have pointed out exact line be to follow kept by compass with only one two short halt kept on until leaving sheep in grassy bottom lit fire on crest above in order that flame might serve a guide to jim must get back with horse before daylight there be little talking before stretched at length before fire have be twenty four hour without sleep be now suffering severely from thirst last drop in water bottle have be emptied early in day be parched not only by heat of sun by stifling dust raised by flock a travelled there have be little supper eaten indeed most of contented with chewing piece of raw meat to satisfy thirst rather than hunger although have fear of return of native reuben thought only prudent to keep watch of party have hour on sentry duty day be just

trace of for next two three week reuben did not return to headquarters spending time in riding from station to station with small party of police urging upon settler necessity not only of strongly barricading house of keeping watch by turn a bush ranger seldom attack place unless can gain advantage of surprise a nothing have be heard of bush ranger reuben determined to return to barrack be spending last night at dick caister when just a be about to turn in sound of horse hoof at full gallop be heard something be matter dick said men ride like at night for nothing went to door opened

sooner later to take look out of window so keep well back night be pretty light so expect will be able to make out can get view of stable from window yes dick replied rather have that in mind eye when put stable up be always good thing men knowing that master can have eye upon when least expect why do ask because if window command stable door can prevent getting horse out yes dick said after losing two in last affair must be serious matter to have rest of carried off reuben went up stair made way towards window standing short distance back must see one moving about in yard be about to move close to when tremendous crash took place below followed by loud shout ran downstairs again bush ranger have moved round to back of house there picking up young tree have be brought in to saw up into billet for firewood used a battering ram against one of shutter at very first blow broke off hinge then made rush at window two shot rang out almost together then firing hasty volley into window bush ranger began to climb in by time reuben have arrived sharp crack of pistol rang out have got police here one of men exclaimed a caught sight of reuben uniform draw off lad expect be that accursed captain voice exclaimed be always riding about with nobody black fellow with have got to go down fellow have will give end of trouble draw off from window for moment what will do next wonder dick caister said a leaving two hand to guard window returned into other room with reuben rather expect be going to try to burn out must keep from that if can mr shillito will go up to upper room keep eye on stable shoot down anyone who may pas line of sight have got loophole caister yes of course have dick replied have forgotten about yes there be two loophole in log in side of house upstairs have be shut up by wisp of straw ever since house be built giving strict order to two men to shout instantly if anyone moved near window two young men went upstairs have seen anything shillito not thing one must almost think that have bolted will hardly do fancy reuben said there be ten twelve of think one two must have got bullet in wish must come on dick said a pulled out straw from loophole reuben went to in succession looked out nothing must be seen of assailant presently however number of dark figure appeared bearing burden have be cutting brush wood reuben exclaimed be right see be going to try to smoke burn out now think be time to give lesson look look exclamation be excited by sudden glare of light on other side of stable scoundrel have set fire to stable shillito said what will do make sally caister asked be ready for if think right reuben said must only shoot down a come out must guess that of be up at window must try to carry horse off instead of destroying only wish be on poor beast back must go for though be twice a many see others now must have gone round to other side of house scarcely have reuben taken up station at one of loophole behind than again saw dark figure took steady aim fired there be sharp cry one of fellow fell to ground others at once threw down burden fled three minute later there be shout look here policeman caister will pay dearly for night work swear bill fothergill never forgets word in way be turn time will be mine next when be take care only reply be shot from reuben aimed in direction from voice came minute later there be trampling of horse be gone shillito exclaimed perhaps be only trick to draw out dick suggested think be that reuben said be not strong enough to send party off to attack with rest think have gone know that ca follow have taken good care of that added bitterly a glanced at stable be now sheet of flame however will look round see three men descended to room below being joined by two hand removed furniture piled against door threw open must go round to side of house so a to get into glare of fire till have looked round reuben said believe be gone may have left couple of lurking somewhere about to pick off when show in light will take one of hand caister scout round on one side do three go other side quarter of hour later two party met near stable where fire be now burning low roof have fallen in only of upright be erect with flicking flame licking a stood glowing above mass of still blazing debris wonder whether poor fellow be under reuben said hope not indeed fancy must have got away might have slipped off when first rode up may be hiding somewhere round afraid to come near till know how matter have turned out so saying gave loud cooey stood silent for minute answer came back there be nothing to be done till morning dick said be use hanging about here before get light will start for watson there be two of men there with two watson ourselves can set out after fellow if be agreeable be a soon a get hold of horse hardly think will be justified in taking reuben said a walked back towards house scoundrel be armed to teeth be first rate shot know foot of country against anything like equal number must make desperate fight of even if did not thrash of course in anything like equal number of own men must not hesitate think will be fair for settler to undertake service a listen shillito exclaimed be coming back again surely enough on night air sound of horse galloping at full speed must be heard think can be reuben said must have motive in coming back after once rode off

mile of station suddenly on coming over crest faint light be seen ahead increased rapidly tongue of flame leapt up come on lad reuben exclaimed scoundrel be at work at hard gallop crossed intervening ground until be within mile of station from broad sheet of flame be leaping up then reuben drew rein for have outridden rest of party be important that must ride together now said when be gathered let

arose from of outbuilding that house be still intact a firing have be heard hoped that still resisted there be shrill whistle when party approached within hundred yard men be seen to dash out of house to leap upon horse with shout reuben rode down did not pause for moment dashed past house in direction in bush ranger have fled be knew hundred yard ahead be not light enough for to see especially after riding through glare of fire sound of horse foot however afforded indication a there be saying in direction might turn be forced to halt two three minute to listen to mortification found that time sound be getting more indistinct for speed at have travelled have taken so much out of horse that be unable to compete with fresher animal ridden by bush ranger who be well mounted many of best horse in district having be stolen by at last sound must be heard longer reuben be reluctantly obliged to give order to halt for feared might override trail be use said a reined in horse will know a well a do that be out of hearing now might turn off anywhere be terribly annoying be too late to save station bush ranger have escaped however will take up trail a soon a be daylight indeed be expecting moment to be joined by jim who be sure to be somewhere near can perhaps guide direct to hiding place deeply disappointed party dismounted from horse scoundrel must have have someone on watch reuben said must never have taken alarm so soon be sorry now that did not send party round to other side before charged down upon blood be on fire at sight of burning station at thought of woman in hand of scoundrel minute later man rode up at full speed from behind be that jones reuben said stepping forward yes sir man replied reining in horse left wilkins behind rode on to tell have happened

cattle discover where separate from take up trail doubt even then if must be successful fellow know that strong party be in pursuit of of will do everything can to throw off scent be sure not to go straight to place of meeting will take circuitous route will make for thick bush where will be next to impossible for even native to follow have done time well gentleman hope will all wait a long a can at station here if boy have not be shot by scoundrel be sure to find way here will be able in probability to set on right track at rate though bush ranger have given slip may congratulate

who must give good deal to win look of gratitude gave when said ' will never forget what owe ' be just going to send off one of men to fetch wife over here will be comfort to two girl for be little more to have woman with there be nothing to be done for donald suppose reuben asked nothing wound be hardly bleeding at told that a far a knew best thing be to keep on flannel dipped in warm water

come down to house captain whitney lady have expressed wish to see want to thank for what have done there be nothing to thank about reuben said only did duty a police officer be disgusted at scoundrel having got away have done must since arrived ca help feeling being in command of force here that be to extent to blame for fellow carrying on a have done for month without being caught think have better come down whitney mr barker said there be something bright hopeful about think that talk with might cheer poor thing up bit when people be in state be seem to turn to everyone for gleam of hope comfort oh if think can do good of course will go though must rather stop here by good way so saying reuben went down with mr barker to house lady met at door arthur have just dozed off whispered mr barker be sitting by insisted on coming out will come in here a silently a possible two men followed into kitchen closed door after fire be blazing brightly wilkins having piled on fresh log before going out to smoke pipe mr donald be sitting in dejected attitude by right when sister entered with mr barker reuben rose coming towards reuben said how can thank sir for exertion have made for having saved from dare not think what fate a long a live sister will bless can assure mr donald reuben said have done nothing duty only regret that did not arrive half hour earlier ah if have mr donald said there must not repine even in sorrow feel how much have to be thankful for yes indeed sister said have truly reason to be grateful a spoke reuben looked at more more intently have started when first spoke outside house good heaven exclaimed be possible be dreaming surely be miss kate ellison certainly be said in surprise at tone think remember why surely be not reuben whitney chapter at donald be difficult to say whether kate ellison reuben whitney be most surprised at unexpected meeting former indeed be aware that reuben have come out to australia that boy whose cause have championed must now stand before a officer to whose energy activity sister owed so much seemed almost incredible surprise of reuben be at least equal to felt must scarcely credit evidence of sens at seeing before young lady whom have believed to be thousand of mile away in england a be usual in case girl be first to recover from surprise be to owe so much said holding out hand mr barker spoke of preserver a captain whitney somehow never for moment occurred to to connect name with be not extraordinary alice said turning to sister surprise to be even greater than to miss ellison reuben said mr barker always spoke of mr donald sister have not least idea that be in colony mother wrote to year ago telling of change have taken place although said that have left tipping said nothing about coming out here reuben have in fact be much disturbed in mind year previously by hearing from mother that mr ellison have died suddenly have seemed lost large sum of money from failure of bank in be shareholder blow have killed estate be when mr whitney wrote for sale reuben have written back begging mother to send particular that must gather communication between australia england be in day very slow answer have yet be received letter have indeed told that estate have be sold mr ellison knew have died few week after have left england be very simple kate ellison said quietly although of course seems so strange to being here sister be engaged to mr donald before papa death a know almost everything went owing to bank a have reason for staying in england came out here with reuben subsequently learned that mr ellison have disapproved of engagement of daughter with mr donald who be younger son of neighbouring squire when after death mr ellison affair be wound up be found that there remained only six thousand pound wife have brought to be divided between daughter mr donald possessed capital have prospect at home alice be quietly married three month after father death have sailed week later for new south wale where a land must be taken up at nominal price be thought that little fortune must be ample to start comfortably however reuben did not learn until time later after chatting for short time returned to camp fire be very awkward mr barker mr donald said do know captain whitney be at one time gardener boy to father oh alice sister exclaimed what difference can make seems to mr donald said that make very great difference know mamma never thought well of be very awkward now finding here in such position especially a have laid under obligation to do not think so mr barker pretend to know anything about such matter mr donald mr barker said bluntly must have thought must have made difference to what man be who have saved from fate a must have befallen have not be for energy can only say that captain whitney be gentleman with whom anyone here in old country must be glad to associate may say that when came here three four month ago friend mr hudson one of leading men in colony wrote to saying that captain whitney be one of most intimate friend that be in respect good fellow that be under lifelong obligation to for have at risk of life when on way out saved that of daughter when be attacked by mad malay at cape more than did not inquire be nothing to whether be born prince peasant mr donald coloured hotly at implied reproof of mr barker word have always shared mother prejudice against reuben whitney have not be long enough in colony to become accustomed to change of position be there so frequent understand mr barker said pettishly be not only that be boy employed in family there be other circumstance oh alice kate broke out how can speak of such thing here be at present owing more than life to man be going now to damage by raking up miserable old story mr barker said impulsively father one of most just a well a one of most kind of men have highest opinion of reuben whitney believe there be nothing in circumstance to alice alludes must cast slightest slur upon character feel certain of dear young lady mr barker said even without assurance sister be shaken by event of day wonder be quite sure that when think matter over will see that preconceived idea may be must be most ungrateful ungenerous to breathe single word in disparagement of captain whitney so saying turned on heel left room kate wishing to avoid further word on matter with sister followed example mr donald reflection be not pleasant felt that mr barker reproof be well deserved that have acted ungratefully ungenerously a rule mr ellison elder daughter be by mean of unkind disposition be essentially mother child question of reuben whitney have be one have caused more serious dissension between father mother than ever remembered have taken mother view of case while kate have agreed with father although subject have be dropped by mutual consent have be very sore one at sight of reuben remembrance of old unpleasantness have caused to play part must not feel be mean unworthy felt angry at angry with mr barker with sister with reuben be standing there with lip pressed together a thought over matter when mr barker came into room be awake now dear perhaps have better go in to then dismissed from mind event of last few minute went in to take place by side of husband a during long hour of night sat there thought over what have passed since preceding evening thought of how much owed to reuben whitney be uppermost in mind when in morning mr barker relieved went into other room where mr barker kate be about to sit down to breakfast said mr barker thank for what said to last night be right be wrong be ungrateful ungenerous can only say that be very sore subject that in surprise thought of past not present believe be very sorry for what said be quite enough mr donald mr barker said heartily be very glad have said what have be sure that must upon reflection feel that whatever old grievance might have be must not weigh instant against what owe to young fellow now let say more on subject be shaken not be wrong in taking up so sharply under circumstance kate said nothing face showed that be greatly pleased at sister change of tone what be going to be done mr barker mr donald asked of course friend who came to rescue can not stay here there be chance of husband being moved for long time be afraid not indeed mr barker said most of will leave afternoon in time to get back to station tonight have be speaking with captain whitney say that with men will certainly stay here for present sent off messenger last night for six more of men to join here for still hope to get news from native boy may set on track of bush ranger need however be under alarm for think there be chance whatever of bush ranger returning by way whitney must like to speak to after breakfast want to give a minute description a can of fellow saw have already description of four five of given by men whom have stuck up band must have increased lately particular might be useful reuben came round in quarter of hour later mr barker fetched into room where mr barker kate be sitting mr donald be worse be glad to hear said a shook hand with two lady see change mr barker said be conscious doe not speak much asked morning to tell friend how deeply feel indebted to thanks be due to settler rather than to mr barker be volunteer know while be simply on duty have however one common interest to get here in time to save station above to catch break up gang of scoundrel now miss ellison if feel equal to must kindly give account of what happened mr barker said that must not ask yesterday something perhaps let drop by chance might serve a indication to a to direction in fellow have gone will tell certainly girl said face paling little although be dreadful even now to think of of course have idea of attack have gone to bed a usual one of men be always on guard on outside of house for attack made mr donald nervous for safety of sister simpson be on guard night whether went to sleep not can not say did miss ellison reuben interrupted found body round by end of house have evidently be sitting down on log against house have be killed by crushing blow with heavy instrument probably one of tool used for breaking in first knew about kate went on be tremendous crash downstairs be followed by continuous thundering noise think must have burst door in with crowbar something be first noise heard strong wooden bar inside kept door in place till battered down with log hurried on thing just a have done be not minute think from time woke alice ran in partly dressed too have heard mr donald shout to men then there be great crash a bar gave way then shot be fired mr donald have be standing just behind door have fired through moment before gave way have not time to step back be knocked down by door be fortunate for for bush ranger rushed in shot down two men instantly alice must have run down to see what have happened to husband must not let out of room must have done good might have be shot then heard moving about house swearing using sort of horrible language then shouted up to to come down else must come fetch so opened door came down at once alice gave little cry of joy a entered room saw husband standing unhurt though still looking dazed confused from blow leader of band suppose have not seen captain whitney indeed reuben said must give good deal to catch sight of what do know about only know that be young fellow not much older than be be life sentence be concerned in burglary in country in two old lady be killed two of accomplice be hung for in consideration of youth a be not proved that took absolute part in murder got off with life sentence heard about case from captain wilson came out here about year after did have not be here

into large store single handed compelled storekeeper to hand over content of till sometimes bring spare horse with ride off laden with grocery store have committed at least score of murder always using pistol at slightest show of opposition sometimes murdering apparently from pure love of thing do know name kate asked real name know that ever heard be always spoken of a fothergill will tell real name presently kate said a sister came into kitchen took off hat made deep bow said 'ladies mate be sorry to put to inconvenience a happen to be hungry must trouble to get supper need not bother to make tea wine be good enough for ' of course a be in hand there be nothing to do to obey order so spread cloth brought out what there be in larder then fetched in wine brought several bottle of spirit for a whispered to alice 'if get drunk may be able to get away from ' before sat down captain told two of men to go upstairs with fetch down watch jewelry money there be in house mr donald have already told where must find that lit four candle put on table captain ordered mr donald to sit down facing saying with sort of mock politeness that must not really enjoy food unless host took head of table several time while be eating saw captain looking hard at alice presently said ' have now why be ellison girl ai ' be astonished a may suppose said ' be miss ellison mr donald be sister ' jove who must have thought ' said 'do know who be ' said did although really seemed to have sort of recollection of face said ' remember tom thorne whose father squire turned out of public house to think now that squire daughter be waiting on be piece of luck dear went on with horrible grin need not tell how came here now will have plenty of time for have made up mind to take with for be horrible lonely life in bush without pleasure of lady society never dreamt be in for such slice of luck a mr donald jumped from seat a fellow spoke in moment levelled pistol at shouted beit down fire ' alice rushed to husband pushed down into seat have rather die than go with ' said to quietly 'perhaps so dear ' replied 'but see have got choice then went on taunting about old time especially reminding that have got thrashing over breaking school house window when went out to get more wine for must touch spirit got knife hid in dress for made up mind to kill rather than that little later stole upstairs brought down brace of pistol mr donald kept under pillow slipped one into alice hand presently began to get noisy captain ordered to come sit on knee then alice showed pistol said must shoot if one of laid finger on captain muttered order to men did hear guessed be to leave alone for present have doubt what intended to do be to catch off guard wrench pistol from be glad have knife hidden away for if did carry off be sure to be able to find opportunity for using that be awful girl said putting hand to face awful to be standing there hearing laughing shouting cursing be tempted to go behind shoot suddenly others must have be just a bad must have gained nothing by must not go through half hour again for money in world men have just finished be getting up from table knew moment be coming fast when heard sudden shout outside heart gave bound a rushed to door captain fired shot at mr donald just a be getting up a ran out shouted to ' will come back for missy ' if have not be for mr donald falling to ground must have fainted alice called a ran to think be trying to lift up when constable ran in knew be saved reuben have given sudden start when kate ellison mentioned name of tom thorne have not interrupted have score against scoundrel before said a finished by heaven will settle account with when meet must have forgiven for wrong did now finger closed on hilt of pistol in belt kate who have be looking down a told story raised eye at tone of intense passion in young officer word sudden flush of colour mounted into cheek be pale from terror excitement through have gone say ditto to captain whitney mr barker said know anything about previous doings against know that if ever come across scoundrel will shoot a dog even ca say anything against wife though be always on side of mercy mr barker agreed must say nothing to stay hand there john even putting aside have committed score of murder there will be no more wrong in shooting than there must be in killing wild beast be sound of horse coming at gallop perhaps be doctor hurrying to door found to great satisfaction that mr barker guess be verified surgeon have be at home when messenger arrived have started five minute later arriving three four hour earlier than have even ventured to hope mr barker at once led way into next room few minute later came out again for hot water sponge kate have stolen away upstairs when surgeon have entered house two men remained to hear verdict be going to probe wound can give opinion yet till discovers what course have taken say that be favourable symptom that pulse be so strong regular wish to come in a will be necessary to hold patient hand while be making examination can not give positive opinion surgeon said when have finished examination ca find ball can not tell for certain what course took after entering think judging from pulse may say from expression of face that vital part be injured exclamation of thankfulness broke from mr donald must not be too sanguine mr ruskin went on there be certainly strong ground for hope will be able to give more definite opinion in course of few hour must of course be kept perfectly quiet with more nourishment than be absolutely necessary that in shape of beef tea must make bed here will manage to slide door under lift on to with a little movement a possible at rate madam said turning to mr donald can congratulate upon fact that bullet did not strike couple of inch higher have done so ride must have be useless one bed be at once brought from room above made up mr donald be placed upon in manner mr ruskin have suggested then with lightened heart party with exception of wife left room kate mr barker at once set to to prepare meal for surgeon while reuben went over to give companion good news that surgeon have strong hope that mr donald must recover in afternoon party with exception of mr mr barker constable rode off to respective station assuring reuben of readiness to assemble again at once must obtain news must afford hope that gang must be traced few hour later other four constable for whom reuben have sent rode up outhouse be now prepared for reception of police reuben taking up abode there although mr donald strongly urged to come into house with mr mr barker surgeon there time of one of lady taken up with wounded man reuben thought that hand be perfectly full said that must prefer to mess sleep with men see mr donald said a tried to induce to alter determination will have to be sending out men receiving report may be obliged to ride out in middle of night therefore see a absolute quiet be ordered for husband will be far better for to be outside house a coming going must be sure to disturb must naturally want to know what be going on will not hope take party away in pursuit of men captain whitney said anxiously might get up false alarm to take away then come down upon house again have be too much taken up with husband to think much about although kate keep up bravely know that be greatly shaken terribly anxious know whether told be to chiefly that horrible man spoke be told a rushed out that must come back to fetch will never have moment peace tranquillity till hear that be killed taken will reuben said think that scoundrel will dare to attempt to carry out threat to come back again with so daring villain must be rash to omit smallest precaution may be quite sure mr donald that in case will leave house unprotected that if must be called away will leave two men here who during absence will remain in house with mr barker doctor may feel perfectly assured that open attack will be made can not impress too strongly upon that seeing man with whom have to deal sister must not stir outside house until have caught until mr donald be so far recovered a to be able to be removed will not tell so because see now strain be over be greatly shaken must not add to anxiety if must break to a if be own idea that have better keep within door until fellow caught be sure that will be well will come in evening hope always of evening captain whitney will make change cheer up besides want to hear about adventure since saw last reuben gladly promised after be dark have placed sentry came into house mr barker be on duty in sick room reuben at mr donald request gave account of voyage out of circumstance have led to entering police must have passed very briefly over affair at cape by many question mr donald succeeded in eliciting from detail of story be gallant action indeed said warmly certainly saved life of two girl at terrible risk of own to make romance complete whitney mr barker remarked ought to have married miss hudson unfortunately see reuben said with smile in first place be only boy be two year senior in next much more important place happened to be in love with someone else did not happen to be in love with though be admit very charming young lady have be extremely kind to how be that whitney mr barker asked eighteen be susceptible age can only account for coldness on supposition that have left heart in england fancy heart be then where be now reuben rejoined with slight smile in right place eh whitney in right place reuben repeated quietly at moment mr barker entered said that mr donald must be glad if reuben must come sit with for little time let talk much mr ruskin said le talk better talking to for time will cheer up do good be glad to see going on so well mr donald reuben said heartily a entered doctor say be not to talk much be to play part of listener do think will catch fellow be mr donald first question will catch sooner later reuben said will run down if be above ground can take step in matter until hear from black boy have be expecting to turn up ever since got here will begin to be afraid that scoundrel have ill treated if doe not turn up before long wife have be telling that knew at home whitney that people did terrible injustice somehow must go into matter curious be meeting at end of world too at such moment be curious reuben said what people call coincidence mr donald be mistaken in telling that people did injustice father be one of kindest friend ever have although mr ellison somewhat misjudged daughter naturally shared feeling be not in anyway to be blamed for for only thought a ninety nine people out of hundred did whitney whitney mr donald muttered to seemed to know name though can not recall where ah said suddenly of course remember now for be in court when stopped when be tried reuben put in quietly yes be be acquitted a know principally from way in mr ellison stood up for thank god that never for instant believed be guilty to think must be mr donald said how strange thing turn out remember must not make up mind about seemed so strange way have better not talk about now reuben said quietly said then say now that knew people who did strange a circumstance have already be may think stranger still day if bring one of before alive dead at moment there be knock at door mr donald came in said that one of constabulary wished to speak to reuben then will say goodnight hope will find getting on nicely in morning mr donald will say goodnight to miss ellison mr barker for mr donald tell mr barker that will be ready in five minute to smoke that pipe talked about with outside chapter jim report jones what be black have just come sir must not let come in for fact be ai figure to introduce among lady what be matter with jones not hurt hope have be knocked about bit sir be done up with travelling poor fellow can hardly crawl be half starved so set to work eating came off to fetch by time have arrived at door of shed jim be sitting by fire eagerly devouring hunch of cold meat men be standing round waiting till have appeased hunger before asked question looked up nodded when reuben entered well jim be glad to see back reuben said heartily be beginning to be afraid about hope be not hurt for black have handkerchief tied round head jim gave grunt continued stuffing great lump of meat into mouth reuben saw that must wait till black hunger be satisfied stood quietly looking on until having devoured five pound of meat gave sigh of contentment then took long draught of rum water constable jones handed to jim better now said that be right jim now tell about jim story be long one took more than hour in telling for english be not always distinct often required much questioning on reuben part before must quite make out meaning substance be a follows on leaving ten day before on mission of discovering haunt of bush ranger knew that be of use to go among wild black ally a hostility against semi civilized fellow be so great that must at once have be killed resolved to go back to spot where track have be obliterated by of flock of sheep to make wide circuit pick up beyond if possible follow until found difficulty be great for bush ranger have spared pain in hiding trail keeping always upon hard high ground at one time getting into bed of running stream following for two mile before again struck for rendezvous however step by step jim have tracked sometimes losing trail altogether sometimes guided merely by fresh made scratch on surface of stone by broken twig bruised blade of grass at last traced far out into bush many mile beyond furthest range of settlement then lost altogether there have be halt for time at spot beyond jim be entirely at fault made circle after circle round spot must find trace whatever of passage returned to point where have missed trail relit ember of fire bush ranger have made cooked food laid down first to think over then to sleep for be now just close of day be clear to that here more than anywhere else bush ranger have made great effort to throw anyone who might be pursuing off trail have doubt that bush ranger have muffled horse hoof with cloth have proceeded with greatest care through bush so a to avoid breaking single twig in passage only reason for such greater caution must be that be here here only that wished to throw pursuer off trail must have seemed to white man that have done before especially when have kept in water course to black jim perception appeared that have be more careless than must be expected that while apparently doing utmost to conceal track have really left sufficient indication to allow practised tracker to follow why then now that be far beyond settlement fairly in country of native ally must for first time so hide trail that must not discover result of jim thought be that when awoke at daybreak started back towards settlement when came to river party have passed in pursuit of native kept along bank scrutinizing ground with greatest care after six mile walking suddenly stopped at point where soft turf near margin be cut up by passage of party of horseman here be confirmation of idea arguing matter out with jim have arrived at conclusion hitherto trail have be false one bush ranger object being to lead pursuer to believe that have gone far out into native country whereas in fact hiding place be somewhere among settlement must be so only way to find be to search for back track have now found with shout of triumph at own cleverness jim forded river followed track of horse be now clear enough horseman taking pain to conceal trace feeling perfectly confident that pursuer must now be thrown off scent jim followed till sundown when have made thirty mile then withdrawing little distance from track made fire camped for night be now inside line of outlying station have approached to edge of bit of wild broken country offered so few inducement to settler that have be passed by for better land beyond although occasionally when herbage be scarce settler in neighbourhood drove animal up to feed among hill black have doubt that gang of be in pursuit have haunt somewhere in heart of wild little known tract in morning again started after travelling several mile entered narrow valley with very steep side with tree brushwood growing wherever must get foothold now adopted careless indifferent carriage although kept sharp lookout one who saw must have supposed that have particular object in view presently noticed that track turned sharply off from line have followed in centre of valley entered tree grew thickly here at foot of hill made halt even for instant walked straight on mile further sat down lit fire began to cook food have doubt that be watched for just after passed point where track turned off heard very low whistle among tree a sat by fire kept back towards direction from have come when presently heard footstep change in attitude betrayed that be conscious of fact that person be approaching until two men stopped beside then with cry a of sudden alarm leapt to foot lor ' mussy exclaimed de white man frighten bery much what for dey say dey come who be nigger where do come from what be doing here name jim said going tro ' country looking for place to tend ho bery good at ho look arter de ho ob mr hudson what did leave for one of men asked sternly someting lost from de house jim said quietly massa hudson tink took make bobbery so jim ran away look for nodder place

can always shoot when have done with will soon see by way handle horse whether have be accustomed to right other said come along with then what wage massa pay jim asked anything may be worth fret about wage jim pretended to hold out for fixed sum man said in stern tone come along want more jaw so have best hold tongue other word passed till got back to tree then turned off where horse have previously done so two minute walk brought to roughly made shed built against almost perpendicular side of hill be built of log there be nothing to show that be inhabited smoke curled up from chimney door shutter be closed anyone who passing through valley have turned among tree accidentally come upon must have taken for hut erected by wood cutter one of men knocked three time at door be at once opened jim be pushed inside men followed door be shut who have got here man sitting by side of large fire distance inside cottage asked angrily be nigger who want work say be accustomed to horse so a be choice between shooting bringing here thought might a well bring to must be handy to have fellow to look after horse cut wood make useful if find be of use there will be no great trouble in getting rid of be true enough other said think there be much risk about come here fellow let look at jim stepped forward towards fire saw now that hut be built against entrance to cave of considerable size in centre be great fire smoke of probably made way to surface through crevice in rock above four other men besides one who have addressed be lying on sheepskin against wall there be opening at further end of cave into inner chamber here jim knew by occasional snort impatient pawing horse be stabled chief of party asked few more question a to where jim have come from how chanced to be passing through so unfrequented country a black have already decided upon story question be answered satisfactory enough think be all right man said at last at rate here be be not likely to go out again have be talking of getting black fellow for time a here be one ready to hand may a well make best of look here went on sternly to black come of own free will here have got to stop will have a much to eat a can stuff plenty of rum to drink 'bacca to smoke if there be anything else fancy doubt can have only look if put foot outside door unless be ordered to do so will put bullet through black brain right jim said plenty eat plenty drink plenty smoke dat suit jim bery well want to go out of de house if massa say be settled then now put more log on fire jim at once assumed new duty bush ranger who hated slightest work be soon well satisfied with new acquisition there be several carcass of sheep hanging from hook placed in roof where be slowly smoked by fume from wood pile of log be heaped up in one corner have to be cut up into size length suitable for fire at one end space be roughly partitioned off be filled with grocery flour case of wine spirit have be taken from waggon going up country in stable be several sack of oat barrel filled with water be drawn from spring short distance from hut first time jim went into stable captain accompanied soon saw by black handling of horse that account be so far accurate that be thoroughly accustomed to stable work cooking be also handed over to gang passed time in sleeping drinking playing card discussing plan of robbery for first few day sharp watch be kept up on black men went out to chop wood bring in water when be required after few day however relaxed vigilance jim gradually took task also upon be perfectly aware although pretended to be unconscious of that first few time went out one other of bush ranger stole quietly after watched at work a nothing suspicious be observed in conduct supervision be gradually given up be time to be moving again leader of band said about week after jim have joined settled next job must be donald station know for certain that generally have money by there will be watch trinket of woman fellow thompson who worked for at first say have got first rate cellar of wine that woman be out outers if be a pretty a say will have here lad to do housekeeping want something to liven up besides will forget company manner if get lady to keep up to mark little there be burst of coarse laughter what do say boy will start tomorrow be long ride have best leave about noon must get into neighbourhood before dark so a to give horse twelve hour rest before begin for may have to ride for ai likely barker be nearest station must be hour before must get together men enough who must dare to follow still be just a well to be prepared since confounded new police officer have be on station there be never be certainty about thing owe one for last affair cost smith wilson mulready life will pay out yet who must have thought of being there just on very night swear if ever catch will roast alive be fool one of others said gave black fellow hot mistake sooner be put out of way better be different sort of chap than last fellow sha' feel comfortable till be got spear pistol bullet in illustration jim note bush ranger plan for mischief jim who be squatting in corner apparently half asleep be listening intently to word did not heed presence in slightest for indeed have since arrival so mixed talk with native word that bush ranger have idea that must follow conversation be thinking now what be best course to adopt in first place have gathered from talk that be only one of hiding place that seldom stayed very long in one neighbourhood question therefore be whether must return be of use going to give alarm unless must return before escape be suspected must have made off before must get back again a for donalds whose station be to be attacked gave concern for australian black have little regard for life except of people to whom be attached be reuben mission to capture bush ranger have be necessary jim must have remained quiet while dozen family be slain until found opportunity of bringing police down upon listened now intently for word might afford index to intention presently question hoped for came suppose will not come back here again tom think be getting too hot to hold in part might ride back here give horse rest load up with few thing may want can bring two three spare horse from donald weather be pleasant now might very well put in few week with black that last haul made of trader good cotton bead trumpery for gin brass ring such like for men will put in best of humour may be sure there will be hot chase after after business must propose that try luck down south for bit agree with one of others said have have very good spell here for last ten month do to tempt luck too long that losing three of number last week looked a if be going to turn what be matter captain laughed so much more for to divide have got goodish bit of brass now to say nothing of good have got at of place can fill up place easy enough time who come in be free to share of what there be in way of grub good only share in brass from time join jim have heard what wanted now lay down thought out be only coming back for short time possibly might change mind not return at must be risky thing to depend upon besides master might be blamed if attack on donalds succeeded must be better then to try to get word to in time for to be there before bush ranger arrived must return to hut so that if police arrived too late must be able to continue with bush ranger till fresh opportunity occurred for bringing master upon be possible of course that one of men must be left in hut in case have only to wait next morning men busied examining cleaning arm after dinner went to inner cave led out horse now look here leader said to be going away see jim nodded come back again tomorrow lock place up stop quiet till come back if anyone come knock while away jim answer let think place empty right jim said shortly went sat down by fire a if have further interest in proceeding window have already noticed have not only shutter outside be firmly closed within with massive plank securely nailed fastened jim heard last of party go out then door be shut lock turned jim party ride off then threw on ground listened to assure that kept steadily on way moment be sure be gone began to search place for tool must fairly suit purpose presently found large butcher knife with cut up carcass with set to work to dig hole in ground close to wall of hut bottom log be only sunk few inch in soil in two hour have burrowed under made way out beyond then crept back again scraped earth into hole again a tightly a must crawling out backwards then placed piece of turf over outside hole stamped down flat be possible that after have started might change mind send one of number back again that however have to be risked at steady run set off for settlement did not make for nearest for have gathered from talk of men that convict labourer of most of settlement in neighbourhood be in league with after three hour steady running in have covered over twenty mile saw shepherd cottage making for gave man message have taken to reuben have sooner done so have found that man be willing to set off with at once than turned retraced step to hut a rapidly a have come be already dusk when reached instead of approaching boldly made circuit crawled up to on belly lay for time listening intently with ear to door felt convinced that one be there to make sure knocked then withdrew among tree be still feeling sure now that place be untenanted removed piece of turf from hole made way back into hut again carefully replacing piece of turf then packing earth under so that must not give way if trodden upon however be very unlikely occurrence a have made opening where bush screened from view swept up scrap of soil from floor inside filled up hole there trampled down then after indulging appetite to fullest threw down went to sleep when awoke few streak of light streaming through crack of door showed that be day made up fire awaited return of bush ranger be four five hour before returned instant opened door entered jim be sure that have failed to disappointment be there plan of taking in trap have not succeeded at be not surprised for own calculation a to distance to be traversed have shown that be very questionable whether even under most favourable circumstance reuben must have got there in time with men without speaking word to men led horse through to inner cave then threw down by fire jim at once proceeded to unsaddle horse rub down keeping ear open time to what be being said by bush ranger remark however be for time confined to terrible curse a to luck how did come about be what want to know leader said be second time accursed police fellow have turned up put spoke in wheel why be not more than hour after first shot be fired before be down upon there must have be pretty nigh twenty of how must have got lot of men a together if have known that be coming beat altogether so doe be general exclamation seemed regularly to jump out of ground just when be going pleasant never knew such bit of luck be if be luck not done o ' purpose yet see a must have known possible a be going there why did know till yesterday not what day be to be except ourselves black fellow one must have known well be certain none of blabbed see a how must have told anyone not exactly leader said considering be be shut up here ever since have be away besides believe knew anything about make out half say to when be talking together mind more than if have be black monkey if did be odds must not have passed through wall back again if must who be to tell to men round here be pal must have cut jaw short with bullet there be use talking about be not be out there be end of still beat altogether that police fellow seems to know what be up to just a well a do must give share of swag have made for last six month for shot at like one of others said blest if do say a sooner be out of here better after what be happened sha' feel safe till be well out in black country if know what be going to do there ai reason why must know where be why johnson leader sneered really believe fellow sort of conjurer do know man said doggedly after have turned up twice a have must be surprised at nothing not if heard sound of men galloping up outside now there be moment silence a involuntarily listened be getting to be like pack of gal leader said savagely agree with sooner be out of better a soon a get dark will be on move tell directly get out among black will come back again be going to carry off gal somehow have owed one for year year always pay debt at least that sort of debt now then black just leave horse for present come cook food quicker better jim hurried about in bush ranger present state of temper nothing must satisfy when in hurry to satisfy angry order stumbled upset glass of spirit water be handing to captain latter caught up brand from fire struck so violent blow on temple with glowing end that fell senseless on ground must have lain there long time be brought to sens by bucket of water being dashed over found when staggered to foot that band be preparing to depart have already packed up bale of present for black placed on horse of more valuable belonging be packed away in secret hiding place rest be left to take chance till returned indeed except by friend among shepherd there be little probability of anyone paying visit to hut however long absence might be have not be that jim have proved really useful fellow for last week must have shot at once tossed body in wood found so pleasant having work taken off hand that after short discussion decided to take with door be locked started at trot evening be closing in horse have already performed two long journey in last twenty four hour soon settled into walk travelled for hour being then evident that horse must proceed further halt be called fire be lighted for be scarcely beyond settlement for aught must tell active search might still be carried on for so anxious be that agreed to keep watch by turn when morning broke be discovered that black be missing next quarter of hour be spent in angry recrimination a none must say in whose watch made escape quarrel ceased be use bothering about leader said there be one thing know nothing can tell nothing against may guess what like people waste time in listening to black fellow story expect have only given slip because of lick across head gave last night admit be fool to do be in best of temper however if worst come to worst can only lead to hut wo find much worth taking there when once get out to black can snap finger at be indeed about midnight when jim have stolen away be still faint giddy face be terribly burned by blow have be dealt when once fairly away from bush ranger set out in direction in knew donalds station lay never halted until arrived there on following evening utterly wearied worn out for have eaten nothing on previous day then have got away after jim reuben said when have listened patiently to long narration have done be possible jim have done splendidly poor fellow although be just too

reuben be glad when said that thought six day severe riding must be rather too much for that must constitute guardian of lady wife have arranged to stay here while be away so will ride over to place see that be going on straight day sleep here at night well lady reuben said a entered room be just off so will say goodbye to hope that on return will find mr donald much better be sure that mr ruskin

not get dere before dark rode rapidly for time after starting so a to allow horse to take easily during heat of day when there be halt of three hour in afternoon quickened pace again men horse be jaded done up when just a sun be setting arrived at destination how black fellow of yours find way through bush be perfect marvel to dick caister said country have become more undulating afternoon first thirty mile be almost perfectly level must see nothing must serve a index except of course sun still be only guide a to general direction must have be nine ten year since fellow be here yet led a straight a if be making for church steeple seems to be sort of instinct reuben said although possibly for last part of distance may have seen sign of passage of native a far a can understand tell at

will make short work of if venture to attack on march back fight pluckily enough against men on foot because know can make off when like ca stand charge of horseman although not so long a journey on preceding day men be heartily glad when at about four o'clock in afternoon halt be called heard that place where bush ranger be supposed to be be four mile away after consultation be decided that jim must lead band consisting of ten constable under o'connor fifteen colonist round through hill to position near mouth of valley in black bush ranger be likely to be when have posted there must come back again to present halting place lead forward party under reuben mind reuben said before others started want to attack black unless show fight object be bush ranger jim say that by what heard have got sort of house have built there let make straight for if black attack drive off can settle with afterwards great point be to capture kill bush ranger agreed to for although black gave great trouble by driving off sheep cattle sometimes killing shepherd there be not same feeling of hatred entertained for a for bush ranger be felt to be natural that native must resent occupation of hunting ground although be shot down without mercy in fair fight if overtaken while carrying off cattle there be active feeling of animosity against be generally kindly treated when called unarmed at station asked for food against bush ranger on other hand deadly hatred be felt by colonist fact that be constantly aided by ticket of leave labourer increased hostility with be regarded jim left horse behind when started with party saying that coming back at night in dark must rather be without after comrade have set out who remained behind posted two men a sentry then a soon a have cooked eaten meal laid down to sleep until time must come for advance be just midnight when jim returned reported that have seen no black by way that believed have posted party without being observed instead of returning by same route that have taken have come straight up valley there be said two hut have be built by bush ranger be now occupied by there be great fire blazing thought that native have probably only arrived there that evening have got near enough to find that be in high state of delight at present white friend have brought did catch sight of of bush ranger jim reuben asked two ob dem came out spoke to black fellow at fire too far off to see dey be hour before daybreak party moved forward halted within mile of bush ranger camp there stopped till must see sunlight touch top of hill at right hand side of valley be signal agreed upon mounting rode forward at full speed just a got within sight of hut heard wild shouting followed instantly by crack of rifle minute have reached scene joined other party who have made straight to hut black awakened suddenly a be sleeping round ember of fire have hastily thrown volley of spear have darted away among bush surrender in queen name reuben shouted promise that will be taken down have fair trial answer came in flash of rifle from window of one of hut constable immediately behind reuben fell dead with ball through head dismount reuben shouted break in door with shout men threw from horse rushed at door of hut sergeant o'connor reuben said do with six of men keep up fire at window let man show there let ten of others look after horse will have black

thickly a party having finished work rushed outside again to assist constable who be guarding horse pour volley into bush reuben shouted then mount charge order be executed in minute horseman be dashing hither thither among bush shooting down with pistol black who resisted dealing tremendous blow among with hunting whip charge be irresistible in five minute main body of black be flying at full speed up steep hillside victor soon gathered round hut several men horse have be wounded with spear none of injury be of serious character well how about prisoner reuben asked sergeant who have arrived before there be only one prisoner sir rest be accounted for be captain know sir have never set eye on if be young chap a say ai jim reuben said just go round examine body see of be captain jim returned in couple of minute none of dem ai sah not dere reuben started be quite sure jim quite sure sah be sure none of escaped sergeant be quite sure of sir one came out of of door there be only three who tried to bolt through window accounted for perhaps that chap who be prisoner can tell where to find captain be bad job indeed if have escaped be man recovering sens yes sir be just coming round reuben stepped into hut escape of thorne destroyed satisfaction success must have given have good reason to know fiendish malignity of man in spite of warning have given kate ellison strict order to police on guard felt thrill of anxiety now that be aware enemy be still at large prisoner be sitting up in corner of hut policeman with drawn sword standing near where be leader reuben asked sternly man call fothergill went away yesterday morning man said with grin of satisfaction have caught yet will hear more of before do where be going reuben demanded wo get nothing out of fellow said be be good mate true ai going to put bloodhound on scent be gone wooing be where be gone wo help much reuben at once went outside called settler round be sorry to say said that leader of party have got away rode off yesterday morning although prisoner have taken did not say where have gone have not least doubt have ridden back to donalds to try carry out threat to return for miss ellison therefore gentleman may ask to start homeward at once horse have only done few mile if press forward may manage to get to camp of evening before last have more to do here except to see if there be valuable hidden in hut set fire to expect that will have fighting with black on way back party two fellow who got away went to fetch will likely enough bar way if be not for must ride on by myself duty be to stop with men until at rate have passed place where black be likely to attack that done will push on be annoying indeed to think that fellow must have passed somewhere on way yesterday settler agreed at once sympathized with reuben in disappointment at escape of leader of bush ranger regretted matter deeply on own account be too now that work be done anxious to be off not only because wished to return to station because felt that position be dangerous one have penetrated to distance hitherto unattempted into country of native knew that must gather round like hornet on

amount bush ranger have brought back with from last plundering expedition have not yet be added to main store wherever might be however be welcome find to police abandoned idea of searching further be about to set fire to hut when prisoner said lookee here may a well tell where lot be hidden may do good when come to trial may a well have a for to lay there dig up ground in front of tree behind hut will find five minute later large leather bag containing considerable quantity of gold note number of watch chain other trinket be brought to light stop to count money now reuben said fasten on one of horse let be off sergeant let jones ride beside prisoner be responsible for safety see that hand be tied behind ankle tied securely to stirrup leather let four men take charge of eight horse of bush ranger do ride ahead with four others keep sharp lookout a go press horse must go at smart pace for have long day march before be fully sixty mile to water hole where camped night before last few minute later party be in motion although disappointed at escape of leader of band be well satisfied with result of expedition at small amount of loss at have be accomplished there be general regret at death of mr blount two life be considered to be small loss for capture of so strong body of bush ranger who knowing that fought with rope round neck always made desperate resistance journey be accomplished without incident reuben felt satisfied that must at least have trouble with tribe have scattered in morning speedy start that have made have taken beyond pursuit if attacked must be by other tribe after hour halt to feed horse cook meat for party proceeded again fifteen mile be passed then reuben saw sergeant with little party ahead suddenly draw rein galloped forward to what be sergeant be pretty sure saw black fellow head over rock sir be nasty piece of ground noticed yesterday a came along must be worst place to be attacked in of have passed if black be here in force know what be doing reuben examined position be certainly nasty place to be attacked in valley be narrow thickly strewn with boulder of size have rolled down from hillside among bush grew thickly be only down narrow path in centre formed by winter stream now dry that horseman must pas think must do to make bolt through sir sergeant said shaking head must only ride two abreast if be strong must be riddled with spear before got through there be charging among stone bush be so sergeant will have to dismount drive out foot by foot there be nothing else for by time party have come up reuben explained to situation at once agreed that must hing on horseback on such ground whole party therefore dismounted horse be tied to bush prisoner securely fastened to tree then rifle in hand moved forward sergeant eye have not deceived for a approached spot where boulder bush grew thickest shower of spear be thrown native cry rose shrill in air party be advancing in skirmishing order most of threw down dodged behind rock a black rose to throw spear moment later rifle cracked out several of black fell rest disappeared among bush make way forward steadily carefully let man watch neighbour to right left keep in line a much a can fight now commenced in earnest settler police gradually made way forward not only have advantage in weapon fact that be able to fire while lying down stooping gave immense advantage over black who have to expose when rising to throw spear take aim with bow several time emboldened by superior number black attempted rush heavy fire from rifle pistol greeted time sent back in diminished number at last resistance became feebler a native seeing that be being driven out of shelter began to slink off so a not to be exposed to fire of white men in comparatively open ground beyond many however be not quick enough be shot down a scaled steep hillside party of white gathered compared note many have received wound more le severe none of nature to prevent from continuing journey quickly returned to horse mounting continued way there be fear of farther attack must think sergeant must think not sir beggar must have have enough of must have lost from forty to fifty men two hour later party arrived at halting place now sergeant reuben said will hand over command to will ride on at once with boy be most anxious about man who have escaped will take four of bush ranger horse have not be ridden having have three four day rest be comparatively fresh fellow have have only one day start if push straight on may be there before reuben briefly bade adieu to friend while jim be transferring saddle to two of bush ranger horse leading two others started together in darkness changing saddle ten mile rode on till past midnight when halted for horse accustomed a be to long journey be now completely broken down jim master must scarce keep seat too much long jim said a threw down after taking off saddle hobbling horse too much long sah be long jim reuben replied people in england must hardly believe horse must go hundred mile in day even if led part of distance fifty mile will take to donald be about twenty mile to water hole where camped first night be about thirty mile from station will jim light fire sah jim be worth while there be cold meat in haversack if be hungry be too tired to eat if there be native prowling about fire might bring round on tink black fellow near massa think so either want to run risk jim besides be sure neither of can be trusted to keep watch reuben in spite of fatigue be time before must get off to sleep thought probably tom thorne be at time camped at water hole twenty mile ahead that in morning horse must be far fresher than have ridden be maddening to at one time thought of getting up pursuing way on foot be stiff in limb felt that journey be beyond moreover if bush ranger have taken other line be not camping there must have mean of pursuing journey at first gleam of daylight be afoot saddle be put on horse continued way reuben soon found however that five hour have rested have be insufficient to restore horse even by riding alternately must get little beyond walk on arriving at water hole remains of fire be found jim examined ground carefully found track of horse be of opinion that rider have started three four hour previously reuben carried large flask of spirit having poured what remained in down throat of horse given drink at pool again pressed on ten mile farther arrived at first outlying station owner of have not joined in expedition being married man unwilling to leave wife in such exposed position upon reuben arrival at once agreed to lend two fresh horse to take care of reuben brought with while settler be driving in from paddock wife busied in preparing two huge bowl of bread milk be thankfully swallowed by reuben jim five minute later started on fresh horse be indeed relief to reuben anxiety to find again flying over ground at rapid gallop after slow tedious pace at have travelled since morning spirit rose fear have oppressed seemed lifted a if by magic assured that have cause for anxiety for that two constable must assuredly be on watch kate have promised not to venture beyond door of house until return chapter settling account reuben soon checked speed of horse anxious a be to arrive a soon a possible might for aught knew yet have occasion to try animal to utmost therefore reduced almost racing pace at have started into ordinary steady gallop horse be fresh in good condition for several mile kept up pace without flagging then be allowed to ease down into walk until got wind again then started at pace half canter half gallop be usual rate of progression of colonial horse drew rein at last on slight eminence from donalds station mile so distant must be perceived thank god reuben muttered to be back here at last there be occasion for further hurry horse be allowed to go at easy walk man on horseback jim suddenly said touching reuben arm where where jim gone from de house sah trough dem tree dare go again gallop fast reuben have not caught sight of figure pressed spur against horse side will see who be at rate jim do ride straight on to house say will be there in few minute a reuben rode at headlong gallop towards point where course must probably intersect that of horseman riding in direction jim have pointed out turned over rapidly in mind thought whether anxiety for kate ellison be not making fool of why must turn from course just at end of long journey to start at full speed on track of figure of jim have caught only glance might be stockman someone who have ridden over from one of neighbouring station to see how donald be getting on even so told harm be done by assuring of that be not way mr barker must take to station have be neighbour who have come over must not be likely to leave again so early neither of constable must be riding away in defiance of order on account to stir distance from house presently caught glimpse of horseman be not more than mile away now view obtained be so instantaneous that must not distinguish particular be riding fast anyhow said faster than man must travel on ordinary business be messenger sent on urgent business be thorne slightly altered direction of course for speed at horseman be travelling must take ahead of at point where reuben have calculated upon cutting off in short distance must get view of for tree ended here plain be open unbroken save by low bush when figure came clear of tree be quarter of mile away reuben gave start for recognized at once uniform of own corp must only be one of men left at donald with exclamation of anger reuben pressed horse to utmost in pursuit of man who be now almost directly ahead at same time uttering loud call man glanced back to reuben surprise instead of stopping waved hand above head pressed forward two mile be traversed before reuben be beside what do mean sir thundered out man pointed ahead have carried off miss ellison sir have shot brown dead will tell afterwards there do see sir over brow there at moment reuben saw figure on horseback rise against skyline fully two mile in front ride steadily smithson said keep in view will keep must overtake in time for horse be carrying double will push on for be better mounted than be may try to double throw off trace if anything happens to stop for moment hunt fellow down to end reuben have be holding horse somewhat in hand during last mile for thought there must be reason for constable strange conduct now let go urging to full speed soon left constable behind knew that for distance ahead country be flat unbroken that fugitive must have chance of concealment whichever way turned upon reaching spot where have seen bush ranger pas wide plain opened before gave shout of exultation a saw that have gained considerably fugitive indeed have evidently not be pressing horse think have long journey before reuben muttered fancy be think be only got constable after that can easily rid of whenever come up to doubt learned from of convict that everyone be away therefore think safe from pursuit when once have wiped out smithson better will overtake sooner such indeed be view of bush ranger who kept along at steady canter troubling very little about solitary constable whom believed to be in pursuit of when indeed on glancing round saw that pursuer be within quarter of mile of reined in horse turning calmly awaited coming reuben at once checked speed of horse knew that man be said to be deadly shot with pistol be confident in own skill for with constant assiduous practice have attained marvellous proficiency with weapon did not care to give foe advantage man sitting on steady seat posse over one in saddle of galloping horse therefore advanced only at walk bush ranger put down change in speed to fear caused by resolute attitude shouted look here constable have best turn horse head go home again know well enough that one constable be match for so have best rein up before put bullet in head if shoot be just a likely to kill young woman here a be know make mistake reuben be already conscious of disadvantage in respect for bush ranger held girl on saddle in front of so that body completely covered be enveloped in shawl covered head a well a figure captor held tightly pressed to with left arm while right be free to use pistol reuben checked horse at distance of fifty yard while thought over best course to pursue a paused thorne for first time noticed that be officer with whom have to deal not with constable who a believed be only one in district uttered savage exclamation for felt that materially altered condition of affair oh be be said thought be only one of men advice gave be a good for a for advise to turn back before mate be down on mate will never be down on anyone again tom thorne reuben said sternly have wiped out seven of other be prisoner be lie bush ranger said furiously be two hundred mile away in bush with friend bobitu eh yes be be not now thorne be lying under ash of hut of yours close to tree where buried treasure be who be going to have help not man will be up in few minute glanced round at constable whom bush ranger now perceived for first time le than mile away reuben word have effect be intended to excite filled bush ranger with fury desire for vengeance while sight of approaching constable showed that unless took prompt measure must have two adversary to fight at once without moment hesitation set spur to horse dashed at reuben when within twenty yard fired reuben felt sharp pain a if hot iron have be passed across cheek thorne uttered shout of exultation a saw start a kept seat again raised hand to fire in instant reuben discharged pistol bush ranger weapon dropped from hand for reuben bullet passed through wrist throwing burden before headlong to ground thorne drew pistol with left hand two shot rung out again at almost same instant reuben however be slightly quickest saved life bullet passed through bush ranger body while thorne pistol be diverted somewhat from aim bullet struck reuben left shoulder instead of head in instant have drawn pistol surrender fire then seeing by change in bush ranger face by collapsing figure that be badly hit waited still keeping thorne covered with muzzle for bush ranger have charge left in pistol still grasped in left hand twice thorne tried to raise in vain then reeled in saddle pistol dropped from hand fell heavily over on to ground reuben at once leaped from horse ran to raise kate ellison who lay motionless on ground a have be thrown removing shawl wrapped round head found be insensible kneeling beside raised head to shoulder minute later constable galloped up badly hurt captain asked a leaped off horse for blood be streaming down reuben face left arm hung useless nothing to speak of smithson see to miss ellison first there be water in flask in holster just bring here sprinkle face hope be only stunned that scoundrel threw off with such force that may well be badly hurt be done for captain man asked glancing at prostrate figure of bush ranger a proceeded to obey reuben instruction because if ai certain about have better put bullet into fellow be very fond of playing 'possum then turning table upon there be fear of smithson be hard hit hope be not dead for must rather that be tried for crime be time before kate ellison opened eye for moment looked vaguely round then a eye fell upon reuben face uttered little cry raised into sitting position what be captain whitney be badly hurt thank god have recovered miss ellison began to frighten horribly be afraid be seriously injured look so alarmed can assure be not much hurt only flesh wound fancy in cheek broken collarbone have saved again captain whitney yes thank god have have that good fortune reuben said quietly time for good for tom thorne will never molest again ca do something face be bleeding dreadfully please let bind up tearing strip off bottom of dress proceeded to bandage reuben face constable took off black silk handkerchief wore round neck think miss will make sling for arm when be done captain will be pretty right do think can ride back sir asked when have fastened handkerchief will wait till ride back to farm fetch help can ride back well enough reuben said trying to rise to

scream then must have fainted for next thing knew be be being carried along on horseback be so muffled up held so tight that felt be use to struggle made up mind to lie quite still a if be still insensible till put down then think intended to try seize pistol to get hold of knife if there be one if must not kill to kill there did not seem least hope of rescue mr barker be away must not be back for hour supposed that constable be shot men round be away with from distance said be going did not think must be back for day presently felt stop turn horse then when spoke knew that have not killed constable one of have followed when answered thought be voice though seemed impossible must not be sure because must not hear plainly through shawl then pistol be fired suddenly felt falling

to whitney for having rid of pest what with thrashing black have have will be able to sleep quietly for month be more than have done for long time kate came out of room with mr donald minute later basin of cold water tea have have effect mr barker predicted little colour have returned into cheek looked altogether more like how be mr donald asked in opinion be doing capitally mr donald pulse be quiet even be breathing a quietly a child believe be simply in state of exhaustion from be not likely to wake till tomorrow morning predict that in few day will be up about indeed if bullet have misbehaved see reason why must be up tomorrow be indeed relief to mr donald said while kate must only clasp hand in silent thankfulness now how be husband hope be none worse for exertion be terribly agitated at first mr donald said fainted know got out of bed to help up be a much a must do when recovered to get to lie down for wanted to mount ride after kate although of course be a weak a child even with help must scarcely get into bed again fortunately mr barker ran in before started on horseback to fetch to say that constable be off in pursuit that quieted then think be occupied in trying to cheer for a soon a be in bed broke down cried till constable came back to say that captain whitney have overtaken shot bush ranger three hour later to great relief of surgeon arrived be first taken in to look at reuben having be told circumstance of case confirmed mr barker opinion that be really in deep sleep must not wake on account said be great effort of nature will hope awake quite of course ca say anything about wound till doe now for antagonist bush ranger be still unconscious though occasionally broken word came from lip surgeon examined wound be shot through lung said be bleeding internally think that there be shadow of chance for one can wish otherwise will only save colony expense of trial now for original patient be time in mr donald room when came out proceeded at once to mix soothing draught from case of medicine carried behind saddle must get off to sleep if can said will have in high state of fever before morning man in state ca go through such excitement a have done without paying penalty now suppose have done said with smile a mr donald left room with medicine yes think so mr barker said if have come hour earlier must have put young lady under charge think that assurance of husband that captain whitney be doing well have be better medicine than must give wonder be shaken mr ruskin remarked mr barker tell have heavy fall too miss ellison yes replied be stunned for time beyond being stiff bruised be none worse for look here miss ellison doctor said after putting finger on wrist suppose will want to be about tomorrow when brave army return now there be nothing can do here mr donald can nurse husband other two require nursing mr barker be sure will take charge of house therefore seriously must ask to take draught be about to mix for to go upstairs go to bed sleep till morning must not sleep kate protested very well then lie quiet without sleeping if in evening find be restless can come down for hour two really must insist on lying down for bit now mr barker will take medicine up put young lady to bed hope will get off to sleep mr barker said when came downstairs again have doubt about mr ruskin replied have given very strong sleeping draught far stronger than must think of giving at other time after tension that poor girl must have gone through must need strong dose to take effect think will hear nothing more of till morning indeed be not until sun be well up next morning kate ellison woke must hardly believe that have slept all night eastern sun coming in through window showed that have done so still felt bruised shaken over be otherwise again dressed hastily went downstairs be right dear mr barker who be already busy in kitchen said look bonny like how be brother captain whitney kate asked think mr donald be awake yet mr barker replied captain whitney have just gone out to shed with husband surgeon gone out to shed kate repeated in astonishment yes dear that poor wretch out there be going fast recovered consciousness about two hour ago constable be sitting up with asked for water then lay for time quite quiet then said 'be dreaming be reuben whitney fought with ' 'yes be captain reuben whitney inspector ' constable replied for time lay quiet again then said ' want to see ' constable told be asleep must be woke badly wounded ' man asked know hit ' 'not very badly hope ' constable answered wake ask to come to ' man said know be dying want to see first if ca come let somebody else come ' constable came in roused doctor who went out saw said might live three four hour yet soon afterwards just a sun rose jim came out to say that master be awake mr ruskin went in to examined wound probed course of bullet have lodged down just at bottom of shoulder bone be glad to say be able to get out when have done told patient what bush ranger have said captain whitney insisted upon going out to wo do harm will kate asked anxiously dear mr ruskin must not have let go saw a went out shook hand with except nasty bandage over face looked quite again a told broken collarbone be mere nothing now know where bullet went have got out there be occasion for slightest anxiety here come again so can judge for very few word passed between reuben kate for mr barker who saw how nervous girl be at once began to ask question about what bush ranger have said have made confession mr barker husband have written down mr ruskin smithson have signed be about very old story in be concerned when boy be great gratification for to have cleared up at last be accused of poisoning dog belonging to miss ellison father be tried for burglary committed on premise be acquitted thanks only to miss ellison influence exerted on behalf fear said with slight smile somewhat illegally however imputation must have rested on life if have not be for thorne confession thought that did first affair knew that be concerned in second although must not prove have now made full confession saying that poisoned dog confirming story told at trial oh be glad kate exclaimed know captain whitney be sure of innocence know how must have longed for to be proved to world what will do mr barker to make public will send copy of confession properly attested to magistrate of lewes copy to paper captain whitney tell be published there weekly be curious went on that sight of whitney must have recalled past recollection while so far a must see everything have happened afterwards career of crime blood that have shed seem altogether forgotten suppose there be hope for kate asked in low voice be dying now mr barker said ruskin be with be fast becoming unconscious when left ruskin said that end be at hand quarter of hour later surgeon came in with news that be over now captain whitney must come into room let bandage up shoulder properly have half time to do before wo want to lie in bed nonsense of sort reuben asked must if thought must obey order a see chance of will not trouble to give seriously think there be necessity for providing always that will keep very quiet will bandage arm across chest so there can be movement of shoulder when be done think will be all right there be only one more question reuben have to ask with regard to event of preceding day why be that smithson did not go to comrade assistance then learned that thorne rode quietly up to back of house dismounted then went to stable where smithson be asleep having be on guard during night pushed piece of wood under latch of door so that must not be raised having thus securely fastened smithson in have gone to front of house have apparently shot down constable there before latter be aware of presence smithson awakened by shot tried in vain to get out be only released by mr barker when recovered from effect of stunning blow bush ranger have struck have then mounted at once followed in pursuit in afternoon party returned from bush having experienced further molestation from native nothing occurred to interfere with
