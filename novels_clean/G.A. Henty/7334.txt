refusal by producing rifle immediately if stranger ventured to urge request of late insolence of boer have greatly increased manner in england have instead of demanding justice with sternness determination that circumstance called for permitted remonstrance to be simply ignored be put down a consciousness of weakness having now collected arm sufficient not only for for whole dutch

discussion have be going on with regard to five seven year franchise be regarded with absolute indifference by uitlanders even shorter time must have afforded advantage whatever member from mining

upon to serve in arm not only against native upon whom boer be always making aggression against england when war foresaw must not long be delayed broke out for month negotiation went on between president kruger mr chamberlain british colonial minister certainty that boer be bent upon fighting became more more evident vast quantity of rifle ammunition cannon poured into transvaal passage being more than winked at by dutch ministry of cape colony be that day known that president kruger have thrown off mask of pretended desire for peace that ultimatum have be telegraphed to england couched in term of such studied insolence that be certain war must ensue greatest civilized power on earth must have shown le arrogance towards most feeble not only be england called upon to send more troop to south africa to withdraw most of force already in country by state owed very existence to whose total population be not more than of small english county term of ultimatum have just become known in johannesburg be not surprising that have created intense excitement have long felt that war must come at early date step have now be taken came a surprise from appearance have seemed that negotiation might be continued for month yet before crisis arrived that must thus have be forced on by wording of ultimatum showed that boer be satisfied that preparation be complete that be in position to overrun natal cape colony before british force capable of withstanding must arrive england indeed have be placed in most difficult position ministry be not unaware of enormous preparation that boer be making have for time past be quietly sending out large number of officer few non commissioned officer men to cape so long a there be hope that boer must finally grant redress to uitlanders must not despatch considerable number of troop for have done so must have be accused not only on continent by section of englishman of forcing on war with weak state whereas in point of fact war be being forced on by country most erroneously believed to be stronger than england boer of transvaal knew already that orange free state must join at once believed firmly that dutchman in natal cape colony must at signal take up arm presently gentleman detached from crowd in front of exchange joined lad of sixteen year old who be standing on other side of street well father be true what say latter asked that kruger have sent ultimatum to england war be certain be quite true chris war be absolutely certain kruger have given british government only two day to reply to most insolent demand ever addressed to great power worded in most offensive manner imagine that reply will be given a ultimatum be sent off yesterday will to morrow morning be in state of war well father there be doubt what result will be doubt whatever a to final result be afraid thing will go very badly for time be glad very glad that kruger must have sent ultimatum can not be accepted a defiance by

not grant modest request may say that war have begun wish now that have sent chris down to durban fortnight ago for there will be fearful rush judging by attitude of boer fear will make journey very unpleasant one a have agreed be absolutely necessary must remain here there be saying what step boer will take with reference to mine be certain that must if possible keep going not for sake of profit may be sure kruger will not allow to go out of country because if be to be stopped must cost immense deal of money to put in working condition again especially if a be likely enough boer damage machinery will do a little work a can boer will not fancy interfere with a long a can benefit by working for must risk loss damage rather than aid in supplying with gold for sake of shareholder in europe must do best to save mine from destruction indeed if work probably will do so until end be at hand will then do a much damage a possible know have agreed on point yes suppose be best robert seems terrible leaving alone here will be in perpetual state of anxiety about think there be occasion for a long a be working mine be taking gold doubt will have to repay when army be master here will

be coward courage be indeed a far a know only virtue posse in long run must certainly be beaten will only be after very hard fighting what do think will do father ca say what will do be sure that what ought to do be to merely hold pass from natal with enough men for purpose to march whole force broken up into dozen column into cape colony there be force there must resist must be undoubtedly joined by dutchman there be convinced that africander ministry must at once declare for in case england must have to undertake tremendous work of conquering whole of south africa afresh for certainly must

durban six week ago what have remaining must leave behind to take chance will be able to take luggage whatever with know how terribly train have be packed for past fortnight week ago almost carriage be commandeered for use of troop going south must take with basket of provision sufficient if necessary for two three day for there be saying how long may be on way to frontier once beyond will of course be able to obtain anything want need expect civility courtesy from boer who indeed must feel malicious pleasure in shunting off into siding letting wait there for number of hour must mind chris above thing to keep temper may happen know how people have be insulted actually maltreated in score of case in present state of excitement boer must be only too glad to find excuse for act of violence be speaking to about three day ago can not impress too strongly upon have already given permission to join one other of corp be being raised in natal if anything unpleasant occurs on road must bottle up feeling wait till get rifle in hand stand on equal term with promise that father think after what have have to put up with here during past two three month especially can bear anything for last few

at once returned hour later with very discouraging report station be crowded with people regular train be running while be there large number of cattle truck have be run up to platform in a many of fugitive a must be packed in be stowed away a soon a be done train have started not number collected on platform have found room in father have left few minute after presently returned from what can hear said there be chance whatever of being able to get accommodation must take chance with others viljoen told that except waggon there be not carriage of sort class left here that there be saying at when must return that even if did must be taken for use of troop going south must say be that if when came down to station with be there will see that go by first waggon leave be something at least mr king said quietly certainly wish to ask for favour from people want to be better off than others have doubt that will be unpleasant time after will be nothing to what great number of people will have to suffer during war be so amy now think that sooner start be made better rush to get away will increase hour will have miner coming in in hundred many of mine will be shut down at once though of will like ours continue operation a long a be allowed to make basket bag take provision in a small a possible mother saw lot of baggage left behind on platform see there be seat to stow thing under must say that flat box can sit on must be best thing will want warmest cloak thick rug for night have box will do very well chris fortunately have plenty of cold meat bread in house will not be more than

have wife thick wadded winter cloak rug over arm small hand bag with few necessary for journey mr king be in usual attire carried only white umbrella look a if be starting for picnic rather than journey will last three four day said with attempt at gaiety there be one comfort will have nothing to look after when get to end chris walked on ahead to let father mother talk together for although arrangement have be discussed settled during past two three day there be much have to say to other now that parting have come lad be fine specimen of young uitlander life passed largely in open air hard work exercise have broadened shoulder made look at least year older than really be be splendid rider excellent shot with rifle for father have obtained permit from authority for to carry one must bring down antelope when running at full speed a neatly a of young boer four day week have spent in mine for father intended to follow in footstep have worked by turn with miner below engineer on surface so that might in course of few year be thoroughly acquainted with detail of profession last two day in week have to with three four lad of own age went for long ride in search of sport couple of hour evening be spent in study under father direction be quiet in manner talked little deeply resented position in british population in transvaal be placed insolence of boer towards brutal cruelty towards native restraint so often found necessary to exercise have have slight influence on character have given certain grim expression to naturally bright face many have be discussion between friend a to prospect of england taking up cause disappointment have be intense at miserable failure of jameson raid however felt rightly must day have good result inasmuch a have brought out wretched position of uitlanders who though forming majority of population source of wealth of country paying tax be yet treated a outcast race deprived of right possessed by people of civilized nation have wondered fretted at apathy with enormous warlike preparation of boer be regarded at home fact that be permitted to become formidable power capable of offering desperate resistance even by army of england whereas before have be enriched by industry enterprise of immigrant have be in danger of being altogether wiped out by zulu swazi have only be saved by interference on behalf of british power thus then while war cloud have be slowly surely gathering lad have watched approaching crisis with delight unmingled with anxiety foreboding of capitalist who without doubting what end must be be sure that enormous loss sacrifice must result before deliverance from boer oppression must be obtained scene at station be extraordinary one men woman child of rank be crowded on platform greater capitalist men whose fortune must be counted by hundred of thousand have for most part left many who in england must be considered a rich men have remained in town till last moment to make final arrangement wind up affair with be well to do storekeeper with wife family together with mining official miner mechanic of kind pile of baggage rendered movement difficult for many have supposed that regular train be still running that must be able to carry away with greater portion of belonging scene at departure of previous train roughly awakened to fact that must be abandoned woman be cry men cursing below breath at last evidence of boer indifference to suffering of by whose work have so greatly benefited mr king soon found that manager be still there on speaking to shrugged shoulder said see what can do look at crowd there when waggon come up there will be rush have men here to keep number in order see that mr viljoen if must send man with to where waggon be standing in readiness to come up wife must take place then yes will do at once have better go with outside station porter will take on from there if be to get off platform here walk up line others must notice there must be immediate rush called to one of porter on platform gave instruction in few minute mr king be seated on box in corner of truck with few others have covered roof although be entirely open at side in next half hour eight ten others who have be similarly favoured by manager joined be known to king be great relief to to find that must travel together instead of being mixed up with general crowd have packed together a closely a possible so that when train became crowded there must be room for anyone to push in among among party be john cairn great chum of chris father mother have be waiting for two hour at station told that there be seven eight of companion there will take seat on side chris said a move in shout to to join will be great thing to get a many people know in here a possible presently train began to move fortunately at spot where drew up group of acquaintance be clustered together managed to get into truck be speedily filled up until there be scarce standing room three minute later train moved on great number be left behind although everyone made a much room a possible woman especially being helped in after truck seemed absolutely choke full a soon a train be fairly in motion many of men climbed up on to roof of covered waggon thereby relieving pressure below enabling woman to sit down others ranged along side sitting on rail so minimizing space occupied even with woman be packed inconveniently together however be so much pleased at good fortune in having got away that there be complaining grumbling that journey must be long one knew at least have started must soon be free people in free country chris friend have be among first to climb up on to roof sat down in group at one end of be going to be pretty cold here to night desperately hot to morrow chris said can put up with must stand for month rather than stop longer among brute there be general murmur of agreement thank heaven one of said next time meet will be with arm in hand have long score to pay off will expect have plenty of chance boer be boasting that will soon drive last englishman out of south africa seem to regard a sort of general picnic will find out mistake before have done still must not think that be going to be picnic way chris said have quite made up mind that boer in cape colony natal will join at once if do will be very long business to put down though have doubt will come right in end do know anything about others know that peter carmichael brown went off with people last night know about others capper willesden horrocks went yesterday lad said sankey holdsworth be on platform doubt got into truck there be seven of here chris said a six have gone on make thirteen certain there be eight more to come most of will stop at pietermaritzburg suppose whose friend be going straight home will go down with to durban there will not be many who have to do so said sankey people carmichael be going to cape town so far a know others will stay see out either at maritzburg durban do think that must take others with chris think so see know other must be nuisance having fellow with of whom know nothing might not pull with while have be so much together that there be fear of having disagreement think have pretty well settled that will be much better to act by instead of joining of corp be sure to be formed down there still if knew one of men getting up corp of people be pretty sure to do so do think must be good plan to join if must accept a sort of independent troop ready to act with when there be big fighting to go about on own account at other time see none of will want pay will furnish own horse arm will therefore be on different footing from men who have to draw pay be equipped at public expense see why officer commanding troop in one of corp must object to joining on term anyhow feel sure that must be able to do great deal more good by being free to move where liked to undertake expedition on own account than if be to act in more regular manner there be general chorus of agreement now how long do think will be before cross laing nek of course ought to be there by to morrow morning be only hundred fifty mile at fifteen mile hour be about usual rate of travelling must cross frontier at two o'clock for be about four when started there be saying father thought ought to take four day provision with think must hold out for time mean to say chris thought possible might be a long a that did think so peter considered that might be shunted off very often to let train with men store for troop go on ahead of well other replied care so much for though say that must be lively to be stuck up here for four day night must be awful for woman must say that very few of have got more than enough provision for day still of course if be shunted at station will be able to buy thing be not so sure of chris said know what boer be at best now that believe time have arrived when be going to be absolute lord of south africa be so puffed up that there be saying what may do to show hatred contempt for happens fellow must keep temper father spoke to very strongly about must remember that will not mind what do must shoot of down on smallest excuse knowing well enough that be helpless that be unlikely enquiry must ever be made anyone punished even if shot dozen of must remember that intend to pay off old score later on that mean to do with interest chapter ii terrible journey twenty four hour have gone not distance have yet be covered night have passed painfully to in waggon for though most of woman have provided with wrap of one sort cold be severe however be le felt than cramped position in have to sit on floor unable to move to stretch leg only change obtainable being by standing up pressure be most felt in open waggon where men a well a woman be packed together so closely that even sitting down be impossible slight relief have be afforded by men on covered waggon taking a many from uncovered truck a must lie down there with a latter be by far more numerous comparatively small number of men must be so entertained for time rising of sun afforded relief a gained in power position of fugitive became almost unbearable stoppage be frequent at station boer from neighbourhood have assembled from curiosity majority to wait for train be to take to front although sometimes detained for three four hour passenger be not allowed to alight men indeed at time by common impulse sprang out be soon forced to take place again of boer using heavy whip over head shoulder while others with pointed gun prevented attempt at retaliation men even woman crowded platform jeering cursing in waggon menacing with whip snatching at such trinket even cloak a took fancy men be several time searched for weapon made to turn pocket inside out content being unceremoniously transferred to of boer chris companion must have taken place below with friend implored not to do so being afraid that must be enraged beyond endurance might in anger say do something must give excuse to boer to use rifle so often pointed threateningly at woman a well a men be only when train be in motion that food drink be passed up from below a too must assuredly have be seen have be confiscated by brutal tormentor when steamed into standerton in afternoon distress of woman child for water be so great that men determined at cost to endeavour to get for a if by one impulse when train came to standstill outside station jumped out made for little village here refused to give sell water food in few minute large party of boer rode in falling upon with whip drove back to train have be armed men must assuredly have resisted till last although certain to be killed so mad be with passion a be must have be throwing away life without chance of even avenging on assailant a reached waggon climbed into place again several have broad blue weal across face while many more be smarting from cut have received on body chris companion have got out when others did so have not followed supply of water cold tea be not yet exhausted a most of lady have made preparation for journey of two three day mr king mother of other lad begged not to go boer be only waiting for excuse to use firearm mr king said happens have better stay here can do good by going so reluctantly have again taken place on roof of carriage sat there with pulse beating fist clenched a heard shout cracking of heavy whip in village presently saw men running back pursued by cowardly assailant two three of lad be so enraged at sight that must have jumped down have not chris laid restraining hand on wait time said in hard voice ca repay now will remember when turn come boer a rode up leapt from horse with shout of exultation walked along waggon striking at men hurling epithet of contempt hatred at even spitting at many of woman be also struck a well a being grossly insulted scoundrel call christian men friend speak of a simple pious farmer call from appearance action a unmitigated set of ruffian a be to be found on face of globe cairn exclaimed passionately be indeed a unsavoury in appearance a be brutal in manner water be scarce in transvaal be used most sparingly for purpose of cleanliness boer sleep in clothes give shake when get up toilet be completed unless on very exceptional occasion when go outside door to water cask fill hand with

dress most of men wore high riding boot of young men from town be in tweed suit vast majority wore shooting jacket long loose coat be in straw hat elder men wore large felt hat with wide brim be however similarly armed with rifle of best most modern construction general appearance be that of large band of farmer of roughest type wholly without regard for personal appearance be fully hour before train moved again then be shunted on to siding while boer entrained with horse on long line of waggon have just come up started on way south a soon a be on board then emigrant tram crawled on again there be night of wretchedness in morning arrived at volksrust frontier town here be again closely searched for arm what provision remained among be commandeered a emigrant called stolen however knew that trouble be now nearly over did not grumble when be informed that train must go farther that must make way on foot to newcastle be told tauntingly that might find of friend there if have not already run away that if stopped at pietermaritzburg for week must have journey down to durban a prisoner be too glad to get out of clutch of boer to utter complaint knew must be useless went off at once prospect be not however pleasant one newcastle be nearly thirty mile away hoped that at least might obtain shelter rest food for woman at of scattered farm at first progress be slow for after being for more than two day half packed up like cattle have almost lost use of limb gradually pace be accelerated men took little child on shoulder others helped woman along charlestown on british side of frontier be already occupied by boer who hooted abused a passed through at laing nek there be dutch commando with gun two mile on woman must go further halted at large farmhouse have be deserted by owner men however who be alone determined to push on at once to newcastle promised must send vehicle of sort to take on if must possibly be obtained mr king other lady authorized to pay sum demanded thankful indeed be tired woman when reached farmhouse found door unfastened a farmer knew be to lock boer must certainly batter in when arrived must probably do greater damage to furniture left behind than if have obtained entry without trouble men soon found wood shed in short time great fire blazed in room bedding have be carried away utterly worn out a be woman be only too glad to lie down on rug cover with cloak men gathered in lower room talked for time before thinking of going to sleep there be scarce one who be not determined to join one of volunteer corp being raised at durban maritzburg to avenge insult ill treatment to have be subjected long smouldering animosity towards boer have be fanned during past three day into fierce fire even who have not before thought of taking part in struggle be now a eager a others to do so in morning be astir early have be supplied with food must have waited until waggon came out from newcastle must hardly arrive until evening at moment boer advance might commence therefore determined to move on early for if met waggon way must return with at once to town be desirable to start a soon a possible so a to get well on way before heat of day be at fullest accordingly by six be in movement long night rest have done good still more so thought by end of day must be among friend be disposed to laugh joke over present situation men have cut heavy cudgel from stock of firewood fact that be not a before wholly defenceless be slight gratification to even lady spoke confidently of being able to walk twenty mile to newcastle must not meet vehicle coming to fetch must go ten mile now then halt till sun be setting after such long rest must certainly go on to newcastle be afraid mother chris said a started that

near frontier determined to continue journey to capital reached next morning lad have quite decided upon course before starting have arranged with parent to remain at general opinion be that british force at front must not possibly maintain that a soon a invasion began in force must fall back a transvaal boer must be able to attack in front on right flank while free stater must pour down through van reenen de beer pass make straight for ladysmith so threaten line of retreat there be few indeed who still believed that boer must stand entirely upon defensive so far a natal went must occupy formidable pass through drakensberg await attack there while must invade cape colony at many point raise boer population however general opinion be that must advance into natal in great force in case be doubtful indeed whether sir george white must oppose successfully north of maritzburg might even be thought be obliged to fall back to durban until reinforcement arrived from england already there be rush to office have be opened for volunteer corp many of fugitive from transvaal have joined a have most of young farmer who have be obliged by hostility of dutch neighbour to abandon home in north

approval of appearance really congratulate mr king said on having command of twenty such serviceable looking young fellow a can ride a tell can shoot ought to do really good service must be well pleased if troop be composed of such good material from fact that can all speak dutch most of kaffir will have great opportunity of obtaining information can in case of need pas a young boer in fact may say that there be danger of being mistaken for by men must take for except that look brighter more wide awake than boer generally do artilleryman must hardly be blamed if plumped shell among at distance of two three thousand yard thought of sir chris turned to band change cap pulled field service cap from pocket took off soft felt rolled up forced into valise put on cap be excellent captain brookfield exclaimed that certainly alters appearance altogether a far a figure must be made out through glass must be seen that be irregular body of sort can be still more plainly seen if a must advise always ride in four when be approaching line there will then be little chance of mistake being made where did pick up horse bought yesterday from farmer named duncan who have brought down from place near dundee ah account for be one of best known horse breeder in colony have not heard that have come down only arrived two day ago sir be fortunate to hear of of rode over early yesterday be lucky enough to secure be lucky there be several mounted corp being formed here at durban horse will go up in price rapidly where be staying ' about mile half farther out sir if want horse must think that have better go on at once for told that have sold sixty yesterday very few of be anything like a good horse a people be subscribing handsomely can not afford to mount trooper on such horse a good many gentleman have found own horse of course will be well mounted good sound country horse be can afford for others be excellent for ordinary work though of course not so fast a yours quite so big horse have strain of english thoroughbred blood if must at time have to ride for there must be little chance of boer overtaking though of be very well mounted for two thing boer will spend money on be horse rifle when do start be going to morrow morning went to station master yesterday evening arranged for truck for horse to be attached to early train to dundee want to get up in time to see first of must lose three day if be to travel by road be right spirit wish must go with troop will wear sort of uniform norfolk jacket riding breech outfitter be so overwhelmed with order that will be couple of day at least before be ready then men must have two three day drill before start be still short of horse so will ride on see duncan want thirty five more a yet although subscription be coming in well be still good deal short of requirement however dare say will be able to make arrangement with duncan a will probably have enough to pay in full by end of week altogether suppose will be ready to start for ten day unless boer delay advance be afraid that will not get to dundee do not believe that will be able to hold town hardly think that there be chance of be sure made mistake in sending portion of force there know premier be most anxious that troop must be posted a far north a possible in order to save loyal farmer from plunder if position be stronger impossible to be turned case must be different be not strong can be turned on flank if boer march to attack general symons who be in command there may possibly beat off a can advance towards ladysmith either from free state on one side transvaal on other troop must be cut off loyal farmer must be plundered just a much a if symons have remained at ladysmith fancy military men think that grave mistake have be made that general white must not have exposed force to disaster besides position of ladysmith be more defensible than of dundee tugela must be natural line of defence even must be turned by troop from transvaal going through zululand line of river must be very difficult to defend by force of le than twenty thousand men however will see how thing work out how enterprising boer be how warmly free stater throw into work think that will have hard time captain brookfield yes think be certain even if cape colony keep quiet be very much afraid will not do if rise will take strength of england to put down well wish luck can assure feel proud of johannesburg section will be glad when join shook hand with whole of lad then rode off train start at eight o'clock chris said have better get good bye over to night

piece of bread occasional lump of sugar two kaffir have brought on pack horse four water skin couple of bucket in heat of day horse be allowed good drink while master whose haversack have be filled by friend enjoyed hearty meal washed down by tin mug full of champagne be in highest spirit although meal be taken under difficult circumstance for be seated on upper rail of truck there being room for to sit down among horse plate be packed up finger teeth served for knife fork be le important since chicken be staple of meal have be cut up before starting many be joke passed along line felt that be last experience be likely to have of civilized food that must be long while before champagne other wine must fall to lot kaffir who have charge of two spare horse enjoyed le for have fair share of provision of master be in high state of contentment with prospect there be halt of hour at ladysmith many of officer soldier gathered at station work for day finished arrival of train being always event of importance in little town be amused interested at party of young fellow who alighted to stretch leg get change of position be leader major asked field one talking to officer name be chris king be chosen because be oldest of have nothing to do with be within year of same age have be chum friend have hunted shot together be one elected a leader just a must choose captain of cricket club come from johannesburg find own horse arm outfit ask nothing from government a speak dutch know more le kaffir fancy can make good deal better scout than cavalry who ca ask question of boer get information from native major laughed saw that lad little resented joking tone in have asked question have doubt that be right said be quite sure must like dozen of a subaltern when did come from johannesburg left there about week ago a be only at maritzburg three day have not lost time indeed think be record performance of course be looking forward to first skirmish can assure be have first on way down here when be between newcastle frontier four five of went to farmhouse to try get food milk for woman child be boer place fellow came out with rifle warned off went forward took shot at king when be quite close to fortunately bullet only went through hat chris knocked down gave tremendous thrashing with own whip then took provision paid for searching house found twelve mauser rifle lot of ammunition took off without paying for boer have made off while be searching house twenty others pursued not dreaming that be now armed however gave volley emptied three saddle killed three four horse moved off without trying to make further acquaintance well done lad officer said warmly be excellent beginning have doubt that will follow up well similar conversation be going on along platform when at last lad again took place in truck hearty cheer be given sun be setting when arrived at dundee be larger place than ladysmith a there be coal mine in neighbourhood considerable number of men be employed in like ladysmith be situated on plain dominated by hill camp be little distance out of town officer be at station with party of men to receive store brought up by train chris at once went up to saluted have just arrived sir be section of maritzburg scout acting independently a be from johannesburg find own horse equipment food provide own ration of course serve without pay propose to scout on own account a speak dutch well think that may be useful in obtaining information will of course search country in direction may be considered most useful have doubt that will be of good service sir officer said suppose can camp anywhere like must think so a draw ration can matter little where post yourselves think that will be able to get tent to night will not want sir have large waterproof sheet intend to use a tentes d'abri suppose have better report at headquarters of general yes must be proper thing camp be mile half away if follow glencoe railway can not miss a soon a horse be detrained baggage packed little party mounted left station choosing piece of unoccupied ground few hundred yard away proceeded to unsaddle picket horse while chris rode away to camp accompanied by one of native to hold horse there have difficulty in finding dismounting walked to group of head quarter tent appearance excited good deal of amusement chaff from soldier passed looked indeed like young dutch farmer in rough clothes rifle bandolier of cartridge seeing young officer close to tent asked be that of adjutant general be there talking to general at door of tent do wish to speak to must be glad to do so chris replied officer walked across informed colonel chris wanted to speak to bring across mr williams general said be evidently young farmer possibly brings in news of enemy movement lieutenant returned to chris led up to general have news that wish to give sir sir penn symons said general hope to be able to do so to morrow then stated position nature of command be very well mounted sir went on a speak dutch hope to be useful at rate will be trouble to a draw ration pay think can pas anywhere a boer be why have not adopted uniform have doubt will be of service general said though hardly think that will pas a boer with cap have wide brimmed hat to use while be scouting general carry too so that on return towards line can be recognized even at distance a not being boer so avoid being fired at yes be very necessary precaution will have officer commanding cavalry artillery detachment warned that section of maritzburg volunteer be dressed a farmer may be known in distance by having cap similar to ordinary infantry field service cap well sir will be glad if will to morrow ride to south following river endeavour to find out whether boer have considerable force in direction either on side of river other may tell that five of natal police be captured on evening of th at de jagers drift boer have be in possession of newcastle for past three day be certainly crossing pass from free state must be very careful for have scouting party across river almost a far a tugela however hardly expect serious struggle for week ten day for account be to effect that boer be still very deficient in transport that for past week at laing nek other pass have be very much straitened for provision must be a well for while be at dundee to come over once day to report doings to receive order a to point where most need information have gone into lodging in town sir have waterproof sheet form tentes d'abri prefer being with horse be only bought few day ago so a will not have much opportunity of sleeping otherwise than in open for time thought a well to begin at once especially a weather look threatening horse being unaccustomed to be picketed might pull up peg get loose be there heavy rain seem to be well fitted for work to set about in right spirit have be accustomed to hunting expedition sir when have often be out for day so that understand how to shift for though be new to campaigning what rifle have doe not look like lee metford general be mauser captured twelve of at boer farmhouse three four mile side of newcastle six day ago fired at though bullet only went through hat thought justified in searching house illustration chris offer service to sir penn symons certainly be heard that there have be skirmish on road learned particular from one of who took part in who stayed here for two three day before going down country said that four five young gentleman who be coming down with party of woman child from volksrust have gone to farmhouse to try get food milk bread for female boer farmer insulted shot at one of when two three yard away have be tremendously thrashed by young fellow returned laden with good supply of milk bread twelve rifle lot of ammunition that have found at farm with of men have beaten off attack of score of boer without loss to yes general that be party have sent forward for waggon got into dundee two hour after skirmish a there be train just going went on at once reached maritzburg next morning where be joined by of party who have come down day before a have made plan before leaving johannesburg be able to start morning be third after arrival there be prompt indeed general said with smile must have needed money a well a brain have obtained leave of family general be well provided with fund to carry through campaign if last for year wanted to be in time for first fight think yours be first fight except that few shot be exchanged between scout boer on morning after ultimatum expired now sir if must at time be in want of necessary will be glad to supply can not furnish with ammunition a mauser carry smaller bullet than rifle thank general have enough to last for considerable time having brought up six thousand round good provision indeed general laughed enough to last through dozen pitched battle will be in town at six o'clock to morrow morning will be pleased to inspect little corp before start thank general will be very proud to be inspected by then saluting returned to horse rode back to dundee be pleased to see that eleven little tent have be erected strictly in line that horse be standing quietly at picket rope that two of troop be placed a sentry large fire be blazing in front of tent two native be squatting by kettle be swung over joint of meat be roasting there two three of lad be standing talking together rest have gone into town cairn came up to a dismounted have heard news chris have not heard particular news be at station quarter of hour ago telegram have just be received that boer be when be sent off entering elandslaagte station be in act of capturing passenger train be standing there message stopped abruptly a doubt boer entered room where clerk be at work at needle by jove be in luck chris said of course be train have to leave three hour after if have stopped for that horse rifle kit must have gone must now be prisoner be serious news though for be evident that not only be marching against in front on flank have cut communication with ladysmith there can be doubt that a everyone said there be mistake to send general symons forward here a be almost certain that with four regiment three battery of artillery regiment of cavalry few hundred of natal police volunteer must never maintain here why heard at ladysmith that column have gone out day before towards besters station a news have come in be even then in neighbourhood be false alarm be enough to show that boer be likely to be coming down cutting railway in rear general symons told that did not expect general advance of enemy just yet because heard that transport be incomplete that be very short of provision think want of transport must prevent advancing know well enough that boer think nothing of going out for three four day without prospect of getting more provision than carry about unless have luck to bring down antelope a utrecht vryheid newcastle be within few mile of free stater have already come down through of pass of drakensberg must be within easy ride of if be in force enough to drive out of place must know must find in clover for heard at ladysmith that there be provision store for two month collected here chapter iv dundee after picketing horse chris went into town found street full of excited people for news that railway have be cut be serious indeed scene reminded chris of have witnessed in street of johannesburg eight day before only eight day yet seemed to a if week have passed since then so much have be done so great have be change a at johannesburg considerable portion of population have left seeing that although troop might for time defend town boer be certain to cut line of railway work at coal mine have be pushed on feverishly of late for strangely enough there be store of coal in dundee at of station down to durban authority have only woke up few day before to fact that coal must be required in large quantity for transport on arrival of troop now be to come to stop hand must be thrown out of employment town must become stagnant until be captured by boer until army arrived of sufficient strength to clear natal of invader that evening many who possessed vehicle started by road for ladysmith feeling that in twenty four hour might be too late at seven o'clock a have be arranged when arrived member of band met at bivouac for supper there be general feeling of excitement among have known that hostility must soon begin to find that line have already be cut that enemy be closing in in direction came almost a surprise however in way prevented from enjoying meal after be over held at chris suggestion sort of council have already told what general have said to that be to be inspected in morning a saddlery be new there be nothing to be done in way of burnishing buckle rubbing up leather a chris remarked must be necessary be hour work in morning grooming horse now said that work be going to begin must draw up few rule for volunteer though be must have regulation in first place find that troop parade in order of battle before daybreak so a to be able to repel sudden attack move in direction may be required if be necessary for be still more necessary for think that must be standing rule that be ready to mount at daybreak sentry must be posted at night however safe may feel think there must be two relieved two hour there will be hardship in a must only go on duty other night in next place think there must be what call officer of day who must generally be in charge of arrangement see that kaffir attended to horse properly so on see will not be always acting together might sometimes be broken into four troop in case one in five must command think same lot must always keep together what do think must be better that in group of five one must be in charge day that group must choose one to act a non commissioned officer there be reply what do think chris sankey asked after pause be a well able to judge a be replied think that must perhaps be best way to write down twenty name put in hat draw one by one first five must be number one squad know whether be right word anyhow will do for next five number two so on then five can vote whether must prefer alternate command to choose one of number a permanent non commissioned officer if prefer must then ballot a to among will be leader if can think of way that must like better by mean say so all agreed that plan that proposed must be adopted four group be first chosen before proceeded to next step peter said of course be quite game to carry out a suggest chris think must be good plan to let final decision stand for week two taking leadership of group in rotation at end of time must be better able to make choice than can be now think be very good idea peter what do say will take turn alphabetically for present at end of fifteen day when of have led three time can decide whether squad will choose permanent leader go on a have begun at once agreed to proposal felt good friend a be that must be very difficult to decide now very well then will be so chris said to morrow will certainly do scouting in day two may be shut up here until get away there will be no scouting to be done must have signal suppose be scattered over two three mile may want to assemble must be able to signal thought of before started from home put down in pocket book sort of thing fancied must be wanted will read out to stirred fire into blaze then read one shot followed by third with ten second between will mean 'enemy seen on right with twenty second between 'enemy seen on left then after pause two shot in quick succession will mean 'enemy in strength ' three shot will be party only ' one shot followed at interval of ten second by two in succession will mean betire to point agreed on before separated ' followed by three shot in quick succession will be 'close in to centre can think of others afterwards think will do to begin with know that have pocketbook so take down signal at once ought to know where will be field said so that must rally round ready for next order might be so therefore have better fix on three shot in quick succession followed in ten second by fourth sound will be sufficient to let know pretty well where be will on hearing join at once be there other suggestion there be silence then book be closed can not too strongly impress upon chris said after have chatted for time necessity for being extremely cautious know how slim boer be how accustomed be to stalk game will have to be a watchful a deer more so in fact since have not power of smell when break up into four party party must scatter keeping three four hundred yard apart on arriving at swell crest of hill halt must be made foot of country searched by field glass matter how long take must assure that there be moving object in sight when get near point must dismount leaving horse crawl forward until reach point from where have good view on account stand up while be making observation boer who might be lying in sight must be certain to notice figure against skyline know that many of be provided with glass a good a own must be a careful a if be out after game instead of men know thing a well a do want to impress upon see have captured five of natal police who be very sharp set of fellow however few day scouting will show far better what be required than amount of thinking beforehand there be one thing want to say to elected for leader be quite probable that when have worked together for bit of may prove much better qualified for post than be what want to say now be if be case will feel in way aggrieved will serve just a cheerfully under order a hope will under mine so long a command there be general chorus of fear of chris know well enough to be sure that have made good choice knew before left johannesburg pluck in walking up to boer with loaded rifle clenched matter well will see chris said will do best a

that nothing more must be done to then be saddled valise with day provision spare blanket being strapped on then have wash made a far a possible tidy by time breakfast be ready have just finished meal when party of horseman be seen in distance rifle be slung over shoulder bandolier belt full of cartridge strapped on donned forage cap after coiling up picket rope halter fastening with valise to

horse of course gentleman must look better if be in uniform for purpose clothes have on be far more useful let see in hat can then better judge how must pas a boer lad slipped forage cap in pocket put on felt hat be of different shape colour a have agreed beforehand at once dropped upright position in have be sitting assumed careless slouching attitude of boer very good indeed general said with laugh a far a appearance go must pas anywhere only criticism can make be that boot look too new be fault will soon be mended few day knocking about especially a fancy be going to have bad weather will take shine out of once off take good care not to put on again boer with clean boot must be anomaly indeed now will detain no longer only manoeuvre boy have to learn be simple one of forming four have practised on foot performed manoeuvre with fair accuracy then chris gave word after saluting general led way off at trot be fine set of young fellow general said to two officer with be son of rich men have equipped entirely at own expense be admirably mounted provided be not caught in ambush be not likely to see inside of boer prison say good deal for zeal that be ready to disguise a boer farmer instead of going in for smart uniform however be right for speaking dutch a hear do must be able singly to mingle with boer gather valuable information a soon a be fairly south of town chris said now work begin number one squad will make way towards river follow course keeping always at distance from so that while must escape notice can ascertain whether body of enemy be side of within sight beyond other bank number four will take right flank keep sharp look out in direction squad two three will under command scout between flanking party examine farmhouse country generally whole will a said last night maintain distance of about three hundred yard apart man will a far a possible keep next to on hand in sight two flanking company starting off under chris separating a rode off until be a far apart a have ordered then moved forward when on level ground went fast broke into walk whenever came to foot of rising ground when near top halted dismounted crawled forward man carried union jack about size of handkerchief elastic ring being sewn to two of corner when necessary flag must be slipped over rifle signal must be passed from one to along whole line to halt by waving flag to advance by holding rifle steadily erect other signal be to be invented in future chris took place in centre of line in readiness to ride to flank from signal might be given for five six mile sign of enemy must be perceived most of field be entirely deserted round few of scattered farmhouse animal must be seen grazing chris set down a belonging to dutch farmer who have fear of interference by boer be prepared to join a soon a advanced many of indeed during past fortnight have trekked north be already in rank of enemy presently chris who be constantly using glass saw flutter of flag on hill away to left minute later signal to halt passed along line have be agreed that signalling by shot must not be attempted unless enemy seen be so far distant that must not be likely to hear what do see brown chris said a reached lad who have first signalled there be good many men animal round farmhouse about two mile away house lie under shoulder of hill to left suppose that be why others did not see dismounting chris crawled forward with other until must obtain view across country a brown have said farmhouse stood at foot of line of hill be crossing be fully mile nearer to on right flank than to point from be looking at from view bringing glass to bear upon must distinctly make out that forty fifty men be moving about that large quantity of cattle be collected near house be certainly raiding party said to companion be too strong for to attack openly at least if be boer must not do to lose number in first fight still may be able to frighten off save farmer who be certainly loyalist cattle gallop along line a far a extends order to come over to right will go on at once get view of ground close by by time have assembled can see what have best be done going back to horse started in opposite direction in few minute chris reached point believed to be nearly behind farmhouse picking up of scout by way expect will be back in about quarter of hour said a dismounted peter field may a well come with may want to send back order walked forward fast until so far down hill that must obtain view of farmhouse moment did so lay down made way across broken ground until be within quarter of mile of then seated among rock have look through glass must see everything be passing a clearly a if have be standing in farmyard be evident boer have only arrived there short time before brown noticed party of two three be still driving in cattle others be going in out of house returning with such article a fancied putting down by horse in readiness to carry off two men woman child be standing together in group be beyond doubt owner of farmhouse how many boer do make out have counted thirty eight peter have made out forty field forty three difference being accounted for by going in out of house shed well will say forty five then sha be far wrong certainly ca attack that number openly may drive off empty handed if take by surprise examined ground for minute two then said think might make way down among rock to within three hundred yard of house will send six more down to with others will go down farther to left work along in little donga running into flat hundred yard to east of house keep sharp look out in direction will be able to see while will be hidden from boer will halt about three hundred yard beyond house a soon a be ready will wave flag then party will open fire be sure hide yourselves well so that may not know how many of there be be certain at first alarm to run to horse ride off directly do so will open fire on finding taken in flank be likely to bolt without hesitation throw away shot if can help empty magazine a fast a can be sure of aim between ought to account for good many of understand chris will wait here till others join then a say will work down a far a can find cover chris at once returned to main party who have by time assembled can bring horse down good bit farther without being seen said there be dip farther on with rough brushwood have better fasten there have learned to stand pretty fairly might not do so if heard heavy firing leading own horse of field peter walked down to spot chris have chosen there threw rein over horse head a usual unfastened head rope tied to bush chris have already explained situation to troop have told off six of to go down to join peter now advanced cautiously with till must point out to exactly spot where two scout be lying then returned to others walked along fast until came upon break in hill lower down developed into depression be during rain water course down made way on reaching bottom found be twelve foot below level of surrounding ground couple of hundred yard further must tell by sound of shouting bellowing of cattle other noise that be abreast of farmhouse going three hundred yard halted chris went up bank until must obtain view saw that be just at spot have fixed on making sign to others took place a have directed ten yard apart then raised rifle after slipping little flag upon moment later came crack of rifle followed by other shot in quick succession chris with eye just above level of ground must see be passing round farmhouse with shout of alarm boer at once rushed towards horse several dropping before reached a rode out from yard magazine rifle kept up constant rattle sounding a if strong company of troop be at work chris waited until be nearly abreast of party then fired companion followed example in moment fire a rapid effective a still kept up from hill be maintained completed stampede of enemy be soon mile away even at distance mauser bullet continued to whistle over among continued flight until lost in distance chris whistle gave signal for ceasing fire two party sprang to foot gave three hearty cheer then ran towards farmhouse in yard lay five boer seven eight horse rider have jumped up behind companion for a passed chris have seen that several of animal be carrying double little group so lately prisoner advanced a came up almost bewildered at sudden transformation have taken place surprise being increased on seeing that have apparently be rescued by party of boer still more when on reaching found that be mere lad be party of maritzburg scout chris said with smile at astonished face though a see be got up a boer so a to be able to get close to without exciting suspicion be fortunate in just arriving in time thank indeed sir settler said for have saved loss of property for aught know from being carried off a prisoner be intending to trek down to ladysmith today have just driven in herd when boer arrived if have be content with stealing must have be away before arrived stopped to plunder everything must carry off a must say from noise that heard in house to smash up furniture must not carry off be indeed grateful to be very glad to have have chance of giving plunderer lesson chris said will make little cautious in future think that be wise to go at once for there be certainly party between elandslaagte where have cut line so must advise to travel west for bit before strike down to ladysmith have not heard of of being beyond line of railway yet now have work to do number one two squad will at once go up fetch down horse number three four will examine boer who have fallen here out on plain will bring in who may be only wounded went out with party found that eight more have fallen three of lay at short distance from farmhouse have evidently fallen under fire of party on hill others have be hit by in ambuscade altogether ten horse have be killed five of boer be still alive have spare cart chris asked farmer yes can spare one fortunately have small one besides two large waggon may ask what want for want to carry wounded men to within reach of friend be nearest drift vant drift be there doubt that party crossed be little more than two mile away then will place wounded in cart might send one of kaffir with to drift stick up pole with sheet on be sure to have halted on other side will guess that there be wounded in a soon a kaffir come within two three hundred yard of river can take horse out return dare say will be back again before be off cart be driven along line that boer have taken wounded being carefully lifted placed in a reached two more be found dead three wounded distance beyond spot where searcher have turned having fallen nearly mile from farm lad who accompanied cart then returned long before reached house horse have be brought down settler kaffir be hard at work loading store into two ox waggon lad lent assistance in le than hour settler started for ladysmith woman child in wagon men on horseback driving herd with aid of kaffir after hearty adieu chris party rode on together for little distance before again scattering widely to recommence work of scouting hitherto have be too busy for conversation now be able to give word to satisfaction felt at success have be splendid sankey said enthusiastically have defeated force twice a strong a ourselves have killed badly wounded eighteen of may be sure that of got away several must have be hit not one of have scratch splendid exclaimed must not have be better managed think ought to give three cheer for chris three rousing cheer be given after chris carmichael said think need talk more about resigning command general symons must not have done better think at rate have begun to wipe off old score chris said have paid for few of insult lady have to submit to a came along be heartily glad that be in time to do have baulked of haul expected to make saved something like thousand head of cattle for colony to say nothing of preventing people from being absolutely ruined be only pity that have not horse with if have not many of boer must have recrossed river must not have taken with without being detected before got into position in case might have have hard fight matter must probably have turned out altogether differently there be general expression of assent for felt that in equal fight boer being twice own number must have be more than match for be evening when returned to dundee having come across more boer during day work directly arrived at little camp where have left tent standing in charge of two kaffir chris wrote short report of doings stating briefly that have come upon party of forty five boer in act of driving off cattle sacking house of mr fraser loyal settler having dismounted divided into two party have attacked boer driven off with loss of ten killed eight seriously wounded left on field many of horse have be killed wounded boer have be sent in cart to vant drift farmer herd have be escorted a far a line of railway have crossed be making for ladysmith there have be no casualty among party field rode over with report delivered at headquarters remaining to ask whether there be order for next day when returned brought line from general contained only word congratulate most heartily affair must have be managed excellently doe greatest credit continue scouting on same line to morrow lad be highly delighted when chris read aloud then sat down to well earned meal be more enjoyed a have be voted field a one of finance committee must go into town buy dozen of champagne in honour of first victory in course of evening one of general staff rode into camp on way to town having be requested by to obtain full particular of fight at eraser farm took seat by fire with chris gave full account of proceeding upon word mr king said managed matter admirably cavalry leader must have done better there be particular credit about management chris said acted just a must have done have be stalking herd of deer instead of party of boer one always manages if possible to put party on line by be likely to take flight before crawling up within shot if must have taken horse down with before opened fire must have done so being so well mounted think few of must have got away must not manage without risking being seen in case boer on making out what strength be must certainly have shown fight even if have beaten suppose must have done must have suffered heavily be quite right not to risk officer said know by old experience that boer be formidable antagonist when behind shelter accustomed a be to shooting on horseback dare say will do well when not opposed by regular cavalry who be convinced must ride through through be quite sure that in open will not be able to make stand against infantry be more important a in so hilly country a natal cavalry must seldom be able to act with advantage in course of conversation told that there be news of large body of boer being near joubert force have not moved out of newcastle nothing have be heard of free stater of utrecht force under lucas meyer have sentry on lower hill round here glencoe there be fear of being surprised sooner come better for be longing to get at can tell felt quite jealous when heard of spirited affair to day can assure that will have greater respect for volunteer than have before if do a well a have done to day will be most valuable addition to force after visitor have left sat chatting round fire till ten o'clock then turned in chapter v first battle in little camp save two sentry slept soundly until at two in morning awoke with sudden start deep boom strange rushing sound be in ear with exclamation of surprise scrambled out of tent what be chris asked sentry be big gun on top of high hill call talana saw flash of light directly after heard report rushing sound suppose be shot overhead if have be shell must have heard burst seen flash must have be fired at camp horse startled by report be plunging kicking lad at once ran to head patted soothed not until be quiet did gather again what time be chris asked clock on church struck two few minute ago brown who be on sentry said a spoke gun boomed from talana a be generally called in town smith hill from farm owned by settler of name at foot be about mile half east of town therefore three mile from camp must be very heavy gun by sound a big a largest of have heard fired from fort above johannesburg joubert must have started from newcastle early to have managed to get up there by time may be force from utrecht anyhow must be strong to venture to attack in way may a well saddle up though be hardly likely cavalry will be engaged will not send to camp for order general will have enough to think about will make matter where twenty men place however will ride over to camp see what be going on there be likely enough that there will be attack by free stater on other side carmichael horrocks do run into town see what be going on there will not start till get back if of staff see may ask question about in quarter of hour two lad returned people there be completely scared at unexpected attack street be full of half dressed men however seemed to be getting over first terror now that found be camp not town be being fired at volunteer corp be already gathering in readiness for order may be pretty sure that nothing will be done till daylight chris said men know ground now none of transvaal boer can do so think will venture to move till can see way about be glad indeed that most of woman child be sent off two day ago that scare on evening that arrived when news came of railway being cut at elandslaagte sent greater part of men who have remained behind who did not mean fighting off by road if bombard town may do damage to property there will be no great loss of life have better give horse feed be if be disposed to eat at hour while be away on reaching camp chris found troop under arm have be roused before boer fire began a picket to east of dundee have be attacked driven in be not however supposed that boer be in force until gun opened fire light be out in camp enemy shot have gone wide be by mean clear why boer must have betrayed presence on top of hill until be light enough for to use gun with effect chris have before starting put on flat cap a approached camp be challenged by sentry who come there on replying officer of maritzburg scout sentry called out advance officer of maritz scout give countersign fortunately a happened officer have given to chris on visit to camp therefore answered at once ladysmith be relieved when sentry called out ladysmith pas be well when entered camp found men be standing in line at ease with rifle piled in front of there be hum of conversation in rank at head quarter tent everybody be astir presently officer came up who be asked a advanced be in command of party of maritzburg scout mr king be not officer asked yes sir have ridden in to ask if there be order there will be none issued until be daylight can make out how matter stand what be force of boer be not likely that will have special order can act with cavalry mounted infantry thank sir then will ride back at once on returning to camp said there be nothing to be done till morning so far have idea of force of boer be just work be formed for peter field horrocks certainly speak dutch better than of others be half past two now have at least two half hour of darkness therefore propose try to find out what force boer have got up there be use for more than four of to go so others can turn in except two sentry will of course be ready to mount in case party of boer must come down upon town before be light next time want three men on special duty will give others chance will ride chris think so of course will be more difficult getting up there in dark will make detour of three four mile come up on other side must be much more likely to be questioned if be on foot than on horseback must come upon party of armed boer remember have just arrived from standerton finding when got to newcastle that force have moved on be to take up station at talana hill rode on to overtake when get fairly there among will dismount field peter will stand by four horse horrocks will go on if hear row will mount wait minute two then if come will ride off with horse a well a own will try make way to edge of hill ought to be able to slip away in darkness if can get there before be shot down overtaken however think there be much chance of being recognized indeed expect most of will be lying down for sleep before time come for action if there be one thing boer hate be being kept awake at night will take one of kaffir boy with can see in dark great deal better than can a boer be sure to have native with be quite a likely to pick up news a be more so perhaps for native will sit talk night while master be snoring think one call jack be sharpest jack be called up on being told what be required at once agreed to accompany time be lost chris three companion mounted with kaffir running alongside set off at trot keeping to north of east rode on for two mile jack leading way with a much ease a if have be daylight when have a calculated come upon ground boer must have passed over turned south kept on until saw dark mass of talana on right made towards on side hill sloped gradually while on facing dundee be extremely steep strewn with boulder be now going at walk soon came upon immense gathering of waggon cart ox pony crowded without order just a have arrived two hour before there be fear of being detected chris said in whisper ca do better than stop here there be getting horse through crowd if did manage to do so there must be getting back certainly not in hurry have better lie down beside be not likely that boer will be coming up down if whole camp be like there be not slightest fear of getting caught jack have already be instructed that when got into camp be to leave join party of kaffir found awake talk to a if be one of bullock driver a chris companion returned former must blow whistle softly be then to make way down to horse at once passing on unquestioned neared top of hill having left mass of vehicle behind there be however large number of pony assembled here in readiness must master require hitherto have heard voice since entering camp a went farther heard talking here fighting men be assembled for most part be lying down be asleep others however be moving about joining leaving group gathered together discussing event of next day horrocks chris now separated joined different party twenty yard from other attracted attention appearance in broad hat rough clothing bandolier rifle be precisely similar to of men standing about doubt that morning must bring brilliant victory appeared to be entertained by enemy artillery must first crush of british then must charge down finish affair say that have le than four altogether one said be a many a everyone know one boer be match for three rooineks will not be fight will be slaughter will stop day to gather plunder send off in waggon then will go south destroy force at ladysmith three day later will be in maritzburg within three four day afterwards will drive british on board ship at durban will get grand plunder there at maritzburg think be time now to take hand at building up that wall along front ebers commando have be at for three hour be turn now illustration chris companion scouting there be general movement be accelerated by sharp order minute later horrocks chris again came together moved on with others three hundred yard farther came upon six gun beyond number of men be at work carrying placing great stone to form rough wall left off work a soon a party arrived having now seen be necessary two lad joined returned with down hill others threw down near horse chris companion went on through huge gathering of waggon made way with great difficulty chris giving low whistle occasionally at last be through camp jack be standing by horse peter field at once rose to foot without word mounted rode without speaking till be little distance from waggon be back earlier than expected field said have be gone scarcely hour no only difficulty have be making way through mass of waggon animal mixed up higgledy piggledy there have be no more excitement than if have be walking through dundee have got wanted to know strength be about four thousand have six gun be building stone wall along brow of hill be cock sure that be going to thrash without difficulty field peter laughed be fool to count chicken before be hatched latter said if think be going to be laing nek business will find mightily mistaken though will be very difficult business to scale hill from other side under rifle fire a will keep up jack have now taken place ahead of again kept there with ease although broke into canter a soon a reached level ground in hour reached camp now jack chris said when have dismounted have not heard what news have picked up not much news baa talk with kaffir hope that beat to day think can not do so too many boer big gun say boer very angry because other commando not here free state boer not arrived sure going to beat rooineks be afraid that may get away if joubert free stater here catch in trap kill such be substance of jack answer in own language by time rest of party have turned out to hear news have have little sleep for be intensely anxious a to fate of four comrade although delighted that have returned safely be little disappointed on finding that affair have be so tame unexciting while be talking two kaffir have stirred up fire put wood coal on hung up kettle be right jack chris said day will begin to break in hour may have to be moving be quiet until half past five lad have just finished meal when boer gun opened fire two three minute later of british replied be uncomfortable feeling sitting here with terrific roaring noise overhead chris said one know that there be not slightest risk of being hit to say least of be very unpleasant there shell have just burst over camp so be shell that be firing indeed boer have be using missile only owing to fault in loading badness of fuse fell for most part without bursting be soon evident to lad that range of british gun be shorter than of heavier piece from talana distance be five thousand yard elevated position of boer gun added to advantage given by superior weight will ride in now chris said a got up from breakfast tell staff what have gathered a to boer strength have on way down hill exchanged hat for forage cap taking horrocks with galloped to camp sir penn symons be standing on small elevation watching fire chris rode up saluted have order for mr king except when fighting be over will join cavalry in pursuit thank sir have not come for order to report to that with mr horrocks two others one of kaffir servant entered boer camp last night in order to ascertain strength did general exclaimed in surprise hear that gentleman said turning round to three four of staff standing short distance behind mr king three of party absolutely entered boer camp last night to discover force well sir what be result there be about four thousand of sir over rather than under have six gun of heavy calibre when be there be at work building thick wall five foot high of rough stone along edge of hill will scarcely shelter gun will provide cover for rifleman at edge of hill there be immense gathering of waggon cart there be certainly not le than thousand of in confused mass behind hill arriving in dark seems to have gone on until must get farther fighting men be on top of hill between waggon be pony certainly must not ride away till waggon have be passed through possibly passage may have be left on side of for to get through in order a be intention to charge army when gun have silenced artillery gathered that expected commando have not come up be disappointed at hearing nothing of free stater who expected must have attacked glencoe from other side be absolutely confident of success expect to overwhelm general white at ladysmith in three day from now to be in pietermaritzburg in week be talking of driving last rooinek on board ship at durban shortly after general smiled be much obliged to for information mr king be much pleased at courage with companion entered boer camp to obtain be satisfactory to learn that force be not much greater than own be also useful to know pony be gathered so close to for shell go over hill may burst among believe that one of boer most vulnerable point be horse for without must feel absolutely lost be sure mr king that must wish to be in thick of fighting must rather that curbed impetuosity for after manner in obtained news for can see that party will do far greater service in scouting in gaining intelligence than must afford in action must advise to shift camp a troop be about to advance into town enemy shot will soon be falling there few minute later two field battery moved forward took up position south of dundee escorted by mounted infantry rifle third battalion of lancashire regiment remained to protect camp must be attacked by free stater while dublin fusilier royal irish fusilier be to march through town to donga river bed mile to east beyond long ascent to talana begin king royal rifle be to take up position under cover to east of town chris have ridden back fast to dundee work of taking down tent packing material store on to spare horse took few minute two of lad went with two native saw horse safely placed in sharp depression mile away in must be safe from boer shell chris have told companion what general have said looked disappointed will have plenty of opportunity afterwards be compliment that considers have better reserve for scouting after be work always intended to carry out still though after what have said can not absolutely join cavalry will manage somehow to see of fighting without getting into thick of besides must say that in case whole brunt of affair must fall upon infantry artillery if silence boer gun capture hill battle be won cavalry will have to wait for chance till can get boer to fight on ground where can act drizzling rain have now set in fact that have started without breakfast in way abated spirit of troop who soon came along marching with light step eager face showed that be delighted at prospect of action battery to right have already come into play vigorous cannonade be being directed at crest of hill from boer gun kept up slower though steady fire in return while nothing else be doing may just a well ride over see how thing be getting on there chris said a soon a two irish regiment have passed little troop trotted across to rising ground dismounted few hundred yard from gun soon saw with satisfaction that fire of boer be far from effective aim be not good very small proportion of shell burst while on other hand shrapnel from british battery burst with splendid accuracy over crest of hill for two hour artillery duel continued then boer gun gradually ceased fire mist have partly shrouded summit of talana eight hundred foot above plain smoke still hung thickly there rendered impossible to say whether have be put out of action simply withdrawn when cleared off must no longer be seen be now turn of infantry beyond donga in be lying rise of ground be gradual up to plantation surrounded smith farm beyond ground be rocky men advanced at double in open order moment be seen by boer continuous fire of musketry be opened distance be about mile mauser rifle have much greater range than bullet pattered thickly on ground only four men however fell two regiment halted in plantation farm building advanced line at edge of tree opened fire in answer to to be exposed general at first have taken up position with gun a soon a men advanced from donga joined accompanied a far a plantation then returned to battery continued fire with greater activity to prepare way for further advance of infantry rifle have joined two irish regiment at half past nine general symons galloped up to farm gave order for advance be received with cheer by men who have be impatiently awaiting scarcely have cheer died away when general be mortally wounded by bullet struck in stomach unconscious that wound be so severe retained seat minute two be then carried by indian bearer company into town troop ignorant of misfortune have befallen be now working way up hill taking advantage of stone boulder although exposed to terrific fire gradually pushing on until reached stone wall ran round face of hill beyond ground be much rougher very much steeper so steep indeed that be almost impossible to climb fire of enemy be now terrific troop be three hundred yard from crest be certain death to show head above wall officer placed helmet on end of sword moment raised be riddled by five ball for time be impossible to advance farther when boer fire moderated little order ran along line for men to storm position signal be made to artillery to cease fire a did so men leapt over wall rushed forward there be now thought of taking shelter returning boer fire effort be needed for surmounting difficulty in way in place rock be so steep that men have to climb on hand knee sometimes below pushed comrade up be in turn assisted by to climb roar of musketry be unceasing seemed to be impossibility for man to reach top unscathed yet there be hesitation wavering number fell panting determined rest pressed on rifle suffered most heavily out of seventeen officer who advanced with five be killed seven wounded at last steepest part of ascent be surmounted who first reached point waited until joined by others then fixing bayonet rushed up slope to edge of plateau cheering loudly boer did not await onset great body have already fled have believed impossible for mortal men to scale hill under continuous fire steady advance through hail of bullet have astounded shaken courage artillery after ceasing fire have galloped off at full speed taken up position on ridge known a smith nek overlooking plain behind hill for distance of three mile be covered with waggon galloping men gun be about to open fire upon when white flag be hoisted believing that boer have surrendered gunner abstained from firing be however first of numerous similar act of treachery boer be thus enabled to make escape appearance of plateau gained by troop be appalling five hundred of boer lay dead wounded many have doubtless be carried off three of gun lay dismounted others have be removed for a must not be sufficiently depressed to bear upon stormers have be taken off a soon a advance began in earnest beyond plateau smashed waggon dead animal lay thickly great number of boer pony have be killed many be still standing quietly waiting for master lying dead above pursuit be out of question men be exhausted by effort be wet to skin by rain have for nine hour come down unceasingly have have food since previous day tremendous climb have taxed power to utmost for time cheered vociferously first joy of victory overcoming thought of dead wounded comrade who have to be collected carried down loss have be severe ten officer thirty men have be killed twenty officer hundred sixty five men wounded nine officer two hundred eleven men did not answer to roll call loss be unaccountable chris a soon a infantry advance began have after talking with others agreed to set out in direction in three squadron of cavalry have started in morning with instruction to work round be prepared to cut off enemy retreat have with of mounted infantry machine gun a whole boer force must be concentrated on hill chris thought that there must be no danger in riding round especially a even have boer posted force to protect line of retreat be confident that speed of horse must prevent chance of capture from native learned direction that cavalry have taken presently on rising ground saw two party halted in hollow two mile apart farthest out on plain appeared to be largest to rode officer in command have seen in camp a saluted on riding up said so have come to lend hand sir can tell how matter be going on at dundee at time rode off sir advance of infantry have just begun boer gun have be silenced men be advancing from smith farm under very heavy fire of enemy continued without intermission a long a be within hearing distance did see other squadron a came along be in hollow two mile away ah be where left trooper be dismounted scout followed example boom of british gun be continuing unabated can be getting on slowly officer said be afraid will find very tough job suppose there be strong force up there over four thousand how do know be up there last night chris said with three of others did not go up in cap a may suppose in wide brimmed hat be able to get about without exciting suspicion found have six gun over four thousand men a speak dutch fluently there be really chance of being detected other officer of squadron have gathered round danger danger be very plucky action leader said suppose be news brought in just before troop marched off well wish that have got breakfast horse feed before started be more important for horse than be for though must not be sorry for breakfast have food in haversack sir breakfasted before started filled haversack with biscuit thinking that perhaps must be welcome for knew that none of troop have anything to eat before leaving be very good to offer colonel said must not eat while men have nothing will go round sir though will be small portion for put about ten pound of biscuit in haversack will not be sorry to get rid of weight will make something like three quarter of pound per man round more than that officer said be indeed greatly obliged to haversack be emptied divided into four heap of equal size with proportionate heap for ten officer four men be called up from troop in short time soldier be munching biscuit man dividing ration with horse sight of rough looking troop have at first excited amusement little derision among soldier feeling be now exchanged for gratitude be unanimously agreed that young farmer be capital set of fellow hour passed slowly until officer through glass saw great movement in encampment on hill waggon standing lowest separated from others gradually general movement set in men must be gaining ground colonel said boer be beginning to funk bit be put into horse mouth again saddle buckled up tightly expression of satisfaction succeeded that of disgust at long hour standing in pouring rain presently when leading waggon be abreast of at distance of about mile order be given to mount two squadron dashed across plain be soon among fugitive there be many mounted men among being first to steal away from fight opened fire a cavalry approached be soon overthrown driven away in headlong flight many of waggon be seized moment defender became stronger boer be now flocking down in great number seeing team property in danger dismounted formed of waggon up in square from opened heavy fire upon trooper chris dismounted party returned fire officer in command seeing that with so small force of infantry must hing that number of enemy be increasing drew off must have continued fight supposed that artillery must soon be at work knew must not open fire a long a be engaging boer therefore retired with long train of captured waggon late in afternoon reached camp nothing be seen of other squadron mounted infantry be news received of until following day when medical officer with wounded men came in like larger force too have ridden in among waggon have taken more northerly line have come on point where boer be thickest have charged taken several prisoner inflicted severe loss on enemy however have swarmed round keeping up incessant fire barring retreat took up defensive position in farm for three hour repelled attack of boer until horse be killed have broken away ammunition exhausted while boer have just

camp with spare horse a soon a hill be carried have fire lighted by time party came in in spite of having worn blanket a cloak be wet through after changing clothes went into town to gather news of how hill have be won by time returned meal be ready what do think of affair chris think that officer at ladysmith be right that be frightful mistake to divide force send four thousand men up here have thrashed boer today may be back again on top of hill tomorrow besides know that joubert force be not engaged to day free stater will be gathering round might win victory be certain to be obliged to fall back soon opinion be that will be very lucky if get through safely why not start to morrow morning chris peter said will be of use scouting here not much use if there be hard fighting hear that native have brought in news that there be firing to day at elandslaagte if be case must have troop there chance be that will be there to morrow yes be very likely chris agreed general white will be sure to hold line there if can for must feel sure that force here will have to retreat now that be attacked in earnest when be talking to day to cavalry one of officer mentioned that have still telegraphic communication with ladysmith for although wire by railway be cut be possible to communicate through boer seem to have forgotten that for be quite out of direct line nearly double a far round well a have order to come here suppose there be occasion to get order to go back think peter proposal be very good one on point like everyone ought to give opinion view be that might be great deal more useful there than here that if stop will run great chance of being captured think that must be fair thing to put to vote took two three leaf out of pocket book tore up into narrow slip of paper now said write 'yes if be in favour of going back 'no if be for stopping here drop into cap majority will decide when strip of paper be examined be found that only two out of twenty one be in

church town hall have be turned into hospital there be good deal of anxiety at officer said general opinion be that with boer closing in round position be very serious one be afraid so sir there be nothing to prevent boer from returning to position on talana hill to day soon after left town morning heard sound of gun away on right supposed that free stater have approached glencoe a mounted men be of very little use there party be too small to be able to do good thought must be best to come back here especially a there be native report that there be firing in direction yes party of cavalry under french came up with battery of field artillery there be little skirmishing in evening boer be strongly reinforced cavalry returned to ladysmith be only reconnaissance to ascertain general

well mounted uncommonly well brookfield subscription must have come in handsomely for to be able to buy such horse a provide own mount equipment chris said consider very lucky in getting hold of batch

satisfaction at news have chance of paying off old score on right person now chris said do hope that fellow who insulted when be coming down be here that will manage to get among for time however wish be not gratified boer now seeing that have small force opposed to steadied opened fire with gun maxim rifle from crest of hill while swarm of horseman dismounted men poured out to threaten flank of british odds be too great comparatively heavy gun of enemy be well aimed served quite overpowered fire of light cannon of field mountain battery order be given to fall back be done in good order though troop be harassed by hot fire from enemy concealed in gully on reaching high ground near modder spruit country be more in favour of british who be now extended on flank boer be unable unwilling to move heavy gun from position on hill being now beyond range exposed to fire of four battery a well a infantry pressing forward fell back general french have brought out signalling apparatus with telegraph wire be tapped message sent to general white asking for reinforcement in order to carry boer position fight now ceased for time party of boer occasionally crept forward opened fire colonial

colonial devonshire regiment gordon highlander infantry being brought up by train be under command of colonel ian hamilton who have thorough knowledge of boer tactic knew how to handle troop be well that be so for led by le experienced commander must have suffered terribly in advance while infantry detrained colonial followed by th lancer rode towards low hill whence party of boer have maintained

from lower ridge at half past three boer artillery joined deeper roar to rattle of musketry sharp crack of british gun although be still early light be indistinct for heavy thunder storm have be for time brewing burst before heat of action really began darkness be in favour of advancing infantry who in khaki uniform be almost invisible to boer troop be now in extended open order advanced towards foot of hill by rush taking advantage of ant hill that studded plain afforded excellent cover being high enough to cover while lying down thick compact enough to resist passage of mauser bullet highlander be suffering most heavily dark kilt showing up strongly against light sandy soil while devon manchester sustained few casualty be dropping fast manchester be somewhat in advance of devon who be guarding flank be threatened by large number of boer gathered on ridge on side storm be now at height thunder for time deadening roar of battle through driving rain infantry pressed on until reached foot of boer hill large number of enemy be on slope hidden from sight by boulder must not long maintain position for british marksman shot a straight a boer battery have almost silenced of enemy scattered shrapnel among higher up hill a boer rose to fly before bayonet of cheering troop be swept away by volley of lee metfords so with short pause when shelter be obtainable troop bore upwards cheering even joking until reached last shoulder of hill boer made short plucky struggle number pushing up from behind to help comrade nothing must check impetuosity of troop magazine of rifle be now for first time set in action boer force withered away under terrible storm of shot men of imperial light horse who have dismounted joined in advance be fighting side by side with highlander manchester pace be now increased to run shouting cheering men went forward with levelled bayonet many of boer lying behind rock maintained fire until troop be within two yard of then rising called for quarter men furious at seeing comrade shot down when hope of resistance be over must have spared none have not officer with greatest difficulty restrained from bayoneting boer many of be in fact killed a troop now joined by devon be rushing down upon camp boer raised white flag bugle sounded cease firing men halted for moment then be advancing quietly when tremendous fire broke out from boer who be scattered over ridge of hillside slope leading to summit hitherto british loss have be wonderfully small considering storm of bullet through have passed number now dropped taken wholly by surprise troop ran up hill again not for long halting when reached crest furious at treachery have be practised with such success upon turned again rushed down hill scattering boer who still clung to shelter with fire be just six o'clock when devon carried last defence of boer then with manchester swept down into camp be now turn of cavalry have in darkness moved forward unnoticed lancer dragoon with few of colonial among whom be maritzburg scout fell upon flying boer cut up with great slaughter although be now quite dark followed for upwards of two mile then returned to camp loss be heavy

captured two hundred prisoner be brought in by cavalry night be dreadful one rain still continued to come down cold be bitter be next to impossible to find still le to bring down wounded nevertheless soldier carried on work during greater part of night boer waggon be turned for time into hospital tent here by light of lantern surgeon laboured unweariedly in giving what aid be possible to brought in whether boer briton chris band worked a hard a rest carried down great number of wounded in spite of exertion of troop many remained on hillside night suffering from wound being a nothing to caused by wet cold lad flask be of great use now enabled many man too badly wounded to be carried down rough hillside to hold on till morning general white have arrived from ladysmith while battle be going on left command in hand of general french on following morning order came for general french to retire a strong party of enemy have be seen further south be hourly becoming more more evident that must be impossible to hold country beyond ladysmith many be of opinion that even position be too far advanced splendid valour shown by soldier at dundee elandslaagte heavy loss suffered have be practically thrown away coal field of northern natal have be lost loyal settler have be plundered ruined colonel yule force be in imminent peril have be obtained be temporary possession of two height of have to be relinquished on following morning beyond showing boer how enormously have underrated fighting power of british troop advantage have be gained by advance beyond ladysmith three of johannesburg scout have be wounded in charge among boer none of injury be severe being merely flesh wound of be hardly conscious during fighting must not be likely to keep long from saddle none of applied for medical assistance a surgeon be so fully occupied with serious case comrade bound up wound placed in most sheltered position must find five of comrade remaining in charge of horse there being possibility of finding two kaffir spare animal in confusion darkness have have one lesson chris said a at seven in morning party assembled worn out by long night work be that blanket be well enough against passing shower that when there be probability of wet must carry waterproof sheet with of course must have be good last night on occasion when there be need for to be using hand will be immense comfort must have be wet through before lay down chris yes must not have kept dry must have gone long way towards keeping warm must be like putting oilskin over wet lint must have felt a if be in hot poultice in short time even while riding must have be very comfortable if have worn a did blanket with hole in middle to put head through must spoil for tent carmichael said well must have flap sewn so a to cover hole blanket be very useful last night horrocks remarked know how must have got many of poor fellow down hill if have not carried in blanket be infinitely easier for great deal easier for saw lot of soldier using theirs in same way be sure will be able to sit horse down to ladysmith chris asked brown capper harris three wounded laughed one must think that be baby chris harris said must ride to maritzburg if necessary though feel arm rather stiff doubt will be stiffer still to morrow felt bit miserable at sunrise after lying there shivering envied fellow who must keep yourselves warm by working be beginning to thaw out now sight of kaffir coming towards with horse hour ago thought of hot coffee did even more than sun to warm will be ready soon willesden who be specially in charge of store said be capital idea bringing that large spirit stove paraffin with even native must not find dry stick morning except a soldier have done chris said pointing to where quarter of mile from spot where have gathered dozen fire be blazing soldier having utilized of boer waggon have be smashed by shell for purpose of firewood yes if be by chris there must be broken waggon besides after must not care to go down scramble with soldier for place to put kettle on at rate stove will be invaluable out on veldt agree with willesden peter said be because be one who suggested that promoted to office of superintendent of kitchen be comfort too that have clear water instead of having to get from one of muddy stream storm have done good anyhow for if have not be for there must have be breakfast for troop until have moved to river in twenty minute be drinking hot coffee munching biscuit at ten o'clock bugle sounded assembly troop formed up wounded be placed in ambulance waggon carried on stretcher returned to elandslaagte station here wounded be sent on by train while infantry cavalry returned by road talking to of officer of imperial horse several of whom be friend of father have only left johannesburg short time before declaration of war chris learned that principal object in fighting battle be to drive boer off line by dundee force must retreat for colonel yule in telegraphic despatch have stated that although victory have be won felt that position be untenable that might at moment be forced to evacuate also learned that safety of line beyond ladysmith be already threatened whether sir george white must decide upon falling back towards pietermaritzburg must hold ladysmith one knew certainly nothing must be determined upon until general yule rejoined with division from dundee position there be indeed growing worse hour while battle of elandslaagte be being fought boer have opened fire from hill above glencoe on british camp have compelled to shift position next day be again obliged to move by artillery on impati mountain be then that general yule decided to retire at once on ladysmith cavalry reconnaissance be sent out found that boer be in great strength in pas of glencoe be therefore determined to move by roundabout way through helpmakaar store of ammunition have be left under guard in other camp be fetched with full pouch little army started on long perilous march at nine o'clock on evening of nd camp be abandoned a stood wounded remained with surgeon under protection of red cross flag available transport accompanied column men kit other encumbrance be left behind be obliged to pas through dundee to get upon southern road so quietly be movement effected that few of townsman knew what be happening column be led by colonel dartnel chief of natal police whose knowledge of district be invaluable to troop road be heavy rain continued to pour down in torrent man carried three day provision tramped along silently through night stoppage by swollen stream be frequent by daybreak next morning have only accomplished nine mile of journey early in morning townspeople have woke up to fact that army have gone there be general exodus of who must obtain conveyance boer remained for time in ignorance that force whose capture destruction have regarded a certain have slipped away saw tent fact that men horse be visible puzzled be eleven o'clock before of more venturesome galloping down found that english force have escaped then from side poured into town have at once pursued might still have overtaken retreating force before immediately set to work to loot great store of provision left behind to gather picking from deserted house of dundee so let slip opportunity pursuit be attempted for four day column continued march resting for few hour day usually marching night road be terribly bad leading through narrow mountain pass have small force of enemy held waschbrank gorge where side be for three mile nearly perpendicular terrible calamity might have taken place happily however boer be in absolute ignorance of road british troop be following concluded that must have somewhere crossed railway be making way down by road to west that have gone through helpmakaar doe not appear to have occurred to for after marching thirty mile to town column be a far off ladysmith a when started anxiety at latter town be intense line being still uncut arrival of column at helpmakaar be known beyond communication must be received on tuesday th colonel dartnel arrived in ladysmith with news that column be now twenty mile away well at once returned to with supply small relief force on wednesday many of men came in on thursday remainder arrived be heartily greeted on th in order to divert attention of joubert free state boer of whom be converging upon general yule column still making way through pass force composed of three regiment of cavalry four of colonial mounted infantry three battery four infantry regiment went out enemy be found near reitfontein actual engagement took place for hour artillery rifle duel be maintained boer fell back number of casualty be not large be principally among gloucester regiment who on entering valley supposed to be untenanted be received by heavy fire from strong party of enemy hidden there fight however fulfilled object for advance be undertaken that of occupying boer attention enabling column from dundee to make way into ladysmith unmolested boer be now closing in on latter town from direction preparation for defence at once began town hall school be fitted up a hospital everything arranged for reception of wounded a boer have already be seen near colenso sixteen mile to south be certain that communication must ere long be cut more unsuitable place for military camp must well have be selected than ladysmith have indeed be chosen year before war be thought of on account of position on railway vicinity of klip river fact that country immediately round be fertile forage be obtainable doubt influenced military authority in selection lying in heart of mountainous country be commanded by steep rocky hill at distance of from two to four mile just a many castle built in day before firearm be in use be rendered untenable against even clumsy cannon of early day placed on eminence near so improvement in artillery possession of powerful modern gun by boer have gravely imperilled position of ladysmith military authority must never have anticipated that town must be besieged by foe armed with artillery must carry over five mile such be case now there felt a soon a be decided to defend place till last that position be precarious one fortunately considerable store of provision have be collected so long a line be open addition be being sent up by train line be single one winding along through pass among hill therefore open to attack by small body of enemy in point of size ladysmith be third largest town in natal durban boasted population of thirty thousand pietermaritzburg of twenty thousand ladysmith of four thousand five hundred being four hundred larger than of dundee be point at line of railway forked one branch running north through glencoe to transvaal other northwest through van reenen pas to bloemfontein be pretty straggling town with barrack government building large store almost house be detached standing in own garden a be largely wooded appearance be very picturesque with klip river branch of tugela running through house be for most part one storied roof be painted white for sake of coolness perfectly open town have ever before undergone siege by army of thirty thousand men provided with excellent gun yet garrison awaited result with perfect confidence chapter vii ladysmith besieged on th boer being now in force on many of hill around town having inflicted first annoyance upon ladysmith by cutting conduit brought down water supply to town from reservoir among hill so forced for future to depend upon few well muddy water of river be determined to make effort to drive back to gain possession of of hill from be now evident town must stand risk of being bombarded hitherto there have be considerable apathy in taking measure for keeping enemy a far a possible out of range few redoubt thrown up during last week strongly held must have be invaluable seemed to be considered by military authority that siege must be short one that boer must speedily be driven off by troop now pouring into durban effort be now to be made to repair consequence of remissness to drive boer off position occupied be hoped that if heavy blow be dealt must draw off altogether force of joubert meyer free stater be now all within distance of few mile be to be beaten up central position be on hill afterwards known a signal hill on have already planted forty pounder gun force composed of six company of royal irish fusilier four half of gloucester mountain battery troop of hussar started at midnight towards hill known a nicholson nek occupied by free stater major general hunter with brigade of infantry three battery small cavalry force be to attack meyer commando to east while general white with two infantry brigade french cavalry six battery of field artillery moved against joubert force on modder spruit be hoped that boer if defeated must find retreat barred by force have stated early for nicholson nek be well away from town before daylight broke at five o'clock in morning gun spoke out be at once answered by boer artillery roar of fire soon became general general white central column be screened by ridge near railway big gun on signal hill directed fire partly against town partly against cavalry must be seen by in rear of column a only few of volunteer horse have be ordered to accompany attacking force chris companion took up position on eminence afforded general view of battle here large number of townspeople also gathered general plan of operation be that two movable column must form rough arc of circle driving in flank of boer sweep whole force before have great many gun peter said a rattle of machine gun thud of quick firing one pounder joined continuous fire of several boer battery deeper roar of big gun seem to be in greater force than be supposed for can make out large reinforcement coming up to from behind artillery be first placed about four thousand yard from boer position a be on higher ground than occupied by gun fire did not appear to be effective be therefore moved forward distance supported by two battalion of rifle dublin fusilier infantry force with pushed forward rapidly gained crest from threatened to take boer position on signal hill in rear boer very strongly reinforced moved to meet heavy fighting took place until enemy force became so strong that not only checked further advance of brigade threatened on flank two battery went to assistance even with aid must not continue advance pressed a be by greatly superior number harassed by fire of boer field battery on hill at other point advance be opposed a hotly nowhere be infantry gaining ground enemy have not wasted time have thrown up intrenchment on steep hill occupied from shelter maintained terrible fire while numerous machine gun swept ground with hail of bullet shell on such ground cavalry be useless range of boer gun be much greater than of own seems to chris said that instead of gaining ground be losing ca see at what be going on certainly firing seems nearer than be have thought same though none have cared to suggest thing hurrah there be train coming in field said heard be expecting party of sailor with naval gun must be useful just at present moment let go down see can make out nothing from here glad to be doing something went down hill a reached station saw large detachment of sailor at work detraining twelve pounder two large quick firing gun team of ox be brought up sailor harnessed to rope with tremendous exertion one of gun be taken up to eminence at eleven opened fire be just in time in steady order column be retiring with face towards boer answering shot for shot carrying off wounded a dropped in spite of terrible rifle fire roar of boer battery a soon a first naval gun opened fire amid cheer of townspeople situation be changed first two shell burst close to boer big gun third in midst of artilleryman be time before fire be resumed in meantime sailor have turned attention to other boer battery field artillery have scarcely be able to reach one by one be withdrawn over crest at one o'clock colonel hamilton brigade have hitherto be lying behind crest first occupied in readiness to repel counter attack boer might make now moved out took up position to cover retirement of hunter column howard brigade although boer pressed hotly upon held ground steadily until comrade have reached camp then marched in unhindered by enemy whose big cannon have now be finally silenced by naval gun battery for most part obliged to retire after seeing naval gun open fire chris have gone down to speak to captain brookfield when met two soldier of mountain battery carrying injured comrade took into hospital then came out shoulder strap showed to belong to mountain battery have gone out with royal irish fusilier gloucester of whom nothing have be heard though occasionally in momentary interval of fire sound of distant musketry must be made out in direction of nicholson nek how be party getting on asked know anything about sir one of men said except that have be heavily engaged since daylight be afraid that be in tight place how be know nothing about have be bad job altogether man said be marching up steep valley with only room for to lead two mule abreast be in rear of column suddenly boulder came rolling down hill shot be fired in moment mule stampeded one two began kicking plunging squealing like wild beast then others set to there be holding be almost pitch dark before one must say be tearing down road have come up there be time to stop who be lucky jumped out of way who be not be knocked down trampled on a soon a have gone of who be not hurt set off after looked for everywhere only two three be caught where rest went know hope that got into enemy line of fire be shot at last gave up a bad job went back to bring in fellow who be hurt think most of be in now have be long time for thompson leg be broken one of arm expect most of rib hurt so to be moved that have have to stop two yard be bad business indeed chris said of course gun be lost one of what be worse reserve small arm ammunition be lost too mule carrying be with ours a fighting up there have be going on ever since be afraid infantry must have pretty well used up last cartridge be not until next day that extent of calamity be known when boer came down with white flag asking that doctor might be sent up little column instead of a have be hoped surprising boer have be ambushed being suddenly attacked by two strong party of enemy at once seized little eminence threw up breastwork of stone defended successfully until ammunition be entirely exhausted hundred fifty have be killed wounded boer have by taking advantage of bit of cover crept up close to murderous fire be poured in two regiment asked colonel carleton who commanded to allow to charge with bayonet cut way through consented to allow desperate attempt to be made men be in act of fixing bayonet when someone raised white flag boer standing up advanced to receive surrender after law of war permitted further defence men half mad with fury at situation in be placed threw down rifle be made prisoner be at two o'clock in afternoon after rest of force have returned to ladysmith thus nine hundred men fell into hand of boer apart from loss be comparatively small considering heat of engagement day work have be altogether unsatisfactory advantage have be gained beyond discovery of boer position unexpected strength fighting power be evident that force at ladysmith be unable to drive off enemy unaided must undergo siege until arrival of relieving army there be provision calculated to last for two month one doubted that long before time general buller must arrive to rescue so confident have military authority be that not only have defensive work be thrown up have omitted to send woman child men unfitted to give active assistance to rear on following morning scout held council of war now chris said have to decide important question be quite certain that town be going to be besieged must say that siege will last for time a nothing can be done to relieve until lot of troop arrive from home have shown at dundee elandslaagte that fellow can drive boer from kopje force arriving to relieve ladysmith must have to fight way through tremendously mountainous district to capture at least eight ten such position at dundee elandslaagte boer have only few gun big one from pretoria have not arrived have time to fortify be certain therefore that will require very big force to fight way in here especially a tugela have to be crossed boer will of course destroy bridge may be couple of month before place be relieved of course question be will stay here go think must be of much use here indeed see that cavalry must be good at whereas if portion of boer push south may be very useful in own line of scouting still be question for to decide chose to make commander when at work must have equal voice in matter of sort there be little discussion be of leader opinion that be best for to leave prospect of long siege in must take little active part be not pleasant one be decided at once that must leave very well chris said then will go in to captain brookfield ask permission to go now that be in camp with must be consulted have since elandslaagte taken place a part of maritzburg scout have be drilled for hour day be already favourite among corp who be proud of work have done being pleasant set of lad uncouth appearance have at first be viewed with much disfavour by many of comrade have be forgiven chris went to commander tent laid matter decision before think that be just a well that must go chris officer said indeed be on point of telling that be leaving for can not understand why cavalry must be kept here indeed know that be opinion also that have asked general to let leave however have decided to keep be sure be mistake before siege be over forage be sure to run short cavalry will be dismounted before end come however have seen pointed out that a scout must be useless here have given leave to go have requested to join first troop that come up line when be once away will give leave to act altogether independently of will be sure suit better than being kept for week perhaps at colenso estcourt thing will do general yule be speaking to only yesterday of manner in party defeated cut up more than double number how three of party went into boer camp at talana ascertained strength for general symons expect that general buller will come on here a be certainly most serious point at present will ask yule to give letter of introduction to will be useful have doubt that will give free hand a have done must not call upon general buller in rig out if be have heard be somewhat of martinet at war office know that have very poor opinion of volunteer there chris smiled volunteer have done good service at cape before now sir have shown over over again that man can fight just a well in plain clothes a if be buttoned up to chin in uniform a boer be nothing volunteer must think that before war be over war office will see mistake must think so indeed chris at present have certainly not woke up to fact see by telegram that london scottish london irish have volunteered almost to man for service here that have not even have civil reply to application tell lad war be going to be big thing before be over may have militia volunteer out here perhaps troop from colony heard that of australian colony have already offered to send body of mounted men that government be ordering out larger number of men than be at first intended hear morning at kimberley mafeking fighting have begun on th kimberley made successful sortie on th general attack on mafeking be repulsed fact that place be beleaguered that have again be obliged to fall back here be likely to be cut off altogether have evidently stirred up begin to understand that be going to be much bigger affair than expected wrote to mother yesterday at durban told intended to leave while be still possible of course have written told of flattering way in general yule have spoken of doings of party said that hoped must not be anxious for be quite evident that be able to take good care of yourselves letter be in answer to one wrote to from durban begging to keep from undertaking what called brained business ' expressing regret that others have be allowed to form separate corp instead of being under command of experienced officer like told that thought that must have le chance of coming to harm in scouting work than if have to work in regular way a general ordered if sort of fighting mean of attacking in front position boer choose to take go on number will very speedily dwindle away fact be a far a colonial can see regular a yet understand fighting boer nothing must be more splendid than behaviour of troop at dundee elandslaagte in humble opinion fight be necessary if talana be to be attacked must have be done by marching troop round hill taking in rear in case boer must have bolted without firing shot that must have be done be shown by fact that cavalry did encountered difficulty on way again at elandslaagte object of keeping road open must have be equally well attained if after driving out of station have taken up strong position there waited for to attack therefore chris think that fighting in way be to say in boer fashion trusting to skill a much a to shooting will be running good deal le risk than must in fighting under british general in british fashion will go off quietly evening must keep bright look out on way for train have be fired upon at moment boer may pull up rail block road altogether two hour later be ready for start just before sunset corp rode out of ladysmith kept sharp look out a went saw sign of enemy crossing tugela by bridge near colenso halted there for night here captain brookfield reported arrival to officer in command of troop on following day chris friend rode on to estcourt have seen party of mounted men in far distance none have come near a military authority be well aware of boer being in vicinity there be nothing to be gained by scouting be now decided that be in advance of point that large number of enemy be likely to reach might therefore strike across country resume what considered regular work added to store several article whose want have felt have slit made in waterproof sheet cover sewn on to close hole when be used for tent have triangular piece of same material made to buckle on so a to close rear of tent have before be open to wind rain have employed much of spare time in training horse in teaching to lie down when ordered thus share shelter taken up by master behind rock wall officer commanding small force at estcourt have at first viewed with suspicion colonel yule have purposely left open letter with have furnished chris so that must be shown to officer commanding post detached force production now caused cold reception to be converted into warm welcome riding across country met more than one farmer trekking with cattle belonging towards ferry across mooi river reported that boer have overrun whole of country north of tugela that party have already crossed at ferry on road between helpmakaar greytown fugitive have come in from village on other side complained that boer be looting everywhere have driven off thousand of cattle number of horse have everywhere wantonly destroyed furniture everything must not carry off in farmhouse visited vigilant look out be kept a scout advanced on second day after starting encamped on slight elevation near mount umhlumba early next morning saw party of twenty boer riding in direction must bring within rifle shot of camp be at once on alert will not go out attack chris said to lad who be running towards horse must mean that though might kill of half of must probably be shot will ambush get picket rope loose bridle on ready for mounting then leave horse in charge of native where camped will be out of sight there when have done that take place quietly among rock do capper carmichael put yourselves twenty thirty yard apart be best shot when boer get within thousand yard be a near a will do if keep line be going open fire upon keep up steadily not too fast when see that only two men be firing will think that be couple of farmer whose place have plundered who be determined to have revenge be safe to hit of others will decide upon wiping out will probably leave horse crawl up in usual style when get close will be turn think many of be likely to get away order be carried out five minute later two rifle flashed out one after boer be riding in clump one be seen to fall horse of gave violent plunge very good exclaimed chris who like rest be lying down behind rock fire too fast wait minute then take turn one little time after other man who have fallen be instantly picked up by one of comrade rode off at full gallop before must get beyond range of mauser of lad have fired two more shot more of boer dropped watcher who have glass directed upon thought by movement that two have be hit boer when firing ceased stopped for little time remained clustered together then took long sweep round to point where ground be broken willow donga ran up in direction must bring within hundred yard of position occupied by hidden assailant there be seen to dismount after talk leaving horse in charge of one man probably one of wounded entered donga course be irregular once twice two lad be able to get shot at boer did not return fire hurried past exposed point a approached head be occasionally raised above bank to view position then disappeared again ground between camp nearest point of donga be thickly strewn with boulder with bush growing between lad have shifted position to side open fire till give order chris said quietly have got now except for slight movement of bush must not have be known that boer have left donga once twice capper carmichael caught momentary glimpse of one of held fire a chris have said let come within twenty yard then fire at once whether catch glimpse of not thinking that rifle be discharged will jump up make rush then will be turn illustration rifle cracked at once presently man head be seen peering round rock at about right distance rifle cracked at once boer fell prone on ground beyond shelter at same moment there be shout comrade sprang to foot rushed forward volley from whole of scout flashed out twelve of boer fell others leapt back behind shelter in turn opened fire keep in shelter chris shouted know now that be two to one will soon be making off combatant be so close to other that dared expose shoulder head to take aim after first shot fired at boer remained quiet chris waited for three four minute then told four of lad who be in best shelter to crawl back mount horse ride out down other side of slope after making slight circuit to gallop straight at boer horse fellow may be distance away already said a may have slipped off directly discharged rifle in case there be time to be lost in getting hold of pony at rate in driving off a two three minute again passed without shot being fired by boer chris be in act of calling off troop to watch donga fire at boer if saw running past exposed point when at moment heard horse returning directly afterwards one of lad have sent off ran up to there be whole lot of coming round other side said sixty seventy of at least distance behind can see lot of cattle waggon suppose be making for home when heard firing just at moment two three shot rang out telling that surviving boer be seen running down donga never mind chris shouted be going to be attacked by big party put down rifle of pile stone on crest so a to make shelter a quickly a can will have few minute who be coming up ca know yet what firing mean ran up to top be not more than six seven hundred yard away said must be better to fight out here than to take to horse of must certainly not get off without bullet need not mind showing yourselves when come up wo be able to make out what be boer indeed reined in pony when saw chris appear on brow of eminence a preliminary of rode off in direction endeavoured to ascertain position on right soon caught sight of clump of horse will soon know about chris said a two of galloped off may a well teach to keep distance take place behind rock then open sharp fire with magazine can not know how many of there be here now be ready yes well then set to work in moment almost incessant rattle of musketry broke out upon astounded boer who turning horse scattered at full gallop to escape hail of bullet more than dozen have fallen before be beyond range of mauser be fully two thousand yard away think need stop chris said fill up magazine again then make for horse directly first party of boer have be seen jack japhet have set to work taking down rolling up tent loading spare horse jump up chris said to be off mind keep well with now went on a rode off in body will do little cattle raiding on own account make for lad with shout rode off at full gallop towards great herd of cattle a approached kaffir who be driving fled separating a rode waving hat shouting at top of voice lad dashed at herd who at once turned went off at rate must have astonished animal accustomed only to small pasture other enclosure press too much chris have ordered before band separated will break down listen for whistle when hear field willesden harris bryan will follow up herd with kaffir keep moving rest will dismount make horse lie down open fire narrow valley passed through yesterday afternoon will do to make stand be about five mile away head cattle for boer wo be far behind when get there enemy indeed have not noticed leave little kopje a be hidden by slight fall in ground where descended be not until observed commotion among cattle that perceived what have happened then furious not only at loss have suffered at seeing booty driven away mounted pursued in hot haste party have obtained start of fully mile valley be reached by fugitive while boer be still distance in rear chris rode along until came to narrow defensible point horse be taken hundred yard on made to lie down sixteen companion then ran back took up position among rock on side of track slope above chapter viii desperate project scarcely have band taken cover in gorge than boer appeared five hundred yard away open fire at once chris shouted farther have to come under fire le will like rifle at once spoke out lad have used boulder behind crouched a rest for rifle confident of shooting position aim be deadly five six of leading boer fell several horse rest came to abrupt pause galloped back little distance then dismounted leaving horse in shelter disappeared from sight in short time dropping fire be opened from side of valley fire unless see man chris ordered there be gap on hillside that ca pas without giving chance fire in rotation be use wasting dozen bullet on one man if first miss let next shoot instantly so on when learn that be death to leave shelter will soon get sick of keep yourselves well under cover rifle duel continued for hour a chris have said must be case after seven eight have fallen a be trying to make rush across piece of ground where boulder afforded cover rest became very cautious at last only occasional shot be heard will fall back now chris said for aught know party of may be working round somewhere to take in rear know that have not got horse with for can see spot where hid still want to be caught between two fire let four on flank crawl back keep well among rock let catch sight of will fire occasionally to let know that be still here when have got horse up everything be ready whistle will come back to will be long time before venture to crawl up discover that have gone hour most likely by time cattle will be dozen mile on way to estcourt boer be not likely to follow ten minute later be in saddle have left horse at spot where there be sharp elbow in gorge retreat must not be seen from valley below cantered along in high glee not one have received scratch while twelve of first party of boer have fallen fully fifteen of second be certain that at least a many more must have be wounded expect really gave up idea of carrying position long ago chris said have only be keeping up fire to prevent turning table upon must have seen that be better mounted than be have be afraid that must in turn take offensive must not be surprised if stay where be day venture to mount ride off till get dark be something like leader peter said enthusiastically knew that be good fellow must make best leader among one must think that choice must turn out so well a have done be second fight have have with boer have thrashed well time although first time be twice a strong in second something like four time have not lost one of number be sure if have be caught where be without with at least half of must have be killed must have be lucky to get away with only that riding without pressing horse be two hour before overtook party with cattle have now broken into walk kept at till hour ago willesden said apologetically when came up kaffir said that unless gave rest half of must drop so let go easy till came up quite right chris said have given boer such thrashing that there be fear of continuing pursuit unless meet more of thief can go on a quietly a like have sort of respect for men like met at dundee elandslaagte who fight manfully stoutly for raiding scoundrel who only come out to rob plunder do wanton damage to quiet people one feel only disgust shoot without least compunction there be general chorus of agreement did get near chris not within about four hundred yard got so hot at first that dismounted took to rock pushed on for bit if whole hillside have be covered with boulder might have have sharp fighting there be open space to be crossed after getting over two three of found safer to lie a close a rabbit for aught know be there still travelled quietly till sunset then halted in open valley where there be water good grass company kept watch by turn being posted with horse mile out in country taking animal with not only because must fall back more quickly because knew horse must hear approaching sound long before master be able to do so must evince uneasiness unmistakably there be however alarm two day later travelling by easy stage arrived at estcourt where arrival with so large number of cattle created quite sensation at once put up notice at post office that person who have be raided by boer must come inspect herd take animal bearing brand soon appeared that cattle be property of four farmer living within short distance of other have arrived in estcourt with family two day previously weary broken down with fatigue hunger loss ruin of property gratitude be deep indeed at wholly unexpected recovery of large portion of herd started next morning mounted on pony have picked up for trifle to drive down country chris saw officer in command a soon a arrived in town gave outline of adventure upon be warmly congratulated will send in written report to sir chris asked be not under order must say that have better write post to officer commanding force at maritzburg know who may be be road closed to ladysmith chris asked yes two day since general french who be ordered to port elizabeth to take command of cavalry brigade be forming to drive back boer who have crossed orange river came down in last train got out be hotly fired upon by boer luckily have not taken up rail train got through safely have have news since for even wire to colenso have be cut for anything know place may be in possession of boer have little fort here have be throwing up entrenchment if come in force there be not much hope of getting off have armored train yesterday ran to within mile so of colenso without being interfered with though several party of enemy must be seen in distance have great hope that will get battalion up from maritzburg to morrow if so by loopholing house throwing up breastwork ought to be able to keep boer out of place unless come in force at rate must advise to scout next time beyond mooi river to make maritzburg head quarter so far a know boer have not yet gone beyond river news of doing so must certainly be of value have done marvellously well in getting away from that party met might not be so lucky next time for a push on be sure in short time to be strong over country between tugela mooi after consultation be agreed to by troop there be reason for haste rode by easy stage down to maritzburg stopping at weston hawick many of friend have gone down to durban still remained from received hearty welcome found letter awaiting for have be arranged that a must be impossible to give address must be sent to maritzburg friend be scarcely ready to credit story on being shown general yule letter saw that at least account of early doings be strictly correct troop be coming up fast from durban there be already strong brigade there chris called upon brigadier presented general yule letter own report of fight with boer subsequently show what can be done by young fellow who be good shot good rider who may say mr king have be admirably commanded what be wish now there be two three troop of volunteer horse here must wish to be attached to one of of course if do so there will be difficulty about really think that must be more useful in carrying on work in own way have be known for long time past that large proportion of cannon rifle ammunition of boer have be landed at portuguese port of lorenzo marque taken up by rail from there to komati poort station on frontier where there be bridge across komati river thence by rail to pretoria chris heard that be generally known that portuguese official who have long be influenced by boer money extracted from uitlanders be still winking at practice although be breach of neutrality so much indignation be expressed on subject at maritzburg chris one day when party assembled at spot where horse be tethered said want to have serious talk with all have heard immense quantity of arm dynamite be passing through lorenzo marque now at present see much for to do here idea be that if must manage to blow up bridge across river divide portuguese territory from transvaal must do infinitely greater service than by killing number of plundering boer troop looked at other in surprise be not really in earnest chris peter said must be tremendous business must be big business doubt be never more earnest in life than in proposing now that know how strong boer be round ladysmith what terribly hard work will be for army to fight way through hill can see that first calculation a to time when can be relieved be good deal short of mark there must be at least twenty thousand men collected here to do think be more likely to be end of january than end of december before boer be driven off have in one case seven week in other twelve before place be relieved begin to turn table on boer according to way carry idea out depends whether be back here by end of year by end of january be acknowledge if get back at have be thinking over there be two way of doing can go on board ship touching at durban going on to lorenzo marque say that must not do must be better to choose only four larger number must excite more observation who go will of course take dynamite with can buy at durban at lorenzo marque must assume character of four young irish fellow know there be lot of already up there german too fighting in boer rank be glad to know that got peppered at although be not to point must go a four irish lad who have come across from america to fight for boer have heard plenty of irish in mine at johannesburg so will be able to put enough brogue in talk to pas know from have heard that trip to portuguese official must be quite sufficient for to pas anything without examination even if did open case find dynamite in must account for by saying that have be told before starting that must be handiest thing to take with must be of more assistance to boer than anything must bring doubt of passenger must know that got on board at durban if question be asked must account for by saying that ship came over in be going on to australia therefore have be obliged to land take on to lorenzo marque once landed must of course take train for komati poort slip off after dark at station few mile from there then know must first reconnoitre bridge when have settled on best place for dynamite must put there next night know good deal about use of dynamite be not like gunpowder that have to put in hole fasten up tightly only have to lay upon iron girder arch light fuse leave to do work boy listened with increasing surprise to proposal what be other plan peter asked after long pause other plan be that must take passage in small craft must hire to st lucia bay then go up through zululand swaziland extends to within short distance of komati poort tribe be friendly enough with hate boer like poison of course in case will take dynamite with then must be guided by circumstance a to course what must do when got to bridge there be again long silence then brown said if anyone have proposed chris must have scoffed at a impossible for have come to have such confidence in that believe must manage there can be doubt that must be grand thing if must do have heard father say that river be terribly bad one that sometimes be altogether impassable for week at time except by bridge even in best time must think from what said must be quite impossible for to take heavy thing like cannon across anyhow be ready to go with thank brown chris said must certainly not ask anyone to go who be willing to do so must volunteer of course only combined for purpose of acting a scout one ever contemplated doing more so far have a allow carried out that object well have doubt that who care to join in what be sort of forlorn hope will continue to do well after have started on of course will if get back rejoin scheme must doubt be considered very wild one can see reason why with good luck must not succeed indeed believe that will succeed if when arrive there find that boer be guarding bridge of course if do so there be little hope of carrying matter out will know importance of bridge to how greatly destruction must be desired by british government may think possible that attempt a propose must be made take precaution to prevent success mean to throw away life if when get there find that be next to impossible to carry matter out will give up even then information must get about matter up there a to boer swazi must be of use know that boer agent have be doing utmost to get basuto to join be likely that may be trying to induce zulu swazi to do same even if fail in principal object must say that time must not be wasted when be up there can of course get news a to how war be going on if find that force be pushing up into transvaal will make straight across country join have be thinking over matter good deal since came here made up mind that anyhow will try to carry out so now resign leadership also for present membership now want to influence in way have come suddenly upon have better talk over together ask be that will not say word about to anyone not even to relation not only because a know must be case must be afraid of having anything to do with what must consider absolutely mad scheme because chance word might prove fatal to success a everyone know there be great number of dutch in colony who although may not be openly hostile be in favour of boer will doubt keep acquainted with movement of troop here can have difficulty in communicating with by native runner be one of friend even to mention casually that have gone north suspicion might be aroused therefore beg that one will breathe word about matter that will decide for yourselves without consulting anyone will leave now will meet here at same time to morrow will have have time to think over then wish to say before go consider that success of plan depends upon having whole twenty of with repeat that four must be quite sufficient there be advantage a well a disadvantage in having only that number must travel without exciting so much notice must have le difficulty about food must conceal more easily in case be pursued on other hand with stronger party must repulse attack if chased by boer so see really want more than three of to join think four be best number must be glad if only two besides brown wished to go with at same time if more desire of course a be comrade must have right to go so saying turned away leaving others to talk matter over went through usual drill afternoon without allusion being made to subject when met next day chris said cheerfully well what have decided first brown do stick to what said yesterday do think better of certainly stick to brown said when say thing mean how about others have made up mind to go with chris peter said so have willesden field capper sankey must go with if wanted to take more than four must go if wanted troop if must rather only have three of be settled that brown willesden go very well chris said that just suit be glad that must all go if be wanted really think that four must be best number so will consider that a settled now there be one other thing want to ask about see have right to take money out of common fund will have heavy expense in first place will want must say couple of hundred pound of dynamite then will have to take native with couple of zulu two three swazi there will be difficulty in getting a so many have be thrown out of employment owing to farmer losing herd may find useful to make present to chief a go along of course will have to take certain amount of provision for party have objection to taking share out of bank nothing have be drawn at present with couple of hundred pound between will have enough to spare for however long may be away there be chorus of agreement be awfully sorry that be going chris field said wo be same without at have agreed to ask to nominate leader during absence must much rather not do chris said everyone have done equally well be question that must settle among yourselves be against field said positively have talked over agree that will never be able to fix on one suppose vote be divided between four five think must feel more comfortable afterwards must rather put name in hat draw one out just leaving to chance almost think that must be better chris said to do a propose agree first that a have done up till now important matter will be discussed decided by vote then draw name from hat let be leader for week in order in come out with proviso if a time go on find that can have more confidence in one than can by majority of three to one elect a permanent leader must be very good plan carmichael said see difficulty be that supposing be going to attack boer boer attack plan leader fixed on might not seem to at best in two fight have have there be not that difficulty for everyone felt that plan adopted be best indeed much better than of must have be likely to think of say that must occur might be not everyone who must fix upon best thing to be done at once a did chris thought for minute must suggest said that in case a mention leader must tell next two on list what proposed if one of two agreed with must be majority there must be nothing more to be said on matter if disagreed with there must be general vote must hope thing must never occur because loss of five minute must sometimes be disastrous though in case might not make difference still be best plan can think of there be occasion for to decide that straight off at rate if must find that arrangement make doe not act perfectly well must advise to join captain brookfield troop act with general opinion be strongly in favour of chris suggestion be agreed that at rate first leader must be chosen by chance carmichael name came first out of hat will not have much responsibility said a have settled to remain here until advance begin now chris about spare horse must like to take one of may have to gallop for be of use being well mounted if be hampered with pony can not keep up with have only to lighten load by getting rid of most of burden then must be free to go own pace must like to take one of kaffir have turned out very well have good idea of cooking be accustomed to way care have must certainly like to have one of must stick to spare horse while other native must be all right if scattered shifted for must not like two spare horse chris thank one must be enough must carry store must get two native pony to take dynamite along will not be travelling at extraordinary rate of speed if broke down must always replace certainly there must be no danger if go through zululand must think not until get north of swazi country for though know there be boer settled among good many must of course have joined army must be easy to avoid others danger will only lie in last part of journey then have settled to go by land yes have decided to go way on horseback might find difficulty with portuguese at lorenzo marque if manage to blow up bridge must have horse must have very bad time indeed in getting back if can get dynamite here will go way by land must be safer doubt boer have spy at durban might have difficulty in hiring craft to take to st lucia starting with horse five six native must be safe to attract attention of someone looking out for news to send to boer think best plan will be to keep little to east of road to greytown where doubt there be dutch strike road run from there to eshowe little west of krantzkop there must be drift bridge ferry where cross tugela will of course avoid eshowe then keep along inside zulu frontier a far a maputa be northern boundary then will cross lebombo range into swaziland know how far must be by way must have to go a crow fly be about three hundred mile from here suppose what with detour pass so on will be four hundred ordinarily distance must be done in twenty day must allow good bit longer than fifteen mile day be utmost can calculate upon however in about month after start ought to be there thereabouts coming back must do more quickly a must have got rid of weight need not be bothered with pack pony talk a coolly about field laughed a if be going out for few day picnic be same sort of thing chris said except that will be longer bit rougher good deal more interesting when will start a soon a possible have to see about be dynamite store for journey know pretty well by time what will want be sure to be able to buy mealie bullock when want one from native tea coffee dozen tin of preserved milk hundredweight of biscuit in case of finding at lonely camp with native kraal near will be right of course will take gallon two of paraffin frying pan small kettle so on lantern will burn paraffin will fill up pouch with hundred round of rifle cartridge fifty for revolver then think will be ready now mind success of enterprise depends entirely upon keeping secret absolutely

week ten day apart direct from here leave for to post one by one to mother be sure send in right order a will suppose that be stopping here quietly out of harm wo be uneasy about peter willesden friend have gone to england so be right brown be at cape have better write two three letter too brown to be posted fortnight three week apart when matter be arranged chris saw jack kaffir agreed

to find two good zulu two swazi do think that must do that there be plenty of here baa look about get good men what will tell that will have to do to act a guide to tell chief who be on march to look after two three pony will only take one of spare horse will look after will have gun baa men like to have gun yes may a well carry gun too jack much better for men to have gun baa must be thought nothing of without right jack there will be difficulty about that store be full of be case men entering volunteer corp who intended to do fighting sold rifle have previously used obtained of government pattern carrying regulation cartridge so for ten pound chris got hold of five really good weapon carefully selecting carried same sized cartridge can take like said to jack who have gone with to buy will tell men engage that if at end of journey be well satisfied with behaviour will give gun in addition to pay few hour afterwards jack brought up four native for inspection be strong

spare horse carried flour paraffin fuse other store brought up weight to hundred twenty pound be somewhat lighter than carried by pony be anxious to keep in good condition in case one of own gave out baggage have be very carefully packed so even when going fast might not be displaced have found no difficulty in obtaining dynamite a several of store kept for use of mine made difficulty in selling must not have be sorry to part with whole stock in view of possibility of siege be not article that sane man must care to keep on premise chris have gone round to store have obtained offer from a said that intended to accept lowest tender be offered to at price very much below what must ordinarily have have to give for case be sewn up in canvas on be painted respectively tea sugar biscuit rice

being hung up in sun wind similar to jerked meat of prairie pampas of america point at water must be obtained be discussed be at considerable distance apart zulu be of opinion that late heavy rain have extended to hill of zululand that there must be abundance of water in little dongas water course must be dry after spell of fine weather while passing through zululand there must be occasion whatever for vigilance by day watch at night for there perfect order reigned here there resident magistrate be stationed at point few white trader have settled dispute between native be ordinarily decided by own chief in serious case appeal must be made to nearest magistrate who at once interfered in case of violence gross injustice at first kraal came to learned that native be everywhere much excited be most anxious to be allowed to join in war against old enemy be greatly disappointed on learning from magistrate that be only white man war that others must take part in if however boer invaded territory must of course be allowed to defend of zulu urged with reason though english might wish to make white man war boer did not desire to be so for knew that have be urging swazi basuto to join against english that offer of many rifle much plunder have be made also to of own chief to magistrate must only reply that knew of old that boer word must not be trusted that be always ready to break arrangement that have made must like to join said because must take help afterwards turn against steal land know well enough that have always stood between must know that if have joined against must be angry after war with be over must no longer protect zulu from knowledge of boer felt that must be so in case offer made to must have induced to side with boer be general hope that

received where stopped although swazi be deeply aggrieved by shameful manner in england have refused after valuable aid have rendered in last war to give support against boer word must have be sufficient to have kept latter out of swaziland a have kept from raiding in zululand that word be not given unfortunate people have be raided plundered best land taken from reduced to state of semi subjection however be glad to see four english sportsman among again to learn something of war have broken out between oppressor british if beat will be free again said last time be beaten gave over whole country to boer left people who have fought for at mercy time must not do that if beat shoot like dog make slave of a make slave of native who dwell in land only so will there be peace know that english will do chris said may be sure that when war be over boer will be no longer master there will be just law made by white men native will be protected evil deed will be allowed be no longer united among one of chief said have be taken by promise gift of boer queen be also be said in favour be afraid of most of must take advantage of fighting to drive of out of land to win back territory have taken from be very poor best land be gone can scarce grow enough food long for time when once again can have rich mealie patch good grazing land for ox horse be again strong people afraid of have not english interfered taken over boer country must have wasted from end to end knew well begged shepstone to hoist flag protect ah must have stayed there then native friend in plain still talk of happy time when be master boer dared no longer shoot down a if be wild beast treat a slave town grew up people paid for work with money not with lash of whip bullet of have mourned over time when english bent knee to boer gave wanted mastery of land right to kill enslave at will be not quite so chris said promised to give good treatment to native be one of condition of treaty believed chief said scornfully did not know that boer oath be only good so long a gun be pointed at perhaps will be like again when have conquered will again trust march away tell be not who will conquer who will conquer tell people that will be master over land that people will have to sail away in ship runner have brought news that have gathered round place where people go to work digging bright stone from ground very soon will take english prisoner that have also beset mafeking that have beaten english soldier in natal there will soon be none left there more than that that people of other boer state have joined have entered english territory be being joined by boer there therefore who must like to fight against be afraid thought english great people have beaten zulu dethroned great king cetewayo now seems that boer be much greater heart be sore need not fear chief chris said country be very many mile away many day journey in ship will take week before army get strong boer have always said wanted peace believed kept few soldier here until army come from england will get best of can send if necessary army many time stronger than of boer be sure to crush in end how must believe wanted peace chief asked everyone knew that be building great fort have got gun bigger than be ever before seen store full of rifle how must believe word when eye saw that be not peace war that meant because be fool suppose chris said bitterly be not from want of warning for people living out here have written again again telling what vast preparation be making people who govern country paid attention be much easier to believe what be pleasant than what be unpleasant folly will cost country very dear if have sent over twenty thousand men year ago there must have be war now will have to send over hundred thousand men perhaps even more great sum of money will be spent great number of life lost simply because government refused to believe what everyone out here knew to be fact did nothing allowed boer to complete preparation to choose own time for war though have made horrible mistake think chief that there be doubt about conquering at last men who now govern country be men not coward will not a that other government did go on knee to boer even if must do so people must not sanction if what chief have heard be correct chris said a rode along next morning must get back again a soon a can boer may be lying of course must make best of thing to swazi certainly sound a if not only at ladysmith at other place thing be going badly at present however in couple of day will not be far from bridge chief said that frontier be only few mile away own men tell that be very hilly country on other side just a be here have certainly come faster that have expected thanks to good feeding horse have turned out well if be really only two day farther will get there in just three week from starting have not brought same pony way a soon a one showed sign of fatigue be changed for with arrangement must return way must take back give chief present for having seen that be taken care of four native although well contented with way in be fed cared for be much puzzled at eagerness of employer to push on disregard paid to information obtained for of opportunity for sport several time have said to jack how be baa doe not stop to shoot there be plenty of deer in place lion there be zebra too though be not easy to get at very difficult to stalk why do push on so fast that pony have to be left behind others taken on can not understand have be with white men who came into country to shoot to see what land be like did not travel like besides will soon be in land of boer a english be at war with will shoot if find jack have only be told that master be going to strike blow at boer have not troubled a to nature have seen how have defeated much larger party than own have unbounded confidence in therefore only said baa have not told know that gentleman be very brave have fear of boer think that need fear that harm will happen shoot enough for to eat heartily buy drink for at kraal stop at if have seen game buy sheep what can want more have got gun have never needed to use perhaps may before get back if boer meddle with will be able to fight prospect of chance of being allowed to fight against boer must alone have inspired four native to bear amount of fatigue without murmur day march farther north have heightened hope that might use gun against old enemy be on twenty first day after starting that from hill commanding broad extent of country caught sight of train of waggon knew that journey be just at end have debated side of komati river must be best to follow have agreed to take eastern bank boer territory extended few mile beyond komati poort be close to frontier a knew nothing a to construction of bridge beyond fact that be iron be not even sure whether be entirely on boer ground if eastern bank of river here belonged to portuguese decided that at rate be better to travel a near frontier a possible a be pursued must ride at once across line not that believed that boer must respect must not know country so well a on own side must not find countryman to join in pursuit keeping down on eastern side of hill continued until must see white line of steam showed direction in train from south east be coming be therefore able to calculate within mile where bridge must be situated camped in dry donga next morning at daybreak left horse behind in charge of men walked forward mile farther obtained view of bridge stood at point where river after running for little distance north west made sharp curve to south bridge stood at loop if object have be to render defensible have be admirably chosen by boer who laid out line to portuguese frontier for from other side of bank approach must be swept by cannon even musketry on flank lying down took in detail of construction through glass then choosing ground so that must not be seen by on bridge kept on until be able to obtain view from distance of quarter of mile examination be now made be by mean of satisfactory nature near bridge there be siding on several line of loaded truck stood engine be at work shunting at least score of native be at work under direction of portuguese while several men who be by dress evidently boer be pointing out to official truck desired to be first forwarded three four of carried huge case two of being long enough to occupy two truck there be doubt be gun chris said if can hing else can work lot of damage here will be sort of satisfaction after long ride a to main object thing look well half dozen armed boer must be made out stationed at portuguese side of bridge a many more at opposite end two lately erected wooden hut of must give shelter to fifty men stood short distance beyond bridge be evident by figure moving about number of horse grazing near that strong party be stationed there to furnish guard for bridge be afraid can not do peter said after glass have be fixed on bridge for several minute at least see chance what do say chris be afraid there be none if be to crawl up to to night shoot down at end of bridge must be nearer see there be line of hut on side two three better class house doubt railway official native live there must turn out when heard firing boer must come rushing over from other side must be out of question for to carry forward four box to middle of bridge plant over centre of girder light fuse quarter of hour must be wanted for business at very least must not have minute if there be a good guard by night a there be by day be likely to be at least a large perhaps much more than that thing be impossible in way however of course can crawl up close after dark satisfy about guard if be not to be managed in way must go down to river bank see whether there be anything to be done with one of pier if be not possible must content with smashing thing up generally on side several of truck look to to be full of ammunition there be eight with long case be doubt rifle remember that terrific smash at johannesburg though say must do such awful damage a there be there for there be know how many ton of dynamite exploded then think about fifty still must be heavy blow amount of store must be destroyed thousand of rifle for aught know waggon with tarpaulin over be full of cartridge however bridge be principal thing will stop here for hour two examine foot of ground so a to be able to find way in dark need not mind about truck now can examine position to morrow if have to give up idea of bridge on returning to horse have long talk chris be deeply disappointed others who have never quite believed that scheme must be carried out be greatly delighted at knowledge at rate might be able to do immense deal of damage to enemy a soon a became quite dark set out again did not take rifle with have brace of revolver have intention of fighting except to secure retreat before starting have wound strip of flannel round boot so that must run noiselessly brown have in first place suggested that must take boot off chris pointed out that if have to run in dark one other of be sure to lame by striking against stone other obstacle there be several large fire in shunting yard at end of bridge at boer barrack crawling along on hand knee be completely in shade managed to get within twenty thirty yard of boer who be sitting smoking talking be evidently greatly satisfied with news that have heard during day listening to talk gathered something of what have happened since left estcourt colenso have be evacuated by armoured train coming up from estcourt have be drawn off line most of soldier with have be killed captured last news be that british have sallied out from estcourt be now surrounded have attacked boer posted in very strong position near place called willow grange have be repulsed principally by artillery with be said immense loss be not pleasant hearing for listener boer then have grumble at being kept so far away from fighting be not that be so anxious to be engaged a to get share of loot a have be reported that something like twenty thousand cattle horse have be driven off from natal then conversation turned upon point still more interesting to listener commando have started from barberton border town thirty forty mile to west into swaziland native have mentioned to one of boer there that four englishman have passed north have stopped at chief kraal be quite young have five native with three pack horse have come to shoot see country said have spoken with one of men with who said that so far have not done much hunting only enough for food supposed that be going to begin further on boer have hour later ridden down to barberton with news have be at once resolved to send off commando of hundred men to search hill for there be suspicion that hunter be british officer who have come up to act a spy cornet have telegram afternoon one of said that be to be specially vigilant here must keep sharp lookout at night suppose be on side of river may be going to pull up railway blow up culvert somewhere between barberton four men with kaffir might do certainly must not damage bridge at ten o'clock most of party retired into small shed few yard away two remained sitting by fire be evidently left on guard for kept rifle close at hand lad now crawled away distance then made way down steep bank to river be stream of size running with great rapidity did not take long to decide that must be impossible to swim out with case place in situation that explosion must damage structure then moved quietly up to spot where end of last span touched level ground rested upon solid wall built into rock ran forty foot above head be now just under where boer be sitting must hear voice see glow of fire be unable to make out exact position of girder have when watching obtained general view of construction consisted of two line of strong girder on side connected by lattice bar with strong communication between side at pier depth of girder be twenty foot after cautiously feeling wall finding that there be opening in explosive must be placed crawled away noiselessly ascended to bank again couple of hundred yard from bridge returned to camping ground observed a went that there be still fire burning in station yard that kaffir be seated near a in silence of night faint sound must be heard like of distant train have doubt that be waiting up for one to arrive indeed before have reached camping place saw train pas by have light save head light of engine fire therefore have doubt that be train with store when reached tent have long consultation fire have be lighted horse have be taken way up little ravine down stream of water trickled here four native have taken up post have only come down in middle of day to fetch food jack cooked over spirit stove be alight when lad returned be carefully screened round by blanket so that not slightest glow must be seen from distance what do think of chris brown said know what to think about have idea what effect dynamite must have when exploded at distance of thirty forty foot below bridge certainly must blow roadway up have very great doubt whether must so twist smash main girder a to render bridge impassable distance to first pier be not great unless one entirely destroyed bridge must say that must be repaired very soon mean in week two by strong gang if girder kept place two three day work might patch up temporarily if be destroyed altogether a far a first pier must stop cannon getting over till temporary bridge be constructed by rigging up strong cable must pas case of musket ammunition across gap in same way know a have seen picture of shipwrecked people being swung along under cable in sort of cradle what do think peter two hundred pound of dynamite must do lot of damage chris must think that must certainly bring wall down have doubt that must do that peter ironwork go ten yard farther doubt rest on solid rock expect wall be put there more to finish thing off than to carry much of weight again see be only single line not above ten foot wide be against for wider line better chance have of being smashed by explosion forty foot below well will have look at bridge waggon to morrow of course bridge be great thing if can be managed though say that blowing up yard must not be good thing if ca make sure of other anyhow need not feel down hearted about came up here on chance even though may not be able to do exactly what want ought to manage to do lot of damage after eating supper turned in to two little tent spirit lamp have be extinguished a have not least fear of discovery did not consider necessary to place sentinel in morning be out again early at former post of observation what be up to now brown said hour later when saw party of boer come down opposite side close to bridge carrying post plank chris made answer be watching intently stopped near bank of river close to bridge then of set to work to level space of ground while others made hole at corner be afraid that be up with plan a far a bridge be concerned be going to put up hut there have not least doubt mean be going to station guard under bridge if do that side be probably doing same on only ca see boer be stupid enough in thing be sharp enough in others be possible that commando from barberton have come upon one of kraal where slept asking lot of question about have found out that have four heavy box with idea may have struck that contained explosive if did occur to be almost certain that man have be sent off at once to barberton with order to telegraph here to other bridge to take precaution against being blown up anyhow there be hut building there see that can be for other purpose after three hour work hut be completed party of eight men brought down blanket other kit two of at once ascended bank with rifle sat down at foot of wall end business chris said however will creep round to point where can get view of side of bridge possibly have only taken precaution on own side for be travelling for time in swazi country to west of komati be where will have heard of crawled away among rock rejoined companion hour later be just same side have settled question for now will give attention to waggon chapter x explosion having given up hope of blowing up bridge chris comrade turned whole attention to line of waggon train have come in on previous evening have added to number although have taken of away with up country now made out that there be eight waggon piled with case almost certainly contained rifle six with tarpaulin closely packed over guessed contained ammunition box four with two large case might contain field gun while two with what be sure be big gun still remained on siding must say that about four five pound of dynamite must be abundance for of ammunition waggon le than must do a must by slitting tarpaulin put pound among case if one case be exploded must set others off there be trouble about will just take note be on second siding there be eight other waggon in front of six behind so can not make mistake about there must be good heavy charge under rifle truck for will have to blow well into air to bend damage enough to be altogether unserviceable a for gun especially heavy one be difficult question of course if must open case get at breech piece put dynamite among must damage mechanism so much that gun must be useless until new breech piece be made fancy must be altogether beyond boer a there be possibility of opening must trust to blowing gun so high in air that will be too much damaged for use by explosion fall have got altogether two hundredweight now two pound to ammunition waggon will take twelve pound what will say for rifle ten pound brown suggested must take eighty more pound willesden objected must make big hole in store must have good charge chris said suppose say nine pound to will save eight pound fifteen pound apiece ought to give eight case suppose hold field gun good hoist will leave with over hundred pound fifty for of big gun now that have seen be necessary may a well be off begin to get ready cover be taken off box of dynamite be unscrewed explosive be with great care divided into portion a agreed upon two of case furnished just sufficient for ammunition waggon two big gun other two for smaller cannon truck with rifle charge be sewn up in piece of canvas smaller charge for ammunition box being enclosed in thinner stuff have be sewn under canvas used in packing fuse detonator be then cut inserted chris be perfectly up in work having performed operation score of time in mine length must burn be only decided after discussion there must be in nineteen charge to explode be in three group at little distance from other cannon being on same siding must be necessary perhaps to wait for time till be free from observation by native others who might be moving about yard then signal must be given that must see must not take long to light fuse for of must be provided with slow match burn with spark must be held under hat inverted tin cup till time came for using question be how far must be away to ensure own safety chris maintained that at least four five hundred yard must be necessary to place in even comparative safety from rain of fragment must fall over wide area finally be agreed to cut fuse to length to burn four minute must allow minute for hitch might occur in lighting three minute to burn be of course important that must be no longer than be absolutely necessary a there existed certain risk that one of little spark might be seen by passing kaffir a be still more probable smell of burning powder must attract attention be agreed that chris must light fuse at cannon be farthest from others that peter must see to six rifle truck willesden brown attend eight truck with ammunition one to begin at end of line when have finished work be to run straight away in direction of encampment be to throw down when felt sure that time for explosion have arrived a soon a be over be to meet at place of encampment tent store be to be removed before work began to ravine where horse be men with being charged to stand at animal head a there must be great explosion horse might break loose stampede matter puzzled most be how when reached respective station separated from other by line of waggon in case by distance of couple of hundred yard be to know when work of lighting fuse be to begin must not be done by sound for must reach ear of awake in yard sentry at bridge chris at last suggested plan when start jack will be stationed at point on hillside high enough for to see from point of yard will show exact spot while be light when start will go down with to edge of yard a separate will turn go up to point have shown will be ordered to walk up quietly not to hurry will give ample time to get to station before reach must keep eye fixed on point will take dark lantern with when get there must turn shade off so a to show light for quarter of minute will be signal to begin be most unlikely that anyone else will see even if did must simply stare in direction wonder what be of course only flash must be safer of might not see must remain waiting for until other explosion took place agreed that must be very good plan chris crawled up with jack until reached spot where commanded perfect view of yard explained to exactly what be to do have already be told what be going to take place knowing that kaffir have very little idea of time said will hold open while say slowly like be showing light baa hope that can see ' will say that over twice then turn off light lie down under big rock till hear explosion wait little for stone fragment will come tumbling down when have stopped doing so make way straight to where horse be will find there before now repeat over to word be to say slowly twice jack did so finding on questioning that perfectly understood what be to do chris went back with to encampment where remained quietly until sun set darkness came on then according to arrangement four native came in carried thing back to ravine laid down ready to pack horse a soon a master returned day passed slowly to lad be in state of suppressed excitement excitement vastly greater than have felt during two fight with boer how will wonder who did when hear news down in natal peter said expect will hear much about chris said may be sure boer will not say much make big brag over success wo care to publish thing a probably paper will only say explosion of trifling nature occurred on portuguese side of komati poort barrel of powder exploded be unknown whether be result of accident work of spy due precaution will be taken to prevent recurrence of accident beyond few native employed at station one be hurt ' others laughed suppose will be about chris however have doubt that commando from barberton will keep very sharp look out for a go back yes wo catch wo venture into swaziland again will make way down on portuguese side following railway till be fairly beyond mountain range can ride fast now that have got rid of dynamite will be time before get news about what have happened here for telegraph wire be sure to be broken instrument smashed really think that best way will be to ride straight down to lorenzo marque when get there can very well state that have be ordered to leave johannesburg that a train be so slow so crowded with fugitive have ridden down suppose that will attract least notice for know that great many of who have intended to stay have be ordered off way will get back to natal in few day avoid danger others agreed that must be capital plan distance by road have crossed few mile to south run from lorenzo marque up to ladysdorp murchison klein lemba gold field must not be above seventy mile must wait till daybreak showed amount of damage have be done then start must be down at lorenzo marque in evening when even if news of explosion reached town boer suspicion that englishman be in hill that be probably work must not be known not until ten o'clock be move made then took up package of dynamite accompanied by jack made way noiselessly down to railway yard here separated chris aided by jack carried big packet for large gun for eight smaller one met one about depositing package in right position under fuse have be already inserted returned to spot have left in minute two be joined by others peter have placed parcel under eight truck with rifle willesden brown have cut hole in tarpaulin of ammunition truck thrust down charge well among box be ready while others stood closely round jack opened lantern just widely enough for to light slow match now be not to hurry back to place jack will be on look out for by time get there know instruction be to turn round open slide of lantern say word told over twice slowly then shut lantern get under great boulder lying against rock will be perfectly safe in there understand baa said at once turned went off others hurried to respective post then turned round gazed at spot where light must be shown in anxiety excitement time seemed interminable began to think that native have somehow blundered at last light appeared turned at once to work minute sufficed to light fuse then hurried away cautiously until past waggon then at full speed along hillside thickly padded shoe making noise upon rock knowing that be sure to be confused a to time have calculated before sun have set how far must run in three minute must be if went well time must have after leaving yard thought that even on rough ground in dark must make hundred fifty yard minute at about four hundred fifty from waggon there be low ridge of rock behind must obtain protection from fragment blown directly outwards chris be first to arrive for truck with cannon be farthest away from bridge be able to run for distance along line before making for elope therefore travelled faster than companion who have farther to run on broken ground in minute rushed up almost together throw yourselves down chris shouted will have directly twenty second later there be tremendous roar blinding crash felt ground shake almost simultaneously came eight others then in quick succession followed six other report mingled with confused roar of innumerable shot blended together there be momentary pause then deafening clatter a rifle fragment of iron wood came falling down over wide area several fell close to where lad be crouched against rock none touched for full half minute fragment continued to fall then boy stood up looked round be too dark to see more than that yard be chaos long line of waggon hut building have disappeared loud shout must be heard from other side of bridge nearer to everything be silent there be doubt that success of attempt be complete lad walked back quietly until be at spot where horse have be placed jack overtaking just a reached be terrible baa said in awed voice jack thought life be gone thing fell on rock must not break nothing short of one of big cannon must have done jack well will see in morning what damage be done four native although have be warned be still terribly frightened horse have at first crash broken away run up ravine have just brought down again still trembling lathering with fear for minute boy patted soothed accustomed to voice caress gradually quieted down be very restless until day began to break boy have thought of sleep lamp be lit tea made of kaffir be given glass of spirit water for have brought up bottle with in case of illness special need be evident from chattering teeth broken speech that native needed stimulant badly before became light horse be saddled five native told to take along hill mile farther when have seen off lad returned to former post above station have several time when looked out during night seen great light in direction have doubt that of fallen hut have caught fire illustration there be tremendous roar blinding crash prepared a be for scene of destruction reality far exceeded expectation waggon within considerable distance of explosion be smashed into fragment wheel broken axle twisted ammunition truck have disappeared many close to have be completely shattered in musket have be be mere heap of fragment rest of truck lay with side blown in others comparatively uninjured be piled on top of others three four deep content be scattered over whole yard box case be burst open content including large quantity of tea sugar tinned provision in vast quantity other store ruined still smoking brand showed where hut have stood dead body of twenty native several portuguese official be scattered here there body of eight boer be laid out together by bridge forty fifty men be wandering aimlessly amid ruin huge cannon stood upright nearly in centre of yard have fallen on muzzle have penetrated foot into earth must not see where fellow have fallen five others looked like fifteen pounder be lying in different direction other three have disappeared rifle twisted bent ruined be lying about everywhere be not a good a bridge chris said after have used glass for time in silence be heavy blow for must think will be week before line can be cleared ready for traffic even when begin will feel loss of so much rolling stock there be five engine in yard one of have be upset will want lot of repair before be fit for anything again wish have kodak with to take dozen snap shot must be something worth showing when get back well may a well be moving boer look a if be stupefied at present will be waking up presently sooner start for lorenzo marque better hour later have mounted be on way travelling slowly till came upon road then at fast pace jack rode spare horse other native rode pony in turn on foot keeping up without difficulty by laying hand on saddle sometimes trotted for two three mile then went at walk for hour stopped altogether for four hour in heat of day for be now getting on to low land being only three hundred foot above sea reached lorenzo marque at about nine o'clock in evening failing to find bed for town be full of emigrant from transvaal camped in open in morning sold two pony be fortunate in finding steamer lying there must start next day being very unwilling to part with horse arranged for deck passage for taking own risk of injury to in case of rough weather setting in berth be already engaged mattered little to a must sleep upon plank a well a on ground found that there be excitement in town a there be report that there have be explosion much damage done near komati poort particular be however known a railway official maintained strict silence a to affair be known however that telegraphic communication with transvaal be broken that three train filled with kaffir labourer accompanied by number of official company of soldier have gone up early that morning among fugitive strong hope be expressed that damage have be serious enough to interrupt traffic for little time to cause serious inconvenience to boer even hazarded hope that bridge have suffered however seemed unlikely in extreme fortunately weather be fine on run down to durban passage of three hundred mile be effected in twenty four hour be now just month since have left maritzburg a soon a landed with horse follower learned that much have taken place during time have started on th of november boer be then steadily advancing so great did danger appear that durban have be strongly fortified by blue jacket aided by kaffir labour on th sir redvers buller have arrived by time considerable force be gathered at british advance began from town on following day place have be entirely cut off boer occupying whole country a far a mooi river general hildyard who commanded at estcourt have be obliged to inarch out several time to keep at distance from town one two sharp artillery engagement have taken place boer being commanded by general joubert in person have always retired short distance movement be so rapid that be useless to follow troop have time fallen back to estcourt on th boer have blown up bridge across tugela army be moving forward great battle be expected shortly on landing chris rode at once to address given by mother found that have sailed for cape town week before riding then to railway found that line be closed altogether to passenger traffic that train with troop strong detachment of sailor be going up that evening learning that naval officer be in command a military consisted only of small party of men who have be left behind when regiment left to look after forward store went to have before landing donned civilian suit what can do for sir officer who be

hear on occasion in camp where will be glad to see at time chris then related idea have formed at maritzburg of blowing up bridge how have carried out adventure passed very briefly over journey described fully how have be obliged to relinquish original project owing to bridge being so strongly guarded at end how failing in respect have determined to do a much damage a possible to great assemblage of waggon filled with arm military store fully detailed manner in have be accomplished aspect of yard on following morning splendidly planned carried out commander of party exclaimed others echoed word be astonishing indeed to think that plan must have be conceived carried out by lad older than of junior midshipman assisted by only three others of same age day before started doctor said saw in one of durban paper telegram from lorenzo marque saying that there have be explosion at komati poort where few waggon have be injured two native killed that boer have suffered in way that damage must be repaired line opened for traffic in few hour there be only one word of truth in sir chris said smiling be that boer suffered be convinced that be strictly true for eight boer at bridge be certainly instantaneously killed of native whom be sorry for there be certainly eighteen killed together with eight ten portuguese employes if must by possibility have got native out of way must have done so a to portuguese feel great regret for believe official in custom house on railway be bribed by boer to break official order receive a to observing strict neutrality aid in way in passing material of war into transvaal there be time for further conversation for be now within short distance of tugela train be winding way between steep hill must have be held successfully by handful of men only wonder to be officer said that boer did not take up drag away rail way from here to estcourt if have lifted out of sleeper have only to harness rail behind horse trot off with know that there be considerable amount of railway material at durban doubt if there be anything like sufficient to make twenty mile of road business must have be still more difficult if boer have collected sleeper in great pile burned of course have destroyed good many culvert bridge at estcourt be wonderful that railway people must have managed to get up temporary trestle bridge so soon to make deviation of line to carry train over doe engineer immense credit pas be widening added after putting head out of window fancy will be at chieveley in few minute train came to stand still at siding short distance outside station be crowded by long line of waggon with store of kind number of sailor be unloading shell for gun crowd of kaffir under order of military officer be getting out store a alighted after hearty thanks to officer whose kindness have be mean of getting forward so promptly who now went to report arrival to captain jones who be superintending operation of sailor chris party hurried to rear waggon be work of considerable difficulty to get horse out must not have be accomplished have there not be stack of sleeper near spot number of be carried piled so a to make sloping gangway by horse be brought down sleeper being returned to place chris friend mounted rode to camp be placed behind long low ridge screened from sight of enemy on opposite hill although within easy range of heavy gun here before daybreak on th major general barton fusilier brigade with thousand colonial cavalry three field battery naval gun have marched north be following night joined by brigade with cavalry next day big naval gun have opened fire although shell have reached lower entrenchment of boer battery on hill have proved to be beyond range even with greatest elevation must be given to while boer gun carried far beyond camp chris have learned at estcourt where train stopped few minute captain brookfield troop formed part of colonial horse have advanced with general barton brigade soon discovered position leaving horse with native went to tent be delighted to see back exclaimed a entered heard in confidence from one of party when joined week back that have gone on mad brained adventure to try blow up komati poort bridge be horrified have of course given leave to act on own responsibility never dreamt of undertaking expedition of sort of course found impossible to get there lad told that have reckoned on being away six seven week be le than month since date on told left anyhow heartily congratulate on getting back got there sir nothing must be done with bridge be so safely guarded however did blow up two big cannon battery of small one ten thousand rifle enormous quantity of ammunition say so chris then have better luck than deserved one of correspondent told morning that there be news in town by telegram from lorenzo marque that there have be accidental explosion at komati poort did not seem to be anything serious tell about congratulate most heartily said when chris have finished story of course have written report of here be sir have made very brief merely saying that have honour to report that with messrs peter brown willesden succeeded in blowing up with two hundredweight of thing have mentioned to destroying large quantity of rolling stock badly damaging five locomotive destroying road siding to extent that traffic can hardly be resumed for fortnight be general here sir will be here afternoon now will not detain from friend doubt saw ride in will be most anxious to hear of doings will hardly know again when came up to join adopted uniform of corp feeling that must be uncomfortable going about in large camp in civilian dress brought with uniform for for seemed very certain that must return alive be very glad of sir for soldier stared at a came up here suppose took for sight seer who have come up to witness battle a left tent found rest of party gathered in group twenty yard away heartiest greeting be exchanged delight of party knew bound when found that four friend have not have journey in vain have two tent between gathering in one of listened to peter who told story a chris said have told twice must probably have to tell again four lad at once exchanged civilian clothes for uniform have be brought up be like of other colonial corp very simple consisting of loose jacket reaching down to hip with turned down collar pocket breech of same light colour material loose to knee tighter below knee boot felt hat looped up on one side first step when be dressed be to mount eminence distance in rear of camp whence have view of whole country in front of be wide valley with broad river running through beyond rose steep hill range behind range be crossed by two bridge that of railway have be blown up destroyed road bridge be still intact though a sankey who have accompanied told be known to be mined to left of line of railway be hill known a grobler kloof on summit of line of heavy gun must be seen there be other battery on slope at foot commanding bridge to right of on hill be fort wylie in bend of river by railway must be seen white roof of church tower of colenso there be battery behind others still farther to right on mount hlangwane heavy gun must be seen on other hill to left of grobler kloof while far away behind colenso be crest of mount bulwana from cannonade be being directed upon ladysmith occasional white burst of smoke showed that garrison be replying successfully on lower slope of hill be line sometimes broken sometimes connected rising one above be boer entrenchment cairn said that heard that extended for nearly twenty mile to right left be believed that see anything like of went on really know much about for boer only answer occasionally from great gun on hilltop although yesterday sailor fired lyddite shell at lower trench there be reply be awful place to take chris said after examining hill for quarter of hour with glass have seen that boer be good in open have doubt will hold entrenchment stubbornly be certain that great many of be good shot have gone over ground at laing nek be nothing at in comparison to position do know how many there be supposed to be of cairn say that there be about twenty five thousand of one know exactly native get through pretty often from ladysmith know more there than do here be jolly cheerful there in thought that will soon be relieved hope that be not counting chicken before be hatched chris said doubt very greatly whether will carry hill in front of if do range behind be doubt fortified how about crossing river there be several drift there be one about four mile to left of bridge called bridle drift waggon drift be about a much farther on there be drift just side of where little tugela run into one just farther on there be skeete drift molen drift with pontoon ferry there be important one called potgieter drift where road from springfield to ladysmith cross trichardt where road go to acton home know there be to right know name well be comforting because even if take colenso there must be no crossing if bridge be mined a town will be commanded by dozen battery must not gain much by capture well tell fairly that be well satisfied that belong to mounted corp will be only looker on for even if win will certainly lose tremendous lot of men be there way of marching round one way other believe not only way at open seems to be round by acton home be place about fifteen mile west of ladysmith on principal road from van reenen pas from there down to ladysmith country be comparatively open be tremendously long way round know how far must say forty fifty mile certainly road will in many place be commanded by boer gun will most likely have fortified strong position at various point of course great difficulty will be transport be sure have nothing like enough to take store for army distance besides chris see that must gain advantage from going to ladysmith way must be a far a ever from thrashing boer certainly must not remain in ladysmith must eat up provision there in time like outlook at peter said ah there be general officer with staff riding into camp most likely be buller have better go down for if brookfield give in report may want to speak to party went down hill when reached camp be at once sent for to captain brookfield tent be glad that be back said sir redvers buller have just ridden up on to ridge will speak to a come down have better come with stand short distance off bring rifle with stand in military order three in line chris two pace in front of having got rifle followed captain brookfield till stopped at foot of slope below point where general staff be standing leader advanced fifty yard ahead of in quarter of hour party be seen descending hill captain brookfield stepped forward saluted general a came along horse length in front of staff sir redvers checked horse little impatiently what be sir said sharply can not attend to camp detail now command maritzburg scout captain brookfield said three of men with mr king who command section to belong have just returned wish to hand mr king report contains news be think of importance give to lord gerard general said briefly motioning to one of officer behind please see what be about gerard then moved forward again briefly acknowledging captain brookfield salute have gone however twenty yard when lord gerard rode up to handed to open dispatch be of importance sir supposing that be merely report of four scout who have gone out reconnoitring with mind absorbed with weightier matter general have hardly given matter thought without checking horse glanced at paper then abruptly reined in charger read through attentively then turned to where captain brookfield be still standing called up quite understand report sir said be possible that men have be up to komati poort gathered from word that have merely returned from reconnoitring sir only came in morning by train from durban with naval detachment with detail how in world did get to komati poort started from maritzburg sir rode up through zululand swaziland object be to blow up bridge to stop supply of munition of war continuing to pas up through lorenzo marque may say that acted on own initiative section to belong be composed entirely of gentleman son from johannesburg provide horse equipment draw pay ration when joined corp made condition so long a not required for regular work must be allowed to scout on own account before calling up captain brookfield general have handed back despatch to lord gerard with word pas round be men general said pointing to little squad yes sir sir redvers rode up to on returning salute said have done well indeed gentleman be most gallant action have own horse with asked chris yes sir then mount at once join a leave camp then can tell about matter on way back chris be soon on horseback waited at short distance while general talked with general barton a soon a saw turn to ride off cantered up joined staff general looked round a did so beckoned to to come up to side now sir let hear more about captain of troop that belong to tell that twenty other young fellow from johannesburg formed yourselves into party of scout be making war at own expense that although in certain way joined troop really act independently when so plea yes sir family have received great indignity from boer although be conscious that must be of little use a troop thought that must do service a scout on own account have be lucky in inflicting blow on be fortunate enough to attract colonel yule attention at dundee furnished with open letter addressed to to officer commanding station saying that have done so have about yes sir sir redvers held out hand chris handed letter so went into boer camp do speak dutch well yes sir speak dutch fairly most of kaffir also be why thought that must be more useful scouting until now have be dressed a young boer must think pas without suspicion anywhere now a to other affair sir redvers said returning colonel yule letter have better take will be useful to time now tell about be entirely own idea first thought of sir three friend agreed to go with did not want large number started from maritzburg with own kaffir servant two zulu two swazi to act a guide two pony of carried hundredweight of dynamite have also spare riding horse then related proceeding from time of start to arrival at komati poort failure at bridge in consequence of strong guard that boer have set over how finding that main object of journey must not be carried out proceeded to wreck station yard content thank mr king general said when chris concluded by mentioning briefly how have ridden down to lorenzo marque taken ship to durban come up by train saw telegram of accident at komati poort imagined that be probably more severe than be stated certainly have idea that such wholesale damage have be effected that be work of of people think that must be unwise for to take public notice of at present possibly there may be attempt made to destroy that bridge if nothing more be said about boer may in time cease to be careful few determined men landed at lorenzo marque may manage to succeed where be unable to do so must be worth money to to put stop to constant flow of arm ammunition be going on via lorenzo marque consider expedition to have be in highest degree praiseworthy to have be conducted with great skill father be mining engineer managing director of several mine round johannesburg general have be working there under learning business therefore know good deal about dynamite what certain quantity must effect have thought of going into army because if so will appoint three friend to regiment at once will be gazetted a soon a report go home be very much obliged to general have thought of entering army will of course mention to friend have never heard say anything on subject be fighting because hate boer one can say unless have be resident there what have have to put up with for past year especially on way down boer not only threatened to strike struck many of lady mother among besides robbing everyone of watch other valuable if have not be for of might have changed mind before got down here that settled matter besides sir hope that will be able to do more good in own way than if became regular officer a know nothing about drill must be of very little good whereas do understand own way of fighting can say so without boasting for have twice thrashed boer once when be twice number other time when be nearly four time a strong a be go on doing so mr king go on doing so can not do better however if of three friend of choose to accept offer be open to be by time close to frere general went on be sorry can not ask to dine with evening a will be too busy for anything like regular meal for in few hour there will be general advance good evening when be le busy will be glad to hear about two fight that speak of colonist have taught few lesson already chris saluted wheeled horse round cantered back to chieveley there be much satisfaction among whole of party when chris related what general buller have said none of three companion have desire to accept commission willesden father be doctor with large practice in johannesburg lad be going home after war be over to study for profession to take medical degree while brown peter be son of very wealthy capitalist if must not have done fighting other way must have liked commission very much of course must have thrown up at end of war must great deal rather be on horseback than on foot own have inclination to fight way across hill talana be pretty serious business be child play to what will be very well chris said did not think that of must care for although must not answer for there be need for hurry in sending in reply there will be time to do when get into ladysmith then will get captain brookfield to draw up kind of letter ought to be sent for have not least idea how must address commander in chief of course thing of sort ought to be done in formal sort of way must not very well say bey dear general three friend care to accept kind offer yours very truly ' there be general laugh then talked over coming fight for be now generally known that attack be to be made in couple of day at latest next morning general buller column started before daybreak be by nine o'clock encamped on open veldt three mile north of chieveley barton brigade having already marched out to site of new camp five thousand yard south of colenso although well within reach of gun boer made effort to hinder operation to shell camp after be formed be evidently policy to conceal gun until last moment although very heavy bombardment of position be maintained day by naval gun reply be elicited though through glass must be seen that much damage be being done to entrenchment like silence chris said a of others be standing watching hill in front of doe not seem natural when be being pelted like not to shy something back be afraid will be terribly hot business when do open fire tomorrow there have be discussion that morning whether four native chris have engaged for expedition must be taken on permanently unanimously agreed that must be be quite possible that colonial corp must at time be called upon to act a infantry must be good thing to have six men to look after twenty five horse while be away then too must be very handy to have stretcher party of own on question being put to four men have willingly agreed to follow party whenever went into fight to take two stretcher with must at once carry who might be wounded back to camp be strong fellow belonging to fighting people must boy have doubt show a much courage a indian bearer have displayed at dundee elandslaagte in evening captain brookfield sent for chris order for to morrow be out said a far a be concerned thousand mounted infantry one battery be to move in direction of hlangwane be hill know side of river to right of colenso will cover right flank of general movement endeavour to take up position on hill where battery will pepper boer on kopje north of bridge two mounted troop of three five hundred men will cover right left flank respectively protect baggage half troop be to accompany dundonald other half will form part of force guarding left wing party will be with force have have share of fighting none of others have yet have chance very well sir will not be sorry to be on duty for naturally will have good view of whole fight while if be engaged must see nothing except what be going on close to yes will be something to see chris something to hear for doubt whether there have be so heavy fire a will be kept up to morrow ever since war began have twenty three thousand men boer more than a many what with magazine gun machine gun fast firing cannon of size will be inferno chapter xii battle of colenso by daybreak next morning whole force be under arm general hildyard in centre be to attack iron bridge at colenso general hart irish brigade be to march towards bridle drift after crossing to move along left bank of river towards kopje north of iron bridge general barton be to move forward east of railway towards hlangwane hill to support general hildyard colonial troop moving against hill a might appear necessary while general lyttleton brigade half way between of hildyard hart be to be prepared to render assistance to a might be required one division of artillery be to follow lyttleton brigade six naval gun be to advance on right sixth brigade be to aid general hart three battery of royal artillery to move east of railway under cover of sixth brigade to point from must prepare way for hildyard brigade to cross bridge action began before six o'clock naval gun opening with lyddite on trench on grobler hill between fort wylie reply be made by boer trooper standing by horse head in readiness to mount must party of boer make raid on camp began to wonder whether enemy have not retreated hildyard men advanced in open order close to railway queen own with west york in support on right of railway devon with east surrey behind on left marched a steadily in a perfect alignment a if on parade eight pace apart hart irish brigade far away to left be in close order cavalry must be seen proceeding at trot towards hlangwane general barton brigade still bearing to east colonel long colonel hunt with battery without waiting for protection galloped straight forward taking up position almost facing fort wylie few hundred yard beyond river opened heavy fire six naval gun be drawn by bullock being still considerable distance behind still boer gun remained silent at half past six musketry opened suddenly upon queen own devon gun in one continuous roar came not only from entrenchment on face of hill from trench close down by river from house of colenso from railway hut from bush fringed south bank of river have be believed to be wholly unoccupied five minute later cannon joined in roar with machine gun one pounder maxim great creusots krupp yet through storm of lead iron soldier went on quietly steadily very ground round be torn up by bullet ball many fell there be flinching while on right long battery though swept by hail of missile from unseen foe maintained continuous fire at fort wylie be awful peter exclaimed a lowered glass thought must be dreadful never dreamt of anything like look at body dotting ground men be passing over yet others go on a if be shower of rain through be passing ca look at longer be a bad for artillery chris said with glass still riveted upon saw lot of horse go down before be unlimbered can see men be falling fast surely can never have be meant to go within five six hundred yard of magazine rifle thought everyone have agreed that artillery must not live within range of breech loader why doe barton brigade move down towards try keep down fire how be hart getting on be not easy to see even with glass have not become engaged until little later than others a approached river equally terrible fire opened upon being in comparatively close order suffered more heavily than hildyard have done presently came upon spruit took to be main river under tremendous fire from mauser gun dashed across swinging round left made for drift sweeping before number of boer who have be hidden in long grass trench be there line after line over four regiment connaught ranger border regiment inniskilling dublin fusilier dashed forward with such fury that boer did not stop to meet bayonet by quarter past seven enemy have be driven across tugela without hesitation irish dashed into river many fell headlong for along bottom barbed wire have be stretched worse still be found that instead of being two foot deep a be expected be eight foot for boer have erected dyke across river little lower down have dammed water back swam across with rifle ammunition be feat beyond except strongest swimmer after maintaining for time be forced to retire naval gun did best to assist silenced of boer cannon be pounding failed to draw boer fire upon be only in centre even partial success be gained hildyard men have reached not captured colenso bridge in spite of tremendous fire of soldier tried to make way along be recalled for be deprived of support of artillery must have covered passage have hope of hart bringing brigade round to clear enemy out from kloofs on opposite side little of aid from lyttleton who have be obliged to move farther to left to lend assistance to hart of scottish fusilier have joined from barton brigade brigade be far away terrible a fighting be at point be battery down by river that most engaged attention of anxious spectator desperate attempt be being made to get gun back almost horse have be killed driver of team of ammunition waggon few survivor of officer several of general staff dashed recklessly forward under hail of fire horse man went over two of gun be carried off fortunately naval battery third field battery have not be taken so far forward be withdrawn with comparatively little loss ten gun stood alone deserted by last of party a seemed then to surprise of watcher one of spoke out for four of men who worked have stood to charge to last again again sent shrapnel among boer trench one fell then two remained continued to fire until last round of reserve ammunition be finished then who be near enough to make out figure saw take stand one on side of gun at attention until fell dead by side of piece have served so well even on right where success might really have be hoped for everything have gone badly dismounted colonial have fought way gallantly up slope of hlangwane nearly reached crest be not seconded by lord dundonald cavalry barton brigade be charged with aiding be kept at distance colonial be at last forced to fall back great a be loss at other point failure to capture hill be really greatest misfortune of day from position on south of river in loop battery erected on summit must have taken boer defence on lower slope of hill in flank must have covered crossing of river at colenso cut off by river from rest of boer position must hardly have be retaken fire must have searched valley up roadway ran almost a far a mount bulwana renewed attempt be made for time to carry off gun early in afternoon general saw that be waste of life to persevere further order be despatched for troop to retire have be day of misfortune yet day of glory for never have fighting power of british troop be more splendidly exhibited never be greater deed of individual daring performed never have troop supported with heroic indifference so terrible fire undoubtedly english general have greatly underrated fighting power of boer amount of artillery to be exposed have not done so must scarcely have distributed force over so wide face attacked at three point nearly four mile apart must have prepared for grand assault by seizing hlangwane firmly establishing of battery there even at cost of two three day labour only attempted to cross river when movement must have be covered by fire boer be quick in discovering importance of hill speedily covered face with such entrenchment that not until after long week of effort failure be attack again attempted against success of attack opened way to ladysmith have general order be carried out at point must probably have be captured hart brigade be to have begun attack owing to map with be furnished being defective troop losing way in spruit being led in far too close formation under enemy fire attempt failed being however largely due to astuteness of boer in damming back river rendering ford impracticable impetuosity of officer commanding two of battery of artillery in pushing gun forward unattended by infantry a ordered not only caused loss of ten gun of nearly men who worked deprived hildyard column of protection must have have in crossing bridge rendered undertaking impossible while failure of barton brigade to give assistance to hildyard to assailant of hlangwane contributed to one failure entirely brought about other general buller general clery have be wherever shot be flying thickest three of former staff captain schofield congreve lieutenant robert son of lord robert have ridden forward a volunteer to try get gun off robert be fatally wounded congreve be wounded taken prisoner schofield alone escaped unharmed with two gun be saved day have be almost more terrible for troop who remained unoccupied near baggage than for actually engaged in terrible light latter animated by excitement anger at inability to get at foe have scarce time to think of danger even laughed joked in midst of hail of bullet watcher have nothing to distract during long hour with glass must plainly see that advance have be made at point to seemed incredible that must come back from storm of fire from time to time learned from wounded men brought up by bearer who fearlessly went down into thick of fire to do duty news of how matter be going on in front gladly have received order to do so must have dashed down to try carry off gun many shed tear of rage a heard how irish strove in vain to cross deep river how many be drowned in attempt to swim expected when in afternoon troop came in that must see utterly dispirited body of men be surprised when irish who be first to return to camp marched along smoking pipe joking a if have returned from day of triumph rather than of failure be animated by knowledge that have done men must do have proved be worthy successor of countryman who have won glory in so many hard fought field that shadow of reproach must fall upon for share in day work although have suffered far more heavily than other brigade returned more cheerfully yet there be depression anywhere evinced although there be anger fierce anger that have not be able to get at enemy grim determination that next time met thing must go differently good many prisoner have be lost party have spread along among bush lined river maintained steady fire against boer entrenchment facing of have not heard bugle sounding retire when be aware what be being done have left shelter rushed across open ground to join column majority being shot down a did so others have waited among bush intending to try after a soon a fell back boer have again crossed river spread along bank have thus made prisoner who be in hiding there in little dongas among so captured be fourteen of devon a many gunner with colonel hunt colonel bullock major macwalter captain goodwin vigor congreve total loss in killed wounded prisoner amounted to about one thousand five hundred of whom nearly half belonged to irish brigade evening searchlight have be placed on lofty hill visible from one end of high kopje held by garrison of ladysmith flashed news that attack have failed that garrison must be prepared to hold out for time yet news of reverse created tremendous sensation throughout natal where have be confidently anticipated that army must brush aside without difficulty opposition of boer relieve ladysmith advancing sweep invader out of colony in england too sensation be scarcely le pronounced for first time gravity of war in be engaged be recognized hitherto have be thought that fifty thousand men must suffice to bring to successful conclusion now be perceived that at least double that number must be required offer of colony to aid mother country with troop have hitherto be coldly received be now accepted thankfully although military authority must not a yet recognize that volunteer must be relied upon a real fighting force there be talk that of militia regiment might be embodied large number of reservist be at once summoned back to rank at front matter went on a before be now known how be that gun have advanced so far colonel long have sent forward of mounted men with two officer boer allowed to approach river bank without firing shot one of scout actually rode across bridge to other side returning to battery reported that there be boer about be only after receiving message colonel long took gun forward to within six hundred yard of river twelve hundred of fort wylie wounded be taken to frere estcourt where hospital have be prepared hart lyttleton brigade be sent back to frere camp at chieveley be moved nearer to station for convenience of supply because position now taken up be more defensible one be le exposed to fire of big boer gun large number of transport animal waggon be brought up country be known that newly landed division under general sir charles be now coming up one regiment somerset arrived in camp two three day after battle loss of cannon be to extent retrieved by arrival of lb howitzer battery be dull work in camp more impetuous spirit be longing to be employed in annoying boer by frequent surprise at night a must have achieved permanent advantage must have be attended with considerable loss of life sir redvers buller set face against such attack went steadily on with preparation a troop came up anticipation of certain success when next forward movement be made be generally entertained chris companion passed time pleasantly enough being old friend have plenty to talk about occasional scouting expedition to east gave certain amount of employment not having be engaged in attack on hlangwane did not participate in soreness felt by rest of colonial at failure to capture hill owing to want of support from lord dundonald cavalry barton brigade chagrin felt at mistake have be made in not making prime object of attack be general for boer must be seen working unceasingly at entrenchment have not only made ford by throwing great quantity of rock stone into channel have also built bridge so that force on hill must be speedily reinforced to extent what must have be effected on day of attack by battalion of infantry must now be very serious undertaking even by whole division lad be chatting one day over chance of next fight most of taking very sanguine view what do say chris one of said after discussion have gone on for time have not given opinion opinion doe not agree with yours chris replied after what saw other day think difficulty of fighting way over mountain be so enormous that doubt whether will ever do there be chorus of dissent well will see said hope that will do just a much a do be tremendous business have doubt sir redvers will go on trying must not be surprised if at heart have doubt that can be done boer have more gun that have number of maxim hotchkiss keep up stream of ball boer trench enable to fire at without showing anything head except when stand up have to move across open if drive out of one position have others to fall back upon be not one natural fortress that have to take dozen of know foot of country occupy while know nothing just what can see at distance well if sir redvers thought a do why must go on hammering at for several reason peter in first place if ladysmith saw that there be chance of rescue must at last give in in second place if

far a possible what boer position be on side whether have placed body of skirmisher on south side of river a did opposite fort wylie included in party be hundred strong be johannesburg section when well away from camp be broken up into small party better to escape observation of boer on hlangwane other height instruction given by commander be that must take advantage of ground to conceal movement from enemy where ground near river be level fit for galloping must dash across if not fired at must skirt along bank mark if there be track by horse cattle have at time come down to water observe if similar track be to be seen on opposite bank a must show that though possibly only in dry weather river be fordable there where ground be too broken rock covered to permit of horse passing rapidly across be to dismount crawl down river to make observation only small portion of troop have be engaged on work main body be to keep along on hill maintaining vigilant watch over country to south east a well a around a many party of marauding boer be known to be still across river knowing sharpness of lad captain brookfield have told off section to explore river bank choice excited jealousy among rest a be hoping for brush with wandering party of boer satisfaction of rescuing cattle good might be carrying off instruction to chris be that be to detach two of party at mile choosing point where must best make way to river unobserved a with main body must go up considerably farther pair when have searched section be to ride mile so back from river fall in with main body on return riding rapidly along chris carried out instruction until when twelve mile from camp remained with only sankey with country have passed be rolling from time to time have caught sight of small party of captain brookfield scout arriving at spot where there be slight depression running down towards river said may a well follow sankey will deepen into donga presently doubt can leave horse there go on on foot look to a if have be used a path of course may only have be made by cattle going down to water may lead to drift if be must be more careful for be just at point that boer be very likely to be on look out rode for distance then dismounted knee haltered horse moved forward cautiously chris still believed be on track heavy rain of week before have sent water rushing down in torrent must have destroyed mark there might have be when must see opening to river in front of climbed side of donga seemed quiet stopping taking advantage of bush crept forward to edge of water there be sign of break in opposite bank there be drift here chris said if there have be there must be pas cut worn down on other side now let push on show more than can help boer lurking on other side must hardly miss hundred fifty yard must say be about width after walking little distance along suddenly came upon break in bank there be break opposite sankey ten to one be drift question be how deep be can see river be not a high a be by four foot dare say that will be lower yet if get week of fine weather be very important to find out will try to ford be hardly likely there be boer so far down have rifle ready keep sharp look out on opposite side minute later went down slope keep back under shelter of bush a soon a go in sankey then stepped into water waded out in few yard be up to waist then deepened slowly be third of distance across when two rifle cracked out from bush on opposite bank chris felt sudden smart pain in ear instantly threw down in water diving made for shore allowing stream to take down swimming a hard a long a must came for moment to surface turning on back before did so only raising mouth nose above water took long breath then sank again swimming time towards shore breath lasted until be in water too willow to swim farther leaping to foot dashed up bank threw down heard two bullet hum close to boer have not be looking in direction only caught sight of in time to take snap shot crawled along through high coarse grass feeling very anxious a to what have become of sankey have heard report of boer rifle there came reply from friend who must assuredly have be lying in shelter in readiness to shoot a soon a saw flash on opposite bank must have forgotten to take cover instant entered water must possibly have remained standing there watching two shot have be fired one have certainly hit ear have other be aimed at sankey crawled along until came to point where must see down on to road to horror sankey be lying there on back chapter xiii prisoner exclamation burst from chris lip a saw sankey on ground be answered by from friend thank god that be there chris have be in awful state about saw go down into water just a be bowled over made sure that be killed be in state a may imagine till two more shot gave little hope for a have not be killed in first might have escaped others what be matter with sankey where be hit be hit in arm ca tell much about only know went slap down there be certainly something matter with shoulder like idiot did not take shelter a told be watching so anxiously never thought about if have not be fool must have jumped up got under cover at once fancy must have knocked head a fell at rate did not think about moving till heard two shot be just a well that did chris said must have put dozen bullet in with mauser before have moved foot question be what be to be done have got rifle chris yes stuck to expect be all right cartridge be quite water tight question be how to get out of line of sight best plan will be for to roll over over sankey said expect will hurt bit be odds do yet let think if ca contrive plan of attracting attention do anything foolish chris sankey said earnestly must rather jump up make run for than that anything must happen to will be careful sankey first thing to do be to find out whether there be only two of fellow dozen where be lying now ground be foot lower than be just at edge of bank will put cap on rifle raise so a just to show instant did so three four rifle cracked two bullet passed through cap a dropped shout of triumph rose from boer at once crawled forward a did so five of ran down bank a many more stood up believing that scout have be killed throwing magazine into play chris fired three shot in close succession then rolled over two three yard dozen bullet cutting grass at spot have just left peering cautiously out again saw that boer have disappeared except two one of whom lay apparently dead just at edge of water other be sitting down be waving white handkerchief be not going to shoot chris muttered though know fellow with must put bullet at once into sankey if thought that be alive hullo there shouted in dutch will let carry off wounded man dead one if will let carry off dead comrade answer be three bullet have drawn back yard two before spoke be in shelter thought of firing again at wounded man did not enter chris mind crawled back to spot where have before spoken to sankey latter be looking anxiously up be all right asked yes well wish must not do sankey said angrily if do will get up can either pot take prisoner be as sankey be going on right have shot two of there be about dozen of over there must say now let talk reasonably of course if be sure must not cross must make off to where horse be ride out meet brookfield others a come back order be that be to join in about hour half must give time to go seven eight mile farther for to do work thoroughly be afraid that if went away boer must presently guess have done so must come across carry off though must be joke for to be taken prisoner to pretoria must be good deal better than for to have two three more rifle bullet in body be sure must have be to move so must risk anyhow will stop for hour there will be plenty of time then for to make off meet others chris crept forward again watched opportunity hour later saw what thought be head appear at once fired rolling over a before instant have pulled trigger three four shot answered own almost instantly there be laugh told that have practised same trick that have done have only raised hat to draw shot again there be silence for time then went back told sankey that be about to start right chris will be very glad when have gone will get hit sooner later if go on firing will be great deal more comfortable when be once off believe will venture across drift know how straight shoot chris crawled back for distance then got down into road have scarcely done so when shot rung out fifty yard away right leg gave way fell with shout of triumph two boer ran up to chris did not attempt to move rifle have flown from hand a fell lay five six yard away surrender said when ran up to well rooinek exclaimed be brave young fellow to make fight alone against dozen of must have be wiser if have gone away when be lucky enough to get up bank without being hit what be use of staying by dead comrade be not dead chris said be hit in arm shoulder knew if moved must be hit again to certainty where be hurt in calf of leg be lucky for boer said that stumbled just a fired now get up will carry across drift helped up other assisted on to shoulder man clothes be wet illustration with shout of triumph two boer ran down did swim river chris asked there be drift mile lower down be bad one managed to get across knew that be alone a seemed determined to remain here made sure of getting a came near to sankey chris called out can get up sankey have beaten be very glad to hear voice sankey replied a raised into sitting position when heard that shot behind made sure be up with where be hit only in calf luckily gentleman who be carrying stumbled just a fired got ball there instead of through head serf right for not having thought before of might cross somewhere else take in rear well ca be helped might have be good deal worse other boer have picked up two rifle now entered river stream in middle be breast high boer with rifle told sankey to hold on to be glad to do for force of stream almost took off foot other boer have now left hiding place received when reached opposite bank one who seemed to be leader said not unkindly have given great deal of trouble young fellow killed one of comrade badly wounded if have left alone must have be very glad to have let alone chris said boer laughed at light heartedness of prisoner then examined wound chris have a said be hit in calf ball have entered behind have come out close to bone chris believed that must walk thought best to affect not to be able to do so wound have bled very little two hole be no larger than must be made by ordinary slate pencil sankey have be hit just below shoulder ball have in case also gone right through from position of two hole be evident that must have passed through bone boer bandaged wound told to lie down under shade of bush then took place near bank to watch drift again suppose have journey to pretoria before sankey said care so much about because be only fortune of war be awfully sorry that be taken chris through beastly folly in not taking shelter a told oh may just a well be together sankey besides mean to go to pretoria can assure believe must walk now if tried may be sure mean to try must advise to avoid making movement with arm make put in sling when start with have better be sent up with wounded prisoner rather than with others wo look so sharply after wounded will be very hard if can not manage to slip away somehow hope others will find horse right that if horse will find own way back oh be safe to find sankey said confidently there will be hunt for when be found that have not joined others anyhow will search to morrow be quite sure that of fellow will be out first thing in morning dare say will take couple of native with if start at point where turned off will track horse down donga without difficulty even if have strayed away will soon have yes suppose will be right chris agreed of course have got spare horse must miss own think be a fond of a be of a sun got low two of boer brought up four pony be grazing little distance from river lifted chris on to one helped sankey to mount then taking seat on other horse rode off at walk arrived hour half later at camp in hollow behind fort wylie here be put into large tent where thirty wounded prisoner be lying german surgeon at once examined again bandaged wound be of hurt badly said in english fortnight will have little to complain of mauser bullet make very slight wound except when hit vital spot be good deal better off than most of comrade here a be now dark lay down at once after taking basin of excellent soup german ambulance be scrupulously clean more serious case be put in bed le severely wounded lay on ground between for number of wounded to be dealt with be very large in tent in boer be treated be many terribly mangled by fragment of shrapnel lyddite shell boy be time before went off to sleep for wound smarted good deal however presently fell off be broad daylight when woke chris lay where be while sankey got up went round tent men belonged to either devon queen own regiment most of be awake asked anxiously for news from chieveley looked disappointed when heard that be likely to be time before fresh attempt be made to relieve ladysmith be right there of course be disappointed that did not get in have provision enough to last for time yet boer seem to think so one of men said a be carrying in here heard one of say that have certainly got ladysmith now for provision there be pretty nearly exhausted in few day must have to surrender if did not meant to carry by assault think will do sankey said confidently not soldier replied scornfully will find that be very different thing meeting chap in open to what be squatting in trench blazing away without giving a much a sight of be beastly cowardly way of fighting call be not hit till just end of day have be blazing away from six in morning never caught sight of one of must not have minded being hit if must have bowled two three of over first after breakfast surgeon said to two lad will be sent off in hour slight case be to go on there may be battle day room must be made for fresh batch of wounded very well sir chris replied a have to go make difference to whether be to day next week be colonist suppose a have not name of regiment on shoulder strap yes sir belong to johannesburg know face be dr muller be not yes recognize be son of mr king sir comrade be son of dr sankey know doctor said be not one of who think that uitlanders have grievance be not here by own choice be commandeered have option in matter well be sorry for lad for though believe that in long run people will certainly win think will be good many month before be in pretoria fight splendidly watched battle until wounded began to come in way regiment by railway advanced under fire seemed a if nothing must live for minute be marvellous brave a be will never force way through hill will never get to ladysmith well perhaps will meet day in johannesburg again yes doctor suppose will be taken up in waggon will for time certainly know about friend oh do order to be sent up with doctor be if will not hurt too much see wound be really more serious than mine a ball have gone through bone yes have good many case of sort seem to be healing rapidly however will strain point give instruction that be to be among who must go in waggon thank sir boy said sankey added be great friend sir though care for myself must be great comfort to to be together wound really hurt good deal have doubt doe surgeon said ca expect ball to pas through muscle bone without causing pain hour later native came into tent under direction of surgeon carried out chris three others whose wound be comparatively slight placed in waggon already contained eight other wounded prisoner sankey with arm in sling walked out be lifted into waggon into must indeed scarcely have climbed without assistance seven more be collected at other tent waggon then moved off joined long line be waiting on road more presently came up when number be complete native driver cracked whip with report like pistol ox got into motion twenty mounted boer kept by side of waggon followed road until within four five mile of ladysmith then turned off crossed klip river came to spot where hospital camp have be erected here halted for night wounded be provided with soup bread such a be able to walk be allowed to get out stroll about surgeon who accompanied train doctor in charge of hospital attended to serious case be carried into tent for night thus making room for others to lie at length in waggon only three of contained british wounded others be occupied by boer chris sankey excited admiration of wounded soldier by conversing with boer native in own language most of boer indeed must speak english perfectly did not now condescend to use even refused to speak in dutch to lad a dislike to colonist who have taken up arm against be even more bitter than felt for soldier for six day travelled on at end of time chris felt sure that must walk without difficulty have at very considerable pain to night undone bandage have with finger scratched at two tiny wound until be red inflamed so that on two occasion on be examined by doctor appeared to be making little progress towards healing inflammation be however only on surface after several furtive trial chris declared that be ready for start move be generally made before daylight in order that considerable portion of day journey must be got over before heat became very great be quite sure chris be a sure a anybody can be who have not actually tried may be little stiff at start believe that once off will be right for eight ten mile after first day ought to be able to do double that have be travelling at rate of about twelve mile day halted that night near newcastle chris heard from guard that must only go a far a volksrust there be put in train reason why have not be done before be that railway be fully occupied in taking down ammunition store that carriage truck be available watch at night be always of slightest kind boer have thought whatever that of wounded must try to escape two be posted at leading waggon contained store medical comfort might if unguarded be looted by native driver rest slept wrapped up in blanket in empty house might be near at nine o'clock boy told others in waggon that be going to escape have before informed of intention to do so somewhere along road have taken down name regiment of of with note a to condition address of friend have promised to give to commanding officer if got safely back have filled pocket with bread in waggon having contributed portion of ration that evening after hearty shake of hand round many low muttered good wish stepped out at rear of waggon with boot in hand be light night figure of two men on sentry over store waggon must just be made out there be thought of regular sentry duty marching up down among boer two men have simply sat down together to smoke pipe chat until turn came to lie down lad therefore struck off on opposite side of waggon making way with great caution to avoid running against of boer be soon far enough away to be able to put on boot walk erect how doe leg feel chris feel stiffer than expected certainly have doubt will soon wear off must take quietly till warms up bit gradually feeling of stiffness passed off going at steady quiet pace made way along road to have returned after have gone far enough to be sure that be beyond hearing of boer kaffir from time to time stopped to listen for tread of horse must have be long way in still night air be met overtaken after walking for five hour came upon stream a knew crossed line at ingagone station ran into buffalo have gone ten mile decided to leave road here follow stream up mile then lie up chris admitted that must not go much farther a must not cross stream for distance must not even putting wound aside do better than stop here sankey be equally contented to rest for arm still carried in sling be aching badly doe not feel sore said inflamed anything of sort just ache a if have got rheumatism in dare say will have for time have heard father say that injury to bone be often felt way for year after be apparently well pain coming on with change of weather however be great odds neither wanted anything to eat have taken long draught when first struck stream a soon a found snug spot among bush short distance from water lay down be soon asleep remained quiet day only going out once after careful look round to get drink of water starting again a soon a darkness closed in walked on with occasional rest until within few mile of glencoe having followed line of railway where have chance whatever of meeting anyone here again halted at stream have agreed that must on following night cross line between glencoe dundee take southern road by british force retired after battle there by route must be altogether out of line of boer coming from utrecht vryheid towards boer camp round ladysmith stock of food be however now running very short ate last crust before starting that evening did earlier than usual a be determined if possible to get bread at dundee knew that few of resident have remained there probably there must not be many boer about for a dundee lay off direct line from ladysmith to north there must be reason for stopping there sankey have insisted on undertaking business alone be of use talking chris said positively can run ca may not be able to run quite a fast a must suppose arm will make much difference anyhow must swing for bit must match against boer on foot will cross line a agreed about mile from dundee when strike southern road can sit down close to will go in like chris said see that must be best thing wish have farmer suit with then must not fear at think that make much odds chris lot of boer have taken to clothes of very much same colour really only noticeable thing about be cap if come upon loyalist will see if can get couple of hat for of straw felt must be right well worry will be rum thing if ca bring out something for breakfast dinner to morrow forget little bit extra for supper to night sankey chris laughed that crust went very short distance feel game for at least good sized loaf although said good bye to friend cheerfully chris felt more down hearted than have done since have said farewell to mother more than two month before a sankey disappeared in darkness leaving sitting among bush close to road last word have be be somewhere about nine o'clock now if be not back by twelve wait longer worry about if be caught have doubt sooner later will give slip again think there be real occasion for to bother unless by unlucky fluke be safe to get through right then with wave of hand started confidently along road met one until be close to town first thing have determined upon be to get hold of hat somehow house be scattered irregularly about in outskirt of town very few light be to be seen in window of course have be plundered said to if only have light have doubt must be able to find old hat somewhere among rubbish in dark there be chance whatever presently saw light in window in detached house of size made way noiselessly up looked in party of five six boer be sitting smoking round table place have not be sacked said to therefore there be doubt owner be traitor be beastly custom boer have of wearing hat indoors a well a out still there be almost sure to be spare one in hall boer out on veldt must not be likely to posse more than hat wear fellow living in such house a must be safe to have variety for different sort of weather at rate must try took off boot then stole up to front door turned handle noiselessly a expected light be burning there door of room in men be sitting be not quite closed after have stood still for minute eye accustomed to greater darkness outside took in surroundings to great delight saw that four five hat of different shape material be hanging there heap of long warm coat be thrown together on bench looking round still more closely saw five six rifle in corner by door to be hanging a many bandolier first took down two felt hat of different size picked out two of coat then with great care to avoid noise took two rifle with bandolier from corner crept out through door closed behind carefully for if found open boer might look round discover that of good be missing whereas one of coming casually out even with light must not be likely to notice put on one of bandolier then coat then slung one of rifle behind then after putting on boot went out with other article hid inside gate of evidently deserted house hundred yard from other felt sure that even when loss be discovered there must be no great search made for thief must be supposed that passing kaffir have come in stolen thing must consider that until following morning must be useless to look for feeling now perfectly confident that must pas unsuspected entered principal street here there be good many boer about none paid slightest attention to presently came to store be still open owner be of course dutch have be pronounced loyalist when sankey be last in dundee have evidently thought prudent to change side when british left sankey have be in shop twice with willesden have found man very civil a thought honest fellow with so much at stake dared not trust now food must have be certain if have to obtain by threat must do at one of outlying house must be dangerous anyhow for though must frighten man into giving what required must not prevent from giving alarm afterwards while be looking on mounted boer stopped at shop door dismounted at once lifted large bundle from saddle look here said to shopkeeper have just come into town having ridden up from near greytown picked up loot at house have be deserted here be twenty bottle of wine lot of tea know how much there be chest half full emptied into cloth what will give for be riding home to volksrust want three loaf couple of bottle of dop footnote common country spirit rest in money bargaining lasted for minute storekeeper saying that wine be of use to for boer ever spent money on wine tea of course be worth money have now large stock on hand must give little for however bargain be at last struck boer brought out bread two bottle of spirit placed in saddle bag then went back into shop to get money moment entered sankey moved quietly up to other side of horse transferred bottle of spirit to own pocket then thrusting loaf under coat crossed street turned down lane twenty yard farther on have gone few step when heard loud exclamation followed by torrent of dutch oath stood up for moment in doorway heard sound of heavy foot running along street have left with loud shout to stop thief who have robbed instant that have passed sankey walked on again in five minute be in outskirt of town made way to place where have hidden other thing taking up walked briskly on until came to bush where friend be anxiously expecting a uttered name chris sprang out have not even begun to expect back sankey how have done see that have got on hat coat be only part of have got three loaf two bottle of dop coat hat for rifle ammunition a well a clothes for gun that see over shoulder how on earth did do sankey honestly dear chris perfectly honestly rifle clothes be fairly spoil of war loaf spirit be stolen from thief consider to be good action let go on will tell about a walk here be bandolier slip on first there be coat hat now will put sling of rifle over shoulder there be complete boer of first water will carry bottle bread now let be going on then told chris how have obtained spoil have hearty laugh over thought of enraged dutchman rushing down street shouting for eatable of have be bereaved be splendidly managed sankey will have to appoint a caterer instead of willesden pay honestly for want for mess see that if entrust charge to will not have to draw for farthing upon treasure chest how be arm feeling have almost forgotten have arm sankey said excitement of thing drove out rheumatic might have supper chris suggested must wait till can get water ca take dop neat how be going to mix when do get water have not thought of chris sankey said in tone of disgust well suppose will be reduced to taking mouthful of poison then long drink of water to dilute will not have very far to go because if remember crossed little stream three four mile after rode out from dundee be a hungry a hunter must destroy pleasure of banquet if have to munch dry bread with nothing to wash down after walking two mile farther came upon stream going fifty yard up so a to run risk of being disturbed sat down enjoyed hearty meal chapter xiv spion kop be almost pity that did not commandeer two pony saddle while be about chris laughed a set off again feeling better for meal only want that to complete outfit must have mentioned before started chris there be saying what might not have done really without joking pony be one of easiest thing going to steal when there be boer about always leave standing just where dismount will be in store drinking place for hour at time without attending to be not difficulty risk for even if thief get off with pony be almost sure to be hunted down be regarded a sort of offence against community man whether native mean white must get very short shrift if be caught on stolen horse yes know still for if must come upon saddled pony there be chance of getting off with must take without hesitation a fair spoil of war yes so must for betting must be very strongly against running across owner in next place must greatly increase chance of getting safely through be fact of being on foot will attract attention must walk about camp full of boer without anyone noticing to walk into camp must seem so extraordinary that must be questioned at once boer travelling across country on foot must be sight hitherto unknown there agree with do think that when get to helpmakaar can do to morrow evening if make good long march to night have better see if ca appropriate couple of pony can walk boldly into place one must notice be new comer there be sure to be pony standing about will be hard if can not bag couple then can ride by road south from there to greytown after crossing tugela strike off by place where have fight near umbala mountain must be good landmark for from there follow old line back to estcourt must be rather shorter to go through weenen there may be boer about few mile must save must not be worth risk made long journey night slept within seven eight mile of helpmakaar started late in afternoon when near town left main road passed through field came into place way a have entered by road be likely to be questioned once in little town walked about at ease did not seem that there be great number of boer there town be well within district held by such loyalist a remained be sure to be keeping a much a possible without house in front of principal inn be nearly score of boer pony lad considered must be altogether too risky to attempt to take couple of a owner might issue out while be doing however stood watching for time there be sound of singing merriment within for quarter of hour one came out if have taken couple of pony at first sankey said savagely might have be two mile away by time yes know that be too late now wait till strike up song with chorus none of be likely to leave room while be going on will drown sound of hoof there be few people about in street even have anyone passed a be mounting must not tell that be not legitimate owner if anyone must come out chris said try to ride away must have whole lot after in minute be not likely must have got hold of fastest pony besides must shoot before got far so if anyone doe come out raise alarm jump off at once run round nearest corner then into first garden come to must be in one before must come out mount pony give chase once among garden must be safe if man who come out doe not shout must pay attention to ride away quietly if pony happen to belong to friend of must not be likely to interfere for must suppose that be two of party who have left place without noticing if give shout jump off at once rush round corner of nearest house waited for minute two then two boer came out mounted couple of pony rode quietly down street at moment song be struck up be lucky if anyone come out see mounting will take for two men who have just ridden off then strolled leisurely across street took rein of two of pony sprang into saddle started at walk twenty yard farther be quickened into trot two men have fortunately gone in other direction once fairly beyond town quickened pace now be boer over chris said exultantly there be one thing sankey must be careful not to go near solitary farmhouse there must still be loyal men left in part if fell in with small party of temptation to pay off what have suffered might be irresistible yes chris certainly must not shoot unless certain of bringing down for if one escaped must return with party strong enough to wipe out altogether however need not trouble about for present though doubt will be well to be careful when be once across tugela well will be there long before morning be not more than seven eight twenty mile rode fast for be possible that when loss of pony be discovered someone who might have noticed go down street might set boer on track in case must certainly be hotly pursued pony however turned out to be good animal a lad be at least couple of stone lighter than average boer must not be overtaken unless of pony happened to be good deal better than after riding at full speed for eight nine mile broke into walk stopping few minute to listen knew that must be able to hear sound of pursuit at least mile away a pony must start fresh again be able to take thing quietly so sometimes cantering sometimes walking reached river at about one o'clock in morning on opposite bank stood little village of tugela ferry here there be drift there be occasion to use ferry boat except when river be swollen by rain now reached only just up to pony belly therefore crossed without least difficulty after passing through village left road struck off across country to south west when four five mile away halted at donga leading pony down turned loose to feed ate supper be soon asleep be no longer necessary to travel by night at eight o'clock started again kept sharp look out from eminence once twice saw party of mounted men in distance made detour to avoid so far a be aware however be not observed distance to be ridden from last halting place be about thirty five mile at one o'clock be within five mile of estcourt on eminence about mile in front of saw solitary horseman be evidently one of scout chris said dare say there be party of somewhere behind if be not mistaken can see two three head against sky line be head stone must know more about if boer have bagged glass when took two three minute later sankey said little black spot have gone so be head dare say be wondering who be put down a boer a loyal farmer though there can not be many of left in district presently from behind foot of hill six horseman dashed out

bottle of wine gave what little remains have of bread to pony then led quarter of mile out of town camped out with there boer coat coming in very useful next morning started at daybreak arrived at camp at chieveley just a friend be sitting down to breakfast be received with shout of welcome torrent of question be poured upon will leave sankey to tell about chris said must go report to brookfield get name struck off list of missing will not be five minute away captain received chris a heartily though not so noisily a comrade have done have be very anxious about said after first greeting when came back to point where left did not find there thought there might be mistake that have ridden on picked up others be not uneasy until got into camp found that did not return then two of friend took fresh horse rode out again taking two of black with black found place where have left following track down came on horse then went on till saw river in front of black traced footstep along near bank till came to spot where there be evidently drift a road be cut down to water on side then crawled along till must look down into road be time away returned with news that have seen below on road patch of blood mark of body in mud step said have gone down to water have not come back crawling along by edge of bank found empty cartridge said whoever have be up there have crawled once twice to edge above sunken road where other be lying that have then gone back from river afterwards down into road little farther there seemed to have be fall then two men with big foot came to spot asserted carried one who have fallen there down to other must not see what have happened then for be evident that boer be in force on other side of river dared not go down farther to examine track enough have be seen however to show that must have be wounded be pretty certain that have not be killed for if so boer must not have troubled to carry body across drift now chris let hear story if mind captain brookfield chris said with smile will put off telling for half hour fact be breakfast be ready have only have one square meal since went away be yesterday at estcourt go by mean captain laughed breakfasted hour before came in forgot that be possible that have not done so be full half hour before chris returned when did so left sankey still telling story of adventure have made very little progress a have declared that must not enjoy breakfast if be obliged to keep on talking time when chris on part have told story to captain brookfield latter said ca say that be altogether surprised to see back though certainly did not expect for long time for felt sure that if sankey be not seriously wounded must manage to give slip before got to pretoria thought must hear first news of at durban for must be shorter easier for to make way down again to lorenzo marque than to follow line must certainly have gone way if have not escaped until be near pretoria be great deal easier to slip away from waggon than must have be if have be once put into train hope sir have not be returned a missing for will have frightened mother terribly if have be thought that there be occasion to give name until have be away for month if be not heard of by time must consider certain that be dead at pretoria knew that a say must be terrible shock to mother if be to see name among missing while must do harm to anyone if kept back for month put down a missing first time after corp be engaged well be just back in time for big fight though be not likely to take part in be supposed to be secret a to precise position order have be privately circulated morning dundonald with regular cavalry natal horse south african light horse went on four day ago with one two other colonial corp occupied springfield baggage train followed after occupying place instead of waiting for infantry to come up moved on to river of men with extraordinary pluck swam across managed to bring ferry boat over under very heavy fire then number of crossed scattered boer like chaff took possession of rough hill called swartz kop held till support came up be capitally managed affair one can not regret that same care be not shown at hlangwane be to go on afternoon a be not in dundonald brigade expect that duty will be a be in last fight to guard baggage what will dundonald brigade do general opinion be that will push round to acton home be not sure that whole force be not going that way must be grand thing if must be done doubt whether train must carry enough store for must be long way round must probably have to fight two three time at least might take five six day then most of infantry have gone on already yes hart hildyard brigade have marched straight from frere by way did hear of boer attack on ladysmith on night of th be night be at glencoe on way up did hear very heavy firing at least be not certain that be firing rather thought be distant thunder storm firing began at two o'clock in morning captain brookfield said be so heavy that everyone turned out lasted four hour there be doubt that boer be making determined attack everyone wondered that did not at once make diversion when day broke must be seen that number of mounted boer be hurrying off from camp among hill towards ladysmith be not until two in afternoon five battalion of infantry marched down towards colenso naval gun opened in earnest on line have effect of bringing boer scurrying down again to trench fellow marched in open order worked way nearly down to colenso be more strongly garrisoned than have be at time of last attack doubt have seen preparing to advance strongly reinforced garrison gun be taken long way down at six o'clock trench be bombarded then came on to rain boer ceased to fire at seven o'clock men turned into camp firing in ladysmith have ceased time before what have taken place there chris asked anxiously for know place have not fallen must have heard of beat boer off splendidly however have hard work to do for heliograph flashed signal at about nine o'clock in morning to say that have so far beaten off enemy be much pressed heard next day that have indeed be case caesar camp have be taken retaken several time by men at point of bayonet by boer by rushing up in overwhelming number be said that have twelve hundred casualty boer at least fifteen hundred of whom large number be bayoneted say loss fell chiefly upon free stater who be put in front by transvaal people fought pluckily several of commander be among killed must think that must hardly try again native got through two day afterwards with despatch have not heard what contained fancy from what have leaked out that defence be very weak ought to take lesson from boer chris said saw something of trench a went up railway valley be wonderful yes must do boer justice to say that be not afraid of hard work ever since first came here have be at work everywhere day in week including sunday of course a be not standing on defensive there be occasion for to construct work to same extent can not myself understand why throw up battery for gun pushing forward zigzag night advancing battery until can plant naval field gun within hundred yard of colenso when must be able to smash entrenchment in time effectually cover advance across bridge one of drift when be in army be always said that next war must be fought with spade a much a with rifle so far have seen nothing of spade except just by gun be also taught that strong position held by steady troop armed with magazine gun supported by good artillery be absolutely impregnable against direct attack grant dundee elandslaagte belmont enslin on other side seemed to contradict idea experience here be other way if keep on knocking head against hill suppose axiom be likely to be finally confirmed then think that be going to fight way into ladysmith captain brookfield not direct into ladysmith possibly may work way round after what saw of fire from position trench above trench mile upon mile in length own conviction be that allowing to utmost for gallantry devotion of men will never win way across hill then move off at two o'clock sir yes fresh batch of waggon be going on be to escort if reach springfield by to morrow night may think lucky for of officer who went with first lot have come back say that road be simply awful there be dongas to be passed where waggon sink up to axle at one point ninety ox be fastened to single waggon must not pull out from hole in be sunk there must be now if one of woolwich traction engine have got hold of drawn out be doing splendid work if war office authority can take lesson to heart next war go into will have five hundred of not single transport animal must cost money doubt must eat nothing drink nothing must only require to be oiled cleaned occasionally to keep in order when be wanted must do work without having to hunt world over for transport animal must save cost in one war there must be thousand driver stoker instead of twenty thousand camp follower must not matter whether country be burnt up dry deep in grass must drag fuel with must save artillery horse by dragging gun till be in neighbourhood of enemy might not look so pretty picturesque a present system must be enormously more useful in long run vastly more economical must like to see kitchener put at war office with authority to sweep out hercules in augean stable must be nothing to chris laughed at earnestness vehemence with commander spoke went on be old army man have be a staunch believer in army tradition a man tell fairly that be disgusted at amount of routine work delay if may use word priggism see going on be not surprised that colonial to man be convinced that must manage matter infinitely better if be left to must harass boer night day sweep plundering party out of land make circuit matter how far into zululand come down behind cut line of railway blow up bridge worry out of colony say must succeed be sure must try believe firmly five thousand mounted colonial fighting in own way must relieve ladysmith clear natal sooner than with thirty thousand will do be not saying that must succeed in continental war though must certainly harass bother regular force four time own strength to succeed must require gun greater degree of discipline than have got force must be absolutely invaluable a assistant to regular army repeat what say chris there be good deal of soreness of feeling on side already want utterance of mine to add to still can assure have be relief to to let steam off at appointed hour maritzburg scout colonial corp started with train of two hundred waggon with immense exertion made eight mile before became dark men be more often on foot than in saddle sometimes roping horse to side of waggon to aid ox sometimes putting shoulder to wheel working with score of others with railway sleeper have be brought for purpose to lever axle out of deep hole into wheel have sunk think ever knew what be to be really dirty before field said a finally dismounted prepared to camp thought did know something about mud can see did not feel that be sort of animated pie must be cooked comfortably in oven if must get big fire stand round crust might peel off really see other way there be one advantage in be that will be able to skirmish if necessary across sandy muddy country without possibility of being made out more than fifty yard away by keenest sighted boer what do propose captain chris if there be running water near course must be clear must lie down by turn be rolled over over thumped with stone rubbed with anything came handy till be in state of comparative cleanliness why running water chris asked why not pond pond field said contemptuously why sir before section alone be washed water of anything short of lake must be solid there be general burst of laughter well field do almost a much good a wash peter said anyhow be better off than others have got tent spirit lamp can have tea with degree of comfort be more than others will be able to do now a have not running water think might a well scrape a much of mud off a can must almost rather remain a be field said hitherto have felt rather proud of appearance a only got uniform when came up here have always have tent to sleep in looked great deal cleaner than average now will be conspicuous for dirtiness in spite of what field say will adopt suggestion peter have better help kaffir to get up tent first chris said then can do scraping while be getting supper ready be very lucky that have water skin filled before starting must hardly taste tea if have be made from water from of spruits tent be erected then jack knife be taken out giving mutual aid to other succeeded in removing at least main portion of mud done sat down to supper fortunately rain have come down steadily greater portion of day have now ceased with tin of cocoa milk fried ham biscuit made excellent meal le fortunate comrade brought kettle be boiled for one after until who have waited up in hope of turn coming have be served a carried tea ration bread be able to make fairly comfortable meal instead of going supperless to bed must otherwise have done a few must have cared after hard work to go out into veldt to gather soaked stick must hardly have be able to light have found small ration of spirit water be given to of five native then lad crept into tent feeling that after thing might have be much worse chapter xv spion kop country immediately round springfield be level well cultivated with pretty farmhouse orchard scattered about little distance to west rose two hill swartz kop have be occupied by mounted infantry spearman hill named from farm near base here general buller have established head quarter spearman hill be generally called mount alice be very important position here naval gun be placed fire commanding greater portion of hill on other side of tugela also potgieter drift where be intended passage of river must be made swartz kop be le important position though also dominated wide extent of country a ridge on other side covered important point from fire mount alice be selected a position for naval battery also for signaller a from here direct communication must be kept up by heliograph flash light with one of hill held by defender of ladysmith illustration naval gun on mount alice be late on th when convoy maritzburg scout be escorting arrived at springfield day have heard boom of artillery rattle of machine gun musketry along line of hill on other side of tugela from height of mount alice groaned in spirit a laboured at work of assisting waggon that be thus employed when hard fighting be going on within eight mile of at past two that day lyttleton brigade have moved forward along foot of mount alice to force passage of river at potgieter drift a soon a boer caught sight of must be seen galloping forward to take place in trench thunder storm that burst torrent of rain screened movement of advancing troop from view for time enabled to near river without having to pas through shell fire from boer battery on hilltop between mount alice river brigade passed across meadow ploughed field reached ferry boat be stuck fast hour be lost at point before party of sailor colonial troop accustomed to such work came forward to aid of engineer speedily got into working order in meantime scottish rifle rifle brigade have moved along bank to drift although usually almost dry water be now coming down breast deep two gallant fellow went across when found line of willow water returned guided comrade over rush of water be so great that many must have be swept away joining hand crossed in line although be broken several time be always reformed not many life be lost a soon a of troop have passed lined bank until two battalion be over then advanced over low hill clearing out few boer who occupied advanced trench by six o'clock ferry boat began to carry main body across taking over company at time be not until half past three in morning that horse waggon gun of brigade howitzer battery be on northern bank whole brigade established on ridge mile beyond river maritzburg scout be delighted at receiving order on morning after arrival at springfield that be to move forward at once encamp close to spearman farm to furnish orderly for carrying message for general started at once after hour fast riding arrived at point assigned to twenty men officer be at once sent to farmhouse took with three tent have brought in regimental waggon erected fifty yard from house rest of troop established camp at point indicated by staff officer quarter of mile away have be two o'clock in morning before convoy have reached springfield horse men be alike tired out a soon a breakfast have be prepared eaten most of trooper turned in to sleep chris dozen of party however obtained leave from captain brookfield to ascend mount alice see what be going on from half past five tremendous fire have be kept up on boer position naval gun be distributing heavy lyddite shell among entrenchment distant from three to six mile occasionally throwing up missile on to summit of lofty hill known a spion kop away to left front not le steadily effectively howitzer battery be pounding boer position at eight o'clock lad reached top of mount alice watched with intense interest picturesque exciting scene here be far better able than have be when at chieveley to see general aspect of country on right from grobler kloof hill after hill separated apparently by willow depression rose from higher point occasional flash of fire burst out a gun tried range against on mount alice whose height however failed to reach spion kop stood out steep threatening summit being hundred foot higher than of mount alice must now see that be not a have appeared from distance isolated almost conical hill be in fact connected with hill farther to left by ridge of be termination immediately behind be deep valley ascent from side be to extent commanded by gun on mount alice swartz kop between spion kop river there be flat belt of country be along that lord dundonald have ridden with brigade of cavalry to acton home where be still stationed point of greatest interest however be at trichardt drift lying six mile west of mount alice from look out must make out division under command of sir charles warren advancing to ford a far a must see serious opposition be being offered must however in interval of silence of gun hear dropping musketry fire in direction few round of shot from warren field gun be evident that only small party of enemy must be disputing passage peter who be intently watching what be going on through glass said be at work at two point on river think be building bridge naval gun dropped few shell among farm building orchard facing spot where troop be gathered a hint to boer that be well within range that have best abstain from interfering with what be going on in hour from time troop reached bank two bridge have be thrown across river passage began by ten o'clock whole be across firing soon after ceased be troop bivouacked quietly be over for day lad returned to camp next day passed quietly except in afternoon boer entrenchment near spion kop brakfontein hill facing position occupied by lyttleton brigade be pounded by naval gun howitzer message be heliographed from ladysmith two thousand boer be seen moving towards acton home a occupation of village be of value until infantry arrived there cavalry be recalled to position where must protect warren left flank from attack on th warren pushed forward portion of force with view to driving back boer right gaining main road leading through dewdrop to ladysmith while woodgate brigade watched spion kop fighting went on day british forcing enemy back step by step on th began early continued whole day inch of ground be contested stubbornly by boer irish brigade who be in hottest position pressed back fiercely with sudden rush have rest of division kept up with advance might have cleared way through enemy centre cannonade to advancing troop be exposed be terrible maxim nordenfeldts heavy cannon field piece captured from month before hurled shot shell incessantly among while rattle of boer rifle be continuous still fair progress be made with le loss than might have be expected in such strife two officer only be killed captain hensley of dublin fusilier major childe who be most popular officer have presentiment that must fall actually asked friend evening before to have tablet placed over grave with inscription be well with child be well at three o'clock fighting slackened heavy thunderstorm seemed to be signal for firing to cease later sir charles warren summoned officer commanding corp pointed out that there be not sufficient food remaining to allow of wide circuit by acton home to be carried out gave opinion now have won so much ground be better to continue to advance by shorter line on be pushing that in order to do be necessary that spion kop whose fire must take in rear must be captured be unanimously agreed to general warren then saw commander in chief obtained consent to change of plan be not however considered necessary to take spion kop until troop have farther advanced sunday fighting be continued a before progress made be slower a boer be largely reinforced fresh gun brought up nd be comparatively quiet situation be not improving five mile of rough ground have be won in a many day fighting force be becoming lengthened out line weaker lyttleton force have to guard line from potgieter drift to warren right against attempt of boer to cut line of communication woodgate be similarly employed in keeping line from trichardt drift to warren left became increasingly evident that not much further progress must be made until left of advance be protected by establishment of gun on great hill be then on rd decided that woodgate brigade must assault spion hop night be known that be not strongly held starting at six o'clock column made way slowly with vast difficulty up ascent be everywhere rugged rocky in many place so precipitous that men have to be pushed pulled up by comrade colonel thorneycroft led way with few men finding out spot at ascent be practicable scouting on side to discover if boer be hidden behind followed woodgate leading men be in bad health quite unfit for such climb in spite of remonstrance have insisted upon going although be obliged to be assisted at more difficult place distance be not more than six mile be not until nearly ten hour after starting that summit be gained hilltop be enveloped in mist be unseen until lancashire fusilier who be leading be within fifty yard of top then boer challenged directly fired rifle almost instantly dozen of comrade joined bringing magazine into play opened fierce fusillade aim be hurried must scarce see foe lancashire men cheering loudly rushed up to crest without loss boer did not await arrival only one of be bayoneted before turned to fly two three be overtaken by eager soldier a soon a boer have gone troop set to work to construct breastwork to hold spot have gained against attempt of boer to recapture ground be too rocky for digging stone be scattered thickly about be used for purpose long before breastwork must be completed dropping fire be opened by enemy morning be gray misty cloud hung heavily on hilltop a cleared off slowly must be seen that position be le favourable than have seemed for flat crest extended distance beyond point have entrenched from rock low ridge hot fire broke out before mist cleared off boer have crept up in considerable force be be evident preparing to retake position have be wrested from by six o'clock scattered fire have grown into continuous roar boer occupying not only nek flank of hill several time men made rush to endeavour to clear off foe proved too costly be now lying kneeling behind unfinished barricade in very short time cloud have lifted sufficiently for boer artillery to discover exact position from hill on three side terrible fire of shot shell from cannon great small machine gun rained upon again again party of men started to foot dashed forward to drive hidden boer facing from hiding place sometimes succeeded for time number thinned so fast that survivor be forced to fall back again to add to horror of situation shot from own gun also fell among defender officer commanding battery not having be informed of intention to occupy hill knowing nothing of situation score of men be killed wounded position be held unflinchingly at ten o'clock general woodgate be mortally wounded by fragment of shell struck in eye colonel crofton took command at once flashed message to general warren stating that woodgate be killed that reinforcement must be sent at once general coke be therefore ordered to take middlesex dorset regiment assume command immediately afterwards warren received order from general buller to appoint lieutenant colonel thorneycroft who be colonel of colonial force to take command be now hoped that be well there unfortunately buller warren be able to give undivided attention to struggle on mountain for lyttleton brigade have advanced before daybreak against eastern slope of hill running north from spion kop advanced briskly maxim clearing out boer from whose fire suffered little sustained loss from shell fire from mount alice sailor having be a uninformed of advance brigade be to make a be of capture of spion kop scottish rifle rd king royal rifle pushed on rapidly gained spur farthest north have there be gun on spion kop object of movement must have be attained advance by direct road on ladysmith have become possibility gun have reached summit troop there be so far from being able to render assistance that be with difficulty maintaining desperate resistance a two rifle regiment be therefore exposed to concentrated fire from boer battery be without support be directed to withdraw order have to be repeated three time before be obeyed fire slackened at point to extent in afternoon farther advance being attempted raged a hotly a ever on summit of spion kop a general buller warren have come up to see state of thing on important position of spion kop general coke went down in evening to explain situation stated that unless artillery must silence enemy gun troop must not support day shelling in evening two naval twelve pounder r mountain battery one thousand two hundred men a relief started to ascend hill to strengthen entrenchment on way up met colonel thorneycroft rest of force coming down officer who have displayed splendid gallantry throughout day having decided on own responsibility that position must not be longer held strangely enough news of retirement be not communicated to general buller who after reporting in despatch written next morning that spion kop be firmly held be riding to front when for first time learned news altogether be day of strange blunder redeemed only by splendid bravery of troop engaged news came a heavy blow to army be supposed that fresh attempt must be made to capture position by ascending northern spur have be carried held for time by two rifle battalion while soldier think only of chance of battle burn to engage enemy feeling only accentuated by previous failure general in command have to take other matter into consideration may feel that may conquer in next fight what be to follow in case chance of success must be smaller than before loss more serious for boer from part have united to oppose many of cannon have be brought over from position from ladysmith be bombarded advantage of surprise gained by long march from chieveley have be lost more serious still be that large proportion of provision brought at cost of so much labour exhaustion of transport animal be consumed what remained must be insufficient have fresh battle to be fought to capture position one behind held by boer general buller be last man to retire a long a there be hope of success knew that not only at home over civilized world men be anxiously awaiting news of second attempt to relieve ladysmith must have be hard indeed for to have to acknowledge second reverse in spite of sternly determined to fall back movement be admirably executed horse waggon gun soldier be taken safely across tugela without hindrance by boer fact showed how deeply have be impressed with valour of soldier sullenly angrily troop marched away have have will must have hurled against boer entrenchment until last man have fallen to necessity of situation be a nothing to retreat acknowledgment that have be beaten feeling be seldom entertained by british soldier loss have be heavy there be still enough of thought for work have to do be with deep feeling of unmerited humiliation that received order to retire feeling however be not of long endurance for two day later when have settled down in camp near tugela round spearman farm general rode through line congratulating troop on valour have displayed promising that ere long must be in ladysmith will be heartily glad when be there chris said when heard what general have promised not only for sake of town for own be really doing good here be hateful to look on when other fellow be fighting so desperately if be not that order be strict against mounted colonial corp going out over country to clear scattered boer out might be doing useful service a soon a ladysmith be relieved be to say if can hold out till get there must certainly vote that come back here instead of staying with army go on again on own account quite agree with carmichael said still be something to have seen two big fight yes brown grumbled if tell anybody that be there naturally first question will be 'what part did take in ' will have to own that took part at only looked on at distance at other fellow fighting call sickening well never mind brown chris said after during business have killed twice own number of boer at least if everyone have done a much boer must be pretty well extinct yes there be certainly something in brown admitted if have be allowed to scout on own account must be hard if have not killed twice a many more by time certainly might have done so must remember also that great many of might have be killed too one can not always expect to have luck have in two fight be sure must bitterly regret gap being made in number that must harris said warmly be good friend before nothing to what be now after living so long together roughing sharing others danger for part must rather go without more fighting than of must go down agree with thoroughly harris chris said a most of be likely to remain out here for life will often meet do hope that when talk of time sha have pleasure marred by having to say how miss so so so so must be sorry even to lose one of black have stuck to work well be always cheerful willing in worst of weather under most miserable condition must really be very sorry if of be killed needed day two for troop to recover cheerfulness be certain that must soon be launched against enemy again be known that general buller must command ground be now more known than be before plan must be better laid looked forward confidently to next engagement thanks be due to weather for renewed spirit of men rained almost unceasingly flat ground on troop be encamped be sea of mud there be one good effect in there be water in spruits men be able to indulge in wash up of clothes occasional bath although have to put clothes on wet be scarcely more damp than when took off there be other work to be done two naval gun mountain battery large cannon be with great labour got up on top of swartz kop lad have given up two tent allotted to to let rest of men have more room now felt full benefit of little shelter tent allowance throughout rest of camp be sixteen men to tent on coming in out a men be muddy up to knee be impossible to keep even tolerably clean discomfort of so many men crowded together obliged to live eat sleep in such confined quarter be very great indeed lad on other hand suffered from none of inconvenience except that must not stand up must only sit upright in middle of tent be perfectly comfortable tent be about seven foot wide on ground a much long native have cut brought in bundle of grass made soft bed one on side of tent blanket be stretched on bed doubled lay over be strict rule that everyone must take off boot on entering tent leave just inside entrance have purchased at sale of effect of of officer killed in action more blanket rug be thrown over entrance to front of tent at night made perfectly warm comfortable trench eighteen inch deep be dug round tent kept floor fairly dry blanket have be given to kaffir who constructed little shelter in squatted by day slept at night in cooking operation be carried on lad have occasion to feel dull for now knew many officer in line regiment among colonial troop a well a naval brigade brookfield boy a be generally called be always welcome be seldom that more than half of dined in own camp chris must always have be absentee for sailor have told to other story of attempt to blow up bridge at komati poort received number of invitation by mean liked to have to retell story generally made excuse other for remaining in camp battery of artillery arrived on st of january on rd of february there be sport in camp of south african light horse camp fire sing song afterwards men be now in high spirit for be certain that in day two attack must be made on sunday february th be known that move must commence next day general buller plan be to make strong feint against brakfontein highest hill of ridge connected with spion kop range while real attack be to be delivered against isolated hill named vaal krantz a viewed from swartz kop mount alice seemed to be key to whole position be thought that possession must open way for direct advance to ladysmith be now in readiness for attack sailor have with steel hawser aid of troop got four more naval gun on to swartz kop before daybreak troop be ready to advance regular cavalry be near base of swartz kop while colonial horse under lord dundonald be near potgieter drift at six o'clock cavalry went forward not far for morning be so misty that artillery must not make out boer position until hour later when tremendous fire be opened from mount alice swartz kop gun placed on lower spur of spion kop while be going on bridge be thrown by engineer across drift major general wynne led lancashire brigade in direction of brakfontein went forward in skirmishing order supported by five field battery howitzer battery of kept up incessant fire of lyddite shell shot against boer position fire being guided by engineer officer in balloon who be able from lofty altitude to signal where boer be clustering most thickly when bridge have be completed general lyttleton advanced with brigade across a feint against brakfontein have succeeded in gathering greater portion of boer at spot supposed to be most in danger lancashire brigade be withdrawn retiring in excellent order movement being covered by incessant firing of gun with completely dominated of boer lyttleton brigade now pressed forward under storm of musketry shell from machine other gun be answered even more thunderously by british artillery din be tremendous greater even than have be previously heard seemed impossible that men must live for moment in such storm of missile pressed on unfalteringly battery with a steadily maintained fire though shell fell continually round among battery have gone out with lancashire brigade now directed fire against vaal krantz having moved across from brakfontein under tremendous fire one of waggon lost horse five artilleryman with manned wheel brought safely out of fire at three o'clock lyttleton brigade advanced in earnest dashed forward at double against vaal krantz heedless of rifle fire from hill on flank from front defender soon lost courage a saw durham rd king royal rifle dashing up hill with bayonet fixed scarce two hundred of remained till british gained crest be speedily scattered bayoneted position when won be found to be unsatisfactory for be dominated by hill beyond must not be seen from british look out station cannon of spion kop be able to sweep plateau at one time boer gathered made effort to retake hill two more battalion be sent up to reinforce defender enemy be driven back fire gradually languished troop remained on ground have won during night from prisoner learned that four thousand boer occupied doornkloof hill on flank that whole of transvaalers under joubert be gathering in front baggage waggon be collected by river in readiness to advance way be not yet sufficiently cleared for boer gun on brakfontein spion kop commanded road must have to traverse be evident to that advance be possible until gun on height have be silenced

general buller held council of war at general be present opinion be unanimous that boer position must not be forced without terrible loss that when arrived at ladysmith must add to number shut up in town a might be found a difficult to force way out a to arrive there general hart pleaded to be allowed to make attempt on doornkloof with brigade strongly held a position be be deemed impossible that must be captured by single brigade original intention be that gun must be taken up on to vaal krantz that with assistance strong force must wheel round take doornkloof in rear owing to discovery that former hill be dominated from several point be found impracticable to carry plan into execution order be therefore given for supply column have advanced distance to retire a movement be being carried out boer kept up heavy fire upon waggon on hospital relying upon protection of red cross flag have advanced within range here a upon almost occasion enemy paid respect to geneva emblem although when a once twice happened one of shell fell near ambulance of theirs have sent in indignant protest against conduct night next day movement to rear continued not only be infantry moved across tugela gun on swartz kop mount alice be removed order be given for general retirement to springfield proof that next attack must be made in entirely different direction chapter xvi colonist adventure in morning after battle order be issued for greater part of troop to return to chieveley among first to leave be maritzburg scout be heartily glad to be off during three preceding day position of cavalry have be galling one have seen nothing of fighting being kept down at potgieter drift in readiness to advance moment that order came have nothing to do to stand sit down near horse watching fire from enemy battery on hill bursting of lyddite shell among outburst of brownish yellow smoke rendering easily distinguishable from sudden puff of white vapour caused by explosion of shrapnel shell of artillery how battle be going be only known from wounded men brought down from front report at first be encouraging became evident on following day that progress be being made evening when sun set colonial regular cavalry returned to camp for be certain that must not act at night when became known on wednesday evening that retreat be ordered news came almost a relief for suspense have be very trying after dinner chris went into tent where officer of troop be gathered a usual talk be of battle in short time captain brookfield said let try get away from subject have talked of nothing else for past three day defy anyone to say anything new about be not pleasant subject richards be in last war know took part in defence of standerton suppose tell about that be one of few pleasant memory of time know that there be much to tell about will let know how came to take share in be exciting time for for be never so near rubbed out in life just before last business broke out happened to be returning from pretoria intending to sell for anything must get large farm owned in leydenburg district of late boer have be getting so offensive in manner that thought something must come of made up mind to sell out at price return to natal when rode into leydenburg found that two hundred fifty men of th regiment be starting next day with large train of waggon for pretoria a be frequently in town have made acquaintance of several of officer thought must be pleasant to ride down with a made difference whether got into pretoria day two earlier later general idea be that war must come of one thought must begin without usual notice warning told officer must not trust boer further than must see for that more treacherous set of fellow be not to be found on surface of earth still must own have more idea that attack must be made upon than have well know what came of be going along hollow with rising ground on side when without slightest warning tremendous fire be opened from flank can hardly be said that there be resistance troop be strung out along line of waggon number be shot down before single musket be fired in defence main body such a be fought stoutly a must only catch occasional glimpse of head of enemy while be altogether exposed there must be one end to hundred twenty men be killed wounded in few minute to save rest from similar massacre officer who commanded surrendered fired few shot at first a soon a saw how must end rode for be with rear guard when firing began so took back track a soon a firing ceased saw dozen boer galloping after blood be up a may imagine on getting to dip jumped off horse left in shelter threw down on crest of hollow a came within range picked off one who be nearest to that brought others up with round turn retired little way then dismounted separated proceeded to stalk exchanged shot for hour two killed got a see by scar on cheek graze however think must have tired of game first suddenly saw dozen boer galloping across country in direction be doubtless party who have arrived too late to take part in fight if can call such treacherous massacre fight hearing sound of shot be riding to see what be going on saw that thing be getting too hot ran down to horse again rode along in hollow fortunately hid from sight of men have be fighting riding up have therefore about quarter of mile start when heard shout knew that be after after what have happened did not dare ride for middleburg a there be saying whether place might not have already risen so there be nothing to depend upon speed bottom of horse be fairly good animal nothing particular have have easy time of while on march for have only done fourteen fifteen mile day might have have hope must outride men in pursuit of must be joined by more men on fresh horse from boer farmhouse village came near besides news of intended attack on convoy must have be known far wide occasionally shot be fired a be riding at gallop boer be doing same have great fear of being hit gained little at first after two hour riding be about same distance behind a when have first started on chase felt that horse be beginning to fag bit sun be setting for attack have taken place in afternoon kept on till be too dark for to make out pursuer of whom be not more than three hundred yard behind then while horse be going at full gallop leapt of without checking trick most hunter can do chose spot because must make out that there be low scrub close to road stooping among ran forward be glad to hear that horse be still galloping at top of speed deprived of weight must probably get good bit farther before be taken if did keep on hoped must do for have evidently entered into spirit of chase have laid back ear whenever boer raised voice in yell rifle be fired be yelling pretty hard when passed urging horse on in belief that chase be almost at end heard more of boer time for a soon a have gone on ran at top of speed for distance then broke into trot by morning must have be thirty mile away decided to make for standerton for there felt sure must be safe for at place be considerable english population must certainly hold out have colt rifle with brace of revolver for even when went down to leydenburg heard that several englishman have be maltreated one two shot by boer met tramped for four day a attack on troop have be made on th of december be now christmas eve have not ventured to go near boer farm for fortunately have shot springbok be therefore under trouble a to food on previous day have not come across water heat be terrible so felt that came of must go ask for drink saw farmhouse about nine in morning made for a approached woman came out of door seeing re entered two boer with gun in hand ran out who be shouted of course speak dutch a well a english shouted back that only wanted water englishman shouted again 'yes be said what difference doe that make ' saw gun go up to shoulder flung down shot went over head be turn now fired twice two boer rolled over walked forward now ready to fire on instant a there might be more of woman ran out man went straight up be screaming over body of men heaped curse on a came up slung rifle behind taking out pistol said 'your men brought on only asked for water fired at want to hurt of if attack must protect ' several time thought must have done so sight of pistol cowed walked straight into house dipped pannikin into pail of water took long drink then filled water bottle went out though cursed again did not attempt to stop a rather feared must understood when before have gone fifty yard heard horse hoof looking round saw girl riding at full speed across veldt have doubt gone to fetch men who be away to next farm to summon assistance draught of water have done world of good soon broke into run though did not conceal from be in bad fix once out of sight of farm changed course did so several time in course of next two hour then on getting to crest of high ground saw river mile away felt sure be broot spruit before starting to walk down looked round little over mile away must see party of fifteen boer ran at full speed down slope must see other place where must make fight of many of river have like here steep bank must at least sell life dearly must only be for time for of boer must cross spruit take in rear still there be nothing else to be done when reached bank gave shout of satisfaction river be in flood there must have be rain up in hill know how quickly stream rise unless boer knew of very willow place there must be crossing for be running like mill stream except at waggon drift bank be almost perpendicular at rate must not hope to swim half across before boer came up so must fight out where be have scarcely found point where must get comfortable foothold on bank with head just above level when boer appeared on top of hill stopped for minute then broke up scattering rode forward felt sure that must have made for river a there be other place where must be concealed when came within couple of hundred yard of dismounted three four came forward on foot when nearest be within hundred yard of fired at so short distance with so good rest must not miss before smoke cleared away winged rest ran back hastily sent shot two among a be consulting with result that rode off three four hundred yard farther back did not attempt to return fire for except when raised head for moment must see nothing of doubtless learned from woman have colt rifle brace of revolver that if be to make rush across open not many of be likely to reach after talk two three of mounted horse rode so a to strike river above below intending doubt to cross if found place where there be chance of doing so felt pretty sure that must hing till be dark then must crawl up make rush be certain anyhow that must not give up a there be two of number lying on veldt besides two at farmhouse there be however more pluck in than have given credit for for about mid day began to advance crawling along ground a if stalking quarry men who have gone out on horseback have returned just a others started crawling up three of galloped away down stream determined at once to shift position bit so a to put off evil hour pulled stone a big a head out of clay of bank put on edge where head have be then got down into water be waist deep at couple of foot from bank above be too steep to walk along have gone hundred yard when saw seven eight inch above water level hole pushing arm in found be place where good bit of bank have caved in laying gun pistol down on ledge felt about farther at top went in nearly three foot be higher at back than be at water edge at rate afforded good chance of safety holding revolver chamber of rifle ammunition above water stooped until must get into hole be just wide enough for purpose then pushed back to end found there be just height enough for to sit with mouth above water back sloped so that have to dig heel into clay to prevent from slipping forward be not comfortable position be secondary consideration have noticed a came along that river be already falling so that have fear of being drowned a long a kept position with trouble fastened pistol ammunition on brim of hat rifle be holding between knee there sat hour after hour fortunately being pretty near midsummer day water be not cold have at least consolation of knowing what state of fury boer must be in must have seen by footstep where have entered river just below where have be standing doubt must have gone along top of bank to see if have come out of water again when reached friend on horseback heard have not swum down river must have concluded that must have be drowned have managed to cross must have seen climb opposite bank in hour water have fallen to shoulder when became dark be waist deep where be sitting to make long story short by midnight water be below foot still falling rapidly waited couple of hour then started to cross be about fifty yard wide be fully half way over before reached chin stream have lost much of force have difficulty in swimming across rest of way though water be deep until be within couple of yard of bank then climbed bank made off saw nothing more of pursuer three day later arrived at standerton remained there til end of war for gallant little town repulsed attempt of boer to capture be narrow escape indeed richards captain brookfield said if have have wit about boer must certainly have got be first rate hiding place think many of must have thought of adopting now will someone else give yarn two three more story be told then party broke up feeling better for having for hour avoided standing topic two day later be settled at chieveley again be generally believed that next attack must take place very shortly that must probably be directed against colenso that evening farmer came into camp horse have dropped dead mile away stopped a passed through tent of scout asked where must find general captain brookfield who heard question stepped out from tent with chris to whom have be talking why searle be thought voice be familiar to what be have ridden in to get help other day raiding party of boer came down through inadi riding in between dingley dell botha castle know hill swept off quantity of cattle have not penetrated so far before one about thought that there be danger while be attacking up here one of farmer rode to greytown for help most of young men there have joined one other of colonial troop fifteen of said that must go out seemed that there be not more than fifteen twenty boer well ca tell about for a be matter of life death have not moment to lose however came up to north of botha castle have sharp fight two of men be killed five of boer rest rode off set to work to bunch cattle a be at be attacked suddenly by party sixty seventy strong fellow that have driven off have evidently come across brought down upon made running fight horse be not so fresh a theirs seeing that have speed of made for empty farmhouse a rode up brought down several of there be wall round yard boer drew off for bit to consider then dismounted planted round house in such shelter a must find within two three hundred yard affair began in earnest first day kept up heavy fire to must make little reply for be certain death to lift head above wall to show one self at window even for moment lost three men way during night tried to carry place be at wall have best of a have only to show head while be altogether exposed there be not much firing next day be evident that meant to starve out there be not scrap of food to be found in place fortunately there be small thatched kraal inside yard gave forage for horse next day killed one of for food night agreed that when boer saw that did not surrender in day two must be sure that must be eating horse a food brought with must be exhausted must then make determined attack for knew have killed eight ten of that must not go away so decided that only hope be for one of to ride here tossed up who must try to get through boer lot fell upon took best of horse have agreed from first that must have to be done have given what scrap of bread must spare to besides be in fair condition a yard be strewn with rubbish party of boer have ripped up bed straw mattress scattered content about of be sure to be on watch rode at walk made for north a side be le likely to be watched have gone about two hundred yard when man jumped up just in front of rifle be ready before must lift shot then clapped spur to nay horse there be tremendous hubbub shot be fired at random in direction doubt whether must have seen after have gone fifty yard rode for quarter of mile due north then turned west have fear of being overtaken for although boer must have horse close in readiness to mount if must try to break out must have got good quarter of mile start be not likely to keep up chase long a must not tell way might have doubled if pursued far must be in direction of greytown be about seventy mile ride a started about twelve have done in nine hour foundered horse fortunately did not drop till be within mile of camp now where can find general will find at frere be afraid will be of use have tried again again at least one other of have done so to let go out scouting will not hear of though whole of colonial be terribly sore at leaving whole country at mercy of boer marauder now that will probably be at work here again directly be le likely than ever to let anyone go ca go without order suppose captain brookfield shook head be just a much under order a regular troop be must be serious matter indeed to fly in face of repeated order on subject farmer made gesture of despair captain brookfield chris said speaking for first time think that by term of enlistment in corp be to be allowed to take discharge whenever asked for be so chris then beg now sir to tender resignation from present moment chris have twenty men by what searle say there be sixty seventy of of whom ten so have be killed well sir have fought against nearly hundred before now got best of besides will have help of little party shut up however now that have resigned be affair suppose that if rejoin will have objection to re enlist captain brookfield smiled must have objection certainly chris general buller might have suppose will know of having be away sir have plenty more serious thing to think of than numerical strength of troop a news of skirmish thirty mile north of greytown be not likely to be reported in paper at rate to attract attention think need trouble on score besides if be reported must only be said that one of besieged party escaping returned with small body of volunteer have collected name of maritzburg scout must not be mentioned be sure that mr searle must impress necessity for silence about point on friend well accept resignation chris headstrong man will have way indeed have great faith in accomplishing somehow relief of party farmer have listened with surprise to discussion between lad captain brookfield latter now turned to said young gentleman be commander of twenty lad of about own age have be in two serious fight in case against boer force much superior to in number have a much confidence in a in men in troop be good shot admirably mounted can be perfectly sure of can take assurance that if twenty men can relieve friend will do so will be able to ride back again with sir can mount certainly can if friend captain brookfield can furnish with meal before start will with much pleasure how long will be before be ready chris hour sir left rubbing down horse when came in here quarter of hour ago will take very short time to pack up start very well dare say that mr searle will be ready by time breakfast will be ready for in ten minute searle while be eating will tell enough of gentleman doings to reassure for see that feel very confident that will be able to tackle boer after what have said captain brookfield can have doubt that will do can seems to that twenty men twenty boy be match for fifty sixty boer while be speaking chris have returned to camp lad be engaged in rubbing up saddlery can knock off at once chris said have need for no longer belong to maritzburg scout there be general exclamation of astonishment what do mean chris mean have resigned in own name yours captain brookfield have accepted resignation be really in earnest chris very much so will not keep in suspense small party of greytown men be besieged near botha castle one of have just ridden in for help know well enough that buller will not hear of detached party going out over country captain brookfield told farmer that be of use going to general that none of colonial troop must leave camp without order a be evident that there be nothing more to be done must not leave man friend to be massacred only thing to do be to give in resignation at once of course now that be done accepted be at liberty to mount ride off where please when have done work will come back reenlist one will be wiser will start in hour need not take tent pole anything blanket waterproof sheet there be lively satisfaction at news that be again going to be employed in what considered proper work what will do about men store willesden asked know that two big box of thing ordered at maritzburg arrived yesterday think willesden will take jack two zulu

fellow off to have resigned be sick of doing nothing a be known that drew pay ration news did not create much surprise be lucky fellow one said get share of fighting full share of hardship still wonder stop till be in ladysmith when be that going to be field asked innocently have be told that will be in ladysmith in week many time since first came up here in middle of december be nearer now than when arrived here do think that must guarantee that must be there in week because if so might put off going trooper shook head with laugh be question man in camp can answer said perhaps in week perhaps in fortnight perhaps added more gravely never know by message flash out that be nearly at end of food if get there in fortnight thereabout motive for going on may be at end in case suppose will wait here till robert have relieved kimberley march on bloemfontein will send free stater scurrying back in hurry even transvaalers will begin to think that be time to go then suppose will advance clear natal out well perhaps may be back again to help by time field answered be heartily tired of place of watching boer making position stronger stronger day be about same with trooper grumbled for one wish must go down with to maritzburg have week off must be such comfort to sleep in dry bed to dress in dry clothes that doubt whether must ever have strength of mind to come back again wish that general must issue order dismounting filling up gap in line regiment with then at least must have chance of fighting doe not seem likely ever to come to here be not going to leave big box behind be yes be going to leave in care of captain with note saying that if turn up again before ladysmith be relieved be to be handed over to poor beggar there there be one thing can not say be that have be short of food for army service corp have done splendidly one have ever be hungry for hour except when on long march engaged in battle if everything have be worked a well must certainly have reason to complain if be own master must afford must go down to durban take passage for myself horse for port elizabeth then go up enlist in one of yeomanry corp with robert when once start there will be plenty of movement on side while here even if get to ladysmith may be fixed there for one can say how long see what be here if boer lose heart defend biggarsberg drakensberg will find at least a much difficulty there a will here be quite certain that ladysmith men will take long time to recover from what have gone through a for cavalry fancy horse have be eaten if have be out here with instead of being cooped up in there must have be able to make hot for boer when retire to keep on run with so small force a have must hardly be able to do so besides have so many line of retreat free stater can go over to left to van reenen other pass commando can go east there be plenty of ford on buffalo must retire on vryheid while main body must make stand at biggarsberg a always seem able to carry cannon off with cavalry must hing without artillery infantry there have be no pause in work of preparation while be talking horse be now saddled food divided saddle bag packed blanket waterproof strapped on chris went across to captain brookfield tent be ready for start sir officer looked at watch be three minute under half hour chris how much ammunition be taking with hundred fifty round sir of suppose will use above ten at outside still there be never saying if must get besieged will want horse be ready for mr searle be ready too farmer said getting up from table stretching ought not to have sat down must ride a far a most at twenty have not done so much for last fifteen year feel stiff in limb however will be all right when have gone few mile wash have before breakfast have done world of good now sir be ready whether will succeed not thank with heart for coming with good bye chris captain brookfield said expect will turn up again like bad penny before many day have gone hope so sir chris said must be sorry to miss end here after having seen so far chapter xvii rescue when chris went out with captain brookfield farmer lad have shaken hand with friend be standing by side of

for draw horse ration now sir will be off gave word mount lad in second swung into saddle good bye lad good luck captain brookfield said men standing by broke into hearty cheer there be strong suspicion that party be not going down to maritzburg be felt that be not sort to throw up before ladysmith be relieved suspicion be heightened when saw farmer mount ride by side of chris be gammon about resigning be not brookfield one of officer said a stood looking after why must have left two of men here with of trap store if have not be coming back must naturally give away besides noticed that farmer come in on foot hour ago there be talk of leaving before arrived have gone off with on one of horse captain brookfield smiled know about officially be that morning mr king resigned in name of party a know told when first joined did so on explicit understanding that must be allowed to resign when chose that provision be inserted when be sworn in be know officially yes if be missed question be asked have become of be answer will give what else know must for present keep to myself suppose will see back soon well consider that be within limit of possibility suppose that have formed plan yet mr king farmer said when have left camp present idea be to follow line half way down to frere if be to strike off towards country at once must of course be noticed so must rather get three mile on say be about seventy mile about well allowing for halt can do in twelve hour must be just a be getting dark of course will not show ourselves till begin to attack house hope will find friend still holding out hope so indeed see boer be quiet when started must hardly think that must make attack again after left seemed to have settled down to starve out be quite possible that now have got away will grow nervous lest must bring help up be very likely to make attempt evening must be pretty sure to succeed time for there be only seven of left there though must make good fight in daylight must have real chance if boer went at in earnest be sure to do next time agreed before started that must not do to try to defend yard after left be going to pile everything movable against door window fight hard to keep boer out must then go upstairs sell life dearly how far be boer horse out about five hundred yard away in dip know always keep three four men on guard there for have seen come out of hollow sometimes cattle have driven off yet yes four of boer twenty thirty native went straight on with a soon a have driven into farmhouse be afraid there be use thinking of getting back depends upon how far have gone chris said rain have brought grass up a likely a not may halt when get to good pasture wait till others join be not likely that gang came from one place expect that have be gathered up from lonely farmhouse where have escaped commando will want to divide plunder between trust other bit must cheat fellow of share if must so must think that what suggest be likely enough that have be arranged to wait when come to good place till others arrive be not thinking of rescuing be if thrash boer at farm will certainly have try did carry off two three thousand head about two month ago from hand of at least a large party a see why must not do again be near mount umhlumba be party did that farmer exclaimed why be talk of whole district of cattle belonged to friend of mine told how have be saved from ruin well sir after will feel more confident than acknowledge have be up to now captain brookfield told about going into boer camp in disguise to komati poort how surprised party of boer looting farm near dundee did not mention that in fact have only just finished telling other affair when came in saying that be ready to start well well be wonderful that party of young gentleman like yours must have done such thing did not hurry horse for most part went at steady canter to animal be most accustomed occasionally must walk for bit at weenan where crossed bushman river halted for hour for double that time after crossing mooi at intembeni then a sun began to lose power went fast until when reached one of farthest spur of botha castle farmer said when get over next rise will see house chris gave order to dismount going forward on foot threw down when close to crest crawled forward until obtained fair view sankey chris be again provided with glass having bought on day before starting at sale of effect of several officer who have fallen in fight at vaal krantz gazed intently for time at house thank god be right so far chris said to farmer can see boer lying round house that dark clump be horse so ride have not be in vain suppose be about mile half from here see gate into yard side be that corner of house hide be on eastern side will be quite dark in hour when be so will move down bit farther then will halt till hear attacking must not go nearer for moon will be up by time if have known that must have got here before dark need not have troubled to bring zulu intended to send forward to see how matter stood then must have guided right up to gate however a have got gun can shoot will add to panic attack will create will be pleased at chance of at last getting shot at boer be complaining to other day that be very happy in other respect be very much disappointed at not having have fight native be indeed delighted when on chris rejoining told that must take share in attack on boer chris friend threw on ground after sending up jack to crest to keep watch farmer said dare not lie down if did must never get up again have indeed to be lifted off horse when dismounted can quite understand that chris said feel stiff tired must be almost made of iron to have ridden one hundred forty mile almost without halting if anyone have told that must do must not have believed of course one be on horseback good many hour day often after going round farm start at two three o'clock ride into greytown back be only matter of fifteen mile way still when one have got seven men life depending upon one one make big effort tell what mr searle best thing can do be to strip lie down will set two zulu to knead will find quite new man after be good idea king will adopt for hour two men rubbed kneaded farmer muscle from head to foot exerting until perspiration streamed from then one of brought up one of water skin poured content over have certainly done world of good farmer said when have dressed say stiffness have gone certainly feel worse than did when got to camp must never have thought of be what be done after turkish bath chris said have have often at native do something of same sort make little hut of bough fill hole in middle with hot stone pour water over steam believe get rubbed too a soon a considered dark enough to be perfectly safe led horse down until judged that be within mile of house then dismounted waited chris have already made arrangement carmichael who be leader for time being of one of section of five be with party to ride straight for boer horse directly attack began firing at house must act a guide to spot where be placed be if possible to attack from behind be to shoot down guard not to pursue if horse bolted on hearing attack on house what have to do be to stampede chris said a soon a have got on run keep going if scatter do scatter too boer without horse will be at mercy stop till have driven five mile away then can halt till morning a come back be likely enough to hear firing can then ride towards join get within rifle shot of boer want life thrown away if hear three shot at regular interval during night ride towards sound may want here be just ten o'clock when there be violent outburst of fire at farmhouse sprung into saddle now carmichael do gallop on get a close a can to horse without being observed go at walk last hundred yard so horse guard be not likely to hear be sure to be up on edge of dip watching farm stay quiet till hear yell then go straight in to in case may manage without getting shot at for a likely a not will have strolled up without rifle a soon a carmichael little party have started chris moved on with rest at walk there be occasion to hurry said will take boer time to force way in hotter be at work le likely will be to hear in two three minute ordered to canter be of use charging expect that be inside yard be however at fast pace that rode up towards wall chris blew whistle cheer of white warcry of two zulu burst out at top of voice give to hot lad chris shouted for benefit of boer kill man jack of scoundrel at once nineteen rifle opened upon dark figure clustered round house use magazine chris shouted again let man of get off appalled by sudden attack ignorant of number of assailant mown down by terrible fire boer on two side of house exposed to did not think of resistance who must do so made rush round to other side joining companion there clambered over wall made for horse have already gone a chris have anticipated four guard be watching farmhouse did not hear approach of carmichael party a chris whistle sounded galloped forward at volley three of boer fell other fled at once with loud shout charged in among pony who be already kicking plunging at sudden sound of firearm minute later be in full flight followed by five lad shouting yelling firing have be unnoticed by boer round house when on arriving at hollow found horse gone gave vent to alarm rage in many strange oath then scattered in flight over country be of use trying to pursue chris said a soon a be found that boer save lying dying dead have escaped from yard must only ruin horse have done big day work already besieged must be heard hastily removing barricade against door in two three minute ran out almost bewildered at suddenness of relief when thought that nothing remained to be done to sell life dearly few hurried word explained position to gratitude to chris party be unbounded first step be to attend to fallen boer of there be eighteen wounded eleven killed a soon a in power have be done for former have be carried into house blazing fire be lit in one of room party gathered there now mr king searle said be baa of party what do think have best be done think first thing chris said be to post dozen men three four hundred yard away round house must not run risk of table being turned on by boer crawling up surprising may still be hanging about in number peter take harris bryan capper two zulu post round house native ear be much sharper than yours be if of think hears anything let crawl out in direction reconnoitre when whistle do come in to leaving others on guard then will tell what have decided upon four named at once went outside calling native left yard jack have already filled kettle colonist have brought with placed over fire while tea be getting ready chris said have better give good feed of mealie to horse how many of yours be there left asked one of colonist twelve have at first be unwounded evening ca say whether of have be hit since wall be too high for bullet to touch a long a boer be outside most likely a be firing through window may have hit of suppose did so because fancy directly boer began fighting here horse bunched in one corner of yard well will feed also see how many be uninjured that be matter of importance for horse will scarcely be fit for work in morning do think yours may be yes think so have only be shut up three day have have good deal of picking what with bed what be lying about in yard before good feed now will certainly set up what do propose to do well want in first place to get enough of boer pony in to mount in second to overtake cut boer off if possible lastly to rescue cattle five of party be away after horse object be to scatter be to halt

carried to greytown if recover cattle will drive down there none of farmer be willing to stay at last have to decide question by lot now chris said gentleman know country great deal better than do can tell way be most likely to take cattle be sure to go north there be other way for to go if whole party be together mounted might go up through zululand a be must not venture to do will cross tugela must say between point where mooi run into junction with buffalo go up through colsie then through helpmakaar lazarath well hope will catch long before get to tugela expect cattle will be somewhere near inadi there be good grazing along there a loyalist have cleared off long ago will have fear of being disturbed saddle be transferred from own horse to boer pony be finally arranged that waggon with wounded must not start until return jack two zulu be left with even must party of boer come along six men must be able to defend till others returned hour after arrival of carmichael party started in pursuit directed course for inadi a must have be useless to search for boer be certain that must make for point where have be arranged that cattle must cross be fifteen mile away be confident that must arrive there before boer who bad walker at best of time disheartened by failure at loss of many of companion of horse must not have got more than half way by time started be half past two when left when approached inadi day be breaking have put on boer hat knew that men in charge of herd must take to be of own party until be quite close to satisfaction saw herd grazing mile south of village be not until be within hundred yard of spot where smoke of fire showed that guard be posted that saw movement then man rose to foot looking at earnestly gave shout of alarm others leapt up at once ran towards pony be fifty yard away before must reach chris party dashed up rifle in hand surrender shouted in dutch fire down with rifle seeing that resistance be useless boer threw down weapon in minute be tied hand foot with rope from saddle be then lashed to bush at little distance from other so a to prevent rolling together loosening other cord native with have at first alarm fled at full speed be already out of sight then whole party rode to ridge quarter of mile back dismounted at foot crawled up to crest mile away fifty men must be seen wearily making way on foot towards have done quite enough in way of fighting chris said must think that have have more than enough will get to surrender if can will wait till be within forty fifty yard then fire few shot over head see what come of have good cover here be in open will know very well that there be not chance of getting away for a have horse have none must defend eminence chose to occupy ride off to if be likely to take besides must never be able to cross river under fire when boer be within eighty yard dozen rifle be discharged at once threw on ground will give chance of talking over chris said then will hail pause ensued boer must be heard talking excitedly together when thought that have given time enough to appreciate condition chris shouted in dutch hullo boer want to have to kill must certainly do must see that be at mercy if choose to surrender may go home if will let lie there a long a like shoot down when get on foot will give five minute to make up mind at end of time one of boer held up rifle with white flag tied to illustration one of boer held up rifle with white flag tied to be not good enough for chris shouted that trick have be tried too often if surrender will take off bandolier belt leave rifle behind come forward unarmed there be shout of fury among boer a found that treacherous design have failed in success will give five minute chris shouted if do a tell will open fire on before time be up boer be seen to be taking off bandolier one by one rose came forward in body without rifle chris allowed to come half way so that must not when found in superior force run back to arm again gave word party rose to foot now said a boer came up will turn pocket inside out have not least doubt that be taking off memento of visit here indeed pocket of prisoner be bulging out sullenly boer obeyed order collection be miscellaneous one have between spoil of dozen farm woman finery formed large proportion of loot be evidently intended for wife at home besides be spoon fork cutlery chimney ornament child clothes several purse packet of spare cartridge will do very nicely chris said when have be ascertained that plunder have be disgorged now gentleman be at liberty to go wish pleasant walk home be only about hundred mile friend with cattle will join at once have doubt that will be able to obtain food from countryman a go along be sure to find friend at village of may get pony at helpmakaar then paying attention to curse threat of boer party rode forward collected boer gun emptied bandolier belt then rode back to cattle released four boer with pointing to comrade told to rejoin then collected cattle driving before rode off when have gone five mile away halted farmer undertaking to keep watch by turn lad throwing down be in few minute fast asleep in four hour be roused continued course till reached farm here rested till next morning then at daybreak wounded boer be placed in waggon ammunition be divided among farmer rifle taken from boer belonged to killed wounded amounting in to eighty one be after charge have be carefully drawn also placed in waggon chris saying must be useless to may be useful to for will arm people in greytown with eighty magazine rifle ought to be able to beat off party may meet a cattle be branded will have difficulty in returning to owner a to boer pony saddle doubt there be many who have lost horse who will be glad of then after renewed expression of gratitude from farmer party separated colonist going south to greytown while scout rode west by line have come late that evening arrived at chieveley have intended to halt after crossing bushman river at weenan heard sound of artillery knew that buller be again moving forward return created excitement in camp of maritzburg scout innumerable question be asked have be on little business of own chris said beyond fact that have be successful have nothing to say know how strict order be against scouting therefore can only say that wanted to give horse change of food have taken three day off horse look better for change anyhow one of trooper said look a if have be worked off leg yes look little drawn in couple of day will feel benefit of be getting too fat before day may be able to tell more about just at present feel that be a well to keep matter to ourselves what have be doing here heard firing brought in must not have be back till to morrow nothing particular except that have be battering along line move have be made yet general idea be that will time make try at hlangwane to morrow hope will take chris said will have good deal more trouble about than must have have at attack in december when be virtually in hand whereas now look stronger than point along line chris however be much more communicative to captain brookfield who said a entered tent well chris did get there in time yes sir caught a be attacking house at ten o'clock night be too busy to notice killed eleven wounded eighteen stampeded pony bolted on foot came back in hope of surprising two hour later need hardly say failed to do then made off for place where herd have captured be waiting for drove pony in a own be too much done up to go on intercepted boer close to inadi made surrender took gun ammunition loot from let go there be forty nine of altogether did not see what be to do with must not have brought here without whole thing being made public be certainly not disposed to escort down to maritzburg will have at least hundred mile to tramp home recovered cattle about two thousand head gave to farmer to find proper owner thirty of boer horse that captured dare say will pick up more of for a be in hurry only drove in a many a wanted have casualty must hardly be called fight be sudden surprise did not stop to count bravo bravo chris now suppose be going to enlist again yes sir if will take certainly will fortunately buller be at frere until moved on again yesterday nobody have missed little camp a far a know so think that there be chance of question being asked will swear in again if will bring others round chapter xviii railway hill there be little talking that evening a soon a tent have be erected cup of cocoa biscuit taken turned in even constant booming of artillery occasional sharp crack of musketry have effect whatever on slumber just before chris lay down however orderly told that captain brookfield wished to see have just received order chris that brigade of cavalry be to turn out tomorrow morning to support infantry hildyard lyttleton barton be going object be to carry cingola be small peak at end of nek extending from to high peak of monte cristo duty of mounted infantry will be to clear eastern side of southern end of range to hold nek separating from highest peak so prevent boer from main position reinforcing defender of lower peak think that party have better remain in camp for after doing over seventy mile today wo be fit for work tomorrow must not like to be left behind here sir hill be not very far away so that must not be hard work for horse doubt must be dismounted considerable part of day then must rather go chris much rather sir must be terribly disappointed if must not go out first day that there have be chance of doing something be always a well to be on right side hardly think so many troop will really be required think be symptom that serious attack will be made in day two on monte cristo hlangwane see possession of cingola monte cristo will take pretty well round flank expect boer will be so much prepared there a be in front hour before daylight be out engaged in grooming horse having received hot mash of mealie flour directly came in on previous evening looked better than must have be expected after hard work on two day out of three by time have finished native have breakfast ready have scarcely eaten when trumpet sounded to horse five minute later mounted infantry belonging to regular regiment colonial horse formed up led by lord dundonald marched north east followed by three infantry brigade battery of artillery when within couple of mile of nek mounted infantry galloped forward selecting spot where ascent be gradual pushed rapidly up hill until reached brow here horse be placed in depression men scattered across crest be just in time for considerable force of boer from monte cristo be hurrying along to assist defender of cingola having now become evident to that be point to infantry moving across plain be making brisk fire be opened a approached boer at once stopped in surprise for a came along have be unable to see that cavalry have quitted rest of column have therefore idea whatever that way to cingola be barred a rapid fire showed that nek be held in force did not think prudent to advance farther after exchange of fire fell back to monte cristo task of infantry be now comparatively easy cingola be not held in great force seeing that retreat along nek be cut off that must not hope to resist strong force be approaching enemy contented with keeping up brisk fire for time then retreated hastily down northern face of hill scattered among numerous kopje between river lyttleton hildyard brigade occupied peak barton with fusilier battalion remained to left of base a mounted infantry have before opening fire taken shelter behind bush rock there be only two three casualty be much disappointed that affair have be so trifling be afternoon now for rest of day comparative quietude reigned although monte cristo threw occasional shell on to crest of cingola mounted infantry remained night in position acting a advanced guard to infantry have order to descend hill before daybreak return to chieveley there being water obtainable for horse service not being required for succeeding operation next morning sunday battery of field artillery have be taken half way up cingola began to shell monte cristo a if have be signal whole of artillery on plain opened terrific fire on entrenchment of monte cristo hlangwane green hill be close to monte cristo on morning of th lyttleton hildyard brigade moved forward to storm precipitous peak barton brigade marched against tangled difficult ground that surrounded green hill queen on right scotch fusilier on left led attack against peak hillside be partly wooded although smokeless powder gave little indication a to progress troop be making occasional glimpse of boer flitting among tree showed that be falling back roar of musketry be continuous a hildyard brigade lyttleton be engaged for short time there be pause then lyttleton men having gathered at edge of wood couple of hundred yard from summit advanced with rush up terribly steep rock boer fired hurriedly bullet flew for most part far over head of queen then fearful of being caught by hildyard men who be also rapidly coming up fled hastily opposition have finally be trifling vast majority of boer have cleared off rest after emptying magazine have followed example before troop gained summit upon heavy cannonade be at once opened from grobler hill fort wylie other boer position however gradually slackened under storm of lyddite shell with be pelted by naval gun important position of hlangwane be at last secured time be lost in getting up gun preparing for farther advance barton brigade have be equally successful in attack hour after capture of monte cristo fusilier crowned summit of wood covered green hill boer defence be now examined proved to be of most formidable nature on south face of hill trench be in tier line behind line most of be fully six foot deep in many case provided with shelter from weather by sheet of corrugated iron taken from roof of house in colenso in case be supported by prop covered with six foot of earth have evidently be used for sleeping living place ground be strewn with straw empty tin fragment of food bone cartridge case old bandolier large quantity of unopened tinned food sack of mealie flour here there be patch of dried blood showing where wounded by shell have be brought in laid down until must be removed to hospital under cover of night on plateau scene be similar here irregularity of ground have be utilized long line of trench intersected showing that boer have intended to make desperate resistance even after have won way up hill be in similar state of litter disorder although have saved gun have left behind large quantity of ammunition provision in hurried flight necessitated by attack being delivered in direction from danger have be apprehended four waggon full of ammunition have be left by in kloof near river have be observed by engineer in balloon position have be signalled to naval brigade who turning gun upon before long succeeded in blowing up when infantry prepared for final rush boer appeared indeed to be entirely disconcerted at attack from altogether unexpected direction while for week have be working incessantly to render hill impregnable have prepared only on face against made sure british infantry must dash nevertheless in a in action boer a soon a saw that there be risk of position being taken began early to make preparation for retreat while keeping up very heavy musketry fire on wood through british infantry be advancing began to withdraw gun speed skill with on occasion throughout war shifted heavy piece of artillery from one point to withdrew altogether be new feature in warfare except when garrison of ladysmith on two occasion of night sortie surprised destroyed three of gun scarcely lost piece either in numerous action during advance to ladysmith in final retreat from town similarly on other side of very large number of gun employed at fight on modder at magersfontein in siege of kimberley whole be with exception of few piece captured when cronje be surrounded withdrawn in spite of hurried evacuation of position feat almost unparalleled even in army accompanied only by field artillery extraordinary indeed in case of work mounting heavy siege gun farther advance be made till afternoon when general buller arrived on summit of green hill seeing that hlangwane be not entrenched on northern side be completely turned by advance sent barton brigade against loss of monte cristo have for time quite taken fight out of boer after maintaining brisk fire for short period evacuated position a soon a infantry neared summit hurrying down western slope crossed tugela three camp full of provision blanket necessary of boer life fell into hand of captor together with large amount of rifle maxim ammunition place have be turned into fortress trench breastwork covered approach by boer might look for attack a whole mountain be covered with huge boulder be able to withstand even storm of lyddite shell be poured upon on following day hart brigade received order to advance towards colenso be still held in force by boer be now commanded by gun have be got up slope of hlangwane on tuesday morning general hart captured position without serious loss boer suffering severely from shrapnel fire a retreated by iron bridge others by ford thorneycroft mounted infantry be called up in evening took advantage of discovery that drift existed there squadron forded river in spite of scattered fire from boer on opposite bank portion of colonial force occupied fort wylie redoubt have be thrown up by troop when occupied colenso have be abandoned when advance of boer to cut line between colenso frere forced to retire next morning thorneycroft regiment crossed moving to left seized kopje facing grobler kloof boer still suffering from effect of unexpected revers offered resistance abandoning camp trench redoubt retired at once to hill scout have followed thorneycroft horse in support now placing horse under shelter in abandoned entrenchment prepared to act a infantry must boer take offensive however showed intention of doing in afternoon troop who have crossed be able to examine deserted camp presented very much same appearance a on monte cristo hlangwane many of appeared to have be occupied by men of better position a many article of luxury choicer food wearing apparel newspaper bible fruit other sign of comfort littered place even here dirt have reigned supreme although must have be inhabited for long time must be seen that attempt have be made to clear away refuse to make in degree tidy a be natural effect of heat of sun on scrap of food vegetable refuse of kind caused sickening stench soldier spent a short time a possible over investigation one article must have be found in british camp be altogether absent from of enemy be joke among troop that only piece of soap ever captured be found in pocket of dead boer that wrapper be still unopened strength of position be however even more surprising than state of filth trench be enfiladed by great boulder be connected by wall of massive construction being specially case where gun have be placed in position colenso have be in similar manner rendered almost impregnable to frontal attack must hardly have be captured by assaulting force until hlangwane have be taken hill beyond railway still covered road bridge by fire have troop marched across must have suffered severely accordingly pontoon train be sent through opening in hlangwane range bridge thrown over tugela north of fort wylie dorsets middlesex somerset crossed at once ascending kopje extended line south until be in communication with thorneycroft men holding therefore railway line along river bank nearly distance between colenso pieters station other regiment artillery followed be now six day since advance have commenced for past four fighting have be almost continuous on wednesday three regiment advanced towards grobler hill in order to ascertain what force be occupying met with opposition until reached lower slope must boer be seen moving then suddenly heavy fire broke out from boulder covered whole face of hill afforded such perfect shelter that have not be considered necessary to form entrenchment a only reconnaissance not attack have be ordered force retired somerset who be leading regiment having nearly hundred casualty other regiment have a many more between next day continuous fire from point held by boer showed that large reinforcement have reached lancashire brigade under colonel wynne started at two o'clock afternoon to carry kopje up brook spruit ran in rear of grobler royal lancaster led way a soon a left shelter of ridge by side of railway be exposed to terrible fire in front from grobler kloof artillery on hlangwane still on plain endeavoured to silence enemy gun though poured number of lyddite shrapnel shell among be unable to do so lancaster advanced with greatest coolness up spruit followed by south lancaster a pressed forward be met by heavy rifle fire from kopje in front on left boer stuck to hill until lancaster be within hundred yard then most of slunk off not knowing lancaster lay under shelter for few minute until ammunition pouch have be replenished then being joined by south lancaster king royal rifle rushed to crest for past two day dublin fusilier have be lying near colenso have suffered very heavily in first attack at potgieter drift now volunteered to take grobler hill aided with fire of artillery colonel wynne brigade did in gallant style boer being evidently nervous that might find retreat cut off must lancaster advance farther up spruit on friday afternoon irish brigade advanced along line then turned off towards railway hill steep jagged eminence almost triangular in shape with one angle pointing towards river side be broken with sharp ledge covered with boulder railway passed through separating last jagged ledge from higher portion of hill rise almost precipitously running back several hundred yard at base of line be dip full of thorn tree deep wind round rear of hill here there be large boer camp little farther to rear be steep hill on enemy creusot gun be now mounted several trench be cut alongside hillside on crest be strong redoubt be most formidable position a seemed to bar progress farther up line be necessary to carry at cost mounted infantry have after skirmish towards grobler kloof returned to camp a country be so terribly broken a to be altogether impracticable for mounted men on thursday captain brookfield have obtained pas for three other officer to go to hlangwane to view operation one of being unwell captain brook field invited chris to take place after inspecting plateau made way down to left hearing that attack be about to be made on railway hill clambered down until reached point where seated in open spot among tree must command view of what be passing be awful place chris said seems to almost impossible to be carried be awful place captain brookfield agreed be one of time chris when one feel advantage of belonging to mounted corp for without being le brave than other men must regard a order to meet certain death be told to attack rugged hill ah there be irish brigade storming party consisted of inniskillings with company of dublin connaught banger imperial light infantry from building called platelayer house at mouth of spruit to foot of hill ground be perfectly open to point where left face of railway hill rose steeply up across open ground distance of mile assailant have to march here come a in open order with rifle at trail inniskillings appeared in view terrible fire broke out from ledge of railway hill while cannon joined in roar gun on hlangwane on slope nearer river with maxim quick firing gun replied on side be awful chris said speaking to rather than to captain who be standing beside think that even at badajos british soldier be ever sent on more desperate enterprise look a if nothing must live under fire even now what will be when get closer not shot be fired by advancing infantry in reply to storm of bullet from boer marksman round of ammunition might be wanted yet must only be wasted on invisible foe took advantage of what little shelter must be obtained sometimes close to river bank sometimes following slight depression afforded at least partial protection at last reached deep donga running into river be crossed by small bridge in passing over have to run gauntlet of boer fire many fell here stream of men passed on then at double rushed to sheltered spot close to foot of ascent where have be ordered to gather here have breathing space real work be yet to begin already casualty have be numerous inniskillings alone have lost thirty eight killed wounded not word have be spoken among little group on hill for last ten minute stood with tightly pressed lip breath coming hard pale face looking at scene occasionally short gasp broke from one other a shell burst in thick of men crossing little bridge cry a if have be struck when troop gained shelter there be sigh of relief will never do captain brookfield said decidedly must need ten time a many men to give chance be opinion of hoped even now that be advance party that ere long must see far larger body of men coming up there be sign of reinforcement at five o'clock troop be re formed advance began dashed forward up hill under heavy fire to supporting line replied boulder afforded certain amount of shelter of inniskillings took advantage until reached last ledge with comparatively little loss work be still before leaping over rushed down on to railway line here wire fence arrested course for moment many fell while getting through over then ran across line passed through fence on other side dashed up steep angle of hill to first trench hitherto fire of boer have be far le destructive than might have be expected attention being confused aim flurried by constant explosion of lyddite shell from british battery have one eye for assailant other for gun a of heavy piece be fired ducked down for shelter only to get up again to take hasty shot before having to hide again thus then be in condition to reckon comparatively small number of assailant a saw irishman dashing forward cheering loudly with pointed bayonet hesitated then bolted up hill to next trench instead of waiting until support have come up for rush irishman with cheer dashed across trench in hot pursuit next line be far more strongly manned storm of bullet swept among still for time kept on wasting so rapidly that even most desperate saw that must not be done turning survivor retreated to trench that have already won while support fell back to railway suffering heavily in retreat fewer than two hundred of inniskillings have fallen in desperate charge colonel ten officer being killed wounded while dublin also lost colonel through night trench be held sternly in spite of repeated desperate effort of boer to dislodge defender nothing must be done for who lay wounded on hill above morning broke fight still continued at nine o'clock desperate charge be made boer be unable to face steady fire be maintained by defender of trench again turned ran for shelter just a attack be repulsed lyttleton brigade arrived on scene exchanging hearty cheer with men who have so long borne brunt of terrible conflict durham light infantry at once relieved in trench descended hill for rest be so much needed day fighting continued while lyttleton men held to position on railway hill there be fierce fighting away to left where welsh fusilier other regiment be hotly engaged roar of artillery musketry never ceased day towards evening white flag be hoisted on side truce be agreed upon for twelve hour to bury dead scene of conflict presented terrible sight hillside between two trench be strewn with dead wounded suffering of latter have be terrible for six thirty hour have lain where fell only relief being little water in short interval during fighting kindly boer have crept down to give truce began at four o'clock in morning of sunday th foe of previous day mingled with other in sad work conversing freely with other boer expressed astonishment that attempt must ever have be made stupefaction at manner in irish have pressed on through fire in have seemed that human being must have existed for minute when informed of relief of kimberley fact that cronje be hopelessly surrounded scoffed at news a fable be so honestly amused that be evident have be kept absolutely in dark by leader captain brookfield party have remained at lookout until darkness set in after first exclamation of pain grief a saw attack fail fearfully thinned rank run back to shelter there have be little said be impossible from first captain brookfield sighed a turned if relief of ladysmith depends on carrying hill ladysmith be doomed to fall returned to spot where have left horse in charge of two of black rode back to chieveley be sorrowful evening men hope have risen daily a position after position have be carried now seemed that once again enterprise have hopelessly failed on monday there be continuation of lull of firing many of officer in camp who be off duty rode up to examine scene of fight be not surprised when saw infantry recrossing pontoon bridge wore dejected aspect especially men who have fought so heroically a now seemed in vain sat watching until last soldier have crossed then rode to top of hlangwane chris party have come out who have not before seen view waited there for couple of hour ate refreshment have brought with discussed difficulty lay in way of farther advance probable point against general buller must next direct attack hullo chris exclaimed suddenly that pontoon train be not coming back to camp do see after moving to point where passed through range have turned to north again not to south hurrah buller be not going to throw up sponge time boer have not done with yet indeed be case general seeing railway hill be too strong to be carried by assault unless with enormous loss of life have caused river to be reconnoitred distance farther up have resulted in discovery of spot where with little labour troop must get down to river pontoon bridge be again thrown such spot be found by colonel sandbach of royal engineer strong working party be at once set to work to make practicable approach point lay three four mile below railway hill most formidable of obstacle must therefore be turned that night troop crossed boer who be in ignorance of what have be going on point chosen for passage being at bend of river hidden by intervening eminence from position be astonished at finding strong force again across river a soon a news reached camp that army be again crossing satisfaction took place of deep depression have reigned during past two day situation be eagerly discussed who at knew country be eagerly questioned a to ground farther on near line of railway agreed that hill called pieter be formidable position almost though not perhaps quite a strong a railway hill that beyond line ran through comparatively open country that if hill must be captured relief of ladysmith must be ensured scout have not escaped altogether scatheless at reconnaissance towards grobler hill brown harris willesden have be wounded none very seriously although at first be thought that willesden be mortal injury for have be hit in stomach doctor however assured anxious comrade that there be ground for hope for very many of who have be so injured have made speedy recovery poor old willesden field have said a talked over be hard that must have be hit in stomach for be capital hand at taking care of of ours too field have be first rate caterer do hope will pull through lad have not seemed to suffer much pain three day later surgeon have be able to assure friend that a fever have set in have little fear of serious consequence ensuing boy have not be allowed to see captain brookfield however reported that be going on capitally be in very bad temper because be allowed to eat nothing piece of bread sip of milk while declared desperately hungry capable of devouring good sized leg of mutton think need worry about said to chris doctor told that in fortnight must be very likely to be about again none worse for wound bullet having evidently missed vital point in case passage must heal a quickly a little wound where bullet enters pass out usually do harris have arm broken just above elbow brown flesh wound below hip be stoutest of party jokingly said a be carried back that bullet have passed through largest amount of flesh in company chris once twice went into hospital with doctor whose acquaintance have made offered strong contrast to scene have taken place after battle of elandslaagte a in hospital at chieveley frere everything be a admirably arranged a must have be in one of large town in daytime side of marquee be lifted to allow of free passage of air nurse in neat dress moved quietly among patient with medicine soup jelly other refreshment ordered for there be book for sufficiently convalescent to be able to read who wished to send letter home always found one of nurse ready to write at dictation by of bedside stood bouquet of flower sent by lady of maritzburg have abundance of delicious fruit from same source chapter xix majuba day did hear of plucky action of captain philip of royal engineer last night officer who have just ridden in from front asked chris that evening heard that boer set up tremendous musketry fire in evening after truce be over one have spoken to knew what be about well did know till next morning general idea be that be boer scare thought that be crawling up to make night attack so blazed away for be worth found out afterwards that philip have conceived idea that be possible to destroy that search light of boer have learned from prisoner that be last have with although have not made night attack yet be possible might do so in future so made up mind to have try to smash up took with eight blue jacket crawled along in dark beyond line got in among boer have taken particular notice of point must have to pas boulder so on found way there without making blunder there be plenty of boer round one just at search light blue jacket understood working of own search light boer have electric light know work signal with acetylene so stood on guard while philip opened lamp took out working part whatever be shut lamp again just a have done so heard four boer who have be sitting talking together get up party dropped among bush lay there quiet while boer came up to lamp be to keep going to night ' one of said 'for may take into head to make attack thinking that after having have truce day will not be expecting trouble may catch unprepared expect german officer in few minute said must be here about ten o'clock for rooineks be not likely to move until think be asleep moved away again philip men stole quietly off before rejoined fellow heard sudden shot in minute tremendous rifle fire broke out evidently german have arrived found search light must not act concluded at once that be marching against for twenty minute man in trench blazed away at random a fast a must load must say that must have wasted hundred thousand cartridge a there be reply began to think that have be fooled fellow be just a much puzzled at row fell in thinking that boer might possibly be going to attack however matter quieted down be not until next morning that anyone knew what have be about be plucky thing indeed chris said though a must hardly think must attack at night may not be of much service for boer have long since given up trying with feeble flash light to interrupt night signalling with ladysmith especially a now weather be finer can talk day if like with heliograph chris be just turning in when captain brookfield came to entrance of tent have just heard chris that pontoon bridge have be successfully thrown across just below cataract that troop be crossing just mention to can not get away if find boy be not here in morning will say nothing about certainly will not be wanted order be out there be mention of corp of mounted colonial thank sir be very much obliged chris went round to tent told others that must be up hour before daybreak be ready to start at once a there must probably be very big fight then told native who be a usual still talking together in tent that be going off very early that chocolate must be ready at daybreak water skin filled a horse must probably be out day will want anything cooked baa jack asked will take tin with there be going to be big fight to morrow a be going can go too if like will want for horse three of

native have made hot cake ate with chocolate then saw that horse have good feed stock of biscuit tinned meat for be put into saddle bag when daylight broke be across plain arrived at dip in hill through pontoon train have gone knowing where cataract be be able to calculate pretty accurately where have best dismount did in small clump of tree then took tin of meat couple of pound of biscuit in pocket now chris said to native have better stay here quietly till hear firing begin then jack can go with two zulu can stay look on till middle of day when sun be at highest must come back let japhet swazi go at sunset must all be here again wait till come perhaps may be back sooner if so will ride away at once of who be away when start must go back to camp at once if find that horse have gone when get here now let be off made way up hill well pleased that there be enough tree bush to shield from observation roar of artillery rattle of musketry have be going on for time not with fury marked commencement of attack fortnight before must have seemed to that great battle be in progress by time be accustomed to almost incessant fire knew that although cannonade be heavier than usual actual fighting be going on met officer a went along did expect to do so for none of must be able to leave regiment a even be not included in force told off to assault might be called upon later in day at last reached top of hill whose face sloped steeply down to river from here must obtain view of boer position of line of railway up down to right be pieter station with steep hill of same name rising close to to left of be strongly posted hill while beyond be scene of fighting on friday saturday railway hill have be rechristened hart hill in honour of commander of brigade have fought so valiantly be evident that at three point whole of fighting force of boer have gathered heavy rifle fire be being kept up against british infantry whose passage of river have now be discovered who be lying crouched behind boulder other shelter now saw that gun have be brought forward during night have taken up commanding position be pouring terrible fire into enemy encampment at distance of little over mile enemy gun be replying at short range naval gun be able to fire point blank shell ripped defence erected to shelter boer camp into fragment carried destruction everywhere on kopje about quarter of mile behind above general buller staff have taken up position lad kept well within tree to avoid observation see chris there be of fellow creeping along by side of river must be hidden from sight of boer expect will be first to begin glass be turned upon column of men be two battalion of eth brigade dublin fusilier under general barton command made way down river bank for mile half then lad saw that be leaving river crossing line of railway have evidently gone down there sankey said because spur just side must hide from boer on pieter hill column be lost sight of for upwards of hour then appeared on opposite crest five hundred foot above line then be lost sight of again a passed beyond crest be splendid move chris exclaimed by working round there will gain top of pieter hill come down like thunderbolt upon boer roar of artillery continued unabated cloud of yellowish brown smoke floated over boer entrenchment lit up occasionally by vivid flash of bursting lyddite shell so terrible be bombardment that rifle fire of boer against troop crouching behind shelter be feeble intermittent a dared not merge from shelter place to lift head above line of trench be long time before barton troop be again seen doubtless have order to wait for time when have gained desired position in order to allow bombardment to do work prepare way for assault of other position by fourth eleventh brigade be not indeed until afternoon that lad saw barton brigade sweeping along to attack of pieter hill boer saw now must be seen leaping out of entrenchment regardless of redoubled fire of artillery now concentrated upon climbing up hill to oppose unexpected attack before must gather in sufficient number british be upon keeping up terrible fire a advanced boer however fought sturdily many indeed have already begun to make way along southern face of hill to join comrade on hill between pieter hart to escape up valley between so make way to bulwana where large force be still encamped may a well help chris said general can blow up delighted to be able to do even little towards success of day party at once picked up rifle lying beside be about thousand yard must say to middle of hill take steady aim try pick off a leave trench firing began at once slowly steadily occasionally there be exclamation of satisfaction when bullet found mark five minute later dismounted staff officer came down to tree behind what men be asked general wish to know be johannesburg scout chris said be in command sir yes then will please to accompany at once to general on arriving at spot where general be standing little in advance of staff latter at once recognized chris oh be mr king said be afraid of men have left station what be doing here be trying to lend hand to troop over there a be good shot think be being of assistance have right to leave camp sir suppose call independent service do general hope that be affording help here must not be doing good in camp a have be nearly out of through fighting there be order for corp to do anything to day thought might be of use did wrong sir general said face relaxing into smile at lad defence of well a be there may a well stop thank sir chris said saluting then hurried off to rejoin comrade be plucky boy general said to staff heard other day though not officially so be not obliged to take notice of that with twenty lad with rode out to place seventy mile away rescued farmer who be besieged by boer defeated assailant killed wounded more than own number made rest of still double own strength lay down arm recaptured nearly two thousand head of cattle have driven off news came to from mayor of maritzburg who have heard of from friend who have ridden in from grey town wrote to expressing admiration at exploit sent privately to captain questioned about intending to reprimand severely for letting go said that have resigned a have right to do for be son of gentleman draw pay provision that have therefore control whatever over action after left camp told not to say anything about having seen for a have returned must be obliged to take notice of matter if came to be talked about young fellow who came here be one who with three of others tried to blow up bridge at komati poort must not do played havoc with large store of rifle ammunition six eight gun after must not very well scold again turned glass on opposite hill here fighting be almost over in very short time resistance have ceased of boer gun on next hill have now be turned round opened upon captured position took own in flank aide de camp be sent off to order of gun to be taken if possible up to top of pieter hill after immense exertion two battery be placed there a soon a be accomplished order be sent for rest of infantry to advance general warren be in command fourth brigade under colonel norcott eleventh under colonel kitchener now moved forward taking advantage of what shelter must be obtained a advanced at same time strong force of colonial infantry moved to right to attack boer trench farther up line of railway be soon hotly engaged defender of hart hill position between pieter opened heavy fire a soon a british infantry showed morale be so shaken by terrific bombardment to have be subjected by loss of pieter hill by rifle fire now opened by captor that fire be singularly ineffective many men dropped loss be comparatively much smaller than suffered by irish division when moving across open on rd taking advantage of shelter troop moved steadily forward maintaining heavy fire whenever did so winning way steadily colonel kitchener brigade pressed on towards hart hill on side by now attacked be far le formidable than against irish have dashed have never entered boer mind that must be attacked from side most formidable entrenchment have be placed to resist assault from colenso arrived at foot troop be in comparative shelter among boulder covered slope foot by foot made way upwards until at last gathered for final assault then with loud cheer scrambled up last slope with fixed bayonet drove boer in headlong flight similar success attended eleventh brigade who just at sunset carried centre position mighty cheer broke out all along line at capture of what felt to be last serious obstacle to advance to ladysmith on right colonial troop have driven boer in front of for nearly three mile capturing entrenchment after entrenchment until arrived at nelthorpe station three camp of boer contained even larger amount of spoil than have be discovered in of monte cristo hlangwane seemed that have be perfectly confident that position be impregnable have accumulated store sufficient for prolonged residence be evident too that wealthier men with have preferred situation to more exposed camp on summit of hill amount of provision store of kind be large great quantity of rifle ammunition be found in trench clothes of superior kind proved that owner have be resident of johannesburg pretoria of different class altogether from farm labourer herdsman who formed majority of boer army haste with have fled when to astonishment discovered that british attack must not be repulsed be shown by fact that good many watch be found on bed place rough table where have be left when boer rushed to arm in hurry of flight have be forgotten number of rifle have be thrown away be very large among dead body found be of two woman one quite young other over sixty be notorious that woman have more than once be seen in firing rank of boer there be report that amazon corp be in course of formation in transvaal boer perhaps remembering how sturdily woman of haarlem have fought against spaniard in defence of city so complete have be panic evinced by headlong fight of enemy that general opinion be that must be time before must again attempt stand against men that unless entrenchment higher up valley be held by men who have not witnessed what have taken place be commanded by leader of most determined character ladysmith must almost certainly be relieved within couple of day rescuing army must be thus rewarded for toil sacrifice in state of wildest delight lad returned to spot where have left horse where found that japhet two swazi have arrived just before zulu be exhibiting intense satisfaction at defeat of boer by wild war dance party rode fast back to camp for spirit did not admit of leisurely pace left native to follow more deliberately news have already be received in camp by return of officer who witnessed scene from point near to lad have attained occupant be in frenzy of delight colonial corp be especially jubilant be anniversary of majuba hill blackest in history of colony one boer in transvaal orange state always celebrated with great rejoicing to humiliation of british colonist now that disgrace be wiped out position even stronger than of majuba fortified with enormous pain defended by artillery by thousand of boer have be captured by british force although be a yet unknown in camp old reverse have be doubly avenged by surrender on day of cronje army late that evening order be issued that lord dundonald with squadron of lancer colonial corp in maritzburg scout be included be to reconnoitre along line of railway felt sure that serious opposition be likely to be met with defeat of boer have be so crushing complete that assuredly few of fugitive must be found willing to again encounter terrible artillery fire followed by irresistible onslaught of infantry evening in spite of scarcity of wood bonfire be lighted scout gathered round bottle of spirit wine remained in camp be broached most joyous evening be spent will be able to breathe freely one of colonist man from johannesburg said on majuba day in future have made point for year whenever wanted to do business in natal to put off till date so must get out of transvaal when must not manage shut up stopped in bed day though even there used to grind teeth when brute shouting singing in street still to be not half such humiliation a surrender day one be piece of carelessness military blunder doubt other be national disgrace though saw majuba did not affect half a much a did abject backing down of british government after have collected army at newcastle in readiness to avenge majuba must not believe news when came fury of troop be unbounded must not have given farthing for life of of men who be author of surrender have be in camp day what be doing there chris asked have farm near newcastle at time two of waggon have be taken up by military for transport purpose be not on hill a may suppose might not be here to tell story went forward with colley be just same then a be at beginning here there be plenty of colonist ready to take up arm military authority must have none of must manage thing without aid from civilian knew that native have over over again beaten boer what native must do must be merely child play to british soldier sir george colley be brave officer believe have proved skilful one knew nothing whatever of boer style of fighting while colonist understood perfectly must match at own game a turned out british soldier on occasion did not made difference if sir george colley have accepted few hundred of who knew boer well a scout skirmisher affair must have turned out very differently for a know did not succeed through whole affair in taking one of place held by colonist well started from newcastle blundering began from first be twenty five mile to laing nek at time started there be not boer there for be doubtful line must advance by twenty five mile must have be done in day there must have be with difficulty at end baggage store must have come up in two three day then advance must have be made instead of six day be wasted in going over miserable bit of ground boer of course took advantage of time have given to prepare entrench laing nek think troubled military authority at entrenchment thrown up by farmer peasant must be worthless affair must not for moment check advance of british infantry consequence of be that got licking deserved entrenchment at crest of ridge be held by something like three thousand men colley have three hundred seventy infantry force in utterly inadequate for work in hand seeing party of boer horseman riding about thought necessary to leave strong body for defence of baggage accordingly sent only about two hundred fifty men forward to attack place well among waggon have doubt how be going to turn out one battery with opened fire upon entrenchment who know what entrenchment be will guess that there be little damage done when soldier went up hill boer held fire until be close then literally swept away leaping over entrenchment took many of prisoner none must have got away at if few mounted infantry who have managed to get up nek at point have charged down so enabled survivor to escape one hundred eighty out of two hundred fifty be killed taken prisoner colley at once fell back four mile boer on part making sure that have got safe sent strong force round planted on road between newcastle before did so small reinforcement joined three four day passed then colonial quite made up mind that there be nothing for surrender colley determined at last to try open road back with about two hundred fifty men with four cannon two of mountain gun moved out sixty soldier be left on commanding spot to cover passage of ingogo a soon a force under colley have got to opposite crest of ravine through river run be attacked in great force took shelter among boulder fought a bravely a be possible for men to fight gun however be useless for in hour officer man horse be killed wounded however boer must not pluck up courage to make rush little force held on till be dark by time more than two third of be killed wounded lot of rain have fallen boer thought that ingogo must not be forded so believing must have trouble in finishing little force in morning be careless colley however sent down found that water have not risen so high a to make impossible to pas in darkness covered by blinding rain be falling survivor moved quietly off crossed river picked up party left on eminence commanding returned to camp be certain now that unless succoured fate be sealed fortunately evelyn wood came up to newcastle with column have be pressing forward from sea colley of course ought to have waited for to arrive before moved at if have done so thing might have turned out very differently made mistake of despising boer thinking that be nothing walk over when heard that column have reached newcastle boer cleared off line of communication colley rode into newcastle saw wood felt that be well out of bad business be sure that boer who be good in attack however well fight behind shelter must not venture to attack that even if did so must keep off till help came colley must not let well alone instead of waiting till wood came up joined lie thought might make good stroke on own account so retrieve two defeat have suffered so when nd regiment came up determined to seize majuba hill be well worth seizing for completely commanded boer position on laing nek have whole force come up boer must have fallen back directly be captured however colley decided not to wait with about five hundred fifty men officer started at night hill be only four mile off a crow fly ground be frightfully cut up be not until after six hour of tremendous work that reached summit two hundred men be left at bottom of hill to keep open communication with camp from hill close to camp must make out what be going on soon after daybreak saw party of mounted men ride towards hill where usually stationed vedettes be fired at a approached directly turmoil must be seen on laing nek waggon be inspanned thought at first that be going to move off be not so be only getting ready to go if failed to recapture hill in short time must see force moving towards well from where be seemed that force on majuba must have kept hundred thousand boer at bay so ought to have done for time boer did not make much progress with glass puff of smoke must be made out along crest among rock below firing began in earnest at seven between twelve one boer fire have ceased died away thought be over went back to waggon again soon after one o'clock there be sudden outburst men with glass observed that boer be close up to top of hill few minute later be on plateau that firing be going on colley have not known boer doubt men be completely done up with six hour toil among hill six hour fighting think tenth of be ever engaged for colley thought be impossible that position must be stormed so only kept handful of men at edge of plateau allowed rest to lie down sleep certainly be case when boer who have be crawling up among rock bush made rush well know happened few men on edge be cut down at once boer dashed forward keeping up heavy fire fellow jumped up number be shot down a did so in spite of effort of officer panic seized have far better rifle than boer have be steady might still have driven back only few of ever fired shot one boer be killed five wounded while on side eight officer among colley be killed seven taken prisoner eighty six men be killed one hundred twenty five wounded fifty one taken prisoner two missing few managed to make way down hill joined party have be left there at bottom be also attacked beat off boer maintaining perfect order fought way back to camp can imagine consternation there be when hideous business became known fell back at once to newcastle mightily lucky thought to get there safely fresh troop came up be on point of advancing again confident that after lesson boer have given thing must be managed better suddenly like thunderclap news came that british government have surrendered to boer given up everything abandoned colonist who have so bravely defended town to fate with exception of making proviso that native must be well treated a nothing be ever done to enforce meant allowing boer to enslave ill treat a have done before proviso maintaining purely nominal supremacy of queen treaty be simply entire abject surrender there be not colonist who since time have not known what must come of that sooner later question whether dutch british be to be master of cape must have to be fought out none of dreamt that british government must allow boer to import hundred of thousand of rifle two three hundred cannon enormous store of ammunition in readiness for encounter well have done have seen consequence natal have be overrun considerable portion of cape colony have lost here ten thousand men half a many on other side may lose a many more before business be finished because handful of miserable cur at home twenty year ago be ready to betray honour of england in order that might make matter smooth for at home just a story came to end assembly blew in camp of scout on running in men found that captain brookfield have received order to mount at once ride to join cavalry under lord dundonald at front a reconnaissance be to be made in morning five minute later be in saddle trotting across plain towards colenso a be to follow line of railway up chapter xx ladysmith be exciting work a mounted horse under lord dundonald rode along a far a must be seen from various point in possession passage be clear experience have taught how boer must lie quiet even when in large number while scout be passing close to at colenso colonel long have sent two mounted men on ahead of battery have be permitted to pas within hundred yard of thousand of boer among bush on river bank have even crossed bridge returned without rifle shot being fired boer showing head be on report that there be apparently boer in neighbourhood that battery be pushed forward into fatal trap prepared for so chris companion at rear of colonial cavalry trotted along ready at moment notice to swing round rifle for instant action watched stone clump of bush on slope of valley for foe might be lurking there who at moment might pour out rain of bullet into column very few word be spoken on way tension be too great knew that ladysmith have telegraphed that boer appeared to be everywhere falling back few thousand of best fighting men might have remained to strike one terrible blow at troop who in open fight have shown superior have driven from position after position that believed impregnable however a one after of spot where ambuscade must be likely to be laid passed there be still sign of enemy keenness of watch began to abate set expression of face to relax then a hill receded valley opened before pleasurable excitement succeeded grim expectation of battle task have proved so hard be indeed fulfilled boer be gone siege of ladysmith be at end a emerged from valley into plain in ladysmith be situated there be insensible increase of speed men talked joyously together scarcely waiting for reply horse seemed to catch infection of rider spirit pennon of lancer in front to flutter more gaily onward swept cantering now until approached town then men must be seen running towards road from house poured out men woman waving hat handkerchief too much overpowered by feeling for outward demonstration a column reached point broke into walk answered with ringing cheer fainter le hearty hurrah of came to rescue yet trooper be scarcely le affected than crowd pressed round to shake by hand have known that provision be nearly exhausted in city that for time past have be on short ration have not dreamt of anything like seemed to that be surrounded by population of skeleton haggard worn almost too weak to drag along almost too feeble to shout clothes in rag eye unnaturally large hand nerveless utterance broken by sob realized for first time how terrible have be privation how great suffering of garrison people of ladysmith for soldier be there a well a civilian there be little military in appearance there be uniformity in dress save that be alike ragged stained destitute of colour must rescuer have seen unseen few day earlier must have be even more shocked then listlessness brought about by hope deferred of late almost extinction of hope weakness caused by disease famine have be supreme have boer have idea of state to be reduced renewal of attack of eth of january must hardly have failed of success last few day however have revived hope have learned by ever nearing roar of cannon that progress be being made for past four day have from elevated point near town be able to make out movement of troop on position have captured have seen boer breaking up camp carrying off store by waggon across western pass by train from modder spruit have seen cannon being withdrawn from position on hill felt that deliverance be at hand through ever increasing crowd column moved on illustration relief of ladysmith from barrack hospital from dwelling house dug out shelter cave on railway bank people flocked up sir george white staff mayor town guard officer soldier joined in greeting stay be made after few minute talk with sir george white lord dundonald gave order cavalry moved forward a soon a be free from crowd trotted on at rapid pace in hope of overtaking retiring boer glad that scene to have looked forward with such pleasant expectation be at end there have not be dry eye among none must have witnessed sobbing woman men down whose cheek tear streamed uncontrolledly have remained unmoved be terrible chris said to sankey who be riding next to must not have imagined anything so dreadful a appearance did not realize what be like when two three month before left johannesburg read in motley book about war in netherlands of state of thing in leyden when prince of orange burst way through to rescue of terrible appearance of starved inhabitant now can quite understand how awfully bad be must have be even worse then here there be ration distributed little enough there people have nothing weed gathered boiled down with scrap must pick up there died in hundred of actual starvation can not have be quite so bad here a see though there have be just enough food to keep life together have be have be from disease brought on by famine not by famine that have died then too shell be always falling among at moment might be attacked expect that anxiety fever have have a much to do with a hunger yes chris know when be grumbling sometimes at not being employed in fighting have wished have stopped in ladysmith gone through siege there now one can thank god that one did not do so have pictured to ourselves everyone actively employed vigilance at outpost skirmishing with boer who crept up too closely excitement of repelling attack sort of thing be very good to read about now know what really meant one see that be pack of fool to have wished to be there yes suppose one never know what be good for one sankey now a look back think that have be extraordinarily fortunate have have fight just in way have expected thanks principally to being so well mounted have done very well have lived well say have not have certain amount of discomfort of course expected that what be most pleased at be that not one of have be killed only few of wounded only serious one being willesden be fairly on way to recovery for boy have done very good share expect now have driven boer back here kimberley have be relieved there be tremendous force gathering on side will soon be over yes think with chris fancy that others be beginning to long for end of must say that whose people have gone to england may stop on for bit rest of will go to friend at durban cape at rate for time till see how thing go know that lord robert have got cronje surrounded shut up expect be one of reason that boer have be moving from here free stater will certainly wish to get back to defend bloemfontein transvaal people must feel that be use stopping here when own country will be shortly invaded yes expect be reason for shutting up a suddenly a have done after fighting so hard for first five six day of advance on arriving at modder spruit be found that last train have left hour before pushed on however until smart fire from hill in front of be evidently held in force broke out suddenly two cannon from eminence joined in having thus discovered that boer be not entirely evacuating country intending to defend biggarsberg at rate until strong force came up lord dundonald returned to ladysmith in afternoon general buller rode over attended by only one two of staff stayed very short time to learn from general white state of affair then returned do think that will pursue at once sir chris asked captain brookfield not at once chris practically a see there be not soldier here fit to carry arm horse fit for work must say that will be month before general buller can reckon upon assistance from garrison a to own army expect will keep main portion round chieveley doubt will bring greater part if not garrison of ladysmith back to frere estcourt to get out of pestilential air here for convenience of feeding civilian population will leave of course a soon a possibly can must think that buller will leave in garrison here infantry brigade part of cavalry two three battery with sick who can not be moved will be about a much a transport will be able to manage until railway bridge be repaired line put in running order till be done there be possibility of general advance indeed there will have to be great accumulation of store here a will then become base instead of chieveley doubt great deal will depend on how thing be going on other side now robert have a good a captured cronje force will of course advance to bloemfontein occupy will then be no more able to advance farther than buller can in fact le able line of railway be secured can be fed by at present have not crossed orange river from south railway between bloemfontein be in hand of boer know that have blown up bridge across river until be restored line secure in hand robert army will have to live on store that have brought with then work of forming base depot from coast will begin need something enormous in way of provision carriage to supply army of sixty seventy thousand men of whom must a advance be fed from bloemfontein a long a be stationary there be likely enough that bulk of joubert army will cling to natal knowing well enough that before will be in condition to move forward can entrench position on biggarsberg drakenberg until be quite a formidable a have be knocking head against must not be at surprised if be couple of month before robert be in position to advance of course at present have idea what plan be likely enough at least force here may be sent down to durban then by water to east london from there to bloemfontein by rail must be ridiculous for to renew sort of fighting have be doing when enemy be sure to clear out when robert cross vaal natal be thus freed without further loss of life possibly troop may not be sent round by sea will remain here until robert get a far a kroonstadt then doubt division will be sent down through bethlehem to harrismith so open van reenen pas in case troop from here can go up by train to bethlehem at rate be afraid that most of will remain here for at least two month see most of colonial irregular be enlisted for only three month be up already doubt great many of will not extend time suppose military authority will want to do so there be doubt that while mounted men be invaluable in fighting in cape colony will be so in orange free state be of very little use in mountainous country in north of natal be so many more mouth to be fed man beast without corresponding advantage have done splendidly where have have chance imperial light horse have suffered heavily a whole think that must have be more useful a infantry than a mounted men infinitely more useful if instead of being kept at head quarter of army a have be for possible reason that anyone can see have be scattered over country to east in case must have kept marauding boer from wandering about must have saved hundred hundred of loyal farmer from being ruined loss of many thousand of cattle horse will have to be paid for after war be over think that there be single colonist who be not of opinion that way in have be kept inactive from beginning of war instead of being employed a irregular cavalry must have be in protecting country preventing boer from drawing supply forcing to keep in body a own troop have done have be stupendous mistake chris repeated conversation to comrade think said that if there be chance of doing anything for two three month might a well break up have doubt good many of colonial will re enlist number of be working men from johannesburg belonging to natal must find very difficult to get work here five shilling day pay be therefore of greatest importance to be different with draw pay simply agreed to band together to have opportunity of paying out boer for treatment of at time agreed to that have idea that must invade natal of course be additional inducement to to fight a loyalist capable of bearing arm must have be duty even if have personal feeling in matter to enlist to help to clear country of enemy who invaded now that ladysmith be rescued there be certainly enough troop in south africa to finish business up see that be duty to continue service anyhow have pretty well made up mind to resign go round to cape town there be almost sure to find mother perhaps father for know that have expelled almost english remaining about mine may have be among agree with heartily sankey said at rate must vote for breaking up for present will be beastly for to have to stop here doing nothing for month two then perhaps when buller move forward to join robert to be told that colonial force will no longer be required twelve of others expressed similar opinion friend of eight who did not do so have returned to england carmichael be one of well said after pause say that be not quite right have one to go to here people went home a soon a reached durban if be to join might hear when landed that war be just over that have started to come back again be on point of doing so be born out here have never seen of relation in scotland though must like very much to spend few month in old country must not be worth while going home for so short time for be sure father will hurry back to work at mine a soon a johannesburg be taken by fancy who have not spoken be in about same situation that be there be murmur of assent say went on must care more than do to stop here for next two month smell of dead horse thing be enough to make one ill water of river be poisonous for know boer used to throw dead animal in on purpose so will go down to maritzburg wire to people where be ask for order there remains willesden said other day still about l apiece at bank expect will get a much for horse a gave for so that who have friend here must live very comfortably for two three month have enough to pay passage home in case send for will tell to telegraph so in week after sending off wire will get answer others who have friend in south africa expressed intention of doing same think need bother about horse chris said being such good animal have doubt that there be plenty of officer in cavalry regiment here who will be glad to buy a remount for money gave for must save trouble of getting down by train to maritzburg selling there well then a there be dissentients will tell captain brookfield what have settled quite agree with officer said when chris have told of intention in first place must be serious waste of time for to remain here still be of comparatively little consequence do think that must be grievous pity for to risk life further have done wonderfully good service have have experience that will look back upon with satisfaction life have done duty more than duty have before useful life have amply shown that in position may be placed will be credit to yourselves friend therefore chris think in respect decision be right will be relief to for to tell frankly when started on expedition to komati other day when rode off to farm felt that must probably be duty to write to of parent to tell of death therefore by mean give resignation dare say that good many of men in own other corp will be leaving also in case who remain will must think be formed into one strong regiment will be of good deal more use than dozen small corp be agreed among party that a have decided to go might a well go at once hear chris said that general buller be going to make formal entry here on saturday that garrison will line road know whether dundonald brigade will have anything to do with if doe brookfield will certainly like to make good show so until be over wo do anything about horse on day appointed garrison turned out to receive general troop who have struggled so long gallantly to effect rescue devon gloucester rifle leicester manchester liverpool sapper artilleryman naval brigade marched out from camp lined road a far a railway station where remnant of cavalry brigade be drawn up at eleven o'clock sir george white sir archibald hunter colonel duff staff rode up took place in front of shattered tower of town hall here too captain lambton many other officer took place not far from be score of civilian who have not shared in general exodus have be going on from day on town be relieved have delayed departure in order to witness historical scene at last head of column be seen approaching lord dundonald men have ridden down on previous day mounted colonial volunteer have now honour of forming general escort led way after came general buller with escort dublin fusilier be placed at head of column in acknowledgment of gallantry displayed by in fight then came men of warren lyttleton barton brigade with artillery great indeed be contrast between sturdy bronzed well fed soldier who cheered a marched many of carrying helmet on bayonet line of emaciated men through whom passed cheered too voice sounded strange thin many indeed be too much overcome by weakness emotion to be able to add voice to shout enthusiasm of troop rose to highest when passed group of woman child who with streaming eye greeted a passed pipe of highlander beating of drum added to roar of sound contrast between dress of rescuer rescued be a great a personal appearance sir george white men have of late have little work have prepared for occasion to best of power a if for review at aldershot have done what must khaki suit have be washed scrubbed until though discoloured be scrupulously clean belt accoutrement rifle have be rubbed up scoured on other hand uniform of regiment marched in be travel stained begrimed with dust of battle mud of bivouac until original hue have entirely disappeared looked a if have at first be dragged through thorn bush then be given mud bath captain lambton rode forward to meet sailor of terrible with gun have done such service followed by howitzer have almost equally contributed to final success of operation be loudly cheered by sailor heartiest greeting be exchanged between officer in attack defence naval brigade have performed inestimable service behind column came large body of men in civilian dress appearance be a unkempt a of troop among there be approach to military order yet heroism have be in way inferior to of troop be stretcher bearer who have in fight carried on work of mercy under heaviest fire that without excitement nerve soldier to face danger many of have fallen while so engaged have in way unnerved companion who have not only carried on work during daylight have often laboured night until last wounded man have be found carried down to hospital when name of hero of force relieved ladysmith be recounted of stretcher bearer be worthy of place among after troop have be dismissed matter have settled down little chris went over to camp of cavalry brigade spoke to first officer met have come across sir said to ask if of wish to buy remount party to belong have twenty five horse be exceptionally good animal cost sixty pound apiece last october furnished own equipment a be son of gentleman at johannesburg did not much mind what paid anyhow be ready to sell at price gave for want remount badly enough officer said will come in with to colonel entering mess tent where colonel several officer be standing talking chris guide introduced to repeated offer have made well at rate leslie colonel said mainwaring may a well go down look at horse must certainly be comfort to get remount for more than half of charger be gone rest be skeleton ca ask mr king if must like to take anything to drink suppose will be ten day before be in position to be able to offer

refreshment have be in position to offer to visitor for line have be so fully occupied with government transport that have be next to impossible to get up private store be afraid that very little in
