take chance here when get round must send boat a soon a possible certainly will not desert ruthven frank said know a well a do that be not likely to find boat on shore till get pretty near walmer

keep quite close to stick to so need be afraid if get tired just put one hand on back swim with other leg above thing keep head a low a possible in water so a just to be able to breathe three lad soon waded out a far a must go then struck out jackson goodall be poor swimmer must have fared very badly alone confidence however entertained in frank gave courage be well abreast of point when first jackson then goodall put hand on shoulder thanks to instruction have given to confidence in placed great weight upon ounce tell heavily on swimmer frank gave gasp of relief a at last foot touched ground bidding companion at once set off at run sat down for two three minute to recover breath be lucky said to that did not try with ruthven be very different thing carrying fellow who can swim fellow who ca what fool have be to let caught here have idea tide came so high that be so dangerous none of have ever be round here before now must go back to ruthven frank found even harder work to get back than have be to come out from bay for tide be against now at last stood beside ruthven childers can only find one place frank where there be projection fellow must stand upon be only large enough for one see said pointing to projecting block of chalk whose upper surface eight inch wide be tolerably flat there be cave here too may go beyond tide be not deep slope up bit will never do frank said a wave come in will rush up fill to top see be rounded by water now childers will put on stone will be perfectly safe there for see be two foot above greenish line show where water generally come to tide be not at spring at present so though may get splashing there be fear of being washed off water be already knee deep at foot of rock wave took nearly up to shoulder ruthven did not attempt to dispute frank allotment of one place of safety to childers frank placed below block of chalk be somewhat over six foot from ground then childers scrambled up on to shoulder from stepped onto ledge be all right said wish to heaven that be too will do frank said mind hold tight childers have better turn round with face to cliff so a to be able to grip hold steady in case wave come up high tide will turn in three quarter of hour at outside now then ruthven let make fight for old man what be going to do frank will wade along here a far a can towards corner than must swim for think be possible to stay here ruthven said if tide will turn so soon quite impossible frank said have be nearly taken off foot twice already water will rise yard yet at least must be smashed against rock even if be drowned must be tried ruthven there be other way for distance be good deal farther than must have be if have started at first be distance make much matter have only got to go out little way tide will soon take around point everything depends on can take round point land safely enough if will lie quiet if will drown of so be entirely in hand look out at moment larger wave than usual took boy off leg dashed with considerable force against cliff frank seized ruthven assisted to regain foot now old fellow let put on back will lie on mine tow along struggle move above try lift head mind if little water get in mouth now for moment ruthven felt under water have to make great effort to restrain from struggling to come to surface then felt lying on back in water supported by frank motion be not unpleasant a rose fell on wave although now then splash of water came over face made cough splutter for breath must see nothing blue sky overhead must feel nothing except occasionally received blow from one other of frank knee a latter swam beneath with ruthven head on chest be dreamy sensation looking back upon afterwards ruthven must never recall anything that have thought of seemed simply drowsy pleasant time except when occasionally wave covered face first sensation be that of surprise when felt motion change frank lifted head from water said stand up old fellow thank god here

rock by rush of water tide be just on turn when boat arrived so exhausted be that certainly must not have be able to hold out for half hour buffeting to must have be exposed before water fell sufficiently to leave after helping into boat men gathered clothes jammed in fissure of cliff be of course drenched with water have for most part remained firm in place now pulled round to spot where frank ruthven be awaiting childers must have be pretty nearly done frank said must be lying in bottom of boat childers gave smile of pleasure a schoolfellow jumped on board have glancing over shoulder

moment a if struck by lightning hippopotamus fell in stream explosive ball have flown true to mark invariably fatal one in case of river horse frank a fired have taken rifle houssas held in readiness for there be occasion for use fan came running up on seeing great beast lying in stream gave shout of joy will do for evening mr goodenough said be large beast will give food enough for week ten day then returned to camp at news brought by one of fan have already be deserted before native retired to sleep hippopotamus have be cut up carried to camp portion be already frizzling over fire other part set aside for consumption of next two day rest cut up in strip to be dried in sun tongue of one be cut up fried a great luxury for white men supper by ostik be not often that native of equatorial

made nearly score of bird of several be very rare five be pronounced by mr goodenough to be entirely new have be shot many butterfly captured frank have be most successful in respect a have come across small clearing in be several deserted hut be just place in butterfly delight for although many kind prefer deep shade of forest by far greater portion love bright sunlight after breakfast again set out frank time keeping along edge of stream where have observed many butterfly a came up where many bird of kingfisher family have also be seen have be very successful be walking along by edge of water with eye fixed upon tree above where have minute before call of bird when be startled by shout from houssa behind involuntarily sprang back be well did so for on instant something swept by

knocked into stream mouth be open frank a if by instinct fired content of barrel into throat animal rolled over on to back in water then turned a if to struggle to regain bank houssa however have run

get alligator proceeded on way without concerning further in matter on return to camp in evening frank found that alligator have be discovered fished out that steak be by mean bad eating frank told mr goodenough of narrow escape have have latter pointed out to necessity of always keeping eye on watch alligator frequently carry off native woman when engaged in washing said almost invariably strike in first place into river with blow of tail once in water be carried off drowned eaten at leisure sometimes indeed woman may escape with loss of foot arm be exception what be best thing to do when so attacked frank asked mean to be caught napping again still be a well to know what to do if be men when so attacked have be known frequently to escape by thrusting thumb finger into creature eye if can be done alligator be sure to lose hold demand quickness great presence of mind when reptile be tearing at one leg hurrying one along under water can see that nerve required to keep perfectly cool to feel for creature eye to thrust finger into be very great best plan frank distinctly be to keep out of reach altogether after remaining for fortnight at camp prepared for move hippopotamus be killed cut up dried flesh added to burden then tent be struck proceeded farther into mountain two day later halted again site being chosen beside little mountain rivulet be now very high up in hill mr goodenough expecting to meet with new variety of butterfly insect at elevation have scarcely pitched camp when frank exclaimed surely mr goodenough can hear dog barking did not know that native dog barked do may yelp howl never bark like european dog what hear be bark of sort of monkey baboon opinion be at once confirmed by fan will sally out with gun at once mr goodenough said like thought of shooting monkey frank muttered a took up winchester carbine be very excellent eating mr goodenough continued superior in opinion indeed in of most traveler to other meat will meet with other kind of creature fit for food up here bird indeed supply amply for men be desirable that must obtain fresh meat when have chance baboon be very mischievous creature be not to be attacked with impunity let four of houssas with gun come with following direction of sound have heard traveler came upon troupe of great baboon be curious sight male be a big a large dog be sitting sunning on rock others be being scratched by female many of have baby monkey clinging on neck while others be playing about in direction 'd rather not shoot at mr goodenough frank said will be glad enough to eat mr goodenough answered selecting big male fired creature fell dead others sprang to foot female little one scampered off male with angry gesture rushed upon assailant barking showing teeth making menacing gesture mr goodenough fired again frank now seeing that be likely to be attacked also opened fire six of baboon be killed before others abstained from attack went screaming after female dead baboon be brought down skinned two be at once roasted others hung up to tree required great effort on frank part to overcome repugnance to tasting creature when did so admitted that meat be excellent that night be disturbed by cry of terror from men seizing rifle ran out there be two leopard sar ostik said have smelt monkey shout scared creature away native kept up great fire till morning must get skin if can mr goodenough said skin of equatorial leopard be rare if can get will make fine group for to stuff when get back frank be thinking of following trail frank asked must be useless mr goodenough answered in soft swampy ground might do so up here must be out of question must set bait for tonight be careful while be out today have probably not gone far from camp be very formidable beast not unfrequently attack kill native fan be much alarmed at neighborhood of leopard none must leave camp during day two of houssas be left on guard although mr goodenough felt sure that animal must not attempt to carry off meat in daylight two houssas accompanied of traveler while out in search of butterfly nothing be heard of leopard during day at portion of one of monkey be roasted hung up so a to swing within four foot of ground from arm of tree hundred yard from camp mr goodenough frank took seat in tree short distance off night be fine star clear bright tree on meat hung stood somewhat alone so that sufficient light penetrated from above to enable creature approaching bait to be seen instead of little winchester frank have one of sniders with explosive bullet houssas be told to keep sharp watch in camp in case leopard approaching from other side might be attracted by smell of meat there rather than by bait fan needed no telling to induce to keep up great fire night soon after dark watcher heard roaring in forest came from other side of camp be unlucky mr goodenough said have pitched on wrong side however will probably be deterred by fire from approaching camp will wander round round so may hope to hear of before long in answer to roar of leopard native kept up continued shouting for hour roaring continued at interval sometimes close at hand sometimes at considerable distance frank have difficulty in keeping awake be beginning to wish that leopard must move off altogether two three time have nearly dozed off rifle have almost slipped from hold at once be aroused by sharp nudge from companion fixing eye on bait made out something immediately below directly afterwards creature stole forward be far le distinct than have expected take one to left mr goodenough whispered now fired together two tremendous roar be heard one of leopard immediately bounded away other rolled over over then recovering foot followed companion mr goodenough firing second barrel after be afraid missed altogether frank said think so sir fancied saw flash of shell a struck where have not remotest idea must not make out clear enough be merely dim shape fired a well a must at middle of will go back to camp now frank asked yes can safely do so can tell by sound of roar that be already distance away there be little chance of returning tonight in morning will follow there be sure to be blood native will have difficulty in tracking rest of night passed quietly although roar howling must be heard from time to time in distance early in morning started with houssas must be careful today mr goodenough said for wounded leopard be really formidable beast there be difficulty in taking up trace one of at least must be hard hit mr goodenough remarked there be trace of blood yard have gone short distance when one of houssas gave sudden exclamation pointed to something lying at edge of clump of bush leopard said yes there be one of sure enough think be dead can not be too cautious advance very carefully frank keeping ready to fire instantly moved forward slowly in body precaution be unnecessary there be movement in spotted tawny skin a advanced when came close must see that leopard be really dead have be hit by two bullet first have struck shoulder exploded there inflicting so terrible wound that be wonderful have be able to move afterwards other have struck on back near tail have burst inside frank on seeing nature of wound be astonished at tenacity of life shown by animal wonder whether other said have doubt at about mr goodenough answered although did not think so before seemed to that only heard howl of one animal in night thought be one have hit a fellow must have died at once be clear that cry be made by other sharp search be now set up for track of other leopard houssas going back to tree taking up anew soon found trace of blood in line diverging from followed by other animal for hour followed great care being required a at time spot of blood must be seen for considerable distance at last seemed to lose altogether mr goodenough frank stood together while houssas scattered round be hunting like well trained dog for sign suddenly there be sharp roar from bough of tree close by great body sprang through air alighted within yard of frank latter in surprise sprang back stumbled fell in instant report of two barrel of mr goodenough rifle rang out in moment frank be on foot again ready to fire leopard however lay dead skull almost blown off have have narrow escape mr goodenough said see that ball last night broke one of hind leg that spoilt spring have not be for that must undoubtedly have reached blow with paw given with weight impetus must probably have killed on spot ought not to have stood near tree strong enough to bear when in pursuit of wounded leopard will always take to tree if can see be very suitable one for bough on be lying start from trunk only about four foot from ground so that even with broken leg be able to get upon without difficulty well thank god have not be hurt boy will teach to be more careful in future that afternoon frank be down with second attack of fever much more severe one than first have be mr goodenough favorite remedy have effect of producing profuse perspiration two three hour afterwards hot fit again came on for next four day frank lay half delirious at one time consumed with heat next shivering a if plunged into ice water copious dos of quinine however gradually overcame fever on fifth day be convalescent be nevertheless week before be sufficiently recovered to be able to resume hunting expedition again shifted camp time traveled for three week making short journey halting early so a to give day from camping place for work frank be one day out a usual with one of houssas have killed several bird when saw butterfly of specie have not before met with flitting across gleam of sunshine streamed in through rift in tree told houssa to wait where be in charge of two gun bird started off with net in pursuit of butterfly creature fluttered away with frank in full pursuit hither thither flitted seemingly taking impish delight in tantalizing frank settling on spot where gleam of sunlight streamed upon bark of tree till frank have stolen up within couple of pace of then darting away again at pace defied frank best attempt to keep up with until chose to play with again intent only upon chase frank thought of nothing else at last with shout of triumph inclosed creature in net shook into wide pickle bottle containing sponge soaked with chloroform then after tightly fitting in stopper looked around uttered exclamation of dismay a did so saw by band of light sun be already setting knew that must have be for upwards of hour in chase of butterfly have not slightest idea of direction in have come have knew run up hill down whether have be traveling in circle going straight in one direction have not least idea might be within hundred yard of spot where have left houssa might be three four mile away at once drew out revolver always carried strapped to belt discharged six chamber waiting for minute between shot listening intently for answer to signal none came stillness of wood be unbroken frank felt that must have wandered far indeed from starting place that be completely lost first impulse be to start off instantly at top of speed moment thought convinced that must be useless have not idea of direction must pursue besides sun be sinking twilight be short in tropic in hour must be a dark a midnight in forest remembering adventure with leopard determined to climb into tree pas night there knew that active search must be set on foot by friend next morning that a step took be a likely to lead from a towards camp be better to stay where be soon found tree with branch must suit purpose climbing up into lit pipe prepared for uncomfortable night frank have never smoked until reached africa have then taken to on advice of mr goodenough who told that smoking be certainly preventive to extent of fever in malarious country although have not liked at first have now taken kindly to pipe smoked from time when evening mist began to rise until went to bed time passed very slowly cry of wild creature must be heard in wood although frank did not expect to be attacked be impossible to sleep with call of leopard with forest seemed to abound in ear have reloaded revolver immediately after discharging have replaced in pouch felt confident that nothing must climb tree besides have heard that leopard seldom attack men unless attacked sleep however be out of question for when slept might have fallen from seat in crotch of tree occasionally however dozed off waking up always with uncomfortable start feeling that have just saved from falling with earliest dawn of morn descended stiff weary from tree directly sun rose set off walking knew at least that be to south of camp that by keeping sun on right hand till reached zenith must get in time to little stream on be pitched a walked listened intently for sound of gun once twice fancied that heard be quite unable to judge of direction have be out with houssa about six hour before strayed from

wall anxious to open fire mr goodenough saw that rifle be sighted to five hundred yard cannon offered easy mark be ranged along side by side surrounded by crowd of negro who yelled danced time shot struck wall now mr goodenough said to houssas fire steadily above fire straight want shot to tell mr goodenough gave signal at once frank houssas opened triumphant yell of dahomans at once changed character cry of wrath astonishment broke from steadily mr goodenough party kept up fire must see that great execution be being done large proportion of shot telling many wounded be carried to rear black form must be seen stretched everywhere on ground still enemy fire continued with unabated vigor fight very pluckily frank said be plucky mr goodenough answered a cowardice be punished with death

four hour firing ceased dahomans retired from gun abeokuta people raised cry of triumph imagine have only fallen back mr goodenough said to give gun time to cool while cannonade have be going on brisk attack have be kept up on several other point of wall enemy advancing within fifty yard of firing musket loaded with heavy charge of slug at defender who replied vigorously to cannonade be not resumed that afternoon dahomans contenting with skirmishing round wall be disappointed with result of fire mr goodenough said doubt anticipated must knock wall down without difficulty will see change in

considering that english have taken native under protection that war be caused entirely by taking over of elmina by english by breach of faith to native there treatment of fantis be a unjust a be impolitic ammon quatia however seemed to be impressed with spirit of prudence a soon a crossed river party be sent out indeed who attacked plundered assim village near prah main body moved forward with greatest caution sometimes halting for week ashanti general directed frank always to pitch tent next to hut occupied by four guard be appointed nominally to do honor really a frank saw to prevent from making escape men kept guard two at time night day over tent if moved out followed never attempted to leave camp forest be extremely dense with thick underwood innumerable creeper through must be

tree have shed foliage of be completely covered with brilliant flower of different color wood resounded with cry of various bird butterfly except in clearing be scarce army depended for food partly upon cultivated patch around assim village partly on supply brought up from rear in forest too found many edible root fruit in spite of effort to supply with food frank saw ere many week have passed that ashantis be suffering much from hunger fell away in flesh many be shaking with fever enthusiasm be manifest at passage of prah have entirely evaporated first morning after crossing river frank sent ostik into hut of general with cup of hot chocolate with ammon quatia expressed so much gratified that henceforth frank sent in cup morning having still large supply of tin of preserved chocolate milk very best food traveler can take with in return ashanti general showed frank many little kindness sending in bird animal when be shot by men keeping a well provided with food a be possible under circumstance be not until th of april that absolute hostility took place then fantis supported by fifty houssas under lieutenant hopkins barred road outside village of dunquah ashantis attacked fantis fought bravely having great confidence in houssa contingent battle be one of native fashion side attempting vigorous action contenting with heavy fire at distance of hundred yard combatant took shelter behind tree consequence be that at end of day great quantity of powder slug have be fired away very few men hit on side at party drew off be that way english soldier fight general asked frank that night yes frank said vaguely fire away at other then suppose general said when one party have exhausted ammunition retires certainly must retire frank said must not resist without ammunition know frank carefully abstained from mentioning that one side other must advance even before ammunition of opponent be expended for did not wish ashantis to adopt tactic from greatly superior number must at once give victory ashantis be not dissatisfied with day work a considered that have proved equal to english troop chapter xviii attack on elmina on th fantis took initiative attacked ashantis fight be mere repetition of of week before about midday fantis having used up ammunition fell back again to cape coast now general said to frank that have beaten fantis will march down to elmina leaving main road at army moved slowly through bush towards elmina thirty mile distant halting in wood eight mile from town twelve from cape coast be going general said to look at english fort white friend will go with with fifty of warrior ammon quatia left camp crossing stream came down upon sea coast short distance west of elmina with be several of elmina tribe who have come up to camp to welcome ashantis approached to within three four hundred yard of fort be separated from by river fort on west coast of africa not being built to resist artillery be merely barrack surrounded by high wall sufficiently thick to allow men to walk in single file along top to fire over parapet top of wall being castellated building have appearance of much strength fort of elmina be of considerable size with barrack officer quarter within one side face river sea be wonderful fort ashanti general said much impressed by appearance yes frank replied there be cannon on top great black thing see sticking out be gun carry ball enough to kill hundred men with shot general looked for time attentively have castle in white men country how do take bring great many cannon throwing ball of iron a big a head frank answered so knock great hole in wall then rush in if there be cannon general urged never attack castle without cannon frank said if have cannon might try to starve people out can not do here because must land food from sea general looked puzzled why do white men come here come to trade said presently yes come to trade frank replied have other reason frank said want to take land because white man can not work in so hot climate then if must not trade must go away general asked yes frank agreed if must do trade must be use remaining here will let do trade general said brightening up if can not take fort will surround closely trade can come in out then white man will have to go away a to fantis will destroy white men will have one to fight for there be white troop frank said white soldier ashanti asked surprised thought be only black soldier fought for white white be few be trader english be many frank said earnestly for man that king of ashanti must send to fight england must send ten there be white soldier number of be not sent here be kept at home to fight other white nation french dutch dane many others just a king of africa fight against other be not sent here because climate kill white so to guard white trader here hire black soldier when be known in england that king of ashanti be fighting against fort will send white troop ammon quatia be thoughtful for time if come said at length fever will kill white man can not live in swamp friend white guest of king died at coomassie yes frank asserted have be nearly year in country before died three week will be enough for english army to march from cape coast to coomassie few might die most of must get there coomassie general exclaimed in surprise white men must be mad to think of marching against city of great king must make great fetish must die when have crossed river think general frank said dryly that fetish of black man have effect upon white men fetish have power when be believed in man who know that enemy have made fetish against be afraid blood becomes like water dy white believe in fetish laugh at then fetish can not hurt general said more turned thoughtfully retired to camp be tantalizing to frank to see union jack waving within sight to know friend be so near yet to be unable to stretch out hand to be now dressed in respect like native king having soon after arrival at coomassie sent present of clothes such a be worn by noble saying that people must not notice so much if be dressed like consequently have party be seen from castle wall appearance of englishman among must have be unobserved three day later general with similar party crossed sweet river at night proceeded along sea coast to within few hundred yard of cape coast castle whose appearance pleased no more than of elmina have done ashantis be now better supplied with food a be able to depend upon elmina tribe who cultivated considerable extent of ground to add to stock ashanti soldier be set to work to aid in planting larger extent of ground than usual proof in frank mind that general contemplated making long stay blockading elmina cape coast into surrender if must not carry by assault native of africa be capable of great exertion for time habitual attitude be that of extreme laziness one week work in year suffices to plant sufficient amount of ground to supply want of family seed only requires casting into earth soon ground will be covered with melon pumpkin sweet potato yam demand greater cultivation banana plantain require simply to be cut for fifty one week in year negro simply sits down watch crop grow to people like time be of absolutely value want be few garden furnishes with tobacco make drink from palm by fermenting juice of cocoanut fowl wander about in clearing suffice when carried down occasionally to port to pay for few yard of calico string of bead be be necessary for clothing decoration of family such people be never in hurry to wait mean to hing to hing be highest joy tomorrow mean month hence directly week if then ashanti army have be detained for one year five before english settlement must have be matter of indifference to so long a must obtain food woman be with for wife daughter of warrior have carried on head with army household good tiny stool few calabash for cooking mat to sleep on basket high piled with provision be there to collect stick to cook food draw water bring fire for pipe minister to pleasure must have more if be at home be contented to wait a long a king ordered be that time year distant frank be often filled with disgust at seeing noble savage lying indolently from morn till night while wife went mile in forest searching for pineapple fruit bent down prematurely aged by toil hardship many of young girl among negro be pretty with soft eye skin like velvet merry laugh graceful figure in very few year disappears by middle age be bent wrinkled old load be carried by woman with exception only of hammock be exclusively carried by men thus then ashantis settled down to what appeared to frank to be interminable business what rendered more tantalizing be that morning evening gun at english fort must be plainly heard be on th of june that ammon quatia reconnoitered elmina news came next day that hundred ten white men in red coat have landed from ship have arrived that morning off coast frank judged from description that must be marine from ship of war in be correct a consisted of marine marine artilleryman under lieutenant colonel festing who have just arrived from england three day later ashanti general with portion of force moved down close to elmina frank be told to accompany shortly afterwards news came that elminas be all ordered to lay down arm replied by going over in body to ashantis ammon quatia determined at once to attack town a be advancing gun of ship of war opened fire upon native town of elmina lay to west of european quarter sound of such heavy cannon differing widely from anything have ever heard before caused ashantis to pause in astonishment then came howl of shell exploded in rapid succession in village from flame began immediately to rise after few minute hesitation ashantis elminas again advanced general who be carried in chair upon shoulder of four men took post on rising ground near burning village there said english soldier be coming out of fort now will see little body of marine blue jacket of barraconta deployed in line a sallied from fort ashantis opened fire upon be out of range of slug a soon a line be formed english opened fire ashantis be perfectly astonished at incessant rattle of musketry from so small body of men be not noise for snider bullet swept among crowded body of black mowing down in considerable number in two minute ashantis turned ran general bearer in spite of shout hurried away with with others frank must have taken opportunity to escape have not two of guard seized by arm hauled along while other two kept close behind a soon a have passed over crest of rise british fire have ceased ammon quatia leaped from chair threw among flying troop striking right left with staff hurling imprecation upon if stop return against white said will send one of back to coomassie there will be put to death a coward threat sufficed fugitive rallied in few minute be ready to march back again be surprise created by wonderful sustained fire of breech loader rather than actual loss inflicted caused panic in meantime believing that ashantis have retired naval contingent went back to boat when dutch vice consul having ascended hill to look round saw that ammon quatia have made detour with troop be marching against town from east where must not be exposed to fire of fort instantly ran back with news marine thirty west indian soldier in fort at once marched out met ashantis just a be entering town fight be severe one for time side appeared to have advantage frank who under care of guard be few hundred yard in rear be filled with dismay at observing that ashantis in spite of heavy loss be suffering be gaining ground pressing forward bravely suddenly gave shout of joy for on rise on flank of ashantis appeared sailor of barraconta who have be led round from boat by lieutenant well r n who be in command instant took up position opened heavy fire upon flank of ashantis who dismayed by attack by fresh foe lost heart at once fled hastily in two engagement have lost nearly four hundred men frank of course retired with beaten ashantis that evening ammon quatia told that arm of white men be too good that must not attack again in open gun shoot farther a well a quicker than ours said slug be use against heavy bullet at distance in wood where can not see twenty foot among tree will be different if attack must attack trade will be starved out when come into wood will see that will eat up several week now passed quietly there be news that there be great sickness among white soldier indeed with scarce exception

steam launch be seen that be making for mouth of river now let go back ammon quatia said will see what will do frank felt full of excitement saw english running into ambuscade determined even if must cost life to warn presently heard sharp puff of steam launch boat be within three hundred yard frank stepped forward be about to give warning shout when ammon quatia eye fell upon expression of face revealed intention to ashanti who in instant sprang upon hurled to ground instantly dozen hand seized in obedience to general order fastened bandage tightly across mouth then bound standing against tree where must observe what be going on incident have occupied minute frank heard pant of steam launch coming nearer nearer presently through bush caught glimpse of then a came along of boat towing behind elminas ashantis be lying upon ground with gun in front of boat be fifteen yard from bank when be abreast ammon quatia shouted word of command stream of fire shot out from bush in boat be confusion several be killed many wounded by deadly volley among latter commodore commerell two three of officer launch now attempted to turn round marine in boat opened fire upon invisible foe who

frank have not be pleasant one while fight have lasted for english rifle bullet sang close to in quick succession one striking tree only few inch above head be doubtful too a to what fate must be at termination of fight fortunately ammon quatia be in highest spirit at victory ordered frank to be at once unbound there see said white be of use can not fight run with eye shut into danger so will be if attack on land be foolish why did wish to call out be not well treated be not king guest be not friend be well treated be friend frank said english be countryman be sure be in hand of english saw party of countryman marching into danger must call out warn even if knew that must be killed for doing so know ashanti said candidly can not say what must do be brave to run risk be not angry with

fort must not shoot over whole town there be few white soldier there men fear to be blown up in air yes frank said gravely danger might be great be better that ashantis must keep away from town if

especially angry that two large war drum have be lost so great be effect produced upon ashantis by tremendous fire british have poured into bush thicket a advanced that general thought expedient to draw off in direction of main body instead of further disputing way english now turned off towards coast marching part of way through open country part through bush so dense that be impossible to make flank attack upon here in such case a when ashantis know that enemy be going to approach through dense impassable forest cut path through parallel to by must advance at few yard distance then lying in ambush there suddenly open fire upon a come along a idea of coming of english have be entertained passed through dense thicket in single file unmolested native path be very difficult unpleasant walking native always walk in single file action of foot aided by of rain often wear path into deep v shaped rut two foot in depth burning two three village by way column reached coast at spot five mile from elmina having marched nine mile a ashantis be known to be in force at village of akimfoo ampene four mile farther party be taken on to point akimfoo be occupied without resistance ashantis fought hard in ampene be driven out of town into bush from british force be too small to drive therefore returned to elmina having marched twenty two mile prodigious journey in climate for heavily armed european effect produced among ashantis by day fighting be immense theory that white men must not fight in bush be roughly upset found that superiority be a great there a have be in open heavy bullet even at distance of hundred yard crashed through brush wood with deadly effect while slug of ashantis must not penetrate at distance much exceeding fifty yard ammon quatia be profoundly depressed in spirit that evening white men who come to fight said be not like who come to trade who ever heard of making long march why if go shortest distance be carried in hammock men march a well a warrior have gun shoot ten time a far a ours never stop firing carry cannon with have thing fly through air scream set village on fire kill men have never heard of such thing before what do call be called rocket frank said what be made of be made of coarse powder mixed with other thing rammed into iron case must not make too ashanti general asked frank replied at least not without knowledge of thing must mix with powder of be ignorant besides rocket require great skill in firing otherwise will sometimes come back kill men who fire why did not tell that white men must fight in bush told that there must be change when new general came that must not longer remain in fort must come out attack few day after fight ashantis broke up camp at mampon twelve mile from elmina moved eastward to join body who be encamped in forest near dunquah be going ammon quatia said to frank to eat up dunquah abra crampa will do better time know what english gun can do will not be surprised with ten thousand men ammon quatia halted at little village of asianchi where there be large clearing be speedily covered with little leafy bower ashantis run up at halting place two day later sir garnet wolseley with strong force marched out from cape coast to abra crampa halting on way for night at assaiboo ten mile from town on same day general sent order to colonel festing of marine artillery who commanded at dunquah to make reconnaissance into forest from place in accordance with order colonel festing marched out with gun rocket apparatus under captain rait annamaboe contingent of hundred twenty men under king directed by captain godwin four hundred other fantis under captain broomhead hundred men of d west india regiment after three mile march in perfect silence came upon ashanti cutting wood compelled to act a guide path divided into three annamaboes who led advance when within few yard of camp gave sudden cheer rushed in ashantis panic stricken at sudden attack fled instantly from camp into bush sudden a be scare frank guard did not forget duty seizing dragged off with in flight by side of ammon quatia latter ordered war drum to begin to beat frank be surprised at quickness with ashantis recovered from panic in five minute tremendous fire be opened from whole circle of bush upon camp stood on rising ground british force returned fire with great rapidity effect annamaboe men stood ground gallantly west indian fought with great coolness keeping up constant heavy fire with sniders houssas who have be trained a artilleryman worked gun rocket tube with great energy yelling whooping a round of grape canister be fired into bush rocket whizzed out notwithstanding heavy loss be suffering ashantis stood ground most bravely wild yell beating of drum never ceased only rose louder a volley of grape be poured into did not however advance beyond shelter of bush a british be not strong enough to attack there duel of artillery musketry be continued without cessation for hour half then colonel festing fell back unmolested to dunquah ashantis be delighted at result of fighting heavy a loss have be have held ground british have not ventured to attack in bush see ammon quatia said exultingly to frank what told be true white men can not fight in bush at wood be thin gave poor cover here see dared not follow on british side five officer king of annamaboe be wounded fifty two of men none be killed distance from bush to ground held by english being too far for ashanti slug to inflict mortal wound ammon quatia now began to meditate falling back upon prah sick wounded be already sent back determined before retiring to attack abra crampa whose king have sided with where english garrison have be posted on d of november however colonel festing again marched out from dunquah with hundred men of d west india regiment nine hundred native ally houssas with rocket under lieutenant wilmot towards ashanti camp time ammon quatia be not taken by surprise scout informed of approach of column moving out to meet attacked in bush before reached camp crouching among tree ashantis opened tremendous fire native ally with exception of hundred bolted at once remainder with houssas west indian behaved with great steadiness gallantry for two hour kept up heavy snider fire upon invisible foe early in fight lieutenant wilmot while directing rocket tube received severe wound in shoulder however continued at work till just a fight be ended be shot through heart with bullet four officer be wounded a be thirteen men of d west india regiment one of native be killed fifty severely wounded great many slightly after two hour fighting colonel festing found ashantis be working round to cut off retreat therefore fell back again on dunquah conduct of native levy here in two three smaller reconnaisances be so bad that be found that further dependence must be placed upon with exception of two partly disciplined regiment under colonel wood major russell be in future treated a merely fit to act a carrier for provision although second reconnaissance from dunquah have like first be unsuccessful effect upon ashantis be very great have suffered great loss while must not see that of enemy have be killed for lieutenant wilmot body have be carried off rocket especially appalled one rocket having killed six four of whom be chief who be talking together be true that english have not succeeded in forcing way through bush if time came out be to kill large number without suffering loss must clearly in long run be victorious what ashantis did not see what frank carefully abstained from hinting to ammon quatia be that if instead of stopping firing at distance beyond at slug be effective be to charge down upon english fire piece when reached within few yard of must overpower at once by enormous superiority of number at ten pace distant volley of slug be a effective a snider bullet whole of native troop must have bolted instant charge be made in open such tactic might not be possible a sniders must be discharged twenty time before english line be reached in wood where two line be not more than forty fifty yard apart sniders must be fired once at utmost twice while assailant rushed across short intervening space have ashantis adopted tactic must have crushed with ease little band with english attacked be characteristic of savage that can never be got to rush down upon foe who be prepared well armed half dozen white men have be known to keep whole tribe of red indian at distance on prairie however can be accounted for by fact that power of chief be limited that indian value own life highly doe not care to throw away on desperate enterprise among ashantis however where power of chief be very great where human life be held of little account be singular that such tactic must not have be adopted ashantis be now becoming thoroughly dispirited suffering have be immense fever hunger have made great ravage among although now wet season be over large quantity of food must be obtained in forest loss white men bullet rocket gun have inflicted upon have broken courage longing for home became greater than ever have not be that knew that troop stationed at prah must prevent fugitive from crossing must have deserted in large number already one of division have fallen back ammon quatia spent hour sitting at door of hut smoking talking to other chief frank be often called into council a ammon quatia have conceived high opinion of judgment have proved invariably correct so far be going said one day to take abra crampa to kill king then to fall back across prah think have better fall back at once frank answered when took with to edge of clearing yesterday saw that preparation have be made for defense that there be white troop there will never carry village english have thrown up breastwork of earth will lie behind shoot down men a come out of forest must have one victory to report to king if can ammon quatia said then can make peace if chooses white men will not wish to go on fighting fantis be eager for peace to return to village what do think if be true that white troop be coming out from england a fanti prisoner say frank answered will see that english will not make peace till have crossed prah marched to coomassie king be always making trouble will see that time english will not be content with retiring will in turn invade ashanti ammon quatia chief laughed incredulously will not dare to cross prah ammon quatia said if enter ashanti will be eaten up be not so easy to eat up frank answered have seen how hundred two can fight against whole army what will be when be in thousand king have not be wise must be better for to send down at once to make peace at price chapter xx white troop two day later frank be awoke by sudden yell leaped from bed of bough seized revolver rushing to door saw that party of twenty men be attacking ammon quatia two guard stationed there have already be cut down frank shouted to four guard ostik to follow guard have be standing irresolute not knowing what side to take example of young englishman decided fired musket into knot of native then charged sword in hand ostik drew sword always carried followed close to master heel frank did not fire until within two yard of ashantis then revolver spoke out six shot be discharged with deadly effect then catching up musket have fallen from hand of one of men have shot clubbed fell upon surprised already hesitating conspirator fortunately for frank have not loaded musket have intended to kill ammon quatia then to disperse instantly before aid must arrive believing that with death order for retreat across prah must at once be given several of have be killed by slug from musket of frank guard pistol have completed confusion report of gun called up other troop came rushing in on side scarcely did frank follower fall upon conspirator than took to heel fled into wood ammon quatia sword in hand have just sprung to door of hut prepared to sell life dearly when frank guard fired affair be so momentary that have hardly time to realize what have happened before assailant be in full flight have saved life said to frank have not be for must have be killed will not find ungrateful when have taken abra crampa will manage that will return to friend dare not let go openly for king must not forgive will have enough to do already to pacify when hears how great have be loss rest content will manage somehow hour afterwards ammon quatia gave order that army must move to attack of abra crampa place be held by body of marine sailor hundred west indian native troop of king major russell be in command village stood on rising ground be surrounded for distance of hundred fifty yard by clearing part of consisted of patch of cultivated ground rest have be hastily cleared by defender at upper end stood church be converted into stronghold window be high up in wall platform have be erected inside for sailor to fire from window be partially blocked with house on outside of village have be loopholed have be connected by breastwork of earth other defense have be thrown up further back in case outwork must be carried mission house in main street hut surrounded formed with church last stronghold for two three day bush round town have swarmed with ashantis whose tomtoms must be heard by garrison night day frank accompanied ammon quatia be therefore in front have opportunity of seeing how ashantis commence attack war drum gave signal when ceased ten thousand voice raised war song in measured cadence effect be very fine rising a did from part of forest by time ashantis have lined whole circle of wood round clearing then three regular volley be fired making from heavy charge used tremendous roar scarcely have ceased when king of abra splendid looking negro standing nearly six foot four in height stepped out from behind breastwork shouted taunting challenge to ashantis to come on replied with loud yell with opening of continuous fire round edge of wood on wall roof of village slug pattered thickly defender be in shelter in reply from breastwork loophole from window roof of church answering snider bullet flew out straight deadly several time ammon quatia tried to get men to make rush war drum beat great horn sounded men shouted time english bullet flew so thick deadly into wood wherever sound rose loudest that ashantis heart failed must not be got to make rush across hundred yard of cleared ground at five o'clock fire slackened shortly after dark attack recommenced moon be up full

after have once crossed prah have done so may be confidently affirmed that must never have got to coomassie policy must have be to avoid pitched battle to throng wood on side continually harassing troop on march preventing men working on road rendering impossible for carrier to go along unless protected on side by line of troop even when unopposed be difficult enough to keep carrier who be

possible advance in skirmishing line through bush rait two little gun be to be in center moving upon road right column consisting of naval brigade with wood regiment now reduced by leaving garrison at various post along road to three company be to cut path out to right then to turn parallel with main road so that head of column must touch right of skirmishing line of d left column consisting of other half of naval brigade with four company of russell regiment be to proceed in similar fashion on left column must therefore form two side of hollow square protecting d from of flanking movement of ashantis be so fond company of d be to proceed with headquarter staff rifle brigade be held in reserve early in morning major home cut road to within thirty yard of village of agamassie ascertained by listening to voice there be not more than score so of men in village gifford have made circuit in wood have ascertained that ashanti army be encamped on rising ground across stream behind village

experienced opposition whatever until issued from bush into little clearing surrounding village consisted only of four five house ashantis discharged musket hastily a first white men showed fire of leading file of column quickly cleared away d pushed on through village then forming in skirmishing line advanced for first two three hundred yard encountered serious opposition be then received by tremendous fire from unseen foe in front left column have not gone hundred yard before too came under fire captain buckle of engineer who be with engineer laborer occupied in cutting path ahead of advancing column be shot through heart similar opposition be experienced by right roar of fire be tremendous so heavy indeed that sound of individual report be lost noise be one hoarse hissing roar even crack of rait gun be lost in general uproar occasional rush of rocket of two trough with party of rait men accompanied wing be distinctly audible d must for time make scarcely way flanking column be also brought to stand owing to extreme thickness of wood ignorance of nature of ground column be unable to keep in proper position diverged considerably ashantis however made effort to penetrate between d for hour state of thing continued company of d advanced along main road to help to clear bush where ashantis still fought stubbornly not two hundred yard from village while two company of rifle brigade be sent up left hand road to keep touch with rear of russell regiment when fight commenced in earnest d be brought to stand by enemy frank lay down with soldier not foe must be seen fire of enemy broke out incessantly from bush twenty yard ahead air above be literally alive with slug perfect shower of leaf continued to fall upon path so bewilderingly dense be bush that men soon lost idea of point of compass fired in direction from enemy shot came thus happened that sailor sent in complaint to general that d d be firing at while d d made same complaint against naval brigade sir garnet who have taken up headquarters at village sent out repeated instruction to commanding officer to warn men to avoid error for two hour fight went on then column to left found that ashantis in front of have fallen back have however altogether lost touch of d be accordingly ordered to cut road to northeast until came in contact with in doing so came upon partial clearing where sharp opposition be experienced houssas carried open ground at rush enemy a usual opened heavy fire from edge of bush houssas be recalled fire be opened with rocket soon drove ashantis back cutting of path be proceeded with in meantime d be having hard time of have fought way to edge of swamp beyond lay immense ashanti camp here fire be so tremendously heavy that advance be again completely arrested not enemy be to be seen from bush of opposite side puff of smoke came thick fast perfect rain of slug swept over ground on be lying here rait gun for be only able from narrowness of path to bring one into position did splendid service advancing boldly in front of line of d ably assisted by lieutenant saunders poured round after round of grape into enemy until fire slackened little d leaping to foot struggled across swamp be over knee deep step by step won way through camp up hill everywhere dead ashantis lay in heap attesting terrible effect of snider fire determination with have fought beyond camp upon hill bush be thicker than ever here where be impossible for white soldier to skirmish through bush ashantis made last desperate stand narrow lane up alone troop must pas be torn a if by hail with shower of slug while large tree stood nearly in center of path caused slightly to swerve afforded shelter to from storm of bullet d sent back in return here rait brought gun up again to front cleared lane bush be too thick even for ashantis gun stopped firing with rush regiment went up narrow path out into open clearing beyond for short time ashantis kept up fire from house d soon drove out single shot from gun down wide street divided town into two portion bursting in midst of group at further end killed eight drove further idea of resistance in direction from mind be now about twelve o'clock although ashantis have lost camp village have suffered terribly be not yet finally beaten have moved principal part of force have be engaged upon left round to right be pressing hard upon column there d be cutting in between latter d when fortunate accident enabled to meet attack more effectively left column have cut path rather too much to east came into road between d d forming connecting link between while right column having at last cut away whole of brush wood in ashantis have so long wedged between road be now in direct communication with d have be reinforced by company of rifle brigade front therefore be now entirely changed faced east instead of north ashantis in vain tried to break line desisted from effort firing died away be thought that battle be over when at about quarter to one tremendous fire broke out from rear of column showing that ashantis be making last desperate effort to turn flank to retake village from have driven at eight in morning so near be rear of column to village that slug fell fast into reserve who be stationed there three company of rifle be sent up to strengthen line for three quarter of hour roar of musketry be a heavy continuous a have be at time during day then a enemy fire slackened sir garnet gave word for line to advance sweeping round from rear so a to drive enemy northward before movement be admirably executed bonny men of wood regiment who have fought silently steadily time that have be on defensive now raised shrill war cry slinging rifle drawing sword favorite weapon dashed forward like so many panther let loose by side skirmishing a quietly steadily a if on parade men of rifle brigade searched bush with bullet in five minute from commencement of advance ashantis be in full final retreat battle ended at about half past one having lasted five hour half ashantis be supposed to have have from fifteen to twenty thousand men in field what loss be must not accurately be calculated a carry off dead a fast a fall where rush be made by troop a have not time to do lay everywhere thick on ground by most moderate computation must have lost over two thousand ammon quatia be killed a well a aboo one of six great tributary king body of king chief executioner be also pointed out by of prisoner fought with extraordinary pluck resolution a be shown by fact that although wretchedly armed for upwards of five hour resisted attack of troop armed with breech loader supported by gun rocket position be good one have doubt calculated upon coming down upon from rising ground on flank rear with advantage must succeed in pushing forward upon side loss in killed be very slight not exceeding eight ten d out of total of four hundred fifty have hundred four wounded of whom eight be officer in right hand column colonel wood six naval officer twenty men of naval brigade with many of native regiment be wounded of sixty engineer laborer twenty be wounded while of five officer captain buckle be killed major home

quarman be attacked by strong body of ashantis coming from west probably forming part of essarman quatia force captain burnett who be in command having under lieutenant jones of d west indian regiment thirty five men of corp few native conducted defense be well seconded by men although attacking force be very greatly superior took little garrison by surprise for did not expect while great battle be raging within distance of mile that ashantis must be able to spare force to attack detached party garrison defended with great gallantry complete success not only beating off enemy whenever attacked sallying out assisting to bring in convoy of store be close at hand when attack began amoaful be town capable of containing two three thousand inhabitant great quantity of grain coarse flour be found here be done up in bundle of dried plantain leaf bundle weighing from five to fifteen pound capture be of great service to commissariat a afforded abundant supply of excellent food for carrier troop be in high spirit night have won battle fought under extreme difficulty that with minimum of loss in killed there be therefore sad recollection to damp pleasure of victory frank have be twice struck with slug in case have penetrated deeply be able to sit round camp fire to enjoy glass of rum water two keg of rum be only store night came up from rear thanks to consideration of commissariat officer to whom soldier felt extremely grateful for providing with invigorating drink after long fatiguing labor of day at about mile quarter from amoaful lay town of bequah capital of one of most powerful of ashanti king here considerable force be known to be collected before battle here many of fugitive be believed to have rallied must have be impossible to advance leave hostile camp so close to station in rear lord gifford be therefore sent out at daybreak to reconnoiter approached closely when twenty men sprang out from bush fired at fortunately without hitting when returned made report general determined to attack burn place order be issued for column consisting of russell regiment rait battery naval brigade supported by d commanded by colonel m'leod to start at one o'clock march be not opposed through bush a scout entered clearing heavy fire be opened upon lord gifford almost whole of party be more le severely wounded when sailor rushed in to support for short time enemy kept up heavy fire from house then fled leaving about forty of number dead on ground town be about twice size of fomana be burned column returned to camp great portion of town be destroyed place stockaded then be in readiness for advance upon coomassie amoaful be to be left in charge of d west indian who have now come up man received four day ration regiment be to take charge of own provision baggage advance started at seven in morning russell regiment rait battery rifle brigade then came headquarter staff followed by d naval brigade hammock ration went on with troop rest of baggage remained behind road differed in nothing from have so long be followed bore everywhere mark of retreating enemy in provision other article scattered about in occasional dark stain in plant grass trampled into ground six foot in breadth showing that usual negro way of walking in single file have be abandoned rate of progression be slow a country have to be thoroughly searched by advance there be too many stream to be crossed causing delay at one of village there be large camp where about thousand men be assembled to make stand defense be however feeble in extreme be evident that be greatly demoralized by defeat on st russell regiment carried place at rush enemy firing wildly altogether beyond range of weapon several be killed rest took precipitately to bush few shot be fired at other place real resistance took place on reaching village of agamemmu after having taken six hour in getting over a many mile column halted order be sent for baggage to come on from amoaful troop be set to work to cut bush round village be very small one breastwork be thrown up round troop be in little tentes d'abri packed a closely together a possible outside house within stockade carrier slept in street of village where so thickly did lie that be impossible for anyone to make way along without treading upon news came in night captain butler with western akims have arrived within two day march of amoaful without slightest reason king whole of army have left captain butler retired suddenly to prah at same time heard that army of wassaws under captain dalrymple have also broken up without having come in contact with enemy from rear also unpleasant news came up attack upon quarman have be no isolated event fomana have also be attacked garrison there have after hour fighting repulsed enemy several convoy have be assaulted whole road down to prah be unsafe next morning after waiting till large convoy came safely in column marched at nine o'clock gifford scout russell regiment rait battery being a usual in front resistance increased with step head of column be constantly engaged several village be taken by russell regiment who full of confidence in officer carried with rush in capital style be six mile to dab ground be swampy road intersected by many stream consequently be not until after being eight hour on road that head of column reached river three hour later before whole of troop baggage be encamped there chapter xxiii capture of coomassie upon afternoon of arrival of english column upon dah king made attempt to arrest progress with view doubt of bringing up fresh reinforcement flag of truce came in with letter to effect that rapid advance have much disconcerted be doubt true that have not be able to make arrangement for payment claimed that must send in hostage most of whom general have asked for be away that must not agree to give queen mother heir apparent be of course principal hostage indeed only one who must be of real value answer be accordingly sent back that unless personage arrived before daybreak next morning must force way into coomassie dah be river about fifteen yard wide three foot deep at deepest place engineer set to work to bridge directly arrived russell regiment at once crossing river bivouacking on opposite bank be unfortunate that first night upon troop have be unprovided with tent must have turned out tremendously wet thunder roared lightning flashed rain came down incessantly tired a troop be there be few who slept there be general feeling of satisfaction when morning broke last day of march began rain held up little before daybreak sky be clear when at six o'clock wood bonny men who have come up by forced march evening before led advance lieutenant saunders with one of rait gun came next rifle followed in support before bonny men have gone mile be hotly engaged combat be for two hour repetition of of amoaful saunders advanced again again to front with gun with few round of grape cleared side of path of enemy at last however bonny men must advance farther lieutenant byre adjutant of wood regiment be mortally wounded lieutenant saunders sent back to say be impossible for to get on farther unless supported by white troop rifle be then sent forward to take bonny men place slowly very slowly advance be continued until clearing round village must be seen fifty yard away then rifle gave cheer with sudden rush swept through to open carried village without check in meantime whole column have be following in rear a rifle advanced be hotly engaged in repelling series of flank attack on part of enemy attack be gallantly persevered in by ashantis who at time approached in such mass that whole bush swayed moved a pushed forward loss must have be extremely large for men lined road kept up tremendous snider fire upon at short distance casualty be slight road like almost road in country be sunk two foot in center below level of surrounding ground consequently men be lying in shelter a behind breastwork while kept up tremendous fire upon foe village once gained leading troop be thrown out in circle round order be given to pas baggage from rear to village operation be carried out in safety path being protected by troop lying in line along baggage once in troop closed up to village disappointed foe continuing series of desperate attack upon rear assault be kept up even after have reached cleared space of village enemy war horn sounding men making wood re echo with wild war cry naval brigade at one time inflicted great slaughter upon enemy by remaining perfectly quiet until ashantis thinking have retired advanced full of confidence cheering when tremendous fire almost swept away be six hour from time at advance began before rear guard entered village a mile half have be traversed coomassie be still six mile away be evident that if ashantis continued to fight with same desperation if baggage have to be carried on step by step from village to village force must not get halfway on to coomassie by instant baggage be in preparation be made for fresh advance rait gun a usual opened to clear way d time led advance enemy fire be very heavy highlander at first advanced slowly wounded straggling back in quick succession into village after twenty minute work however have pushed back enemy beyond brow of hill from point advanced with great rapidity dashing forward at time at double until foe scared by sudden onslaught gave way altogether literally fled at top of speed war drum horn chief stool umbrella littered next village told how sudden complete have be stampede a d advanced troop be from time to time sent forward until despatch came in from sir alison saying that village save last be taken that opposition have ceased that enemy be in complete rout up to time attack of enemy upon rear of village have continued with unabated vigor shot slug continually fell in place news from front be soon known be hailed with cheer went right round line of defense whether scared by note of triumph because too have received news effort of enemy ceased at once scarcely shot be fired at half past three baggage be sent forward headquarter staff rifle brigade followed there be further check d several company of rifle brigade entered coomassie without shot being fired in defense sir garnet wolseley soon after arrived taking off hat called for three cheer for queen be responded to with heartiness vigor must have astonished ashantis be still in considerable number in town having be told by king that peace be must be made seemed in way alarmed watched a amused interested spectator proceeding of white troop first thing to be done be to disarm who have gun seemed to scare others for in short time town be almost entirely deserted be now fast getting dark troop bivouacked in marketplace have so often be scene of human sacrifice on large scale day work have indeed be heavy one have be twelve hour on road without rest time to cook food water be very scarce really drinkable water having be met with during day in addition to have undergone excitement of long obstinate fight with enemy concealed in bush after work of almost equal severity upon day before have passed sleepless night in tropical rainstorm yet with exception of few fever stricken men not single soldier fell out from place in rank be first night in coomassie destined to be quiet one soon after two o'clock fire broke out in one of largest of collection of hut be soon in blaze from end to end engineer pulled down hut on side with great difficulty prevented flame from spreading fire be result of carrier others plundering one man policeman caught with loot upon be forthwith hung from tree several others be flogged after hour excitement place quieted down sir garnet be greatly vexed at occurrence a have evening before sent messenger to king asking to come in make peace promising to spare town if did so although coomassie be well known to frank be still ignorant of character of interior of chief house next day wandered about with almost a much curiosity a soldier interior even of palace of chief showed that ashantis can have idea of what call comfort house be filled with dust litter must not be accounted for solely by bustle hurry of picking out thing worth carrying away prior to hurried evacuation of place from roof hung mass of spider web thick with dust while sweeping place out before occupying brought down accumulation of dust must have be result of year of neglect principal apartment be lumbered up with drum great umbrella other paraphernalia of

many interesting valuable silver plate gold mask gold cup clock glass china pillow gun cloth casket cabinet olla podrida resembled content of sale room in many of native apartment of palace be sign that human sacrifice have be carried on to last minute several stool be found covered with thick coating of recently shed blood horrible smell of gore pervaded whole palace indeed whole town palace be full of fetish object just a trumpery meaningless a in humblest cottage king private sitting room be like rest open court with tree growing in tree be covered with fetish object thickly hung with spider web at end be small deep alcove with royal chair so that monarch must always sit on shady side along side of little court ran sort of verandah beneath be immense assortment of little idol

woman apartment sort of stuff of european of native manufacture be found scattered about in wildest confusion terror horror of four five hundred lady when found that husband be about to abandon palace that must have time to remove treasured finery can be well imagined in almost apartment yard of palace be very slightly raised mound larger than plate others two even three foot long be whitewashed presented strong contrast to general red of ground lower wall patch marked place of graf whole palace in fact appeared to be little better than cemetery slaughterhouse in one guard be placed over palace here a elsewhere through town looting be strictly forbidden day general expected arrival of king who have sent messenger to say must be in early at two o'clock tremendous rainstorm broke over town lasting for three hour in evening became evident that be again deceiving order be issued that troop in morning must push on three mile to tomb of king where be said to be staying later on however news came that king have gone right away into interior a storm be coming up became evident that rainy season be setting in in earnest determination be therefore come to to burn town to start for coast next morning night major home with party of engineer be at work mining palace preparing for explosion while prize committee be engaged in selecting packing everything considered worth taking down to coast news of change of plan however have not got abroad troop paraded next morning under belief that be about to march still farther up country when became known that be bound for coast there be general brightening of face buzz of satisfaction ran down rank be true that be believed that large amount of treasure be collected at king tomb prize money must not have be unwelcome still men felt that power be rapidly becoming exhausted hope of fight with foe of capture of coomassie have kept up upon march now that have be done usual collapse after great exertion followed hour added to number of fever stricken men who must have to be carried down to coast man a saw comrade fall out from rank felt that own turn might come next at six o'clock in morning advanced guard of baggage began to move out of town main body be off by seven d remained a rearguard to cover engineer burning party frank stayed behind to see destruction of town hundred engineer laborer be supplied with palm leaf torch in spite of outer coat of thatch being saturated by tremendous rain flame soon spread volume of black smoke poured up soon huge pile of smoke resting over town told ashantis of destruction of blood stained capital palace be blown up when engineer d marched out from town scarce house remained untouched by flame troop have proceeded short distance before have reason to congratulate on retreat before rain began in earnest to rejoice over fact that thunderstorm did not set in three day earlier than did marsh round town have increased foot in depth while next stream before rivulet two foot half deep have now swollen bank for hundred fifty yard on side with over five foot half of water in old channel across channel engineer have with much difficulty thrown tree over white troop passed while native carrier have to wade across be laughable to see only eye of taller men above water while shorter disappeared altogether nothing being seen box carried fortunately deep part be only three four yard wide thus carrier by taking long breath on arriving at edge of original channel be able to struggle across caused terrible delay still greater one occurred at dah here water be more than two foot above bridge engineer have made on passage up river be a deep a previous one have be carrier therefore waded a before deep part be wider so wide indeed that be impossible for shorter men to keep under water long enough to carry burden across tall men therefore crossed recrossed with burden short men swimming over passage across bridge too be slow tedious in extreme of cross plank have be swept away man have to feel step of way over so tedious be work at five in afternoon became evident that must be impossible for white troop to get across process at once slow dangerous before river be still rising be matter of importance that none must be left upon other side at night a ashantis might for anything must tell be gathering in force in rear consequently sir archibald alison gave order for white troop to strip to wade across taking only helmet gun clothes be made up in bundle carried over by native swimming while others took place below in case of men must be carried off foot by stream passed over without accident one result however be laughable incident next morning incident may be safely asserted never before occurred in british army be quite dark before last party be over native collecting clothes did not notice of one of men who have undressed at foot of tree consequently have to pas night very wet one in blanket absolutely paraded with regiment in morning in nothing helmet rifle incident caused immense laughter native swimming across river found brought back clothes a journey be necessarily slow tedious owing to quantity of baggage sick being carried down frank now determined to push straight down to coast bidding goodbye to sir garnet many friend have made during expedition took place for first time in hammock with bearer have accompanied from cape
