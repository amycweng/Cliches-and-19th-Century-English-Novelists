worthy to genius bravery must have raised because genius be directed by steady aim purpose lord peterborough be indeed one of most striking instance in history of genius talent wasted life thrown away by want of fixed principle by inability unwillingness to work with other men quarreled in turn with party with almost individual with whom came in contact while be constantly changing opinion be intolerant of opinion differing from at moment held be always ready to express in most open offensive manner contempt dislike for who differed from eccentricity be great be haughty arrogant hasty passionate denied god quarreled with king rendered utterly obnoxious to party in state yet there be vast amount of good in strange man be generous warm hearted to fault kind to in station beneath thoughtful considerate for troop who adored cool in danger sagacious in difficulty capable at need of evincing patience calmness wholly at variance with ordinary impetuous character although did not scruple to carry deception in order to mislead enemy to point vastly beyond what be generally considered admissible in war be true to word punctiliously honorable in ordinary affair of life for

same have be in place then madam mr anthony said solemnly must have deserved what happened to that must be turned neck crop into street mr anthony gave determined nod of head nod signified that must have voice on point however seeing that in husband present mood be better to say more resumed work while conversation have be proceeding jack stilwell who have fled hastily when surprised by mayor a be talking to daughter at back gate of garden have made way down to wharf there seating upon pile of wood have stared moodily at tract of mud extending from foot to strip of water far away position be

husband having further tie at oxford week later jack stilwell found domiciled at house of mr anthony be in vain that represented to cloth merchant that wish lay toward seafaring life that although father have wished to go into ministry have given way to entreaty mr anthony sharply pooh poohed idea insisted that be nothing short of madness to dream of such thing when so excellent opportunity of learning respectable business be open to at other time jack must have resisted stoutly must have run away taken chance rather than agree to proposition be broken down by grief at mother death incapable of making struggle against obstinacy of mr anthony scarce caring what became of signed deed of apprenticeship made for five year slave of cloth merchant not that latter intended to be anything kind sincerely believed that be acting for good of boy in taking a apprentice a jack recovered spirit energy absolutely loathed trade to be bound have not be for mistress anthony alice must have braved heavy pain penalty in day befell disobedient apprentice must have run away to sea constant kindness fact that mother with dying breath have charged to regard cousin a standing in place prevented from carrying idea often formed into effect in shop life be wretched be not stupid a master asserted for indeed in other matter be bright clever father have be well pleased with progress made with study in first place hated work in second shortcoming mistake be magnified made most of by foreman andrew carson man have long looked to be taken into partnership finally to succeed master seeing that latter have son conceived violent jealousy of jack stilwell in whose presence a prime favorite of mistress anthony of daughter thought foresaw overthrow of plan be not long in effecting breach between boy master for jack carelessness inattention gave plenty of opportunity mr anthony ere long viewed boy error a act of willful disobedience state of thing lasted for two year until climax came when a mr anthony have said to wife jack upon foreman attempting to strike have knocked latter down in shop mr anthony first impulse be to take apprentice before justice to demand condign punishment for act of flagrant rebellion moment reflection told that jack at end of punishment must return to house where wife must take part a usual quarrel have frequently arisen on account must be more bitter than before be far better to get rid of at once accordingly ordered from shop tore up indenture before eye bade never let see face again for first few hour jack be delighted at freedom

recruited almost entirely from reckless desperate men criminal be allowed to commute sentence of imprisonment for service in army gate of prison be also opened to insolvent debtor consenting to enlist effort of recruiting sergeant aided by such measure a proved insufficient to attract sufficient number of men to keep up army at required strength pressing have always existed to certain extent have be carried on secretly be regarded a illegal therefore a men must be have law giving justice authority power to impress men might select with exception of who possessed vote for member of parliament be passed with approval of party on side of house of common there be indeed great need for men england have allied with austria holland in opposition to france subject of dispute being succession to crown of spain england feeling in matter being further imbittered by recognition by louis xiv of pretender a king of england therefore although interest be not so deeply engaged in question a to

acknowledged successor to crown of spain indie netherlands while dauphin a eldest son of maria theresa must receive kingdom of naples sicily with spanish province of guipuscoa duchy of milan in compensation of abandonment of other claim when condition of treaty became known inspired natural indignation in mind of people of country have thus be arbitrarily allotted dying charles of spain be infuriated by conspiracy to break up divide dominion jealousy of france must have led to select austrian claimant emperor undisguised greed for portion of spanish empire overbearing unpleasant manner of austrian ambassador in spanish court drove to listen to overture of louis who have powerful ally in cardinal portocarrero archbishop of toledo whose influence be powerful with king cardinal argued that grandson of maria theresa must not be bound by renunciation also that have only be made with view to keep separate french spanish monarchy that if descendant of hers other than heir to throne of

temper avarice shameless corruption speedily alienated people from monarch above cardinal be supposed to be tool of french king to represent policy have for object dismemberment of spanish monarchy aggrandizement of france that louis have such design be undoubted if properly managed bribed portocarrero must have be pliant instrument in hand cardinal be soon estranged by constant interference by french agent in own measure of government therefore turned against france that power of intrigue have recently used in favor pretended to be devoted to france referred even most minute detail of government to paris for approbation with double view of disgusting louis with government of spain of enraging spanish people at constant interference of louis philip however found new powerful ally in heart of people by marriage with maria louisa daughter of duke of savoy beautiful girl of fourteen year old who rapidly developed into graceful gifted woman became darling of spanish people whose intellect firmness courage guided strengthened weak amiable husband for time power of spain france united overshadowed europe trading interest of england holland be assailed french army assembled

seized set in stock mayor have made light of affair have altogether seemed in unusually good state of temper dame anthony at once connected with jack disappearance knew that list have be made out by mayor idea that husband have taken mean of getting rid of jack that be exulting over success of scheme flashed across a mayor be away at town hall be forced to wait till return to dinner sooner have meal be concluded andrew carson two assistant have left table than began richard want to look at list of men who be pressed request scarcely came a surprise upon clothier have made up mind that wife

secret about suppose there be secret mayor replied according to act of parliament request of majesty minister drew up list of fifty of most useless disreputable of inhabitant of town rejoice to say that place be rid of respectable citizen be grateful to for manner in have fulfilled task laid upon a to clamor of few angry woman cause not moment annoyance know why be telling richard wife said calmly did not cast reflection a to manner in made choice only said wished to see list see that list concern mayor said why do wish to see wish to see richard because suspect that name of cousin jack stilwell be upon oh mother cried alice who have be listening in surprise to conversation suddenly starting to foot mean that have pressed jack to be soldier leave room alice father said angrily be concern of child like when door closed behind girl said to wife naturally name be in list selected fifty of most worthless fellow in southampton name be first occurred to what then then tell richard dame anthony said rising that be wretch mean cowardly cruel wretch have vented spite upon jack whom love a if be own son because must not put up with tyranny of foreman may be mayor of southampton may be great man in own way call mean pitiful fellow wo stay in house with hour longer wagon for basingstoke come past at three o'clock will go stay with father mother there take alice with forbid to do

town must hoot must dare show face in street insist indeed why miserable little man finger be tingling now say word to will box ear till wo know whether be standing on head heel mayor be small man while dame anthony although not above usual height be plump strong crestfallen spouse felt that be capable of carrying threat into execution therefore thought prudent to make reply angry wife swept from room be time before mayor descended to shop in interval have thought matter over have concluded that must be best for to let wife have way indeed did not see how must do otherwise have expected storm not such storm a never before in fifteen year of married life have seen wife in such passion there be saying whether must not carry threat into execution if interfered with now must be better to let go storm must blow over in time be natural enough for to go over stay few week with people in time of course must come back again after have got rid of jack being so must afford for awhile to put up with absence of wife be unpleasant of course very unpleasant to be called such name a one have heard did not so much matter perhaps after be best thing must happen that must take into head to go away for time in present mood must not make thing comfortable at home of course daughter must side with mother accordingly when carrier wagon stopped at door mayor went out with pleasant countenance saw that box be safely placed in that wife be comfortably seated on shawl spread over heap of straw attention however received thanks recognition from dame anthony while alice whose face be swollen with cry did not speak word however be seated well under cover of wagon must not be seen by few people standing near a mayor continued till wagon started speaking cheerfully giving sort of injunction a to taking care of on way flattered that one must have idea that departure be anything amicable one week later letter arrived for dame anthony mayor at once recognized handwriting of jack stilwell took up to room have considerable debate with a to whether must open not question be what did boy say if wrote full of bitter complaint a to treatment receipt of letter by wife must only make matter worse in case must be better to destroy letter a well a others might follow so put end to communication for be unlikely that boy must ever return to england accordingly opened letter after reading through laid down with feeling of something like relief be written in cheerful spirit jack began by saying that feared dame anthony alice must have be anxious when heard that be missing from lodging have doubt dear cousin will have guessed have befallen seeing that so many have be taken away in same way think that late master acted handsomely in thus getting rid of for a list be made up by be of course doing will please tell from that feel grudge against in first place did not know be going away to sea must naturally have angered to see one known to be connected with hanging about southampton doing nothing besides know that always meant kindly by took in when have nowhere to go gave apprenticeship without fee have not be that roving spirit rendered disinclined for so quiet life must doubtless have done much for hereafter thus thinking over seems to reasonable that must have be angered at rejection of benefit intended for in next place may be that action in shipping off a soldier may in end prove to be for welfare have carried out intention gone a sailor sailor might have remained life seems to that a soldier chance be larger not only will see plenty of fighting adventure accord well with spirit seems to sergeant who have shown much kindness say that be so that there be fair chance of advancement soldier be for great part disorderly ignorant men a mean to be steady obedient so a to gain goodwill of officer a have received good education from dear father hope in time to come to be regarded a one different from common herd if get opportunity of distinguishing get killed by spanish bullet pike thrust by fever say be not uncommon then be possible may come back at end of war with honor credit sergeant said may even obtain advancement to rank of officer therefore late master having done many good turn may perhaps find that last one even though intended not be best of will make respect to dear cousin tell feel grudge ill will against will give love to cousin alice tell will bring home rare keepsake from spain must fall in way know will do same for who have always be so good kind to boy be not bad boy mayor said well pleased a laid down letter may be have judged too harshly seeing that set against what be best for welfare still one can not expect men head on boy shoulder writes dutifully properly believe be fault of andrew carson who be forever edging on by report of boy laziness carelessness certainly have grudge against assuredly exceeded place authority when lifted hand against wife cousin seems to truly have acted somewhat hastily wrong headedly in matter will give master carson notice at end of month will require service no longer fellow put too forward will please mary never liked woman in matter of like dislike be shrewder than be perhaps when hears that be going read letter will forward to by carrier may come back to certainly miss sorely household matter go wrong now that be away ought not to have said thing to wise man think anything of what woman say when be angry now that think thing over certainly seems to that have sort of warrant for word yes certainly know what can have come over unless be that fellow andrew carson richard anthony have not be considered bad fellow else must never have become mayor of southampton for fifteen year mary have got on very well together save for little dispute have arisen from over masterful disposition be good wife none must wish for better though be given to flame out at what considers unrighteous dealing woman have fault man too a far a go upon whole few of have le than mary will write to at once mayor be not man to delay when mind be once made up sitting down at writing desk wrote a follows dear wife inclose letter have come for from cousin jack opened will think poorly of when tell have be filled with complaint of a expected must not have come to hand for anger against be fierce enough without adding of fresh fuel thereto lad a will see writes in quite strain remembers former kindness rather than late injury letter have put into head to think matter over in different spirit from in have previously regarded have come to conclusion have acted wrongly first that did not make allowance enough for boy second insisted on keeping to trade disliked third have given too willing ear to what andrew carson have said against boy lastly that took such mean of freeing from today give andrew carson notice to quit service matter in have hitherto withstood be willing to forget word spoke to in anger seeing that there be foundation for that when woman be in passion tongue go further than mean now a be ready to put on one side trust that also will put aside anger at having obtained pressing for soldier of cousin can see for by writing that doe not desire that enmity will arise out of manner of going for fifteen year have lived in amity see not why after cloud pass away must not do so again miss sorely thing go badly with since have gone food be badly cooked serving indifferent if will write to tell that be willing to come back to be loving dutiful wife again will make holiday come over to basingstoke to fetch alice home again be writing to jack sending five guinea for will no doubt find use in getting thing suitable for adventure upon be embarked for payment of majesty to soldier doe not permit of purchase of many luxury on second thought have resolved to pay andrew carson month wage to let go at once so that if return will not find one here against whom have always be set who be indeed in small way author of matter have come between save only a touching impressment of own must take blame solely upon give love to alice say that must keep up spirit look forward to time when cousin jack will come back to after killing of many spaniard having signed carefully sealed letter with from jack inclosed within mayor then proceeded to write following to young soldier dear cousin jack have read letter sent to wife be written in very proper dutiful strain departure have caused trouble between wife hope will pas away after have read considered letter carried matter so far that be at present with cousin alice at house of parent at basingstoke having read letter write to tell that feel that be not without blame toward did not see until manner of letter opened eye to fact have misunderstood being bent on carrying out own

sir when be together on guard on board ship noticed never talked of such thing seemed to a if one be trying to forget past think that made more brutal bloody minded than must have be one be afraid of one else guessing a be contented be wanting to get away so carried on a bad a must ' ' dare say be right lad must be terrible position for man to be in see law can make distinction if be thoroughly understood that if man took up life of pirate whether willingly unwillingly must assuredly be executed if be caught must have sea swarming with pirate now lad know how boom be fastened can suggest way that must get over loosen without giving alarm 'there be way sir one end be fastened by big chain be fixed to great shackle be let into hole in rock fastened in there with lead be fixed end of boom

gun in of be loaded with round shot to keep vessel from approaching though of course must fire grape into boat saw coming in ' 'this doe not seem easy business by mean mr earnshaw ' captain said 'it doe not sir ' lieutenant agreed in dubisome sort of way 'but doubt can be done sir doubt can be done 'yes how ' captain asked 'you will be in command of boat mr earnshaw will never do to attack place a without sort of plan be boom like lad ' lieutenant asked 'be lashed together ' 'no be solid spar ' said entrance be not more than forty foot wide boom be part of mainmast of big ship ' 'it seems to ' said lieutenant 'that only way to get at must be to go straight at boom two lightest boat to go first men must get on spar pull boat over then make dash for battery heavy boat can follow ' must never do mr earnshaw ' captain said 'you forget there be twelve gun loaded to muzzle with grape musketballs trained upon point only forty foot across must be possible to land just outside boom lad on one side to keep along edge wade in water to battery 'no sir rock go straight up from water side 'well two sentry how do get down to water edge ' 'they be let down by rope from above sir rope be hauled up a soon a be down 'this be deuce of place mr earnshaw ' captain said must hing hastily in matter will only be throwing away life of lot of men failing in object be intending to sail on not return for week for doubt will be specially vigilant for time after seeing large ship pas a be will return tonight to back of island will there leave cutter gig will be in charge of cutter mr escombe will take gig will then sail away again before daylight for although from what lad said there be watch kept on side of island can not be more than three mile across of men woman might stroll across might from high point in island obtain view way will make thorough survey of side cliff certainly seem so far a must see a left island a perpendicular a be on side passed there may be place easier than place where by setting wit to work may make shift to climb up get into island will if have to blast flight of step up cliff will do best to find place sir ' lieutenant said 'and if there be one will make one ' lieutenant told be to accompany in cutter be got ready for trip water week ration of food be placed on board boat for in climate there be saying when gale might spring up how long vessel might be before got back to pick up boat when be fairly out of sight of island lay to till got dusk then head be pointed back again there be scarce breath of wind stirring vessel went through water so slowly that couple of hour later captain ordered boat to be lowered for saw that if wind did freshen ship must not get to island much le get away again before daylight oar be got out off started after four hour steady rowing lieutenant who be steering by compass made out land looming high above quarter of hour row dropped grapnel close to foot of cliff men be told to get sleep a well a must till morning a soon a be daylight be off again rowed to end of island for a mr earnshaw said to third lieutenant have best begin at end do work thoroughly when got to point turned rowed back keeping about two hundred yard from cliff so that must see well up be about hundred foot high sometimes little le sometimes good bit more went a straight up from water edge a cliff at dover only there be no beach be deep water right up to foot went along very slowly men only just dipping oar into water of watching foot of cliff sometimes must stop altogether while officer talked over possibility of one climbing up at place where water trickling down from top have eaten away face little not goat in world must have climbed up not to say men so kept on till got to other end of island must have be five mile long not place must see 'unless be going to do a captain said blast step up face of rock believe be to be done lieutenant earnshaw said to mr escombe 'well there be nothing to do lad to row in drop grapnel again wait till see ship light tonight ' although rowed in to within oar length of cliff there be eight fathom of water when dropped grapnel have be lying there hour when third lieutenant said must think mr earnshaw that if be to bring pinnace with four pounder gun in bow up end with small charge fire ball with rope fastened to up into clump of tree saw just about middle of island might get caught ' might escombe idea be good one doubt whether there be man on board ship must climb rope swinging like against face of cliff 'he might if used knotted rope ' mr escombe said must mind making try yer honor ' one of sailor said dozen others volunteered readiness to make attempt will put to captain mr earnshaw said agrees a be first to volunteer jones will have chance ' day be dead calm so be night followed although rowed back to end of island from have come no light be to be seen that night next day passed slowly sun be hot toward evening lieutenant gave permission for men to bathe warned that man must go far from boat because there might be shark about however did see none enjoyed dip be in better humor still when found that light breeze be springing up might have be about midnight when men on watch made out light to seaward be long in getting up grapnel sitting oar in hour be on board be soon sailing away from island again next night in came again saw that third lieutenant plan be going to be adopted in fact guessed so before for sail maker have be at work with two light rope making rope ladder ship smith have got empty shell on deck have made shift to screw iron eye into for fixing rope to gun be taken out of pinnace little mortar fixed in dozen rope hundred fathom long have knot put in two foot launch two cutter be lowered a well a pinnace time crew be armed with cutlas pistol went with a before a must be wanted to guide when got near village be bright starlight night without haze so that when got close must make out outline of cliff must see thick wood growing on top when got within about hundred yard of cliff boat stopped rowing ' use more powder than can help gunner mr earnshaw said first place want to do more than carry out rope to full length in next place want to make more noise than can help what wind there be be fortunately blowing seaward being so close under cliff sound will be echoed back at same time le noise better will begin with very little sir if ball go to top of cliff will put trifle more into gun next time be better to make mistake on right side ' small quantity of powder be put in mortar be only four inch one then wad be put in shell with one of knotted rope fastened to dropped in top rope have be coiled in tub so a to run out easily gunner applied match there be dull report man held breath to listen there be thud high up on cliff then splash ' few foot short of top must say gunner must put in more next time for shell must go well up over tree drop among otherwise wo catch ' gunner by light of lantern measured out half a much powder again a have used before then fired time heard sound till there be faint splash in water rope gone sir ' gunner said looking into tub 'there be little too much time ' think so ' mr escombe said think that splash be end of rope touching water in case will be just right hundred foot up cliff five hundred foot among tree fear of rope coming back to ' took quarter of hour search in dark to find rope at last came upon sure enough there be only four five fathom in water jones mr earnshaw said 'it turn put that light line over shoulder when get to top haul on till get up rope ladder fasten to stout trunk give low hail will hold rope a steady a can below while mount ' 'ay ay sir ' said man who be active young chap will be up there in jiffy fastened lower end round one of thwart of boat then began to climb be near five minute before got to top for there be nasty place where cliff jutted out rope be hard against presently shaking ceased minute later light line be hauled tight there be low cheer in boat then up went rope ladder minute two later there be hail from top 'all taut sir ' will go first mr earnshaw said accordingly up went one by one followed waiting for signal that one before have got up till have gone except two told off a boat watch then men of launch cutter followed in about two hour be at top lantern be shown to tell ship be there started at once across island mr earnshaw keeping line by pocket compass be rough work though at last lieutenant said 'we make noise going through bush that have better wait till daylight so just halt where be lad a soon a first ray of light showed be off again hour later reached edge of slope down to cove remember ' lieutenant said 'that woman be to be hurt men who resist be to be shot cut down be to take prisoner who throw down arm of may be able to prove le guilty than rest at rate there be fear of spanish authority being too merciful pirate have be scourge of sea for last six year well lad there ai much more to tell took completely by surprise men in village be knocked down bound without firing shot men in battery tried to slew gun round did give 'em time fought desperately for knew what doom be there be prisoner taken there a soon a village be taken went straight with mr escombe to captain house wife be standing at door gave little cry a saw british uniform ran step two to meet then stopped arm dropped by side 'what peter ' said a came up 'be who led here ' ma'be be ' say 'and best thing must do for for must not wish to stay here life with just people be here ' 'but what have happened ' said be be here what have become of schooner schooner be sunk ma'be brig be captured ' husband ' ma'be take on husband went down with schooner tottered thought must have fallen mr

order on deck unarmed witnessed execution of comrade who be hung up to extremity of main yard other prisoner be sentenced to two hundred lash apiece punishment be according to idea of time very lenient such punishment being frequently administered for comparatively trifling offense prisoner considered fortunate in escaping hanging for indeed have prepared previous to administration of punishment colonel addressed men told that ringleader have be found guilty sentenced to death that member of court martial have agreed with considering youth inexperience of offender whole circumstance of case must be possible to remit death sentence confident that prisoner whole of regiment must recognize leniency with have be treated must return to duty with firm hearty determination to do in power to atone for misconduct to show true worthy soldier of queen if be case further notice must be taken of error at same time warned that have by long list of men who have taken prominent part in affair that first time of misconducted might be well assured that mercy must be shown to naval court martial showed greater severity than administered by military officer vessel be short handed moreover officer did not wish stigma to attach to ship of serious mutiny among crew have of be matter must have be reported a none of crew have absolutely taken part in rising however evident be that intended to do so sentence of death be passed number of men be sentenced to be flogged more le severely who have lately be pressed getting off with comparatively light punishment while

insufficient for such enterprise prevailed upon lord galway to give part of lord raby general cunningham regiment of english dragoon although portuguese strenuously opposed being done conduct indeed at time be very similar to adopted hundred year later toward duke of wellington throwing conceivable obstacle in english commander way opposing plan of action suggested many of dragoon be without

later archduke charles landed amid thunder of gun of fleet fortress for here for first time be acknowledged a received honor due to king of spain there be little delay lord peterborough energy hurried one else forward on th of august fleet again put to sea king prince of hesse darmstadt accompanying wind be contrary be not till th that anchored in altea bay at mouth of guadalaviar on valencian coast on other side of roadstead stood castle village of denia expedition be received with good will by people who hated ascendency of france at madrid be bitterly jealous of castile a soon a fleet anchored peterborough caused manifesto to be distributed among people disclaiming idea of aggrandizement on part of great britain ally intention of injuring person property of spaniard who be lawful

shot have be fired surrendered general ramos with four hundred regular troop from fleet landed took possession amid enthusiasm of population charles iii be for first time on spanish ground proclaimed king of spain of indie earl of peterborough now proposed plan of most brilliant daring kind have advice be taken war must probably have terminated in very short time by securely seating charles iii upon spanish throne madrid be distant fifty league from altea bay requena be only town of strength lay in way rich country must have afforded ample provision mean of transport friendly portion of people must have placed at disposal of army in whole of central spain there be force must oppose troop of philip be either on frontier of portugal occupying disaffected city of north at madrid there be few troop of horse in week then possibly without shedding drop of blood charles might have be proclaimed king in capital of spain plan be of course not without danger marshal tesse with overwhelming force must threaten left of advancing army garrison of northern city if united must march with equal superiority of force upon right tesse must be followed by lord galway allied portuguese army while barcelona other stronghold of catalonia must rise if garrison be withdrawn even in case of failure peterborough must have retired safely through valencia have re embarked on board fleet must have marched to gibraltar scheme be at once daring judicious archduke charles be slow timid be controlled by advice of even slower more cautious german adviser argument entreaty on part of peterborough must suffice to move earl be in despair at so brilliant opportunity being thrown away expressed with greatest of bitterness in letter home a to impossibility of carrying out movement when embarrassed by presence of king by incapacity of king adviser however finding that nothing must be done re embarked troop fleet sailed for barcelona be not however thought probable that successful attempt must be made upon so strongly fortified city be determined that if upon inspection chance of success must appear slight fleet army must at once proceed a originally intended to assistance of duke of savoy chapter vii barcelona city of barcelona one of most populous important in spain be not naturally place of great strength be situated on plain close to sea defense although extensive be not very formidable against strong army provided with siege train to hold fully required much larger force than be disposable for defense garrison be however fully equal in strength to

partisan of duke d'anjou destined for employment in different part of spain be now however detained in city by governor to assist in defense first glance into state of affair gave earl of peterborough such unfavorable impression that at once objected to proposed attack governor don francisco velasco be brave distinguished officer garrison equaled own force in number town be well supplied with provision store in order to add to difficulty of besieger order have be given to destroy forage in surrounding country must not be conveyed within wall austrian sympathy inhabitant might posse be effectually suppressed by power vigilance of governor besieging army be far too small to attempt blockade while chance of assault upon equal force behind well armed defense seemed almost desperate engineer declared that difficulty of regular siege be enormous if not insurmountable that only vulnerable point be covered by bog where transport of cannon formation of work must be impossible above principal hope of expedition have failed adherent of charles have assured that whole country must rise in favor on arrival of fleet that town must probably open gate to receive promise have like others have received from spanish friend proved delusive few of peasantry appeared to receive on coast be unarmed without officer earl instruction although generally quite indefinite be stringent upon one point be on account to make slightest alteration in plan of expedition to take decisive step for accomplishment without advice of council of war must have be in case embarrassing for general in present instance be calculated altogether to cripple there be little harmony among chief officer english military officer be by mean on good term with other while naval officer regarded almost a insult lord peterborough being placed in command of english hated german officer despised dutch lord peterborough disliked almost associate entertained profound contempt for one whose opinion might differ from at moment might happen to hold be impossible that good must come from council of war composed of such jarring element a however lord peterborough instruction be positive on th of august convened council of war on board britannia consisting of nine general brigadier with two colonel on staff king prince of hesse darmstadt be present took part in deliberation singularly enough council proved unanimous in opinion that barcelona must not be attacked reason for decision be drawn up put on record council pointed out difficulty existed declared strength of allied army to be only nineteen battalion of foot two cavalry regiment of whom more than seven thousand men be fit for action only one hundred twenty dragoon horse have survived voyage in serviceable condition decision of council be most opposed to hope wish of charles prince of hesse darmstadt addressed letter of strong remonstrance to lord peterborough urging to abandon expedition at juncture must be alike fatal to common cause discreditable to british arm meanwhile however greater part of troop have landed without opposition sea broke with such force on beach that much difficulty have be experienced in getting ashore landing place have be well chosen by lord peterborough sir cloudesley shovel be about two mile east of city near place called badalona close to mouth of little river basoz transport be moored in a close a possible boat of fleet carried three thousand men ashore trip in five hour fifteen battalion be landed without loss of man strong natural position about mile from city be chosen for

between two of bastion that whole strength of army must be thrown upon assault acknowledged force of several objection to attack urged that in case vigorous action be safest dwelt upon ruin must fall upon such of subject a have declared for if abandoned to fate concluded by declaring that at least must not desert appeal failed to move of council with exception of peterborough alone voted although in opposition to own judgment in compliance with king plan notwithstanding adverse decision of council horse dragoon be landed on th on th th th council again assembled to deliberate upon earnest request of king that must attempt siege for period of eighteen day first decision be adverse two only voting with lord peterborough for siege at second council influence succeeded in obtaining majority at third agreed to abandon attempt even commander in chief concurring cause of sudden reversal of opinion be that none of workman whom have demanded from leader of catalan peasantry have appeared felt impossible to carry on work erect siege battery without such assistance nevertheless peasantry gave effectual aid in landing artillery tent ammunition store on th king landed amid great concourse of people who received with demonstration of enthusiasm must with difficulty make way through to camp prepared for near san martino presence of king on shore added to difficulty of situation following of german courtier complained bitterly of disinclination of ally to undertake siege while ally be incensed against who reproached for not undertaking impossibility dissension spread between ally dutch general declared that must disobey order of commander in chief rather than vainly sacrifice men peterborough be driven nearly out of mind by reproach recrimination to be exposed quarrel took place around be most anxious to carry out instruction a far a possible to defer to opinion of charles be also bound by decision of council of war be exactly opposite to wish of king prince of hesse darmstadt enraged by insisting that fifteen hundred disorderly peasant whom have raised be army must be paid a regular soldier from military chest while must submit to discipline refused to labor in trench open rupture took place when prince in vexation at result of council of war even went so far a to accuse earl of having used secret influence to thwart enterprise to add to difficulty of commander in chief english troop be loud in complaint against for having landed committed to apparently hopeless enterprise nevertheless clamored to be led against town that might not be said to have come like fool gone like coward lord peterborough confided trouble vexation freely to young secretary jack be sincerely attached to generous eccentric chief general be gratified by young officer readiness at time hour to come to write from dictation long letter dispatch sent home saw too that be thoroughly trustworthy must be relied upon to keep absolute silence a to confidence made in midst of quarrel dispute siege be carried on in languid manner battery of fifty heavy gun supplied by ship manned by seaman be placed upon rising ground flanked by two deep ravine on several of adjacent hill battery of light field gun have be raised three week be consumed in comparatively unimportant operation real advance toward capture of place have be effected something like blockade however have be established for catalan peasant guarded vigilantly approach to town officer of fleet be le discontented than brother on shore at feeble conduct of siege have be consulted must have be in favor of direct attack upon city with scaling ladder a if have be about to board hostile ship peterborough officer be well aware that attack against city defended by superior force must be simple madness even attack by regular approach with mean labor at disposal must have have chance of success while on shore in fleet be chafing at slowness hopelessness of siege jack stilwell be alone aware that commander in chief did not share in general despair of good arising from operation lord peterborough have little communication with other general alone in tent with jack interpreter occupied from morning till night in examining peasant spy a to particular of fortification of city of ground near to wall of habit proceeding of garrison at last resolved upon attempt in daring enterprise be almost without parallel indeed only hope of success lay in boldness for friend foe must anticipate that must be attempted be le than surprise of citadel of montjuich formidable stronghold covered weakest part of defense toward southwest far exceeded in strength other part of line have be most skillfully designed ditch be deep wall firm outwork skillfully planned battery well armed inner defense formidable in be in fact by far strongest point in position of besieged standing on commanding height be abundantly capable of defense even against regular siege reduction be always regarded a most formidable enterprise to be undertaken at leisure after capture of town only weakness lay in fact that surrounding on side be numerous ravine hollow must afford concealment to assailant that trusting to extraordinary strength of position garrison of montjuich might neglect proper precaution one morning before daybreak earl accompanied only by jack native guide left camp on foot having laid aside uniform put on attire of peasant so that glitter of accouterment might not attract attention of enemy outpost making long detour approached castle ascending one of ravine gained point where unseen must mark particular of fortification having carried out purpose earl returned to camp with companion without absence having be observed observation peterborough have made confirmed report of peasant that garrison kept negligent watch at once resolved upon making attempt to none of most intimate friend did give slightest hint of intention to disguise view called council of war in camp fleet wherein be resolved with full consent that siege of barcelona must be abandoned that army must be immediately re embarked conveyed to italy accordingly heavy artillery be conveyed on board ship warlike store collected troop warned to be ready for embarkation storm of reproach be poured upon earl by charles courtier officer of fleet protested openly declaring that assault ought to be attempted that be too late in season to attempt operation elsewhere to jack surprise commander usually so hasty irritable passionate bore with greatest calmness patience reproach accusation to be exposed one dreamed that behind preparation for embarkation plan of attack be hidden on th of army received order to embark on morrow while within town garrison inhabitant who be pretended to be well affected to bourbon held high rejoicing at approaching departure on afternoon of day detachment of english dutch troop twelve hundred strong be ordered to assemble in allied camp for purpose a be supposed of covering embarkation scaling ladder everything necessary for assault have already be privately prepared by catalan peasant under peterborough instruction about six o'clock in evening four

in support at little distance at prince of hesse darmstadt be surprised by lord peterborough entrance into quarter since rupture intercourse have ceased between have determined earl said to make night attack upon enemy may now if please be judge of behavior see whether officer soldier really deserve bad character of late have so readily imputed to then explained that troop be already on march to montjuich prince immediately ordered horse two gallant impulsive singular men rode off followed only by jack stillwell prince aide de camp at ten o'clock overtook troop peterborough ordered total change of route leading road be winding narrow difficult for great part of way there be only room for men to march in single file night be very dark detachment many hour on march so daylight be just breaking when reached foot of hill on fort of montjuich stood troop under peterborough command now perceived object of march imagined that must be led to attack before day have fairly broke general have well considered subject have determined to avoid risk confusion of night assault called officer together explained to why did not mean to attack till broad daylight examination of place have shown that ditch must be crossed palisade barrier having be erected have noticed too that inner work be not sufficiently high to enable gun properly to command outer work must be carried by enemy have therefore determined to carry outwork by assault judging that if captured inner work must not long resist in case of reverse to enable to take advantage of success told that have ordered brigadier general stanhope to march during night with thousand infantry handful of cavalry to convent lying halfway between camp city there to hold in reserve peterborough now silently coolly completed arrangement for assault divided body of troop into three party first of two hundred eighty strong be to attack bastion facing town be strongest part of defense prince of hesse accompanied party lieutenant thirty men formed advance captain fifty more be support remaining two hundred men be to form in rear order be that must push forward in spite of enemy fire leap into ditch drive garrison before if possible enter work with if not to obtain at least firm footing on outer defense second party similar in strength formation under command of hon colonel southwell be to attack unfinished demibastion on extreme western point of fort furthermost from town remainder of little force under dutch colonel be to be held in reserve to assist wherever might be most useful occupied position somewhat in rear of halfway between two party who be to make assault soon after daylight peterborough gave order to advance in highest spirit in excellent order soldier pushed up hill toward fort irregular spanish troop be first to perceive fired hasty volley at british troop a ascended crest then retreated into fort seizing arm garrison rushed to rampart manned in time to receive assailant with sharp fire grenadier who formed leading party did not hesitate for moment leaped into unfinished ditch clambered up outer rampart with pike bayonet attacked defender captain detachment speedily joined defender gave way broke fled in wild confusion party rushed into bastion peterborough prince with two hundred men followed quickly in perfect order be soon master of bastion earl at once set men to work to throw up breastwork to cover from gun of inner work a there be plenty of material collected just at spot for carrying out of extensive repair be able to put under cover before enemy opened fire upon attention of garrison be wholly occupied by sudden unexpected attack prince della torrella neapolitan officer in temporary command of fort ordered force to oppose assailant be what peterborough have expected at once sent order to colonel southwell to commence attack upon now almost undefended west bastion order be promptly obeyed at first rush ditch be passed rampart gained outer wall scaled three gun taken without loss of man defender hastened at once to meet new danger opened heavy fire upon british sallying out endeavored to retake outer rampart with bayonet desperate contest ensued though many of english officer soldier fell must not yield foot of position have captured colonel southwell man of great personal strength daring be in struggle three time surrounded by enemy time cut way out in safety sally be at last repulsed english intrenched position turned captured gun against fort while assaulting column be occupied in intrenching there be lull in battle besieged must not venture to advance against a must have be exposed to fire of other to risk of flank attack peterborough exerted to utmost ordered up thousand men under general stanhope made prodigious exertion to get gun mortar into position upon newly won rampart great be consternation astonishment in barcelona when loud roar of musketry broke out round citadel velasco governor be thunderstruck to find threatened in vital point by enemy whose departure have evening before be celebrating assembly be sounded church bell pealed out alarm troop ran to place of assembly fortification round town be manned body of four hundred mounted grenadier under marquis de risbourg hurried off to succor of montjuich earl have be sure that movement must be made must not spare men from own scanty force to guard road between city castle have posted number of armed spanish peasant who be in pay of army in narrow gorge where with hardly risk to might easily have prevented horseman from passing peasant however fired hurried volley then fled in direction lord peterborough learned lesson here never forgot namely that spanish irregular useful a might be in harassing enemy pursuing beaten foe be utterly untrustworthy in plan of combined action succor therefore reached montjuich in safety two hundred of men dismounted entered fort remainder leading horse returned to barcelona marquis de risbourg have sooner entered fort taken command than adopted stratagem nearly proved fatal to english hope of success ordered men to shout long live charles third threw open gate of fort a if to surrender prince of hesse darmstadt who commanded at point be completely deceived ordered colonel allen to advance with two hundred fifty men while followed with company in reserve believing that spanish garrison have declared for king charles british advanced eagerly in disorder into ditch when terrible fire of musketry be suddenly opened upon from front flank in vain tried to defend brave prince be struck down by mortal wound while endeavoring to encourage be carried to rear allen two hundred men be taken prisoner prince expired few minute later before there be time for doctor to

follow will bear infamy of having deserted post forsaken general appeal be not in vain ashamed of late panic fugitive halted faced about pressed after up hill on reaching top found that strangely enough garrison have not discovered that bastion have be abandoned for in retreat english be hidden from sight of in inner work marquis de risbourg instead of following up advantage have at once left montjuich at side near city taking colonel allen prisoner with pushed on toward barcelona halfway down met reinforcement of three thousand men prisoner on being questioned informed spanish commander that lord peterborough prince of hesse led attack in person thereupon officer commanding reinforcement concluded that whole of allied army be round castle that must be risking destruction if pushed on

schratenbach strongly opposed bold counsel urging that troop required repose after labor number be hardly sufficient to guard province have won such argument drove peterborough almost to madness troop have in fact gone through hard work during siege of barcelona two month half have elapsed since city surrendered moreover far from being reinvigorated from rest be suffering from illness caused by inactivity in unhealthy country already benefit derivable from gallant capture of barcelona have be lost enemy have recovered from surprise dismay excited by event friendly wavering who must at once have risen have king boldly advanced after striking success have already lost heart become dispirited by want of energy displayed in after proceeding from part of spain mass of troop be moving to

troop to assist in enterprise peterborough difficulty be increased by general conyngham who commanded brigade at fraga hastily falling back upon lerida upon hearing exaggerated rumor of strength of enemy peterborough however did not hesitate moment mounting horse accompanied only by aide de camp jack stilwell lieutenant graham rode for tortosa changing horse at various town through passed riding almost night day reached tortosa on th at once summoned magnate of town to give information a to real state of thing then found to astonishment that detail king have sent respecting force of enemy be entirely incorrect charles have written that be two thousand strong sixteen thousand peasant be in arm against whereas la torres have with seven thousand good troop not single peasant have taken up arm general killigrew who now commanded two hundred dragoon thousand british infantry at tortosa together with officer considered that under such circumstance be absolutely hopeless to attempt movement for relief of san matteo peterborough did not hesitate moment only said to officer unless can raise siege affair be desperate therefore capable only of desperate remedy be content let try fortune whether can not by diligence surprise effect that by downright force be apparently impracticable officer have unbounded confidence in general although enterprise appeared absolutely hopeless at once agreed to undertake accordingly three weak english regiment marched from tortosa under killigrew next day earl followed with dragoon party of miquelets overtook infantry night next morning broke up little army into small detachment in order that might march more rapidly dividing miquelets among a guide ordered to assemble at fraiguesa two league from san matteo advance be admirably managed small party of dragoon miquelets went on ahead along of road to occupy pass among hill when arrived at point have strict order to let one pas until troop appeared in sight when advance again pushed forward secured position for same purpose thus indication of coming preceded troop arriving together with admirable punctuality before fraiguesa place be taken by surprise guard be at once mounted on gate with order to prevent one from leaving town on excuse thus while english force be within two league of san matteo la torres remained in absolute ignorance that hostile force be advancing against graham jack be nearly worn out by exertion have undergone with indefatigable general have ridden for three day night almost without sleep on arrival at tortosa be engaged unceasingly in carrying out chief instruction in making preparation for advance in obtaining possible information a to country to be traversed young officer have now begun to speak spanish residence of four month in country constant communication with native two month half steady work with instructor have enabled to make great progress be now able to communicate without difficulty with spaniard with whom came in contact chapter ix advance into valencia earl of peterborough have not satisfied with depriving enemy of information a to advance took step to confuse alarm by false news by mean of large bribe prevailed upon two peasant to carry copy of same letter to colonel jones who commanded in san matteo took further step of insuring loyalty by arresting family a hostage moreover took care that must know nothing a to real state of thing that must report if treacherously inclined arranged that one of must go in first passing through besieger line must arouse suspicion must then when arrested give up letter concealed upon must also betray route by companion be endeavoring to reach city so that second messenger must also be captured letter be taken letter be a follows to colonel jones will hardly believe what letter informs of if come safe to though have taken best precaution will do little prejudice if fall into enemy hand since will see feel troop almost a soon a can receive intelligence must be betrayed to end for venture to be that may prepare to open furthest gate toward valencia have four thousand miquelets ready who will have employment love be fit for pursuing pillaging flying enemy country be a one can wish for entire destruction be sure upon first appearance of troop first discharge of artillery answer with english halloo take to mountain on height with men conde de la torres must take plain hill on left being almost impassable secured by five six thousand of country people what will gall most will be whole regiment of nebot revolted to near valencia be likewise among be eight day ago in barcelona believe conde de la torres must have so good intelligence from thence that can not be ignorant of belongs to own troop own resolution can easily keep from though nothing else know force have multitude be gathering from part against so be forced to put whole into action must be decided to give hope to desperate game by nine ten within hour after can receive will discover on top of hill not two cannon shot from camp advantage of sea be inconceivable have contributed to bring about what must never expect to see force almost equal to enemy in number know that le must do business besides never men be so transported a to be brought in such secrecy so near enemy have near six thousand men locked up night within wall of traguera expect will believe till see know have thousand foot two hundred dragoon in tortosa will thousand foot english dutch came down ebro in boat embarked thousand more at tarragona when landed at vinaroz artillery from thence brought in country cart be easy to assemble horse zinzendorf moras be a good a own with english dragoon make up in near two thousand whole depends upon leaving retreat without interruption dear jones prove good dragoon be diligent alert preach welcome doctrine to miquelets plunder without danger friend peterborough two letter fell into hand of la torres so artfully have capture be contrived that never occurred to to doubt truth of mendacious document order be instantly given to prepare for march almost at same time two event occurred in siege work caused confusion of troop several mine have be unskillfully sunk charged one of prematurely exploded destroyed forty of workman remaining mine colonel jones contrived to swamp by turning course of brook into thus rendering harmless while troop be confused with disaster news of content of intercepted letter spread through camp causing general panic almost immediately afterward advance guard of peterborough force be seen according to promise contained in letter on crest of hill by able management twelve hundred men be made to appear vastly more numerous than be dragoon showed in various party at different point of hilltop after pausing a if to reconnoiter camp galloped back a if to carry information to main body behind while infantry availed of wooded uneven ground to conceal weakness seemed indeed to enemy that top of hill avenue of approach be covered by advancing column la torres unsuspicious of stratagem be now convinced that position be one of extreme danger while confusion reigned in camp tent be hastily struck gun spiked in few minute spanish army started along valencia road in retreat might almost be called flight colonel jones seeing confusion reigned instantly sallied from town with whole force in pursuit followed la torres for nearly two league to penasol inflicting loss of nearly three hundred men upon spaniard while peterborough on other side marched force through abandoned intrenchment into town scarcely halting however made show of pursuit a far a albocazer always keeping to hill with such caution that in case enemy must learn weakness retreat must still be secured while on march courier overtook with two dispatch one from king charles other from english resident with court at king told that must be obliged to countermand reinforcement have promised for relief of san matteo in consequence of unfavorable state of affair elsewhere however conveyed to peterborough something valued more than reinforcement namely full power to act in accordance with own discretion dispatch from british resident told that news have come that duke of berwick with main army of france freed by retreat of lord galway from trouble on western side of spain be in full march for catalonia prince of serclaes with four thousand men watched small garrison at duke of noailles with eight thousand french troop from roussillon threatened catalonia on third side while philip marshal tesse have collected ten thousand men at letter concluded with word there be nothing here distrust discontent despair responsibility left by king letter upon peterborough be great indeed on one hand if did not return to defense of catalonia king might be exposed to imminent danger on other if repassed ebro might be accused of having left valencia loyal inhabitant to fate must have forfeited advantage that audacity skill have already gained difficulty in case be enormous infantry be marching almost barefooted be clothed in rag season be inclement country mountainous rough horse of dragoon so exhausted that must scarcely carry rider in obedience to instruction here a at tortosa assembled officer in council of war asked opinion be unanimous in saying that with small exhausted force under order further operation must be undertaken for conquest of valencia that little army must post in position a might afford greatest facility for protecting king peterborough have thus on one side not only difficulty of position opinion of council of war against further advance on other hand knew anxiety of king help must be given to valencians therefore announced to officer resolution a desperate a ever formed by sane man have listened gravely in silence while officer gave opinion then ordered that footsore infantry with few of horse must march back to vinaroz little town on seaside day journey from tortosa where in case of necessity might embark in boat be taken off to ship then to stupefaction of officer announced intention of proceeding with remaining dragoon about hundred fifty in number to conquer province of valencia in vain officer remonstrated earl be firm council then broke up troop prepared for march in opposite direction parting of peterborough officer be very sad for doubted not be final one will yet endeavor said however circumstance seem desperate to secure kingdom of valencia since king have thought conquest possible in present case can not complain of motion however rash might appear be resolved therefore never to repass ebro without positive order from before starting earl wrote to charles explained fully intention be evident from tone of letter that peterborough did not expect to survive extraordinary expedition language be grave firm though respectful full of stronger remonstrance more homely advice than often reach king concluded have have little share in council if advance have be approved if majesty have trusted if majesty have permitted to march into kingdom of valencia when so earnestly desired without making stay under pretense of march of imaginary troop if majesty must have believed on occasion majesty must have have time not only viceroy of valencia kingdom with what force have be going to march straight to valencia can take other measure leaving rest to providence time lost so much against inclination expose to sacrifice at least will perish with honor a man deserving better fate earl now again sent order to one thousand spanish foot three hundred horse have before be nominally placed at disposal have never moved from town in be garrisoned to follow into valencia at same time wrote to colonel will to march immediately with like number of english horse foot to assistance king on receipt of peterborough letter issued positive peremptory order that spanish troop be at once to be set in motion colonel will wrote in reply that important action have taken place at san esteban de litera on th th of january between general conyngham with brigade chevalier d'asfeldt in after bloody contest french be driven from field with heavy loss of killed wounded prisoner ally have also suffered serious loss general conyngham have received mortal wound command therefore have devolved upon having seen infantry march off peterborough attended only by two aide de camp took place at head of handful of cavalry proceeded on desperate enterprise enterprise most extraordinary have ever taken place between enemy of equal degree of civilization be war of general with small escort literally without army against able officer with thousand of disciplined troop numerous defensible town position against enormous difficulty of country against want fatigue in shape above against hope yet one who have witnessed that little body march off must have supposed that be entering upon what seemed impossible expedition expedition from none must come back alive worn out sorry a be appearance of horse ragged dirty that of rider latter be in high spirit contagion of extraordinary energy audacity of chief have spread among have absolute confidence in genius entered upon romantic enterprise with ardor of schoolboy not le be spirit of two young aide de camp before starting earl have offered option of marching away with infantry be not that doubt courage lad for marked under fire at montjuich fatigue will be terrible have already supported in manner have surprised work have undergone have already borne far more than full share of hardship of campaign have in dispatch expressed very strong opinion to government a to value of service have rendered be very young must be sorry to see life sacrificed in such enterprise a be undertaking will think le of if elect now to have period of rest young men have however so firmly emphatically declined to leave that earl have accepted continued service cavalry instead of keeping in compact body be broken up into party of ten of whom followed different road spreading through hamlet passed news that great army of be forerunner be following hotly behind so must peasant favorable to philip cause carry news to la torres that general must be forced to believe that be being pursued by veritable army many straggler of retreating force be picked up handed over to peasantry to be sent a prisoner into catalonia for most part little party of cavalry be well received by populace majority of valencians be in favor of king charles night when halted weary horse obtained ample supply of grain forage trooper be made welcome to best village afforded few extra horse be purchased by peterborough during day be well for aide de camp that be so for scarcely have finished meal than peterborough ordered

opened from wall wholly disregarding earl at head of men dashed up to gate demanded in imperious tone that principal inhabitant must assemble hold parley with boldness of earl manner imperative tone in spoke so astonished citizen on wall that ceased firing sent for magistrate priest when assembled on wall peterborough told in angry tone that gave only six minute for deliberation that if offered slightest resistance must repeat at nules massacre la torres have carried out at villa real added that unless instantly surrendered must blow down wall moment artillery engineer arrived terror stricken magistrate at once summoned town council upon repeating peterborough terrible threat be resolved at once to surrender six minute have scarcely elapsed when gate fell back on hinge peterborough dragoon entered town in triumph here wearied band enjoyed rest for day peterborough spreading alarm presence excited by giving order great quantity of provision forage must be brought in

capable of realizing advantage of mountainous country if spaniard must do a much must tax power of greatest military nation to subdue yet must hardly have suffered check without endeavoring to avenge so altogether mr stilwell must congratulate ourselves that affair ended a did in case must have be in way to blame for disposition throughout appear to have be excellent marked alike with prudence boldness chapter xi valencia while occupied in preparing for advance general sent letter after letter to valencia bidding citizen to keep up courage promising to hasten to relief of city ordering jack to continue correspondence in name so a to delude friend foe that be still at castillon took post secretly hurried away back to tortosa to see after reinforcement still doubted whether spanish troop king have promised must be at disposal for campaign in valencia have got into motion in case have not done so determined to post to colonel will bring up officer with brigade at vinaroz found that spanish troop have already entered valencia that of militia of province of catalonia be also in motion to join therefore concentrated little force at castillon to place returned a rapidly a have left when be assembled consisted of thousand horse two thousand infantry being one english three spanish battalion of regular besides be about three hundred armed peasant whom earl thought better not to join with army therefore quartered at almenara although have accomplished marvel there be yet much to do duke of arcos have succeeded conde de la torres in chief command latter having be superseded after signal failure duke have ten thousand men placed under order of whom thirty five hundred be in possession of strong town of murviedro covered approach to valencia while with main body marched upon valencia commenced siege of city magistrate knowing that must expect little mercy must town be taken made vigorous preparation for defense dispatched messenger to peterborough imploring to come to assistance be now in readiness to do so on st of february marched from castillon with army having unlimited power earl before starting presented to two aide de camp commission a captain a reward for service have rendered although so inferior in number little army advanced toward valencia with absolute confidence of victory success gained by leader with handful of cavalry over army of seven thousand men have be so astounding that troop believed capable of effecting anything that undertook have seen ride off from san matteo with little body of horse upon what seemed impossible enterprise have met again after having conquered province if have accomplished with such scanty mean what be not possible now when have three thousand men at disposal earl trusted fully a much to talent in way of deceiving enemy a to power of defeating by open force in field eccentric genius appeared to revel in mendacious statement by deceived puzzled friend foe although spreading of certain amount of false news for purpose of deceiving enemy have always be considered a legitimate mean of warfare peterborough altogether exceeded usual limit appeared to delight in inventing most complicated falsehood from mere love of mischief at time jack be completely bewildered by general so rapid be change of plan so changeable purpose so fantastic eccentric bearing utterance that military genius be astonishing one can for moment question be genius rather of knight errant than of commander of great army a partisan leader peterborough be without rival in history whether must have succeeded equally well a commander of great army have never opportunity of proving be more than doubtful rapid change of plan shifting uncertain movement may lead to wonderful success when small body of troop have to be set in motion must cause endless confusion embarrassment with large army can only move in accordance with settled plan deliberate purpose must be said however that most eccentric of general proved upon many occasion a at siege of barcelona that be capable of adapting to circumstance be possible that have ever be placed in command of great army must have laid aside flightiness eccentricity love for theatrical stroke hair breadth adventure must have exhibited steadfast military genius must have placed name in annals of british history on par with of wellington marlborough never did exhibit faculty for ingenious falsehood more remarkably than at murviedro where indeed great proportion of invention appear to have be prompted rather by spirit of malice than by military necessity murviedro be saguntum of roman one of strongest city in spain force there be commanded by brigadier general mahony officer of irish descent have under five hundred regular cavalry battalion of eight hundred trained infantry rest of force consisted of spanish militia town be fairly strong contained large population be separated from wide plain by river on bank of redoubt mounted with artillery have be thrown up here valencian road wound through pas above on crest of lofty overhanging hill be ruin of ancient saguntum peterborough have artillery save few spanish field gun enemy position be formidable by formation art force be altogether inadequate for attack upon so hopeless did attempt appear to be that peterborough officer be unanimous in opinion that must be better to make wide circuit avoid place to march directly upon valencia give battle to duke of arcos under wall peterborough however simply told to wait see what must come of in mean time continued to bewilder foe by most surprising romance agent be for most part few sharp witted dragoon peasant whose fidelity be secured by family being held a hostage have already contrived to bewilder division of la torres before reached main body under duke of arcos spy in pay have informed spanish general that british be close upon have accordingly at once broken up camp marched night in morning spy again presented stated that british be pushing on over mountain to left to occupy important point to cut off retreat to valencian plain a seemed absolutely impossible that must have pressed forward so quickly la torres refused to credit story spy a if indignant at truth being doubted pledged at hazard of life to give proof of assertion to officer who might be sent to ascertain two officer in plain clothes be accordingly sent with in direction where stated english to be when stopped for refreshment at village on way be suddenly pounced upon by picket of english dragoon who have be sent there for purpose after time spy pretended to two officer that have made guard drunk that must now make escape leading stealthily to stable showed two of dragoon lying in apparently drunken sleep three horse be quietly led out of stable three men rode off of dragoon making show of pursuit incident of course established credit of spy la torres be convinced that retreat be really threatened hurried on again with speed while time english army be really many mile away near murviedro other dragoon be induced to feign desertion while permitted to be taken prisoner a vied with others in extravagance of false information spanish general be utterly bewildered by contradictory nature of lie reached while la torres be hastening away at full speed to join duke of arcos peterborough be occupied in fooling mahony that officer be distant relation of lady peterborough earl sent to demand interview with naming small hill near town for purpose when time for interview approached earl disposed army so a to magnify number a much a possible be posted a near town a must venture along pas others be kept marching on lower slope of hill number increased in appearance by mass of armed peasantry being mingled with mahony having received earl word for safety rode out to appointed place to meet accompanied by several of principal spanish officer peterborough first used persuasion to induce mahony to enter service of king charles irish officer refused to entertain tempting offer made peterborough then changed tone said with air of kindly frankness spaniard have used such severity cruelty at villa real a to oblige to retaliate be willing to spare town if under protection know that can not pretend to defend with horse have will be so much more useful in place if joined with troop of arcos to obstruct passing plain of valencia be confident that will soon quit murviedro can a little prevent a can hinder from taking town inhabitant there must be exposed to most abject misery can in way preserve by being bound in capitulation be willing to give if have assurance of immediate surrender of place very night case be so apparent that need not dissemble know will immediately send to duke of arcos to march to carthusian convent meet there with body of horse under command earl further offered in same apparent spirit of frankness to show mahony troop artillery a well a large resource have upon sea be only six mile off mahony be entirely deceived by manner of man regarded a relative laughingly acknowledged that have in case of necessity intended to fall back with cavalry upon duke of arcos interview ended by mahony retiring to town agreeing to send back answer in hour at end of time sent out capitulation by spanish officer have peterborough scheme ended here must not have exceeded bound of what be regarded a fair method of deceiving enemy subsequent proceeding be absolutely indefensible be indeed almost incredible on part of man who in respect carried point of honor almost to extreme notion doubt be to paralyze action of enemy by exciting suspicion of treachery among leader mean took to do so be base unworthy in extreme began with spanish officer who have brought capitulation giving garbled account of interview with mahony then endeavoring to bribe to desert to austrian cause insinuating that have succeeded by mean with mahony a earl expected failed to induce spaniard to desert succeeded in purpose of filling mind with suspicion of treachery on part of mahony mahony have conducted negotiation in manner worthy of loyal skillful officer have stipulated not to leave town till one o'clock in morning that peterborough must not pas river until hour have arranged in order to allow duke of arcos time to reach plain where be to be joined by horse from murviedro peterborough machination have be effectual spanish officer on return informed countryman that mahony have betrayed troop populace became enraged against unfortunate irishman threatened life peterborough who in spite of perverted notion of honor must not on account have passed river before time stipulated neighing of horse in town supposed that of troop be leaving in order therefore to create suspicion confusion among enemy ordered body of men near river to fire straggling shot a if small party be engaged at outpost mahony hearing sound sent word that collision might have occurred be result of breach of term of capitulation on part that depending implicitly on honor of english general must not believe that foul play must take place peterborough sent back compliment by officer who brought message with expression of gratification at good understanding prevailed between at same time proposed that mahony for security of inhabitant of murviedro to prevent troop being molested a retired from town must permit regiment of english dragoon to cross river to form guard at gate offering at same time to deliver up number of officer a hostage to spanish for loyal fulfillment of term in evil hour for mahony consented to proposal when spaniard saw peterborough dragoon advancing without opposition through difficult pas up to very gate of town suspicion of treachery of leader became certainty spanish officer got company troop together a quickly a possible hurried across plain to camp of duke where spread vague general panic officer accused mahony of treachery to spanish general national jealousy of foreigner made tale easily believed peterborough have taken step to secure success of diabolical plan against honor of wife relative made choice of two irish dragoon persuaded by bribe promise of promotion to undertake dangerous part of false deserter to tell tale with furnished accordingly set out rode straight to camp of duke of arcos gave up to outpost by whom be led before spanish general questioned by repeated story have be taught statement be that have be sitting drinking wine together under rock on hillside close to where conference be held that peterborough mahony walking apart from others came near to where be sitting did not notice that saw earl deliver five thousand pistoles to mahony heard promise to make major general in english army to give command of ten thousand irish catholic be being raised for service of king charles said that be content to receive reward to be shot a spy if mahony did not give proof of treachery by carrying out arrangement with earl by sending messenger requesting duke to march night across plain toward murviedro to carthusian convent where everything must be arranged for destruction by strong ambush of british troop scarcely have men finished story when aide de camp galloped in from mahony with very proposition have reported that must make arcos have now no doubt whatever of mahony treason instead of complying with request be obviously best course to have be pursued a junction of two army must thereby have be completed duke broke up camp without delay fell back in exactly opposite direction be exactly what peterborough have be scheming to bring about mahony with cavalry having delivered over town marched to carthusian convent there finding unsupported rode on to spot where duke have be encamped finding that army be gone followed on overtaking mahony be instantly arrested sent prisoner to madrid be satisfactory to know that succeeded in clearing from charge of treachery be promoted to rank of major general be sent back with la torres who be ordered to supersede duke of arcos success of earl stratagem have be complete without loss of single man have obtained possession of murviedro have spread such confusion doubt into enemy army that although more than three time own force be marching away in haste having abandoned siege of valencia city must now enter with troop success be wonderful one be sad to think that be gained by such treacherous dastardly maneuver might have cost gallant officer who be moreover countryman distant connection of earl honor life next day earl entered city of valencia in triumph whole population crowded into street house be decorated with flag hanging church bell pealed out welcome amid shout of people below waving of handkerchief from lady at balcony rode through

holiest city in spain other town must boast of connection of so many saint possession of so many relic priesthood be numerous influential religious procession be constantly passing through street in church service be conducted with greatest pomp magnificence peterborough knowing value of alliance assistance of priest spared pain to stand well with church revenging for outward deference paid to by bitterest sarcasm jeer in letter to friend at home believing nothing gross superstition saw prevailing round be argument in favor of own disbelief in holy thing did not fail to turn to advantage with lady romantic adventure extraordinary bravery energy endurance brilliant wit polished manner courtesy devotion rendered almost mythical hero fair valencians be to woman devoted admirer adherent while apparently absorbed in pleasure peterborough energy never slumbered for moment position be still one of extreme danger force of la torres seven thousand strong recovering from panic have day two after entered town returned taken post on hill near preparatory to recommencing siege four thousand castilian be marching to support by road leading through fuente de la higuera while at madrid within easy distance lay overwhelming force of main army under marshal tesse to cope with force have little army in town amounting to three thousand men deficient in artillery ammunition store of kind have

sent by la torres to act a convoy for gun store who be sleeping on pavement scattered among house in readiness for start at daybreak resistance soon ceased before entering place peterborough have placed cordon of dragoon in semicircle round to prevent one passing out time be lost cart be already loaded troop of cavalry horse stood picketed by gun be soon harnessed up few other horse in place be seized to prevent one riding off with news order be given to peasant to start cart in ten minute after entering place convoy be on way with long row of cart laden with ammunition sixteen gun cordon of dragoon be still left round town officer in command being ordered to allow one to pas for hour half after time be to gallop on with men to overtake convoy a by time must be no longer possible for one to carry news to la torres in time for to put troop into motion to cut off convoy from valencia journey back took much longer than advance for cart drawn for most part by bullock made slow progress three hour after convoy started dragoon left behind overtook when within three mile of town be met by small party of enemy spanish militia be at once scattered by charge of dragoon convoy proceeded without further molestation until just at noon entered gate of valencia where astonishment delight of inhabitant at appearance be unbounded in few hour cannon be mounted in position on rampart adding very much to defensive power of town be now safe for time from attempt at siege by la torres whose plan must be entirely frustrated by capture of artillery intended for siege peterborough be not yet contented junction of four thousand castilian of whose approach have heard with la torres must raise force under general to point must enable to blockade town pending arrival

spanish camp peterborough rode at head having by side spanish gentleman acquainted with foot of country forded river without being observed then making a wide circuit a possible round camp came down upon road without alarm being given then pushed forward after three hour march came upon castilian at fuente de la surprise be complete spaniard knowing that spanish army lay between town have taken precaution british be in possession of place before be aware of danger there be attempt at resistance beyond few hasty shot castilian be sleeping wrapped up in cloak around place on alarm leaped up fled wildly in direction in darkness great number got away six hundred be taken prisoner hour be spent in collecting breaking arm left behind by fugitive force with prisoner in midst then started back on return march circuit of spanish camp be made ford passed a successfully a before just a daylight be breaking little army marched into valencia news rapidly spread inhabitant hurried into street unable at first to credit news that castilian army whose approach menaced safety of town be destroyed movement of troop on previous night to rampart absence of greater part of officer from festivity have occasioned comment a none knew that expedition have set out be supposed that earl have received news from spy that la torres intended to attempt sudden night attack people must have doubted astonishing news now received have not be for presence of six hundred castilian prisoner two serious misadventure caused la torres to despair of success against town defended by so energetic enterprising commander a peterborough now turned thought toward small town of sueca alcira below town commanded by gun be important bridge of cullera by by far greater portion of supply for town be brought in from country la torres therefore determined to seize place be distant about fifteen mile from camp so to straiten town for provision a usual peterborough spy brought early intelligence of intended movement order issued by la torres be known to earl few hour later needed activity to be in time five hundred english six hundred spanish infantry four hundred horse be ordered to march with speed to threatened town pushing on without halt troop reached hour before spanish force appeared on spot on finding two town strongly occupied by british la torres abandoned intention drew off troop portion of spanish army be cantoned in village only two mile from alcira few day later peterborough determined to surprise for purpose marched out at night from valencia with english force of thousand men reached spot intended at daybreak a have arranged spanish garrison of alcira also about thousand strong have order to sally out attack village at same hour spaniard also arrived punctually just a be preparing to burst upon unconscious enemy who be four thousand strong happened to come upon picket of twenty horse unaccountable panic seized broke rank fled in such utter confusion that many of terror stricken soldier killed other picket aroused enemy who quickly fell into rank peterborough seeing that must be madness to attack with wearied unsupported force reluctantly ordered retreat conducted in perfect order without loss of man be peterborough only failure with exception one of plan have proved successful only failed here from trusting for once to cooperation of wholly unreliable spanish ally after nothing be done on side for several week campaign have be one of most extraordinary ever accomplished success be due in degree to chance solely to ability of peterborough wild a many of scheme appeared be always planned with greatest care calculated upon almost possible contingency prepared for never intrusted to others must do personally commanded expedition even of most petty kind extraordinary physical power of endurance enabled to support fatigue to carry out adventure must have prostrated most other men highest praise too be due to troop who proved worthy of such leader confidence in chief inspired with valor equal to own bore uncomplainingly greatest hardship fatigue engaged unquestioningly in adventure exploit against odds made success appear absolutely hopeless hundred fifty dragoon who followed earl of peterborough to conquest of valencia deserve place side by side with greatest hero of antiquity chapter xii irregular warfare from moment that news of loss of barcelona have reached madrid philip of anjou have labored strenuously to collect force sufficient to overwhelm enemy have moreover written urgently to louis xiv for assistance although france be at moment obliged to make strenuous effort to show front to marlborough ally who have already at blenheim inflicted disastrous defeat upon louis responded to appeal formidable french army be assembled at saragossa roussillon while fleet of twelve ship of line under command of count of toulouse sailed to blockade barcelona duke of berwick one of ablest general of day be sent to head southern army in january french army of catalonia under marshal tesse reached saragossa where arrogance brutality of marshal soon excited storm of hatred among aragonese town resisted desperately entry of french troop assassination of officer men be matter of daily occurrence savage reprisal adopted by marshal instead of subduing excited spaniard to still fiercer resistance savage cruel a be marshal be in haste to meet enemy in field philip who be with have greatest difficulty in getting to move forward be in last week of february that news reached earl of peterborough that marshal tesse have left saragossa be marching toward lerida be two day after unsuccessful attempt to surprise enemy camp near alcira menaced a valencia be by force greatly superior to own must not leave city in absence must speedily have succumbed to attack of la torres walked quickly up down room for minute then said captain stilwell can not leave here will send to marquis of cifuentes have shown greatest activity energy with doubt that will do equally well when acting independently will give letter to marquis saying that be one of most trusted valued officer begging to avail to fullest of energy skill will tell at present be tied here that when enemy reach barcelona will at hazard march hence take post in rear do what can to prevent carrying on siege in mean time beg to throw obstacle in way of advance to hold pas to last to hang on rear attack baggage train cut off straggler can not hope to defeat tesse may wear out dispirit men by constant attack speak spanish fluently enough now will be able to advise suggest remember day that tesse be delayed give so much time to king to put barcelona in state of defense with little force can not do much even when come sole hope of barcelona be to hold out until fleet arrives from england if king must take advice will guarantee that will be crowned in madrid in two month pig headed german who surround set against proposition make have better start tonight a soon a get dark take mounted guide with who know country thoroughly will be change for from pleasure of valencia to guerrilla warfare in mountain in inclement season stilwell graham said a left general think must care about mission own have enjoyed in valencia have lost heart dozen time since arrived have not lost mine at jack said laughing be sick of ball festivity be not brought up to know rough a work may be will prefer to long stay here yes graham agreed must not care for long stay may be quite certain earl will not remain inactive here many week be waiting to see how thing go moment game be fairly opened may be sure will be on move yes suppose will be very long after jack said still be not sorry to go at seven o'clock in evening jack set out taking with two dragoon a orderly earl having suggested that must do so always do thing if be possible captain stilwell there be time when must be doing something else be a well to have one that can rely upon besides orderly will give additional importance in eye of peasant most of men have picked up spanish have better pick out two of orderly who be best up in jack have spent afternoon in making round of call at house where have be entertained after exchange of adieu ceremonial speech compliment be heartily glad when gate closed behind set out on journey a road did not pas anywhere near spanish camp there be little fear of interruption in way guide led by little frequented track across hill by morning be far on road be frequently obliged to make detour to avoid town village favorable to king philip why one town village must take one side next other be inexplicable to jack be so throughout country singular anomaly existed must be accounted for by variety of cause popular mayor powerful landed proprietor whose sympathy be strong with one side other must probably be followed by townspeople peasant influence of priest too be great also be divided however be fact remained that a with villa real nules neighboring town be frequently enthusiastically in favor of opposite party a jack have seen dispatch letter poured in to earl knew what be circumstance prevailed in town village knew to

for own sake cook cellar offer strong inducement to remain at home be so son priest said with laugh be a may see easygoing man well contented with lot envy not bishop of toledo know be said that even worm will turn so have seen peaceful priest enacting part of bloodthirsty captain son face grew grave now can little imagine deed ferocious tesse have enacted here in arragon when warring with english french behave like civilized nation when warring with spanish peasant who have mean of making wrong known to world behave worse than horde of brutal savage will tell circumstance have driven to place at head of parishioner to wage war of extermination with french to deny mercy to one of accursed nation who may fall into hand have brother rather must say have one well to do farmer who lived at village six mile from saragossa have only daughter who be to be married to son of neighboring proprietor handsome high spirited lad be devoted to nina be to have be married three month ago wrote to to go over to perform ceremony went wedding day arrived be ready be holiday in village for be favorite bride be dressed village maiden men be in best procession be about to set out when troop of dragoon

bey troop have be fired at ' frenchman said 'and hold responsible ' be one from village brother said 'we have wedding here not soul be absent ' ' care not ' officer said 'we have be fired at will give

saragossa after reading funeral service over saw tesse told of scene have witnessed demanded vengeance laughed in face senor persisted got angry told that be not for cloth must hang from steeple called down heaven curse upon left came home do wonder senor found hard to spare frenchman for whom pleaded do wonder that man of peace lead out villager to slaughter enemy indeed jack exclaimed warmly such act a must stir blood of coldest into fire priest priest man must be le than man who did not try to take vengeance for so foul deed have many massacre of sort be perpetrated many priest replied in case have redress be obtained by relative of victim throughout arragon doe same hatred of french prevail everywhere priest said then king charles must meet with enthusiastic welcome here say that priest answered must be well received doubtless simply because be enemy of french for arragonese can not for life of see why must be ruled over by foreigner in respect german king be even le to be desired than french one connection between two latin nation be naturally closer than between german french king must more readily adapt to way than must stiff thick headed german apart from recent doings of french army arragon must have preferred philip to charles moreover charles be looked upon a choice of catalan valencians why must men of arragon take king others have chosen king charles will doubtless be received well because appears a enemy of french will not find that people of arragon will make great sacrifice in behalf let french army enter province again man will rise in arm against there will be little disposition to raise troop to follow king charles beyond limit of province castile be strong for philip jealousy there of catalan be even greater than here fact that arragon will go with catalonia valencia will only render castilian more earnest in cause of philip there have be several skirmish already between band of miquelets of castile whole country along border be greatly disturbed be pity that spaniard can not agree among a to who will be king ah son will be very long yet before spaniard agree upon point be mistake to think of a one nation be dozen nation under one king if be asked nationality reply englishman if ask spaniard will reply be castilian catalan arragonese biscayan never be spaniard hate other a scotchman englishman hated other hundred year back even now regard yourselves a different people what connection be there between hardy mountaineer of northern province easygoing peasant of valencia andalusia nothing consequently if one part of spain declares for one man a king may be sure that other will declare against a long a have great men spaniard for king descent went in regular way from father to son thing went smoothly because pretender must have shadow of claim a between two foreign prince man have right to choose for be there spaniard with shadow of claim party must rally round unfortunately be not so foresee epoch of war trouble before matter be settled for tell must not give that flask of wine be able to put crown upon head of one other of foreigner let get crown govern well strongly tax villager lightly interfere in way with privilege will be well content such will find be opinion of most men in spain now tell if there be aught can do for say must be on way by daybreak tell in direction journey will be hard if can not find friend there with whom introduction will insure hearty welcome if can tell where be largest gathering of miquelets can tell way will ride jack replied mission be to ascertain what aid king can rely upon in province three day ago there be many thousand of men under arm priest replied by tonight there will be le than a many hundred day tesse crossed frontier with army greater portion of band went to home arm will be laid aside until news come that french army be on return from barcelona fancy there be little chance of seeing king charles among in day two tesse will be before barcelona joined a will be there by french army marching down from roussillon will make quick work of town king charles will have choice of going to valencia to be hunted shortly thence of sailing away again from country in ship must seem like jack agreed be reckoning without earl of peterborough english general must be wonder priest said marvel can not accomplish impossibility what can do with two three thousand trained troop against twenty thousand veteran french soldier can not tell what will do jack laughed may rely upon that will do something must take fair odds that will somehow other save barcelona rid catalonia of invader that judge to be altogether impossible priest replied anything that man must do be ready to admit that general be capable of judge to be within range of possibility if will take advice son will not linger here will ride for valencia embark on board ship with when time come will see jack said laughing have faith in improbable may not be so very long before drop in again to drink flask of wine on way through arragon with king charles on march toward madrid if do son will produce bottle of wine to be ditch water have three four stored away in cellar preserve for great occasion be remains of cellar of predecessor a good judge of wine a ever lived be forty year since laid by be said best vintage have ever come across have good old man died ten year earlier what heritage must have be mine in later year be not so saving a behooves good man to be indulged in on minor occasion consequently two dozen remained when succeeded to charge twenty year ago too be not sufficiently chary of to begin with six bottle be drunk in first ten year since then have be a stingy a miser two bottle have be opened hope father that have laid in similar supply for whomsoever may come after surely have son fifteen year ago have hogshead of finest vintage in neighborhood bricked up in cellar have inscription placed on wall by must be taken suddenly successor may know of store that awaits at present must not find inscription did search for for when trouble began filled up letter in stone with mortar gave wall two three coat of whitewash did not choose to run risk of grand wine going down throat of thirsty french soldier must be act of sacrilege when matter be settled be at peace again will pick out mortar from letter not till then have often reflected since how short sighted be not to have stowed away hogshead for own consumption must have be something to have looked forward to in declining year ah father who know what may happen before wall may fall down then naturally must wish to see whether wine be in a good condition a must be besides will say to why when successor left miserable two dozen of grand wine of must bequeath whole hogshead to who may come after who moreover may be so bad judge of wine that will value treasure more than equal quantity of rough country vintage avaunt tempter priest said laughing added more seriously have frightened never thought of have always pictured successor a man who must appreciate good wine a do truly must be terrible misfortune did not do so veritable throwing of pearl before swine now that have presented dreadful idea will be ever in mind will no longer think of hogshead with unmixed satisfaction idea be terrible one truly jack said gravely to prevent must

that although general may undertake desperate thing never attempt anything have not at least possibility of success in fact a know have never yet failed in enterprise that have undertaken be true
