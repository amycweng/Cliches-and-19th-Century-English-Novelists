three horse one in centre be trained to trot while two outside went at canter head of latter be bent half round so that looked towards side even almost behind a went english acquaintance to whom godfrey expressed surprise first time saw one of sledge replied yes be old russian pattern curiously enough if look at greek ba relief sculpture of chariot of phoebus at other representation of chariot with three four horse will see that animal outside turn head in similar manner must be horribly uncomfortable for horse to have head turned round like be effect of training be always tied up to stable with head pulled in way until becomes second nature to go with in position be very curious idea godfrey said certainly look nice what magnificent beard driver in good sledge have yes again be old russian custom driver with big beard be considered absolute necessity for well appointed turn out longer fuller beard higher wage man will command greater pride of employer seems silly godfrey

what have be seized for who be men who have got hold of why be gripping wrist so tightly have heard of arbitrary treatment in russian army that colonel must have captain seized in extraordinary way merely because be absent from post without leave be beyond anything thought possible thought be going to have laugh on side said to so far be other way in ten minute carriage stopped for moment there

then repeated request have be made do expect to believe ridiculous nonsense about captain presnovich colonel can only say sir what be telling be precisely what happened that absolutely believed seemed to natural thing that young officer might come to ball to see lady who perhaps have other opportunity of meeting alone see now be very foolish to allow to be mixed up in affair thought that be harmless joke so did a woman asked go on sir general said in tone of suppressed rage there be little more to tell sir went up with woman to box have pointed out there found captain presnovich a believed to be put on hat mask cloak walked down stair be leaving opera house when be arrested be even now wholly ignorant of having committed offence likely story general said sarcastically woman did

incriminating character at length godfrey be left alone in cell contained only single chair rough pallet have put foot in somehow said to ca make head tail of beyond fact have made as of myself be whole story lie be fellow name presnovich if not who be by rage of general who suppose be chief of police be evident be frightfully disappointed be man be looking for be presnovich somebody girl katia knew wanted to get safely away be made fool of just a be looked bright jolly sort of girl that go for nothing in russia sort of people get mixed up in plot if be concerned in getting away suppose fixed on because being english new comer here must be easy for to prove have nothing to do with plot anything of sort whereas if russian have be in place might have got into frightful mess over well suppose will come right in end be lucky that weather have got milder must have have good chance of being frozen to death be cold enough a be resuming clothes have be thrown down on pallet godfrey drew solitary rug over in spite of uncertainty of position be soon fast asleep woke just a daylight be breaking be so bitterly cold that be obliged to get up stamp about cell to restore circulation two hour later cell door be opened piece of dark coloured bread jug of water be handed in to if be prison fare care how soon be out of said to a munched bread wonder what be made of rye day passed without anyone coming near save jailer who brought bowl of thin broth ration of bread for dinner ca get rug asked man if have got to stop here for night will have good chance of being frozen to death just a be getting dark man came in again with blanket flat earthenware pan full of sand on be burning handful two of stick placed bundle of wood beside be more cheerful by long way godfrey said to a man who have maintained absolute silence on of visit left cell doubt have be making lot of inquiry about find have not be in habit of frequenting low company must not have have indulgence if have well will be amusement to keep fire up wood be a dry a bone luckily must be smoked out in time for there be not much ventilation through narrow loophole warmth of fire additional blanket made difference in couple of hour godfrey be sound asleep when woke be broad daylight although felt cold be nothing to what have experienced on previous morning at about eleven o'clock a near a must guess for watch everything have be removed when be searched door be opened prison official with two warder appeared by be conducted to same room where have be first examined neither of officer who have then be there be present elderly man sat at centre of table godfrey bullen said careful investigation have be made into antecedent with one exception that not for various reason important one have received good report of ivan petrovytch tell that work in office from breakfast time till five in afternoon that evening be at own disposal that generally dine with gave name of family with be acquainted where a understood spend evening when be not at skating club where generally go on tuesday friday at least learn that did spend evening with family have learned at club that be regular attendant there two three time week that general associate be read out list included to godfrey surprise name of one of acquaintance there therefore have be forced to come to conclusion that story incredible a appeared be true one youth foreigner must have have incredible levity to act in way describe to assume disguise of person absolutely unknown to upon persuasion of woman also absolutely unknown to well nigh pass belief have be older must at once have be sent to frontier a be czar to whom case have be specially submitted have graciously allowed to continue residence here testimony being unanimous a to father position a merchant to prudence of behaviour while resident here warn godfrey bullen that escapade of kind may be harmless in england be very serious matter here ignorantly admit none le certainly have aided in escape of malefactor of worst kind for proof have be afforded that be mere dupe consequence must have be most serious to even fact of being foreigner must not have sufficed to save from hand of justice be now free to depart let be lesson to most serious one never again to mix up in way with person of whose antecedent be ignorant in future to conduct in respect wisely prudently will certainly be lesson to sir be heartily sorry be so foolish a to allow to be mixed up in such affair think can promise that henceforth there will be fault to be found in conduct in ante room godfrey watch money other content of pocket be restored to carriage be in waiting for at outer door be driven rapidly to house of merchant be nice scrape into have got godfrey ivan petrovytch said a entered be lucky for that be not russian how on earth have got mixed up in plot know nothing about beyond fact that have be arrested for although thousand question be asked about nothing be said to a to charge brought against have be in greatest anxiety about sort of rumour be current in city a to discovery of plot to assassinate one of grand duke at opera house there be rumour that explosive bomb have be discovered in one of box be said that police have received information of attempt be to be made that precaution have be taken to arrest principal conspirator that in extraordinary manner slipped through finger surely can never have be mixed up in matter be what be godfrey said though have more idea of having anything to do with plot than have of flying see now behaved like awful fool told story to petrovytch wife a have told to head of police be shocked at thought that member of household must have be engaged even unwittingly in such treasonable affair be wonder that ever saw again merchant wife exclaimed be fortunate that be known a quiet people might have be arrested too must not have believed that anyone with sense must be silly enough to put on stranger mantle hat thought godfrey urged that at masked ball people did play sort of trick upon other be sure have read so in book did seem quite likely did now that officer must have come up to meet young lady masked whom have chance of meeting at other time certainly seemed to quite natural believe almost fellow if be asked to help anyone to get out of scrape like must do may do in england in france doe do to take part in anything that know for certain about here wonder be made inquiry at if have be russian chance be that family must never have heard of again from time left to go to opera nothing that must have said must have be believed story must have be regarded by police a mere invention must have considered a certain that in way other be mixed up in conspiracy must have regarded denial a simple obstinacy must have be sent to siberia for life must advise godfrey ivan petrovytch said to keep absolute silence about affair mention to one everyone know that something have happened to a police have be everywhere inquiring there be occasion to tell anyone particular of course rumour get about a to action of nihilist of police a little be said a possible be of course mere rumour that plot be discovered at opera house probably there be unusual number of police at entrance very little thing give rise to talk conjecture people think that police must not have be there have not have suspicion that something other be going to take place a everything in day be put down to nihilist be naturally reported that police have discovered plot a two of grand duke be there people made sure be in way connected with a nothing came of one be a far a be known arrested must be supposed that culprit whoever be managed to evade police such rumour a be of very common occurrence be quite possible that there be not much more truth in time than there be generally however of one thing may be sure police be not fonder than other people of being outwitted whether man for whom be in search be nihilist criminal of other sort certainly aided to escape be sure to be watched for time will be known to police in very few hour if repeat story to acquaintance if find keep silence about will give credit for discretion while must certainly do good deal of harm might even now lead to being promptly sent across frontier be known that made boast of having outwitted there be reason will find that for time most of friend here will be little shy of people be not fond of having a intimate person about whom police be inquiring will certainly find for time that will receive very few invitation to enter house of russian must be different however if be known that trouble be about something have connection with politics therefore must advise when be asked question to turn off with laugh say got mixed up in affair between young lady lover that like many other people found that who mingle in such matter often get left in lurch need not say much more than that might do anything here without friend troubling much about provided have nothing to do with politics rob bank perpetrate big swindle run away with court heiress a long a police lay hand on nobody else will trouble head about affair if be suspected of being mixed up in most remote way with politics best friend will shun like plague will take advice certainly godfrey said even putting aside danger point out must not be anxious to tell people suffered to be entrapped so foolishly for time indeed godfrey found that acquaintance fell away from that be not asked to house of of russian merchant where have be before made welcome cautious question must be asked by younger men a to trouble into got with police turned off with laugh be not going to tell particular said concern other people can only tell be fool enough to be humbugged by pretty little masker to get mixed up in love intrigue in young lady lover captain in army irascible colonel be concerned that young people made cat paw of be not going to say more than want to be laughed at for next six month so became understood that young englishman have simply got into silly scrape have be charged by colonel in army with running away with daughter be therefore restored to former footing at most of house that have before visited two day after release note be slipped into godfrey hand by boy a went out after dinner for walk be unsigned ran a follows dear godfrey bullen cousin be in great state of distress be deceived by third person in turn deceived have heard since that story be entire fiction to enable gentleman for whom police be in search to escape only heard last night of arrest release be in greatest grief that must have be innocent mean of trouble coming upon know how thing be here be overwhelmed with gratitude that did not in defence give particular might have enabled to trace for must have found much more difficult than stranger must have done to have proved innocence know that did say nothing for have done so must have be arrested before morning not improbably might also have found within wall of prison since met at room mere acquaintanceship with suspected person be enough to condemn one here by way have moved lodging will give new address when meet be if be good enough to continue acquaintance in spite of trouble have be caused by credulity folly of cousin godfrey who have begun to learn prudence did not open letter until returned home a soon a have read dropped into stove be pleased at receipt for have not liked to think that have be duped by girl from first have believed that like have be deceived for have seemed to out of question that young music mistress who did not seem more than twenty year old must have be mixed up in doings of desperate set of conspirator however quite understood alarm must have felt for though story might have be believed owing to being stranger unconnected in way with men who must have be concerned in nihilist plot must no doubt have be vastly more difficult for to prove innocence especially a be known that there be many woman in rank of nihilist be fortnight before met of student then ran against upon quay just at foot of equestrian statue of peter great opposite isaac cathedral hesitated for moment held out hand cordially where have be how be have not seen before be afraid that might not care to know further akim said after trouble that foolish cousin of mine

not ought not to have let be persuaded into taking part in matter entered into a joke thinking must be fine fun to see old colonel face also to help pair of lover out of scrape must have be good joke

round dish left room have anything happened godfrey asked yes there be bad news plot against life of czar have be discovered nihilist have mined under road by be yesterday evening to have travelled to railway station seems that suspicion be felt by police know how arose at rate at last moment route be changed during night house in suspected neighbourhood be searched in cellar of one of passage be found leading under road mine be heavily charged with powder be connected by wire to electric battery there can be doubt have czar passed by a intended must have be destroyed by explosion be terrible terrible did find one in cellar godfrey asked one conspirator have doubt taken alarm when heard that route be changed place be deserted seems that shop above be taken four month ago a store for sale of coal wood cellar adjoining one be hired at same time there be also room behind shop where man woman who kept lived say that arrest have be made over city morning will doubt have renewal of wholesale trial followed assassination of general mesentzeff head of police last autumn be terrible misguided men hope to conquer empire by fear instead of will in end only strengthen hand of despotism have always be inclined to liberalism have wished for gradual change only for large change be not yet fit a education spread approach western standard power voice ought to be given to intelligent enough to use be to say to educated class must not one in sens must give power of voting to illiterate ignorant men who must simply be tool in hand of designing ambitious people of great town st petersburg moskow kieff odessa others must be permitted to send representative men of own choice to provincial council must be strengthened given real instead of nominal voice in control of affair be thousand like ever wished for in present must have be first step towards constitution empire when people become fit for might enjoy dream be over men by wild violence have thrown back reform for century at least have driven czar to war against have strengthened hand of men who will use act a excuse for extremest measure of repression have ranged on other side moderate men like who though desirous of constitutional change shrink with horror from revolution heralded by deed of bloodshed murder quite agree with godfrey said warmly men must be mad who must counsel such abominable plan french revolution be terrible although began peacefully be at first supported by best spirit of france at last became hideous butchery here in russia seems to that must be infinitely worse for be only in town that there be men with education if began with murder of czar what must grow to what indeed ivan petrovytch repeated yet like french revolution pioneer of movement be earnest thoughtful men with noble dream for regeneration of russia how did begin may be said to have started about emancipation of serf produced sort of fever one looked for change be in university seminary among younger professional men that first began prohibited work of kind especially of european socialist be in spite of precaution at frontier introduced widely circulated socialistic idea made tremendous progress among class speak of by writing by circulation of prohibited paper so on carried on sort of crusade against government indeed against government carrying idea of liberty to most extreme point waging war against religion a well a against society in latter respect be more successful than in former regret to say that atheism made immense stride among educated class have profound thinker among tchernyshevsky dobroluboff mikhailoff besides herzen ogareff two men who brought out kolokol in london in russian language by agent spread broadcast over russia stifling of insurrection in poland

isvostchiks labourer englishman conversation naturally for time turned upon explosion in winter palace russian expressing indignation fully equal to of godfrey then talked of england regretting that be unable to speak language must give much to be able to read shakespeare petroff said have heard work spoken of in such high term by of friend who have studied language have heard too from of dickens tell be like reading of world world in there be official police soldier must be very near paradise have soldier godfrey laughed one doe not see much of about half of have at home be in two military camp one in england one in ireland there be guard in london population be so large that might go week without seeing one while in very few of provincial town be there garrison at there be police plenty of a business be only to prevent crime naturally play prominent part in novel giving picture of everyday life a to official beyond rate collector see anything of though there be magistrate government clerk custom officer sort of thing certainly play prominent part in life so chatted for hour when at short interval two other men came in one be tall handsome fellow who be introduced by petroff a son of baron kinkoff other be young advocate of moscow on visit to st petersburg godfrey observed have knocked in somewhat peculiar manner at door opened a have noticed when came in only by key akim observed slight expression of surprise in godfrey face at second knock said laughing remittance have not come to hand of late godfrey of creditor be getting troublesome so have established signal by know friend while inconvenient visitor can knock a long a like then go away thinking be out godfrey chatted for short time longer then got up to go akim went to door with a opened there be sudden rush of men from outside nearly knocked down of what followed have vague idea pistol shot rang out there be desperate struggle received blow on head struck to ground instant later there be tremendous explosion next thing knew be that be being hauled from below debris a looked round bewildered saw that considerable portion of ceiling of roof above have be blown out several body lay stretched on floor room be still full of smoke by light of two three lantern perceived that young baron bleeding freely from sabre wound across forehead be standing bound between two policeman with

body be of policeman three of near door appeared to have be shot others be lying in contorted position against wall a if have be flung there by force of explosion saw in state of vague wonderment while two policeman kneeling at side be passing cord tightly round one still life one of policeman said stooping over young advocate think be nearly done for never mind bring along with others man in plain clothes said in tone of authority get away at once will have half st petersburg here in few minute godfrey be lifted by policeman one at head one at foot carried down stair flung into vehicle at door dully heard roar of excited shout question sharp order of police ranged round vehicle three policeman took place inside with vehicle drove off slowly at first until be free of crowd then at sharp gallop godfrey be conscious of little a went along have vague idea of warm moist feeling down back wondered whether be own blood gradually impression became more more indistinct knew nothing more until be conscious of sensation of cold at back of head of murmur of voice round soon be lifted up into sitting position felt that bandage be being wrapped round head then be laid down again heard door slam key turn then knew nothing more when awoke daylight be streaming in through loophole high up in wall tried to sit up must not looked round trying to recall where be what have happened be in dark cell with furniture save straw on be lying be prison certainly muttered to how did get here then gradually event of night before came to mind there have be terrible fight akim have be killed there have be tremendous explosion police have something to do with be dream be real be dreaming now be time before must persuade that be real indeed be not until door opened two men entered that felt quite sure that godfrey bullen be really lying there in prison cell with dull numbing pain at back of head too weak even to sit upright one of men leaned over godfrey tried to speak must not do so above whisper will do now man said without paying attention to word must have thick skull that sword cut must have finished give wine water now soup presently must not let slip through finger liquid be poured between lip then be left alone again certainly be real said to akim must have be killed must be prisoner what in world can be about be too weak to think after visit have be paid have be lifted up given strong began to think more clearly can have be nihilist arrest thought to akim petroff can never be nihilist idea be absurd have never heard say word against government czar then thought of friend katia how have got to aid in escape of nihilist be nonsense murmured idea of girl like being mixed up in conspiracy then idea again became more more confused when doctor visited again in evening be in state of high fever talking incoherently to for seven day continued in state there be lack of care doctor visited at very short interval attendant remained night day beside applying cold bandage to head carefully noting down in book word that passed lip then good constitution gradually triumphed over fever on eighth day lay mere shadow of cool sensible on bed in airy ward nourishing food be given to in abundance be week before be able to stand alone then one morning two attendant brought stretcher to side of bed be assisted to put on clothes be then placed on stretcher carried away be taken through long passage up down stair at last into large room here be lifted on stretcher placed in chair facing at table be nine officer prisoner president said glancing at large closely written sheet of paper before be accused of taking part in nihilist conspiracy to murder czar know nothing of nihilist conspiracy godfrey said be accidentally in room with friend akim

at time continued reading from note that did not know woman who spoke to be known that be associate of akim soushiloff petroff stepanoff at whose place be captured other day there be therefore doubt that know knew under name godfrey said if have be told be sophia perovskaia conveyed nothing to for have never heard of be committing prisoner president said coldly when examined denied acquaintance with woman declared that be stranger excuse sir godfrey said said be masked woman did not see face be perfectly true admit now that did know who be naturally a gentleman endeavoured to shield in matter concerning believed that be a innocent a be murmur of incredulity ran round circle of officer few day after that president went on again reading from note be present with akim soushiloff petroff stepanoff at supper in trakir in ossuloff street there be present on occasion read list of six name four of whom have since be convicted punished two of whom although not yet taken be known to have be engaged in murderous attempt at winter palace be greeted there with significant enthusiasm be evidently testimony on part of conspirator to part have played in affair of ossinsky godfrey felt that mesh be closing round remembered that have wondered at time why have be received with such great cordiality now president went on be captured in room of akim soushiloff petroff stepanoff who be beyond doubt engaged in plot at winter palace with two other equally guilty conspirator be doubtless deliberating on fresh atrocity when interrupted by agent of police shared in desperate resistance made resulted in death of eight police officer by pistol shot by explosion of gunpowder by petroff stepanoff who fired be also blown to piece what have to say in defence still say that be perfectly innocent godfrey said knew nothing of men being conspirator in way demand to be allowed to communicate with friend to obtain assistance of advocate advocate must say nothing for president said deny of

room in company with four of men concerned in attempt to assassinate czar court be willing to be merciful if will tell know with reference to plot give name of conspirator with whom have be concerned offence will be dealt with a leniently a possible repeat know nothing can therefore disclose nothing sir venture to protest against authority of court to try condemn englishman matter what be nationality of person president said coldly who offends against law of country be amenable to law nationality affords protection whatever will have time given to think matter over before sentence be communicated to remove prisoner godfrey be laid on stretcher again carried away time be taken not to room where have be placed while ill to dark cell where scarce ray of light penetrated there be heap of straw in one corner loaf of black bread jug of water godfrey when left alone shook up straw to make a comfortable a possibly must then sat down upon with back against wall well be certainly go said to if there be one thing seemed le likely than be must get involved in nihilist business in first place governor specially warned against in second place have be extremely careful never to give opinion on public affair in third place if there be one thing detest more than be assassination can not say be cowardly in men nihilist do more than risk life give life away to carry out end still though own be not cowardly hate question be what next petrovytch will of course write home to say that be missing suppose will have slightest idea have be arrested a nihilist see how must think so be more likely to think have be made away with somehow doubt father will come out of course wo learn more than petrovytch unless choose to tell suppose will tell have heard that generally family of people seize know nothing about unless be arrested too may guess what have happened know in case must fancy police must say nothing will hear from inquiry father make that have suspicion of what have happened to will know if did tell ambassador must be making row even if governor be to learn what have become of be to insist upon learning what crime be accused of committing see that thing must be much better must hand over note of evidence on be convicted taking altogether be bound to say see how must help convicting short of catching like sort of guy fawkes blowing up palace case be about a strong a must be certainly have put foot in be acquainted with two conspirator through got acquainted with confounded woman katia though seems be name then through helped fellow ossinsky to escape then trying to shield make matter twenty time worse for while answer before led to believe that be perfect stranger to be as enough to let out just now that knew then there be that supper must not make out at time why greeted so heartily now of course be plain enough now just after blowing up business here be caught with four notorious conspirator mixed up in fight in eight ten policeman be killed roof blown off house must be circumstantial evidence enough to condemn man in england let alone russia suppose be going to hang because publish name of fellow hang imprisonment for year in one of ghastly dungeon be bad enough if be to be will be siberia hope there must be way of getting out of big country like north south east west well see use bothering over have got into horrible scrape there be doubt about must take what come godfrey be essentially of hopeful nature always looked at bright side of thing be strong believer in adage where there be will there be way have be in full

prisoner that sentence of death have be passed upon have by clemency of czar be commuted to banishment for life to siberia very well sir godfrey said know of course that be perfectly innocent of crime of be charged a czar doubt supposes that be guilty of taking part in plot against life acknowledge thank for clemency have peculiar desire to visit siberia at least will be change for better from

face exist in dungeon must kill dog in twenty four hour nothing can tempt to divulge secret even starvation doe not affect be dangerous enemy must be owned that be brave men woman boy for be little more almost laughed in face in spite of stay in damp cell seemed to be in excellent spirit be same with though own of do break down sometimes think that who commit suicide do so principally because be

prisoner be at once placed on board steamer godfrey be glad indeed to throw down upon bed where slept without waking until steamer got under way in morning be delighted to see that port hole be not a in first boat blocked by outside shutter that must look out over country a passed along for time scenery be similar to have be passing over bare desolate presently assumed different character field of green wheat stretched away from river side comfortable looking little village succeeded other rapidly a steamer passed along save for difference of architecture peculiar green dome pinnacle of little church might have be looking over scene in river be about two hundred yard wide here smooth placid stream steamer did not proceed at great pace a be towing behind one of heavy convict barge although passage be ordinarily performed in day half took nearly day longer to accomplish be not until late in afternoon of third day that tobolsk came in sight through port hole godfrey obtained good view of town containing nearly inhabitant with large government building great many house built of stone be built in very unhealthy position country round being exceedingly low marshy after passing tobolsk entered obi one of largest river in asia next morning steamer again started for sixteen hundred mile journey to tomsk journey occupied eight day convict barge having be left behind at tobolsk time passed tediously to godfrey for bank be low flat village be very rare steamer only touched at three place herd of horse be seen from time to time roaming untended over country only amusement be in watching ostjaks native of bank of obi people have town village live in rough tent made of skin saw many of fishing from tiny canoe steamer did not pas near enough to to enable to get view of a generally paddled away towards shore a steamer approached heard afterwards that be wonderfully skilful in use of bow use principally for killing squirrel other small animal bow be six foot long arrow four foot head be small iron ball so a to kill without injuring fur of small animal feat recorded of english archer of old time be far exceeded by ostjaks even at long distance seldom fail to strike squirrel on head godfrey be informed by man who have be present that saw ostjak shoot arrow high into air cut in two with arrow a descended feat seemed to altogether incredible be confirmed by evidence of russian traveller tomsk be situated on river tom affluent of obi town be about same size a tobolsk climate of district be considered best in siberia land be fertile among mountain be many valuable mine although comparatively small province in comparison to tobolsk on one side yeneseisk on other contains area of million square mile excluding russia be bigger than two country of europe

get away from prison employment year authority trouble about may take to mountain forest live on game for few month in summer when winter arrives must come in give up what happens to then godfrey asked perhaps nothing solitary confinement for bit perhaps beating with rod just according to temper of chief official at time perhaps if be bad case be sent to mine for bit be what certainly happens when be political prisoner why ca get right away where be to go to officer said with laugh to south there be sandy desert where must certainly die of thirst to north trackless forest cold must freeze bullock solid in night great river mile wide to cross terrible morass to say nothing of wolf who must make short work of native tribe to west people of desert be fierce savage must kill anyone who came among merely for clothes besides get reward from government for escaped prisoner bring in alive dead want bolt bar to keep prisoner in here whole land be prison house prisoner know well enough that be better to live under roof to be well fed there than to starve in forest with prospect of flogging at end of holiday still there be thousand take to wood in summer government doe not care why must be spared expense of feeding if starve to death kill other off in quarrel for greater part of must think more of taking life than of killing fowl there be end of further trouble about for understand be only men who have life sentence murderer so on attempt to run away short sentence men be not such fool went on kindly seeing that godfrey looked depressed at what have heard do think of running away if behave well gain good opinion of authority wo find uncomfortable will be made clerk store keeper will have good deal of liberty after time if try to run away will probably be sent to mine though be not so bad there a say be bad enough even prospect be not very cheering to godfrey hitherto have seemed to that there must be real difficulty although there might be many hardship privation in making escape from so vast prison have told that must be possible to evade pursuit in so vast region now seemed that nature have set so strong wall round country that russian did not even trouble to pursue confident that in time prisoner must come back again be not silent long with buoyancy of youth put question aside for present with reflection where there be will there be way anyhow

will get away somehow have be refrain be constantly running through mind even now satisfactory reply to assertion that not dozen men have made escape at once occurred to there be motive to induce to make escape must not return to russia in other country must be even more in exile than here where everyone spoke language where a far a have seen climate be a good a of russia country more flat ugly there be nothing can want to escape for repeated to have everything to escape for mean to do having once re established view to satisfaction began to chat away cheerfully again to companion be not everyone said who posse advantage who can travel five six thousand mile by rail steamer carriage without ever having to put hand in pocket for single kopec only objection to be that give return ticket be objection policeman agreed smiling be not going to travel night day a did between ekaterinburg tiumen hope oh will only travel while be light well be comfort be bad enough for short distance must be something awful if have to be kept up for fortnight how long will be before get to irkoutsk about month know nothing a to what will be done with beyond that may for anything know go to mine at nertchinsk be long distance east beyond irkoutsk may go to verkhoyansk yakout settlement mile from irkutsk within arctic circle there be lot of penal settlement scattered over country send ordinary convict population there there be danger from theory be that politicals be always plotting therefore be for most part sent where by possibility can get up trouble godfrey set lip hard together asked question for next half hour although journey be not continued by night telega be still godfrey constant place of abode sometimes be wheeled under shed sometimes stood in road in case policeman be by side night day godfrey be indifferent whether slept in bed in telega when straw be fresh shaken up couple of rug laid upon be by mean uncomfortable night be not cold rain have fallen since left further reflected that probably there must be flea other vermin in post house that altogether be gainer instead of loser by regulation be pleased with appearance of atchinsk bright little town day journey from tomsk be like siberian town built of wood house be painted white gray picked out with bright colour stood in middle of large grass plain with inclosed meadow of luxuriant herbage bright flower among large number of sheep cattle be feeding beyond country again became dull monotonous krasnoiarsk be next town reached between town kansk country be again cultivated scarce day passed without large gang of convict being overtaken on road for distance godfrey suffered terribly from mosquito swarmed so thickly that peasant working in field be obliged to wear black veil over face fortunately have be warned by guard at atchinsk that there must be trouble with pest on further man have at request bought for few yard of muslin under sat during day spread over telega at night be however long dreary journey godfrey be heartily glad when at last saw dome of irkoutsk city of fifty thousand inhabitant drove rapidly through town to prison where be placed in cell by morning after arrival warder entered with man carrying basin shaving apparatus confound godfrey muttered have be expecting ever since saw first gang of convict hoped did not do to be of course useless to remonstrate hair have grown to great length since left st petersburg be first cut short then barber lathered head set to work with razor godfrey wondered what particular style of hair be going to be have noticed that convict be partially shaved be left bare from centre of head down one side others have front half of head shaved while hair at back be left have only ridge of hair running along top of head from forehead to nape of neck from one ear to other be shaving like monk said to a work proceeded well think be best after for with cap on wo show when barber have done stepped back surveyed godfrey with air of satisfaction while jailer a wrote down particular in note book grinned godfrey passed hand over head found that a supposed have be shaved half way down to ear in middle of bald place barber have left patch of hair about size of crown stood up perfectly erect burst into shout of laughter in other two men joined jailer patted approvingly on shoulder bravo young fellow said pleased at seeing how lightly godfrey took for many of exile who have stood bravely loss of liberty be completely broken down by loss of portion of hair branded wherever went a convict godfrey be then taken out into large court yard out through gate into inclosure have evidently be added very short time to precinct of prison be of considerable size being four five acre in extent be surrounded on three side by palisade fourteen foot in height of newly sawn timber wall of prison formed fourth side of square in corner of inclosure be placed clump of six little wooden hut two low fence ran across inclosure at right angle to other dividing space into four equal square where fence crossed other there be inclosure few yard across in be two sentry box with soldier musket in hand standing by few men be listlessly moving about while others be digging working in small garden patch into inclosure be divided policeman who accompanied godfrey led to one of little hut opened door went in young man be sitting there have brought companion policeman said will share hut with can teach what be required with brief introduction closed door behind left young man have risen godfrey looked hard at other surely have met before prisoner said know face quite well know yours also godfrey replied now that speak know be young englishman godfrey bullen be godfrey replied alexis stumpoff so be godfrey exclaimed in surprise delighted at meeting shook hand cordially what be here for godfrey asked thought that have obtained appointment at tobolsk yes be sent out a assistant to doctor of one of prison suppose understood that be not sort of appointment one must choose be certainly surprised when heard that be going so far away godfrey said a friend told that have property seemed almost like going into banishment be just what be young doctor laughed have be too outspoken in political opinion one two of set have be arrested sent out here when be informed on day after passed examination be appointed to prison at tobolsk be also intimated to that must be more agreeable to go there in capacity than a prisoner a be also of opinion a to tell truth of friend be for pushing matter good deal farther than cared about doing be not altogether sorry to get out of how be that be here a prisoner godfrey asked be more than can tell two month ago governor of prison entered room with two warder informed briefly be to be sent here a prisoner have ten minute given to pack up thing for journey hour later be in cabin of steamer with cossack at door what be for heaven only know have never broken regulation never spoken to political prisoner when in hospital except to ask medical question have never opened lip on politics to soul there think perhaps can enlighten godfrey said related to attempt to blow up emperor at winter palace fate of petroff stepanoff akim soushiloff doe indeed explain alexis said be very intimate with of be quite enough to have be intimate with two men engaged in plot against life of czar to ensure one visit to siberia so be have thought of everything seemed to that must have be something at st petersburg that name have be found on list when of nihilist be arrested something of sort for certainly did join be before there be idea of taking step against czar wonder be here after being mixed up in escape of valerian ossinsky then being caught again with four nihilist just after terrible attempt to blow up czar wonder did not hang wonder too godfrey said suppose if have be year two older must have done so can assure have not slightest idea that petroff akim be nihilist do think that country be horribly misgoverned a foreigner be business of mine however strongly felt must have have nothing to do with men who tried to gain end by assassination be just a innocent in affair of ossinsky behaved like fool grant be have met woman who a now know be sophia perovskaia be only known to then from having met once in petroff akim room be introduced to a akim cousin katia met at opera house told cock bull story about young officer who have come to see lady there have left regiment at moscow without leave to do so colonel who be at opera house have heard of being there be looking for be persuaded to change domino with to enable to slip off oh be alexis said wondered how got mixed up in affair still more why let out after having be caught in what considered serious business well here be victim be curious chance have thrown together again well what be life here godfrey asked alexis shrugged shoulder a life be detestable though be for short time only there must be nothing to grumble about be fairly fed have patch of ground where can grow vegetable twelve men in hut can visit talk to other when be said be said oh by way be also permitted to make anything like be can buy material if have money work can be sold in town there be one man have made turning lathe make sort of pretty little thing there be man who be officer in navy carves little model of ship out of wood bone man paint have not decided yet what will do have two three hundred rouble when be sent off here a only spent four five on road have plenty to last for time for tea tobacco how do get warder smuggle in be understood thing there be real objection to though be very strict about bringing in spirit still can get vodka if have mind to be only question of bribery how long be here for alexis fifteen year be supposed to be in for life godfrey said fifteen year be a bad a life young doctor said what be use of life after having be shut up here for fifteen year well mean to stay be one thing godfrey said there ca be difficulty in escaping from here not least in world alexis said quietly where do propose to go have not settled yet seems to that one with pluck energy ought to be able to make way out of country somehow besides from what hear great number do get away take to wood yes have to give up again that may be hear also that if give up long way from prison escape from refuse to give account of be simply sent to prison again a vagabond in case be treated a ordinary convict now from what hear ordinary convict be infinitely better off than political one of course have to associate with bad lot still be better than almost solitary confinement work have to do be not hard if be well conducted be let out after time whereas there be hope for political prisoner at rate even if knew that if be retaken must be hung at once must try distance to frontier be enormous even when get there must be arrested at first place come to if have paper besides how must get through winter must get through winter somehow godfrey said stoutly there be hundred thousand of people in scattered village who live through winter why must must make friend with native in north live in hut hunt with be not thinking of that distance be a say enormous cold terrible idea be to escape by south be desert godfrey oh call desert to frighten people from trying to escape way know there be caravan route by tea come from china besides there be tribesman who wander about there pick up living somehow say that be going to succeed only say be going to try may lose life may be sent back again very well then will try again other way be not far from chinese frontier here be frontier be at kiakhta not more than three four hundred mile away what be people like be called buriats be sort of mongol tribe living generally in tent wandering with flock herd through country like patriarch of old if have large flock herd godfrey said reward russian offer for escaped convict ca tempt much most likely be hospitable almost wandering tribe be if one have luck one might get befriended stick for time to one of tribe in wandering south then get hold of other people so get passed on there ca be anything impossible in alexis know that traveller have made way through africa alone mungo park did lot of other people have done so of negro tribe be according to account deal more savage than asiatic tribe once among doe much matter way one go whether be east to china west to persia alexis sat looked with wonder at companion by saint godfrey bullen begin to understand now how be that people living in bit of island must be pinched out of russia never missed be colonizing world how go in ship to explore polar sea have penetrated africa in direction a traveller go among wildest people a missionary be brought up to have everything done for to think a be told to think to have official keep eye over at turn to be punished if dare to think independently till have come to be nation of grown up child be only boy if will forgive calling so yet talk about facing most horrible danger a coolly a if be proposing going for promenade on nevski wo talk more about now for have made feel quite restless there have be here two hour have forgotten duty a host have not even offered cup of tea be shameful alexis brought out samovar soon have water boiling tea made after have drunk went out of hut godfrey be introduced to other exile two of who lived together be quite old men have be professor at university of kieff be exiled for having in lecture taught be considered pernicious doctrine there be three military two naval officer noble doctor two son of merchant received cordially godfrey saw that in other place society must be pleasant one there be air of settled melancholy in majority of face while sentry fifty yard away high prison wall behind seemed ever in mind by common consent a seemed allusion be ever made to politics have strong opinion have sacrificed everything for of what use to discus matter course of be powerless to influence in smallest degree free there be probably not one of must again have striven in one way to bring about reform by instructing ignorant rousing intelligent frightening powerful here with hope of returning whole thing be best forgotten past be dead to be without future news godfrey brought of blow have be struck against czar roused for few day war then be still being carried on others be wielding weapon have forged of what have happened afterwards godfrey be ignorant four men have be arrested killed whether have played important part in matter knew not whether others have shared fate must say be so far a heard numerous arrest have taken place excitement caused by news very speedily died away again became listless indifferent worked for little time in garden beyond only who have made sort of occupation for have anything to interest actively in sometimes played chess draught card did so a godfrey observed in half hearted manner with exception indeed of one of professor who be by far strongest chess player of party who passed time in inventing problem when complete carefully noted down in book with solution when be dead said one day to godfrey who be watching will send book to nephew of mine see have written name address outside be great chess player will send to england france to be published be pleasant for to think that work even here in prison may serve a amusement to people out in world except in dulness monotony of life there be little to complain of godfrey be surprised to find how far differed from own preconceived notion of life of political prisoner in siberia be only when by effort looked ahead for year tried to fancy possibility of being so cut off from world for life that must appreciate terrible nature of punishment better thousand time to be one of murderer in prison behind wall have work to occupy time constantly changing associate with knowledge that by good conduct must sooner later be released be allowed to live outside prison when at eight o'clock in evening prisoner be locked up in hut endeavoured to learn everything that alexis stumpoff knew of siberia found that knowledge be much more extensive than have expected a came out nominally godfrey a free man brought with book must buy on country almost got by heart seemed to that be likely to be kept here for year if not for life might be sent from one government prison to from tobolsk to eastern sea therefore place possessed interest for besides although be not actually political prisoner be virtually so sympathy be wholly with prisoner thought that might possibly be able to advise counsel men who came under charge to describe to place where might have relation friend shut up to dissuade who like meditated escape for study have not gone far before became convinced that be well nigh hopeless learned how strict be regulation on frontier how impossible even if be reached to journey on without being arrested at very first village that fugitive entered so strict be that although number of convict establishment be within comparatively short distance of frontier escape be more frequent from than from three thousand mile to east when say escape mean escape from siberia escape from prison be of constant occurrence since most of work be done outside wall there be thousand might almost say ten of thousand get away spring have to come back again in winter authority trouble little about for know that must give up in few month yes guard told about that said be not punished much when came in sometimes be flogged russian peasant be accustomed to flogging think little of more often be not flogged have perhaps heavier chain for convict wear chain have advantage over there be put on poorer diet for time lose remission of sentence must obtain by good behaviour be even when be recognized a rule take care not to give up at prison left at one many hundred mile from in course of summer hair have grown again assert stoutly that be free labourer who have lost paper who can not earn living through winter authority know of course that be escaped convict have mean of identifying can not send round of hundred convict establishment so instead of man being entered a alexis stumpoff murderer for instance be put down by name give word vagabond be added next year may break out again in time hardship suffer in wood become distasteful settle down to prison life then after perhaps six perhaps ten year of good conduct be released allowed to settle where will so see godfrey bullen how hopeless be chance of escape not at godfrey said men be most of peasant men without education without enterprise incapable of forming plan wholly without resource in feel a certain of escaping a be of being here at present say that will succeed first time a say there be difficulty in getting away if fail in one direction will try in chapter vi escape evening be spent principally in conversation about siberia godfrey being eager to learn everything that must about geography people alexis told knew a to mountain river various native tribe district where village be comparatively numerous mighty forest that stretching away to arctic sea must hardly be said to be explored book paper be forbidden to political prisoner so strict be regulation that warder must not under consideration bring in godfrey wrote particular that judged might in way be useful with burnt piece of stick upon table a alexis gave then learned by heart washing off after have done so few of detail alexis must give must be of use in attempt first intended to make southern frontier be so temptingly close that seemed absurd to turn from to attempt tremendous journey north involving certainty of having to struggle through arctic winter to face difficulty of passage west by land sea beyond fact that from irkutsk must have to make for southern point of lake baikal sixty mile away then strike about south east for two hundred through country inhabited almost entirely by buriats doctor must tell little kiakhta said rather a far a russian be concerned troitzkosavsk be sort of suburb of kiakhta be frontier town kiakhta be sort of neutral town inhabited only by merchant by treaty between russia china officer stranger be allowed to sleep there across frontier few mile away be chinese suppose must say mongol town of maimatchin beyond fact that people about there be mongol rather than chinese such religion a have be that of thibet rather than china for priest be called lama know nothing except that caravan route from kiakhta to pekin be somewhere about thousand mile that camel do in about thirty five day then make about thirty mile day godfrey said suppose there must be well at halting place ah be matter godfrey see camel can go three day without water easily enough of course must carry skin of water for traveller oh be odds godfrey said one must walk ninety mile easily enough in three day there must be difficulty in carrying water enough for time besides one must of course join caravan if one must luckily enough have two hundred rouble in note when be captured restored a well a watch other thing when started suppose mongol be just a fond of money a other people chinese be certainly might get chinese tea merchant to let go in train for consideration russian laughed word godfrey begin to think will do there ca be anything impossible in doing godfrey said why did not burton disguise go with caravan to mecca visit holy place be twenty time a difficult dangerous going along caravan route of course difficulty be language buriats if one must talk mongol whatever fellow call language must be easy sailing own that be difficult thing to get along explain what want with people who can not understand word say suppose buriats speak russian must say that great many of do godfrey know there be missionary school among of live in settled village though be so wedded to own wandering life that build house on exact model of tent with hole in roof to let smoke out still a deal with town come in to sell cattle sheep herd so on doubt greater part of at rate on side of frontier speak certain amount of russian difficulty will be to persuade not to give up can pay more not to give up than can get for doing so godfrey said must kill for what have godfrey be permitted to kill runaway in fact encouraged to do so reward be same whether be brought in dead alive must think alexis be easier to bring in live man than dead one know russian laughed think buriat must find very easy to take distance alive there must be trouble in chucking into cart bringing here after preliminary operation of knocking on head godfrey smiled forget there must be preliminary trouble in knocking on head alexis seriously think native who have be in contact at with civilization be disposed to take life without strong motive of course robbery must be motive must certainly have nothing about that tartar buriat suppose be something of same thing must covet be telling that many of people have very large flock herd be likely such people a must cut stranger throat on chance of finding few rouble in pocket well one must think not godfrey of course be not rich may not be rich say be always nomad well people who be nomad must always have sort of animal to carry tent certain amount anyhow of cattle horse sheep at believe in cutting throat without motive let understand little more about intention godfrey do mean to climb over fence then to stroll away to south with hand in pocket hat on one side of head to ask first man come upon to direct to shortest road to pekin godfrey laughed not quite that alexis clothes did very well in st petersburg though be worse for journey here daresay must pas well enough in street of irkutsk first thing to do will be to get clothes for a far a must see coming along native dress good deal like russian suppose in winter wrap up more in fur may wear fur differently sort of peasant dress must do a must not excite attention while tweed suit must be singular even in street here that fur lined great coat must be right godfrey yes bought that at st petersburg know that must go very well with peasant dress be certainly not suitable for time of year though will take with if can if must roll up carry a knapsack must be first rate for sleeping in besides might do a something to exchange when one get to place where money be of little use if can get hold of pistol anyhow will be glad pistol will always produce civility if one meet only one two men other thing must want be box of match for making fire good knife better still small axe for chopping wood bottle skin for holding water will be seized sent back in week godfrey very well then there will be harm done regard a sort of preliminary investigation will ascertain difficulty of travel in siberia will learn lesson for next time believe true way be to strike one of great river to build steal boat to go down in to arctic sea then to coast along until one get to norway be big affair besides be great deal too late in year for when attempt that will make off a early in spring a possible remember may be flogged when be caught godfrey well must like to be flogged a say convict think much of suppose must bear used to flog in army navy till quite lately be dishonour alexis exclaimed passionately godfrey shrugged shoulder dishonour lie in crime not in punishment said at great public school in england fellow be flogged well there be disgrace in if be only for breaking rule anything of sort must be horrible dishonour if be for thieving sort of thing be absurd believe flogging be best punishment there be be lot better to give man couple of dozen send about business than be to keep for year in prison at public expense to have to maintain wife child also at public expense while be there besides thought said other day that did not flog political prisoner well at least not at of large prison in of small establishment with perhaps brutal drunken captain major a governor doubt may be done sometimes well will take chance of when do think of starting alexis asked after pause directly have only to decide how be to get out after door be locked to make rope of sort to climb fence with blanket tied together will do for a to getting out there be difficulty one only have to throw blanket over cross beam get up on get off one of lining board displace few tile crawl through have mind to go with godfrey have alexis must be awfully glad at same time must not say word to persuade to do know make light of know very well that there will be danger tremendous lot of hardship to be gone through think be afraid of godfrey alexis said seriously be not have be thinking of ever since began to talk to of getting away consider be hundred to one against success a say if fail get brought back great harm be done if get killed die of hunger thirst again harm be done for certainly life be not thing to cling to when one be prisoner in siberia be not that see be differently situated to if do succeed in getting away go home be right if succeed in getting away what be to become of speak russian german there must be return for to russia unless day when new czar ascends throne on such occasion when general amnesty be granted even must hardly extend to political prisoner what be to do so far a can see might starve after one might almost a well remain here a starve in pekin in chinese port granted must work way back to europe on board ship what must do if landed at marseille liverpool must not go through street shouting in german ' be doctor who want to be cured ' alexis godfrey agreed must not well do will tell what must do of course at first place get to where there be telegraph to england will send message to father to cable to firm there to let have what money require very well then of course must go home with to england there be one thing must promise be post in father office know trade with russia though correspondence be generally carried on in german be quite sure that father must after have be companion on journey a propose make berth for in office to undertake correspondence in russian german that must pay salary quite sufficient for to live in comfort if must rather be sure that must find mean for going out settling say in united state in part where german be general language then in case godfrey russian said shaking hand warmly be man think must have gone with anyhow what have said quite decides now then what be first proceeding godfrey laughed must say to take inventory of belonging alexis rather of belonging for mine be very briefly described two hundred rouble in note watch pocket knife suit of clothes stand up in dozen pair of sock three flannel shirt bought on way one great coat lined with fur think be about be very small share yours be much more numerous more numerous not much more useful alexis said let bring one large portmanteau of clothes a ca carry away on shoulder be of very little use can take in way be suit of clothes spare flannel shirt two sock have got two case of surgical instrument will take few of most useful other thing pair of forceps for instance may come across tartar with raging tooth make friend for ever by extracting will put bandage two plaster in pocket be thing one ought always to carry for one be always liable to get hurt sprain a to money have hundred twenty rouble be in silver changed paper at tobolsk thinking that silver must be more handy here unfortunately took away pistol couple of amputating knife will make good weapon have got leather waistcoat will cut up make from couple of sheath of course have got fur cloak one of very handsome one will take there ought to be difficulty whatever in getting one to give two peasant dress in exchange for coat for people know something of value of fur yes if can get gun ammunition thrown into bargain alexis will be most useful for may have to depend upon what shoot sometimes yes must be great addition godfrey well will set about making sheath at once have got store of needle stout thread will be useful to take with godfrey said not only for mending clothes if want for exchange woman have to sew over world even most savage people can appreciate advantage of good needle be so godfrey have got packet of capital surgical needle silk will put in with others wo take up much room well will start to morrow night think have better wait for two three day godfrey said must save up of food yes will want bread alexis agreed ca well get in through warder must look suspicious will get in meat through have got of last lot left so can do with very little bread for next two day found plenty to occupy while stock of bread be accumulating one of russian coat be cut up made into two bag like haversack with band to pas over shoulder for carrying belonging strap be make of cloth for fastening great coat knapsack fashion agreed that however long might have to wait must choose stormy night for flight a otherwise must hardly break through roof scale fence without being heard by sentry who kept watch night day be eager to be off for be already end of july winter must be severe in country over have to travel on fourth day heavy rain set in in evening began to blow hard now be time godfrey said nothing must have be better have already loosened two of lining board of roof a soon a have be locked up for night removed altogether packed haversack with article have agreed to take with six pound of bread meat rolled four blanket up knotted tightly together strapped up three fur lined cloak placed knife in belt then without much difficulty prised up one of thick plank with hut be roofed godfrey got through opening alexis passed out to haversack coat then joined slid down roof dropped to ground paling be twenty yard behind hut a soon a reached godfrey climbed upon companion shoulder threw loop of doubled rope over one of palisade climbed on to top then with rope pulled up coat haversack dropped outside alexis pulled up by rope be then dropped on outside slid down by shifted rope on to point of one of paling so that must be easily shaken off from below then slipped down rope shaken off two of blanket opened haversack hung over shoulder great coat strapped on put one of twisted blanket over shoulder scarf fashion wrapped other round a cloak then set out on way fortunately prison lay on south side of town at distance of mile from a course to extremity of lake baikal lay almost due south be able to strike right across country wind be from north have therefore only to keep back to to follow right direction be half past ten when started for night be short have not be that sky be covered with cloud air thick with rain must not have be dark enough for to make attempt until hour later by three o'clock be light again knew there be little chance of escape being discovered until warder came to unlock hut at six in morning a plank have removed from roof be at back of hut therefore invisible to sentry doubt will send few mounted cossack out to search for a be political prisoner alexis said may calculate will be seven o'clock before set out a be very last direction will imagine have taken need not trouble ourselves about besides will soon be getting into wooded country believe be wood round lower end of lake will be quite out of way of traffic for everything going east from irkutsk be taken across lake by steamer after twelve hour walking with only one halt of hour for refreshment reached edge of forest after again making hearty meal of bread cold meat taking sip from bottle containing cold tea lay down slept until late in afternoon well have accomplished so much satisfactorily alexis said now have to keep on to kaltuk at extreme south western point of lake be very small place believe be where must get what want will be there by evening will be just right a must do for to go in until be pretty nearly dark place of sort be sure to have store where sell clothes other thing trade with people round struck lake mile two from extremity following until must see roof of house lay down for hour until must be dark enough to enter have better put on fur coat alexis said people wear long coat of fashion other in dusk will pas well enough be village containing fifty sixty house for most part tent like structure of buriats met one in street kept on until saw light in window of house larger than others looking in saw that be place for be in search opening door went in closed behind man came out from room behind shop stopped for moment at seeing two stranger then advanced with suspicious look on face do want bargain alexis asked abruptly have little money to buy with said sullenly that matter little for will take out in good man hesitated alexis drew out long keen amputating knife look here said be not to be fooled with may guess what be not be nothing to nothing to want of good be ready to give good exchange for be not robber here be coat look at be almost unworn have used only one winter can see be lined with real sable cost three hundred rouble at rate be worth hundred to even if take out lining sell skin separately burn coat examine for shopkeeper did so be good skin said alexis must see that quite appreciated value now alexis said want two peasant dress complete coat trouser high boot cap what do charge for twenty rouble suit very well pick two suit right size for lay down on counter now want

over head before week be past godfrey placed ten rouble note two one rouble note on table gathered up good made into bundle carefully loaded gun put powder shot into haversack then alexis lifted bundle shouldering gun left shop will give alarm do think godfrey asked not be thoroughly well satisfied daresay will get hundred fifty rouble for coat besides know that escaped convict be desperate men that must be likely to execute threat besides suppose must venture to stir out for aught know may be waiting just outside shop to see what doe will fear that might get that hungry looking knife into if came out to raise alarm be quiet be soon beyond limit of village struck out for country held on for two three mile filled water skin at little stream running towards lake then entering wood pushed on for little distance lighted fire made tea be fairly off now godfrey have become what call wanderer must be safe enough among russian peasant most of whom have be convict in time in village north for be always willing enough to help men who have taken to wood well except in village of there be few enough about here be not likely to come upon from here to frontier be buriats indeed beyond frontier however a have got gun need not be afraid of small party of course of have gun too suppose will be fool enough to risk throwing life away for nothing at rate there be one comfort there be nothing to show that be political prisoner now might be honest peasant if be not for confounded head of hair must think godfrey said have better get rid of hair altogether will be time before grows anything will be better than be now have got scissors godfrey have soap if have knife of ours be sharp enough to shave with can singe off godfrey said not now in morning when can see will do for can do for must rather be bald headed altogether than be such figure a be now accordingly in morning singed off hair with red hot brand then changed clothes for have obtained night before folded up great coat divided tea tobacco greater part of powder shot between put portion in haversack rolled rest up in coat then strapped to shoulder started on way now feel ready for anything alexis said a tramped along have weight to speak of to carry have mean of getting meal occasionally now if keep little west of south will strike selenga river run through maimatchin then will be in china will have to avoid town because know there be treaty between russia china about sending back exile who cross frontier still when get there be at starting place of caravan be desert whole distance no first part be mountainous country with two three river to cross think real desert be more than eight ten day march across will certainly have difficulty about water for time to come there be plenty of squirrel in wood at least expect so for abound in forest must knock of over if can believe be not bad eating though never tried one then by stream ought to be able to pick up wild duck though of course at time of year greater portion of be far north still have great hope will be able to keep ourselves in food with assistance of what may be able to buy occasionally think only thing have got to fear at part of journey be buriats thing be really afraid of be getting into china mean frontier here be mongolia be only nominally chinese when get across desert enter china tell frankly see way of can speak word of language have paper may be arrested shut up a suspicious vagabond there be one thing at kalgan be close to great wall there be russian trader must go boldly to ask help russian out of russia be sure

one arm that anyone must make child sleep so soundly that must not wake under such operation seemed to beyond bound of possibility tell child be going to do good alexis said to mother that be to look at eye steadily placed at side of couch gazed down steadily at child then began to make pass slowly down face for three four minute black eye looked into unwinkingly then lid closed little alexis

indeed godfrey alexis said a took possession of new abode have indeed alexis nothing must have be more providential be in clover a long a choose to stop here do think child will recover think there be hope of doing so native be a hard a nail suppose child have ever have day illness in life in pure dry air there be little fear of wound doing badly next thing to do be to make pair of crutch to get about with till can bear to have wooden stump on only nuisance be that will be delayed a doctor can not very well leave patient till be fairly on road towards recovery certainly not godfrey agreed well daresay will put away time pleasantly enough here hour later two horse be brought up with saddle bridle be presented by buriat to guest be picketed by tent next three week passed pleasantly rode hunted shot little patient made rapid progress towards recovery at end of time be able to get about on two crutch godfrey have made for be better that must make godfrey also wooden leg when be ready for alexis have said be just a well that gratitude must be divided little so will hand that part of work over to buriats be delighted indeed when saw child hopping about camp with crutch gratitude knew bound to guest alexis have made secret to buriat of intention of trying to make way to pekin endeavoured in way to dissuade from will never find way across desert said will die for want of water people be wild savage be ruled by lama if put to death must be likely to do for what have will certainly send back to kiakhta hand over to russian there even if got through desert chinese must seize send back must be madness to try must be better than to go south make for thibet although even must be desperate expedition tribe be wild savage desert be terrible for who know must never find well must perish miserably of thirst even if escaped being killed by tribesman still chance must be greater than must be of reaching pekin have far better make up mind to live here will give flock herd must be a of family alexis must marry sister who be rich a well a pretty for owns third of flock herd see alexis warmly thanked buriat for offer said must take time to consider might do worse said laughing to godfrey when be alone woman be certainly great deal better looking than men girl must be considered fair looking even in russia at rate must be vastly better being buriat here than being inside prison at irkutsk agree with there alexis must be horrible being cut off here from world for life one be cut off in prison godfrey though agreed to share attempt have never be very hopeful about success be still le hopeful now from what hear of difficulty ahead of a said when first talked of there must be frightful difficulty here must be way by convict must always try to escape yet have never heard of one doing so yes begin to think have made mistake alexis in choosing route instead of northern one besides will have winter upon in very few week now must of course add tremendously to difficulty be not seriously thinking of stopping here be know godfrey see have got home friend waiting for if do get away have nothing exile do believe will never succeed in getting out through china think must do better than stop here for year two by end of time may succeed in establishing relation by mean of buriat with of tea merchant at kiakhta getting one of to smuggle through with caravan at rate if still hold to going will go too have intention of deserting can assure in fortnight godfrey have made stump for child hollow be lined with sheepskin to take off jar strapped firmly on to limb wound be not quite sufficiently healed yet for child to use regularly when on first trying walked across tent joy of father mother knew bound have only be waiting for to make move for pasture have for time be getting short on following day tent be pulled down for three day journeyed east then finding suitable spot again pitched tent be now a buriat told only thirty mile from kiakhta godfrey alexis have talked matter over during journey agreed that season be now too late for to think of attempting journey until following spring have almost concluded that attempt to get through china must be altogether abandoned going north there be rigour of climate enormous distance a obstacle passage must be chiefly by water there be danger from tribe must have to pas through difficulty such a might meet with from opposition of chinese have pretty well resolved to pas winter with buriats to make start in spring host be greatly pleased when informed of intention at rate to spend winter with for hoped that before spring alexis must have made up mind to accept offer to settle down a member of tribe day after buriats pitched fresh camp one of men reported that have seen large bear at edge of forest two mile from hut alexis godfrey at once took gun borrowed couple of long spear two hunting knife started for wood native going with to show exact spot where have seen bear there be good deal of undergrowth about thought probable that animal be not far off buriat have brought dog with animal at once began sniffing ground master encouraged presently started sniffing ground a went have gone few hundred yard when stopped before thick clump of bush began growling furiously have short consultation then two friend took up post one at corner of bush while buriat went round to rear of clump with dog began beating bush with stick while dog barked yelped minute later bear broke out of bush within four yard of alexis russian levelled gun godfrey report far louder than usual something flew close to head moment later saw alexis struck to ground by bear godfrey rushed up fired when within two pace of animal with fierce growl turned upon sprang aside plunged spear deep into side bear struck at handle broke in two then rose on hind leg godfrey drew knife awaited rush stood stationary for minute swayed to fro then fell on side godfrey leaned over plunged knife in deep behind shoulder pressing until blade disappeared then feeling certain be dead ran to alexis who lay motionless on ground by side of lay stock of gun portion of barrel have exploded completely shattering russian left hand be not only even most serious injury bear have struck on side of head almost tearing off portion of scalp ear buriat have by time come round godfrey bade run to camp at top of speed to fetch assistance feeling in friend pocket drew out bandage alexis always carried wrapped up a well a must shattered hand of thumb two first finger be altogether missing wound on head be felt altogether beyond in le than hour chief buriat four of men dashed up on horseback have brought with two pole hide to form litter chief be deeply concerned when saw how

warm water poured spirit between lip of wounded man gave sign of consciousness be afraid said to buriat who be looking on anxiously that skull be injured there be concussion of brain only thing can see will be for to be carried at once to kiakhta there be sure to be hospital there doctor must be best buriat said will take house there wife sister will nurse will be better than going into hospital godfrey agreed for two reason in first because alexis must certainly get more careful nursing among friend than in hospital might then avoid if survives injury being again imprisoned time be lost four buriats took pole godfrey walked beside litter buriat wife sister mounted rode off to have everything ready for when arrived at troitzkosavsk suburb of kiakhta be late before reached buriat met mile outside town at once conducted to house that have hired from friend established there a soon a alexis be laid upon couch godfrey buriat went out ascertained where one of surgeon of military hospital lived on reaching house be shown by cossack who acted a doctor servant to room friend of mine have be badly injured by bear buriat said wish to come see at once be in house have taken near will be responsible for charge doctor looked keenly at godfrey then said will come be not buriat said to godfrey a started be not doctor though have be living with for time man who be ill be buriat sir be russian member of own profession be clever buriat said saved life of child by taking off leg be running about again now be a brother to must gladly give thousand cattle rather than that must die other word be spoken until arrived at house surgeon stooped over alexis lifted one of eyelid felt pulse concussion of brain said serious case bring rag hot water bathed wound for time then carefully

seen came alone be better said to buriat be very far from being out of danger will be long illness hope that may be able to bring round will send medicine presently keep cloth with cold water ice to head beckoned to godfrey to follow out of room want to ask question said about patient have be called in by buriat to see friend of doe not concern who what may be be different with a russian officer can not be seeing daily without reporting have met person who scarcely appears to be what seems be painful to to be obliged to say so give advice way only say that if wish to be asked question must be best for to leave here after nightfall until then will not consider necessary to make report will be back again once twice to day have better think matter over godfrey have be thinking matter over a walked beside litter have already arrived at decision be evident that many week if not month must elapse before alexis must be fit to sustain hardship must attend attempt to escape thought probable that more than ever must be inclined to throw in lot with wandering buriats have therefore only to think about have foreseen that must not be able to stop at kiakhta without being exposed to being questioned that there remained therefore only option of living with buriats during winter of giving up former plan must be most advantageous in event of trying to reach pekin difficulty in direction appeared to so great that shrank from thought of facing especially a must now be alone preferred idea of trying to escape by north in case further sojourn among buriats must be useless in russian prison must be able to pick up many valuable hint from men with whom must work might find someone ready to make attempt with difficulty of escape from prison did not seem very great must thought be even le at one of penal settlement than if confined in ordinary jail when however doctor spoke to godfrey only thanked said must speak with again when next called buriat saw that be looking serious when returned to room what did say to asked did threaten to report spoke very kindly godfrey replied said that must be duty to do so if remained here buriat shook head be thinking of yesterday be afraid for out on plain there must have be none to question here in town stranger be noticed at once for resident be known must make off at once can take horse will watch over friend once in tent will be safe godfrey thanked warmly told that have not quite decided a to what must do must let know later on then a must hing for alexis threw down on pile of skin thought matter over in light chapter viii mine of kara godfrey found difficult matter to decide what be best to be done after two hour thinking mind be quite made up did not stand in same position a alexis with buriats be alexis who have laid under obligation by saving child life be simply liked a doctor companion without alexis long month of winter must be dreary indeed thought that imprisonment must be preferable to living alone in buriat hut accordingly rose at last told buriat that course be decided will give up said know that must make welcome in tent from what have told see that there be prospect whatever of escape through china that if go out to plain will be there for life while if go to prison may in time be released at rate can again escape whenever come to will be welcome buriat said for know best will be sorry to lose be there anything can do for know governor here for have have large dealing with for sheep cattle for troop will be very glad if will go with to godfrey said word from may be of great advantage to there be prison here be most anxious to be sent to nertchinsk not to irkutsk because be from there escaped buriat wife sister be sorry when heard godfrey determination be too much occupied with alexis to try dispute when will go buriat said at once if will take have preparation to make only cause extra trouble here can be of assistance first if will procure paper pen ink will write letter for to give to alexis when recovers telling why leave buriat sent out one of men who presently returned with writing material godfrey then wrote long letter to alexis explaining at reason actuated in deciding to give up be in good hand said must hing for in case must have to leave now for did not give up must leave evening therefore must do good to in case know that be half inclined to stay with buriats will now have even greater reason for doing so than before if however must at future time change mind try to make escape need not tell how delighted must be to see in england inclose address

better take with can not do godfrey said be have of own know must gladly give to if be conscious can not take now very well buriat said be doubtless right at rate can take from be rich have many thousand of sheep cattle if take will be offended will think that in way have displeased thousand rouble be nothing to have given a much for one suit of fur for wife must take if ever attempt to escape again will need money after much debate godfrey accepted five hundred rouble in note seeing that buriat must be really pained by refusal knowing that money must indeed be useful to when next tried to make escape being anxious to hear surgeon next report about alexis godfrey delayed start until after visit there be change doctor said after examining patient did expect there must be after such serious injury a have received must be strange indeed if did not suffer from shock may be day before change take place be vastly better that must be restless even wildly delirious than lying

be before if be wise gave significant glance at godfrey will keep to must say have be political one of men said in tone of contempt for there be certain jealousy of politicals among convict class because although lot be really much harder than of ordinary convict be allowed to retain own clothes be lodged separately be almost men of education in many case of noble family feeling be evidenced by indifference with rest of men strolled away again when heard suggestion how do get tobacco godfrey asked starosta be part of ration surely money may have when come in here must soon be spent may

on surface there be underground because have worked in must rather work there than here ca look after so sharp can take a easily a like godfrey looked astonished idea of siberian mine have be taken from story written by men who have never be within thousand of mile of who drew terrible picture of suffering of exile simply for purpose of exciting feeling throughout europe against russian government be very unhealthy in mine underground be not why must be be much cooler pleasanter working underground than be in dust heat can tell thought quicksilver mine be unhealthy quicksilver man

murder robbery with violence where be to sleep presently asked mikail sleep in corner next to wall put bag next to mine be not so likely to play trick with then godfrey be not sorry to lay down on board there be attempt at undressing on part of of convict must have thought bed very hard one few month since be now well contented with though must have preferred rather more room on side suppose ought to feel very miserable said to ca make out why here be shut up with about hundred a villainous looking fellow a one must want to see something like half of murderer desperate criminal ought to be down in dump seems unnatural must be suppose have sort of mark tapley disposition get jolly under difficulty of course must feel more if have made up mind to escape somehow colonel seems good sort of fellow even prisoner speak well of then be comfort to hear that talk about quicksilver mine be lie work be going to be worse than gold digger must have in california navvy at home there be great hardship about at rate for time if be not for thought of how horribly anxious must be at home about must not mind will be something to talk about one life first thing for to do be to learn from others a much a possible about country have learned lot about geography of siberia from alexis have got good idea about river dare say will learn good deal more from of men thing be to pick up a much of language a can from tartar fellow seem to be scattered pretty well over country at least have seen of way have gone know there be other tribe fishing chap call ostjaks be one must have most to do with expect one must get on with if one happened to get in right vein suppose speak sort of dialect like of tartar at rate must think must be sure to be near enough for native to understand other believe russian help with language for russian be only civilized tartar at rate one of first thing to be done be to learn to speak language must be able to learn lot about country from too have got eight nine month before one can think of making start for of course must be done in spring be end of september now though have lost account of day of month so lay thinking for long time always confidently hopefully soon after daylight convict be astir be there place where can get water to wash asked mikail there be tap trough out there in yard man said looking somewhat surprised at request godfrey hurried out threw off jacket shirt turned tap on to head enjoyed thorough sluice feeling vastly better for wash slipped on thing again went into room be not surprised now that have woke with something like headache for air of room be close unwholesome breakfast similar to supper night before be soon served godfrey have plenty of bread left from evening before put piece now served out to under jacket hour later convict ranged two two started for mine distance be five mile heavy tool be taken in cart drawn by horse guard of soldier with loaded musket marched beside line mine be large open cutting prisoner be employed in digging sand carrying on hand barrow to place where be to be washed work be not entirely performed by prisoner a there be many free labourer also employed godfrey be given shovel work consisted in loading sand gravel a pickmen got down on to barrow being unaccustomed to work back ached hand be blistered by end of day knew from experience in rowing that must pas off before long at rate labour be far easier than have anticipated have expected to see overseer with whip there be nothing of sort few men directed labour spoke sharply enough if saw of prisoner shirking there be nothing to distinguish from other work of kind save cossack guard here there leaning upon musket certainly men worked harder than ordinary labourer must do indeed when time be up prisoner started on return towards prison free labourer continued work must do so afterwards learned for hour a must take considerable time for sand obtained during day to be thoroughly washed up gold extracted godfrey have at first looked narrowly at sand a shovelled for speck of gold have seen none indeed proportion of gold at mine of kara be so small that must not have paid if worked by free labour produce served to lessen expense of prison mine afforded work to convict prisoner be not forbidden to talk godfrey who have happened to be placed next to young fellow of better class learned good many particular a to mine have seen woman at asked if be not employed at labour never heard of such thing other said have to work wash mend clothes scrub floor help cook be after working for certain time according to length of sentence be allowed to live out of prison after still further time be at liberty to settle down anywhere in siberia choose have be here long godfrey asked have be here three year said must be out by time if have not run away last year how did get on got on well enough till cold weather came there be plenty of berry in wood besides occasionally came down stole thing from cart waiting at night at post house got chest of tea once that lasted through summer there be ten of together besides that people along road be very good to escaped prisoner dare not give anything because if be known did so must be severely punished on window sill of almost house be placed at night plate with food on in case wanderer must come along of course when winter came have to give up do think escape altogether be possible say that be not possible for have done suppose for one who have tried hundred have died there be living in mountain in winter men do get free there be great many private mine in of ask question be glad enough to engage anyone who come along after working there a free labourer for couple of year be comparatively easy to move somewhere else in time one may even settle down a free labourer in town there be getting right away then for one can leave siberia without passport giving particular of life be not thinking of trying be because if will take advice wo be very well to go out for summer holiday be very different thing from attempting escape be fool to try have longing to be in wood must not help so now will be obliged to work here for couple of year longer before can live outside prison be here for knocking down colonel be in love with same girl liked best father liked best be tyrannical brute one day insulted before knocked down be tried for trumped up lot of other charge against there be difficulty in getting plenty of hound to swear to so see here be with ten year sentence know that be not lucky how be that godfrey asked there be dozen fellow in regiment be one of who ventured to think for have secret meeting be in communication with men of other regiment well be sent off before anything came of got hold of name of others when arrested nihilist at kieff be sent out here for life met one of few month back told so so see be rather lucky that knocked down colonel when did besides be ever so much better to be convict than political know how be have luck to get turned in with can tell there be comparison between lot ours still be hateful of course living among such gang a fellow look pretty bad godfrey said bad be not word for other said man know who work a clerk in office told that there be about two thousand two hundred prisoner in six prison of kara of only about hundred fifty be woman be even worse than men for of hundred fifty there be hundred twenty five murderess of others twelve be classed a vagabond suppose most of be murderess too out of two thousand men there be about six hundred seventy murderer be not such big proportion a among woman though a there be nearly seven hundred classed a vagabond must not be far wrong if put down other man a murderer be horrible godfrey said well be not pleasant must remember that great many of murderer may be otherwise pretty honest fellow great many of have killed man woman when mad with vodka of others have done in fit of jealousy few perhaps out of vengeance for great wrong rest grant be thoroughly bad by way name be osip ivanoff there be two three decent fellow in ward will introduce to evening make pleasanter keeping together have got card help pas away summer evening in winter be too dark to play there be only one candle in ward so there be nothing for to lay up go to sleep a soon a get dark there be prison dare say wo be sorry when be back first three four day work be always trying chapter ix prison life godfrey found that there be sunday break in work at kara once fortnight whole of occupant of ward have bath upon day work be done upon good many saint day also rested so that practically have holiday about once in ten day for own part must have be glad have work gone on without break when men started for work at five in morning returned to prison at seven at night great majority after smoking pipe two turned in at once while upon day when there be work quarrel be frequent what be to still more objectionable men told story of early life seemed proud rather than otherwise of horrible crime have committed own time did not hang at heavy upon hand one of tartar prisoner who spoke russian be glad enough to agree in exchange for sufficient amount of tobacco to enable to smoke steadily while so employed to teach own dialect godfrey found a have expected sufficient similarity between two language to assist very greatly with two hour work evening long bout on holiday made rapid progress with especially a got into habit of going over over again through vocabulary of word have learned while be at work in mine when not employed with tartar spent time in conversation with osip ivanoff little group of men of same type spent much of time in playing card whist being very popular game in russia often invited godfrey to join mind be so much occupied with own plan that felt quite unable to give requisite attention to game soon learnt method by order discipline be maintained in prison for small offence punishment be decrease in ration prohibition of smoking prisoner one enjoyment confinement to room last part of sentence be that prisoner most disliked so far from work being break afforded to monotony of life rendered privation of severest of punishment godfrey learned that there be greatest difficulty in getting men to accept position of starosta in spite of privilege power position gave because did not go out to work for more serious offence men be punished by flogging more le severe with birch rod for however seemed to care very little although sometimes incapacitated for doing work for day from effect of beating lastly for altogether exceptional crime for open outbreak of insubordination there be plete flogging with whip of twisted hide fastened to handle ten inch long inch thick lash be at first same thickness a handle tapering for twelve inch then divided into three smaller lash twenty five inch long about thickness of little finger terrible weapon be in use only at three of siberian prison of kara be one from twenty to twenty five lash be given punishment be considered equivalent to sentence to death a in many case culprit survives punishment short time prisoner be agreed that at punishment of plete be extremely rare only being given for murder of convict official by one of convict quarrel among prisoner although frequent attended by great shouting gesticulation very rarely came to blow russian having idea of using fist contest when came to that being little more than tussle with hair pulling random blow have prisoner have knife other weapon ready to hand result must have be very different godfrey have not smoked until arrived at kara found that in dense atmosphere of prison room be almost necessary therefore took to besides smoking being allowed a useful to ward off fever improve health of prisoner also have effect of adding to contentment rendering more easy of management a fear of smoking being cut off did more to ensure ready obedience than even fear of stick tea be not among article of prison diet samovar be always kept going by mikail tea sold to prisoner at cost price small sum paid to convict sufficed to provide with with tobacco vodka be seldom smuggled in difficulty of bringing in being great punishment of detected in doing so being severe at time however supply be brought in being carried a godfrey found in skin similar to used for sausage filled with spirit wound round round body be generally brought in when one other of prisoner have received remittance a most of be allowed to receive letter once three month letter in case of men who have once be in good position generally contained money privilege be only allowed to men after two year unbroken good conduct godfrey teacher in tartar language have be recommended to by osip a being most companionable of tartar prisoner be young fellow of three four twenty short sturdy like most of race with good natured expression in flat face be in for life having in fit of passion killed russian officer who have struck with whip came from neighbourhood of kasan in far west godfrey took strong liking to be not long before conceived idea that when made escape must if possible take luka with such companionship must be of immense advantage must greatly diminish difficulty of journey a for luka became greatly attached to pupil tartar be looked down upon by fellow prisoner term of equality with godfrey chatted with knowledge of world seemed to tartar to be prodigious made look up to with unbounded respect friendship be finally cemented by occurrence took place three month after godfrey arrived at prison among convict be man named kobylin man of great strength boasted that have committed ten murder be always bullying tyrannizing quieter weaker prisoner one day passed where luka godfrey be sitting on edge of plank bed talking together luka happened to get up just a came along kobylin gave violent push saying get out of way miserable little tartar dog luka fell with head against edge of bench lay for time half stunned godfrey leapt to foot springing forward struck bully right handed blow straight from shoulder man staggered back several pace fell over opposite bench then with shout of fury recovered foot rushed at godfrey with arm extended to grasp lad who have be one of best boxer at shrewsbury awaited onset calmly making spring forward just a kobylin reached landed blow given with strength impetus of spring under russian chin man went backwards a if have be shot roar of applause broke from convict mikail rushed forward godfrey said to let alone mikail fellow have be nuisance in ward ever since came be just a well that must have lesson sha' do harm just leave alone for minute two wo want much more illustration godfrey punishes kobylin in convict prison russian rose slowly to foot bewildered half stupefied by blow fall must probably have done nothing more maddened by taunt jeer of others gathered together renewed attack in vain attempted to seize active opponent godfrey eluded furious rush before must recover always succeeded in getting in two three straight blow at last met a in first rush knocked off foot by time kobylin have have enough of sat on floor bewildered crestfallen everything that russian peasant doe not understand savour to of magic that kobylin must have be thus vanquished by mere lad seemed altogether beyond nature must not understand how be that have be unable to grasp foe how like stroke of lightning blow have shot into face even jeering laughter of companion failed to stir russian peasant be accustomed to be beaten be humble to who be master kobylin rose slowly to foot have beaten said humbly know how forgive be wrong be ignorant did not know say more about godfrey replied have have quarrel there be end of there need be malice be prisoner here together be not right that one must bully others because happens to be little stronger there be other thing besides strength behaved badly have be punished let smoke pipe think more about sensation caused in ward by contest be prodigious victory of lad be a incomprehensible to others a to kobylin rapidity with blow be delivered ease with godfrey have evaded rush of opponent seemed to a to almost magical from moment regarded godfrey a being possessed of strange power placed altogether apart from osip other men of same stamp warmly congratulated godfrey what magic be osip said taking by shoulder looking with wonder at have be thinking lad yet that strong brute be a child in hand be miracle of david goliath over again be simply skill against brute force osip may tell have not told anyone before since came here that mother be english did not say so because a may guess feared that be known reported might be traced who be then instead of being merely classed a vagabond must be sent back to prison escaped from be put among class of prisoner understand ivan of course have along felt sure be political prisoner thought perhaps might have be student in switzerland must account for having idea different to other people be sent for time to school in england there learned to box so be english boxing osip said have heard of never thought be anything like why never once touched if have must have got worst of godfrey laughed there be nothing in size weight go for very little in boxing man knowing nothing about have not smallest chance against fair boxer who be active on leg did not seem to be exerting osip said be a cool a quiet a if have be shovelling sand even laughed when rushed at be great point of boxing osip one learns to keep cool to have one wit about one for anyone who loses temper have poor chance indeed against who keep cool moreover man who can box well will always keep head in time of danger difficulty give nerve self confidence enables at time to protect weak against strong just a did now osip said well must not have believed if have not seen be sure feel obliged to for having taken down fellow kobylin few others have be nuisance for time may be sure there will be no more trouble with after lesson have given luka gratitude to godfrey be unbounded from time must have done anything on behalf while respect with have before regarded be redoubled therefore when one day godfrey said to when spring come luka mean to try to escape will take with tartar considered to be settled thing be filled with deep sense of gratitude that companion must deem worthy of sharing in peril winter set in in three week after godfrey reached kara work at mine have to be abandoned a much employment a possible be made for convict be sent out to aid in bringing in tree have be felled during previous winter for firewood others sawed wood up split into billet for stove other party went out into forest to fell tree for next winter fire be set to whitewash house process be done five time year in spite of there be not work for number time hung very heavily on hand of who be unemployed godfrey be not of number for a soon a work at mine terminated received order to work in office a clerk warmly appreciated act of kindness on part of commandant removed from constant companionship of convict be now more unpleasant than before a during long hour of idleness quarrel be frequent men became surly discontented besides received regular pay for work be of importance a be necessary to start upon such undertaking a meditated with a large store of money a possible have since arrival refused to join in of proposal for obtaining luxury from outside supply of food be ample for in addition to bread soup there be three four time week allowance of meat daily earnings in mine be sufficient to pay for tobacco tea even ten rouble have handed over to mikail remained untouched one reason why be particularly glad at being promoted to office be that have observed upon day when first arrived large map of siberia hanging upon wall although have obtained from alexis others fair idea of position of town various convict settlement knew nothing of wild part of country through must have to pas inhabited portion formed small part indeed of whole during winter month seized opportunity when for few minute happened to be alone in office to study map to obtain a accurate idea a possible of range of mountain one day when colonel be out other two clerk be engaged in taking inventory of store knew therefore that have little chance of being interrupted pushed table against wall with sheet of tracing paper took outline of northern coast from mouth of lena to norway specially marking entrance to river however small also took tracing giving position of town river across nearest line between head of lake baikal nearest point of angara river one of great affluent of yenesei winter passed slowly uneventfully cold be severe did not feel office being well warmed heat in crowded prison far greater than be agreeable to at christmas there be three day of festivity people of kara peasant round sent in gift for prisoner one laid by little money to buy special food for occasion vodka have be smuggled in convict of different prison be allowed to visit other freely although there be much drunkenness on christmas day there be serious quarrel be on best behaviour godfrey be glad when be over returned to ordinary occupation again for thought of last christmas have spent in england brought change in circumstance home to more strongly than ever for once buoyant spirit left be profoundly depressed while around be cheerful gay nothing surprised godfrey more than brutal indifference with most of prisoner talked of crime have committed except perhaps indifference with story be listened to seemed to indeed that of convict have almost pride in crime that even went so far a to invent atrocity for purpose of giving supremacy in ferocity over fellow noticed that who be in for minor offence such a robbery with violence forgery embezzlement military insubordination be comparatively reticent a to offence that be condemned for murder who be most given to boasting about exploit one must almost wish said one day to friend osip that one have strength of samson to bring building down destroy whole of be very glad have not if have really fancy of sort have not least desire to be finished off in sudden way be dreadful to listen to godfrey said can not understand what motive of government can be in sending thousand of such wretch out here instead of hanging can understand transporting people who have be convicted of minor offence a when term be up may do well help to colonize country what can be hoped from such horrible ruffian a have trouble of keeping for year even when be let out one can hope that will turn out useful member of community probably take to old trade turn brigand think do of who escape soon after coming out might do so not when have be released must not care then to run risk of being flogged to death by plete kept in prison for rest of life running away be nothing have heard of man who have run away repeatedly being chained to barrow have to take with wherever went indoors out be worst ever heard of for a for flogging with rod fellow think very little of will often walk back in autumn to same prison went from take flogging go to work a if nothing have happened be never flogged with plete for sort of thing be kept for murder heading mutiny in of official have be killed brigand be chiefly composed of long sentence men who have got away early who perhaps have killed cossack policeman who tried to arrest peasant who will not supply with food after dare not return so join band of brigand in order to be able to keep to wood through winter think that very few of men who have once served time be released ever come back again during winter food although still ample be le than allowance have received while working allowance of bread be reduced by pound day upon wednesday friday be fast day meat be issued except to engaged in chopping up firewood bringing in timber from forest leather glove be served out to men working in open air in spite of hand be frequently frost bitten evening must have be long indeed to godfrey have not be for tartar

swept down from northern mountain sent boat flying into port lake be one of deepest in world sounding in many place being over five thousand foot many river run into lake only outflow being by angara baikal be peculiar a being only fresh water lake in world where seal be found about two thousand being killed annually shore be in most place extremely steep precipice rising thousand foot sheer up from edge of water with sounding of hundred fifty fathom few yard from foot fish abound in lake sturgeon of large size be captured there godfrey knew that there be guard house with cossack on road between northern point of water steep mountain rise almost directly from have specially studied geography of region knew that after passing round head of lake there be track across hill by must after travelling hundred fifty mile strike main road from irkutsk to yakutsk near town of kirensk on river lena from kirensk must be little more than hundred mile to nearest point on angara be one of principal branch of yenesei to gain river must be great point lena be even nearer to head of lake baikal also flowed into arctic sea course be almost due north must be absolutely hopeless to endeavour to traverse whole of north coast of siberia angara yenesei on other hand flowed north west fell into arctic sea near western boundary of siberia when reached that point must be short distance from russia seemed to that only chance be by keeping by river in great range of mountain in north of siberia there must be mean of obtaining food to cross district must be certain death by river on other hand there must at least be fear of losing way journey must be shortened by using canoe if must obtain one if not raft must often find little native village hut by bank must be able to obtain fish from besides must catch fish might possibly even winter in native village for reason have determined on making for angara buying stock of dried fish at little fishing village on lake walked to within mile of head there slept for night started hour before daybreak passed cossack guard house unseen just a daylight be stealing over sky then went along merrily road be not much used great stream of traffic passing across lake baikal be in fair condition made good progress along long before luka have after several attempt made bow to satisfaction be formed of three four strip of tough wood firmly bound together with waxed twine having procured string wax at farmhouse on way there be one advantage in taking unfrequented route road between irkutsk tomsk be a godfrey have learned on outward journey frequented by band of brigand who have hesitation in killing a well a plundering wayfarer here be only likely to fall in with convict who have escaped from irkutsk from convoy along road be for most part perfectly harmless seeking only to spend summer holiday in freedom knowing that when winter came on must have to surrender of such men godfrey have fear gun companion bow arrow rendered too formidable to be meddled with until came down upon main road there be chance of meeting police officer cossack village be passed on journey godfrey therefore have longer hesitation in shooting squirrel frisked about among tree found a luka have said excellent eating although required three four of to furnish anything like meal soon however gave over shooting for found that luka be at least a certain with bow a be with gun with advantage that blunt arrow did not spoil skin a luka told be valuable must be able to exchange for food siberian squirrel furnishing highly prized fur day luka brought down at least dozen of little creature with dried fish cake made of flour afforded excellent food on way after four day walking across lofty plateau descended into cultivated valley before rose cupola of kirensk while along valley flowed lena a yet small river although must become mighty flood before reached sea nearly four thousand mile away must have to be crossed at kirensk sat down held long council a to how have best get through town agreed that must be done at night for in daytime certainly must have to produce passport there will not be much chance of meeting cossack policeman at one two o'clock in morning luka if there be about ought to be able to get past in dark if one stop can settle luka said tapping knife luka wo have bloodshed if can help though mean to be taken if fellow must stop ask question try to arrest will knock down then will make bolt for there be moon now will be dark a pitch so that if kick out lantern must be unable to follow if doe let fly one of blunted arrow at will hit quite hard enough though wo do serious damage of course if there be several of must fight in earnest be very unlikely will meet with even two men together at time of night accordingly went in among tree lay down did not move until heard church bell of distant town strike twelve then resumed journey keeping with difficulty along road once in valley became broader better kept at last approached bridge godfrey have have fear that there might be sentry posted here be pleased to find entirely deserted will take off shoe here luka tie with piece of string hang round neck will go noiselessly through town then while if go clattering along in heavy shoe policeman there may be in street will be on look out to see who be passed however through town without meeting policeman soldier street be absolutely deserted whole population seemed to be asleep once through town put on shoe again followed road for short distance then lay down under tree to wait for

spirit be true that real danger of journey have not yet begun so far everything have gone very much better than have anticipated have not thought there must be chance of recapture for knew that unless came into town russian took trouble about escaped convict convict with whom have spoken have agreed that there be little trouble in sustaining life in forest during summer for even if must not obtain food from peasant have only to carry off sheep at night from fold be why peasant be so ready to give one said say that be not sorry for real reason be know that if did not give must take instead of being harmless wanderer a call must be driven to become bandit still godfrey have anticipated much greater difficulty than have met with in fact up to present time have be simply delightful tramp through wood next part of journey must expected be le pleasant have large comfortable boat well adapted for navigation of river there must be no difficulty a to food for fish must be obtained in quantity grain be have heard from of tartar prisoner who knew portion of yenesei abundant extraordinarily cheap seated in stern of boat with paddle there be occasion to steer for mattered in way whether boat drove down river bow stern first at present be amusement to keep straight with occasional stroke with paddle luka sat on floorboard at bottom of boat set to work to manufacture from squirrel skin two fur cap of same pattern a worn by ostjaks godfrey have asked to do so in order that might be taken for member of tribe by anyone looking at from village on bank a to dress did not

will look like hair then if like can make two summer cap to put on when land to buy anything very well luka think idea be good one people do wear hair long close crop might excite attention be better than gold digging at kara be luka nodded good for man always to work said good to lie quiet sometimes know that care about lying quiet generally luka be pleasant to do so in boat be keeping look out for wild fowl must make pleasant change to fish diet not so far south a yenesei swarm with in winter in summer go north just before frost begin can shoot a many a like will be something to look

travelling almost due west yenesei ran north a floated down have have much conversation a to plan be now nearly end of august must not be long before winter be upon month yenesei must be frozen must be obliged to winter question be where must do so illustration spearing fish by torch light now be on yenesei luka be on native river though home be fully thousand mile higher up godfrey have at first proposed that must disembark here make way up bank home offer filled luka with indignation what be going to do without asked can talk little tartar quite enough to get on among people how must get on with ostjaks besides even if be to leave must rather die than do must not go to home for in native village must be at once arrested sent back to mine might live among other tartar what good must be must be stranger to why must leave who have be more than brother to to go among stranger wherever go will go with when get to own land will be servant can beat if like will not leave did not for sake strike down man in prison did not take with have not brought hither what must have done alone if be tired of shoot a long a live will not leave godfrey hastened to assure luka that have only spoken for good that be well aware that without must have little chance of getting through winter that nothing therefore be farther from thought than to separate from if be willing to remain be time before luka be pacified when at last saw that godfrey have intention whatever of leaving behind if be willing to go with recovered spirit entered into discussion a to where have better winter have never be below town of yeneseisk knew that ostjaks be to be found fully thousand mile below town especially on left bank of river below along right bank tungus yuraks be principal tribe be finally agreed that must keep on for at least eight hundred mile beyond yeneseisk then haul up boat camp at ostjak village there remain through winter will get at yeneseisk think ostjak will prize most knife bead for woman cheap trinket looking glass small hatchet too must probably be valued luka said ostjaks have told that kindred far down river be more like people to extreme north by sea be pagan there not like to south have reindeer draw sledge be very poor know nothing from can get fur can buy goat skin sheep skin at yeneseisk will have to depend upon for food godfrey said why can get food for ourselves luka said somewhat indignantly when cold begin before river freeze will get great quantity of fish will freeze hard last till spring then too river will be covered with bird will shoot a many a can of freeze too flour must take with flour be very cheap at yeneseisk corn will not grow there bring down in great boat from upper river how do get boat back luka get back break up for firewood firewood be dear at yeneseisk get much more for barge for fire than cost to build in forest higher up then how do do for fire among ostjaks have heard have wood fire kill seal there be number of farther down river from fat make oil for lamp burn will be in hurry a go down will float near bank may kill seal what be thinking of for godfrey be looking rather serious be thinking luka that thing be thinking of buying thing to trade with ostjaks know flour tea goat skin so on will take good deal of money spend much now when get into russia will want money ca beg way right across country luka said will not be

will weigh much will get someone to help down with have already gone over over again list of purchase to be made will drop down little nearer town luka when think be about time for to be coming back so wo have so far to carry thing be more than three hour whether have got anything not will begin to feel anxious about luka nodded went off godfrey paddled boat out short distance let down stone began to fish be under real uneasiness a to young tartar there be nothing about to distinguish from other native a must be about time arriving in considerable number at yeneseisk to sell skin of animal have taken in chase during summer to lay in store for winter be unlikely in extreme that anyone must even question such indeed be case there be number of native in store of russian trader made purchase without question being asked bought rather more hatchet knife trinket than have agreed upon two sack of flour although deemed latter to be luxury that must very well dispense with godfrey be just thinking of taking up anchor going down towards town when saw returning accompanied by two native carrying sack pulled up anchor paddled to shore have got everything luka asked everything powder

said in high spirit that everything be settled that for eight month at least there must not be slightest risk of meeting with russian policeman soldier hurrah for north luka for shooting adventure luka smiled be rarely laughed be always ready to smile when godfrey addressed air feel brisk cold to day will soon have winter upon yes look there luka said pointing into air ahead of what be look like long black streak goose luka said be flight of wild goose from north a approached godfrey saw that tartar be right solitary bird led way two followed closely then came rank after rank widening out till be broad band of fully fifty abreast line after line followed in almost military array extending in length fully quarter of mile why there must be thirty forty thousand of there exclaimed in amazement will see bigger flock than luka said why river from minusinsk down to turukhansk more than mile be well nigh covered with bird will have lack of meat presently during day many flight similar to first seen passed overhead larger containing only score two bird next day number be still larger whole battalion coming along almost incessantly be by mean confined to goose there be gull swan flock of small bird of many kind flight of wild duck latter for most part flying much lower than goose kept far overhead have better land to night luka said fly close after dark flock will settle on bank will shoot a come overhead may not see well be so thick that can hardly miss accordingly when evening came on landed fastened boat took couple of sheep skin to throw over shoulder for even in two day cold have sensibly increased lay down to await coming of bird day long air have be full of cry have grown quieter now though occasionally heard sharp cry of leader of flock followed by responsive note from bird following from time to time godfrey must hear whirring sound of multitude of wing a flock passed overhead became louder a time went on knew that be flying lower have loaded gun with heavy shot once twice be disposed to fire luka time stopped be much too high yet will come close down presently star be shining brightly godfrey must make out outline of goose a passed overhead presently there be sharp call few hundred yard higher up bank lot be coming low luka whispered be probably going to settle to feed get ready now godfrey lay with gun pointed upwards minute later heard rustling of wing rose to sound like mighty wind then forty yard overhead dark cloud of bird swept along across sky godfrey fired one barrel waited moment then fired again with loud cry of surprise alarm flock divided in two almost instantly there be several heavy thud on ground close by hurrah have got of godfrey said leaping up ran to collect fallen bird there be five of be grand exclaimed in delight will shoot more luka asked have a many a can eat luka for next three day at least must be waste of powder shot to kill more worse still must be waste of life be right to kill what require a food to mind there be nothing more wicked than taking life merely for amusement consider that must well deserve misfortune might happen to if be to kill one of god creature wantonly one of best poet have written 'he prayeth best who loveth best thing great small for dear god who loveth made loveth ' make furious sometimes luka when read book of what be called sport find men boasting of killing numerous creature merely for pleasure of killing feel that nothing must give greater pleasure than to flog such brute luka did not much understand outburst of indignation a usual grunted assent carrying bird returned to boat be freezing to night tartar said a stepped in will lay goose in bow beyond cover will be frozen by morning godfrey be glad of wrapping of warm fur night even when shook off looked out at sunrise be still so chilly that after have leaned over side of boat a usual sluiced head with water be glad to take paddle work hard for bit to keep warm get fire alight luka kettle on said cut up one of goose how be going to get feather off suppose will have to pluck singe must take much too long that can spare feather time so saying with knife made slight incision down breast bone then proceeded to tear off skin bit by bit feather be quick way godfrey said though doe improve bird appearance be trifle never mind bread will have to do without before long feel a hungry a hunter in very few minute fire be blazing portion of goose frizzling over in twenty minute meal be ready godfrey thought have never eaten anything nicer meat being much le rich than of tame goose did very well without bread for next three day made pause floating down night day stream varying in speed from five to ten mile hour at point where stream be most rapid paddled in towards bank to avoid wave raised by river in course light boat always floated easily over needed to be kept with head to godfrey be afraid that moment carelessness might bring broadside on to therefore preferred to glide along at somewhat slower rate near shore river be now mile half wide to left country be flat on right must see hill rising far above other one two small trading station be seen on right bank upon left passed only few cluster of ostjak yourts on right great pine forest came down in place to within short distance of river be rarely seen on left on fifth day after leaving yeneseisk saw small trading station on right bank godfrey who have got geography of river by heart judged to be peslovska because be one of few trading station be not situated at point where tributary stream ran into yenesei be far enough down now luka said be not more than two hundred mile from turukhansk will land at next ostjak hut come to see if be disposed to be friendly with will be friendly luka said confidently why not be peaceable people know did touch stranger must be punished there be russian soldier at turukhansk ostjaks be very poor have thing to give want nothing of twenty mile further saw group of seven hut on left bank ahead of paddling in landed close to three four canoe much smaller than own lay there a climbed lofty bank of ostjaks came out from hut what do want one of asked abruptly be

in hut at once came out be good old man who seemed to be leader of ostjaks said why must not stranger live here with hunt with if chooses will be welcome let help stranger whole of ostjaks at once set to work godfrey chose piece of level ground twenty thirty yard lower down than hut luka aided by of men carried various article out of boat while be doing woman stuck pole in ground round circle godfrey have traced lashed together in middle with strip of hide three large skin be placed against on northern side then woman paused have better buy more large skin if have got luka say that will give knife for hide enough to finish hut with knife be large one with rough handle strong blade when luka took one out from bundle said to chief will give knife for enough skin to finish hut gave order to wife two of other woman at once brought elk hide from pile lying by side of tent few stitch here there with needle made of sharp fish bone with thread of twisted gut fastened corner of hide

have idea must have made so comfortable will give cup of tea round luka a reward for labour care for sugar two pound bought at yeneseisk will come in useful now will think lot more of if be sweet see if have got big kettle little thing of ours will only hold couple of quart upon inquiry chief produced cauldron exhibited with great pride have evidently be used for melting down blubber luka carried down to water edge then scrubbed with sand until be tolerably clean then rubbed with wisp of coarse grass filled with water stood on fire that ostjaks have made from drift wood picked up from shore in hour water boiled put in two three handful of tea pound of sugar let boil for minute two then took pot off fire then invited ostjaks to dip in cup in of hut have few tin mug for expense risk of carriage of crockery rendered price prohibitive even tin mug be prized a among most precious possession luka godfrey also dipped in cup a act of civility latter made wry face when approached lip for odour of blubber be very strong took opportunity when none of ostjaks be looking to pour content of tin upon ground beside to ostjaks smell flavour of blubber be drawback men woman sat round fire drinking sweet liquor with great enjoyment evidently highly contented at coming of stranger among while be partaking of godfrey heard sound behind looking round saw boy driving in several reindeer be delighted at sight not only because promised hunting expedition because might aid to carry across frozen steppe to obi before frost broke up talking with ostjaks luka found that a temperature have be below freezing point day intended to commence fishing in next morning position of hut have be specially selected for purpose river made sharp bend just above point threw current across to opposite bank forming almost back water at spot where hut stood seemed strange to godfrey a lay down night to be without gentle motion of boat to have be so long accustomed lay awake for time not forgetting before went to sleep to thank god for wonderful success have so far attended to pray for continuance of protection a soon a be light boat put off anchoring short distance out be soon engaged in fishing godfrey put down four line with six of hook mikail have purchased for before starting from kara be baited with strip of fish luka be soon busy at work hauling in fish be mostly jack tench by evening have caught nearly hundred when rowed to shore found that have be far more successful than of ostjaks being due to superiority of hook over fish bone contrivance of native following example of ostjaks laid fish in line in front of tent to freeze during night after boiling kettle frying couple of fish taking supper lighted two torch again went out returning before midnight with twenty five salmon averaging fifteen pound by morning fish be frozen a hard a piece of wood be then laid in pile for four day work continued with equal success by end of time have pile of fish six foot square three foot high making godfrey calculated nearly ton of fish have observed that of ostjaks have morning brought in several wild goose swan luka learnt from that there be large marsh mile away in large flight of goose settled night accompanied by two of ostjaks started late in evening for spot when came near marsh must hear low chattering noise a bird fed on aquatic grass sometimes heard cry in air answered by call from feeding bird followed speedily by great rustling of wing a fresh flock alighted godfrey luka have brought with fox skin sat wrapped up in in spite of felt cold a waited hour after hour godfrey dozed off several time at last slept for three four hour be awakened by touch from luka low warning to keep silence morning be breaking found that ostjaks have built sort of shelter of bush have effect of breaking force of north wind of hiding from water fowl raising head cautiously saw before sheet of willow water be absolutely covered with goose few swan being seen here there luka have warned not to fire until ostjaks have shot arrow a sound of gun must at once scare whole flock edge of water be about forty yard away ostjaks luka have made hole through bush in front of so a to be able to shoot without exposing head moving gently godfrey found spot where must see through bough native be just ready to shoot there be three swan close to edge of water bow twanged almost together although knew how marvellous be shooting of ostjaks be nevertheless surprised at seeing that of bird be struck in head be thus killed instantly without slightest noise being made again again shot arrow brought down bird luka third arrow be le successful wounded bird on neck with loud cry of pain alarm flew flapping across pool in instant whole mass of bird rose on wing circling round round with loud cry native lying on back shot arrow after arrow into air in case transfixing goose have twelve arrow when be exhausted luka said now godfrey can fire godfrey waited until number of bird flew in mass over then discharged barrel five goose fell then whole vast flock flew away to north leaving lagoon entirely deserted save by floating body of dead companion arrow better than gun luka said a rose gun kill frighten away arrow keep on killing be true enough luka there be doubt bow be best for sort of work will manage better time bird be picked up twelve have fallen to of ostjaks luka have eleven godfrey five be heavy burden to carry back to hut godfrey luka share of bird be laid by pile of fish with exception of one luka proceeded to skin hang up while godfrey saw to fire put on kettle when have finished breakfast godfrey said will take three four hour sleep now luka then be going down to have look at marsh accordingly started at mid day godfrey made detour round lagoon hundred yard beyond on opposite side found clump of bush that thought must suit purpose with luka assistance cleared spot in middle large enough for to lie down on then returned to camp took next meal early then taking fur to make comfortable again started round lagoon be just sunset when got there spreading two three fox skin on ground throwing two over shoulder waited be scarcely dusk when first flock of goose passed close over head on way to lagoon luka discharged two arrow then godfrey fired two barrel into several fell flock scattered with wild scream after circling round round for time settled in lagoon quarter of hour passed then flock came along all night flock continued to arrive at short interval from godfrey brought down several luka arrow be soon exhausted godfrey continued firing until morning began to break then got up to see result of night shooting although seldom excited gave shout of pleasure ground around be thickly strewn with goose many be only wounded luka with short heavy stick soon put out of pain although not without several sharp chase then collected counted bird there be eighty four in night shooting luka larder will be full taking up six goose be a much a must carry returned to tent then set out again accompanied by boy girl of village time whole of goose be carried to hut be awful pity godfrey said a looked at great pile that have got anything must use for holding feather well will have picked anyhow can make thick layer of under skin for present when get downright cold can nestle in among somehow accordingly child be set to work to pluck bird be then left out to freeze in same way a fish night next day rested then have night shooting amount of success be a great a have attended first have plenty now to last well on into spring godfrey said a looked at great pile what be to be done next luka pour water over fish let freeze do keep better way luka yes not get so dry ostjaks have be astounded at success of visitor in fishing shooting godfrey now have conversation with chief offered to shoot supply of goose for native if must furnish companion with complete outfit of fur for winter chief at once agreed to a have large supply of fox skin in camp with exception of rarer sort be practically worthless for purpose of exchange godfrey made chief offer to give hatchet two knife six fish hook if must supply with a much seal flesh a might require during winter with blubber for lamp ostjaks have already killed good many seal pursuit of required time patience godfrey wanted to ensure supply for winter although luka told must have plenty of opportunity of getting seal then accordingly for next ten day shooting be continued at night godfrey luka sleeping during day leaving to young ostjaks to collect bring in bird cold daily increased godfrey began to feel much want of warmer clothing however on eighth day ostjaks brought in two suit be joint work of woman of village a ostjaks be greatly pleased at quantity of food coming in daily ensured sufficiency of meat throughout winter in addition to own stock of fish work be well done for closely fitting shirt have be made of squirrel skin have brought down with with fur inside trouser be of red fox skin with hair outside upper garment be long capote of same fur reaching down to ankle furnished with hood covering head face with exception of opening from eye down to mouth in addition to be given to a present pair of ostjak boot be large loose be made of goat skin rendered perfectly supple by grease rubbing with hair inside came up to thigh have thick sole made of layer of elk hide there be also for pair of sock of squirrel skin with hair inside pair of fingerless glove of double skin fur being inside out except in palm be of single skin with fur inside well if be cold enough to require godfrey said will be cold indeed will be awful walking about with surely one can never want fur in time godfrey found that be none too many for at thermometer in winter sometimes sink to degree below zero for time however found occasion to use capote fur shirt trouser boot being amply sufficient while fur cap with hanging tail kept neck ear perfectly warm already ice be thick on still reach of river beside hut stood although beyond shelter of point yenesei still swept along lagoon have be frozen over for day in spite of water being kept almost perpetually in motion by flock of water fowl ground be a hard a iron ostjaks be now for day employed in patching up hut preparing to withstand cold of winter immense pile of firewood have be collected on shore for bough of tree drift wood brought down by river often came into backwater be always drawn ashore however busied men might be at time in fishing through summer scrap of wood came within reach have be landed result be great pile must calculated with blubber have stored be sufficient to last through winter what will do if fuel must run short godfrey asked luka will cross frozen river with sledge to forest must either take hut down establish there must cut wood fill sledge bring over have be talking to on other side there be many russian village for post road be on side in summer carriage be drawn by horse in winter have reindeer people be very poor skin that make clothes with be poor animal be torn by dog injured be why must not sell red fox skin must have be worth two rouble if have be good merchant will give nothing for be injured say doe not pay for carriage so be glad to make up for do do with reindeer milk in summer in winter let to owner of post station of course when move use what want luka godfrey said after sitting quiet for time be more money if have that might hire sledge reindeer a soon a snow get on ground travel west of course there be tempting poor people to make such journey without money to pay well will go hunting presently luka said might get good fur sell yes see why must doubt many of russian peasant in village have gun if get skin why must great many skin come down year tartar said black fox be worth money fifteen twenty rouble ermine be worth money lot of in wood well must hope for best if can get enough for to take across to obi ought to be able to coast round in canoe to archangel think must do from river in one season ice doe not break up till june begin to form again in october can only rely upon three open month doubt whether must get in time from yenesei however be of use bothering about now fortnight frost be so severe that ice extended almost across river heavy fall of snow covered everything a soon a be deep enough godfrey luka followed example of ostjaks raised high wall of encircling tent to keep off bitter north wind then weather changed again wind set in from south drenching rain fell at end of two three day ice on river have disappeared be not long before winter set in more bitterly than before ground became covered with snow to depth of upwards of three foot river froze right across wall round tent be rebuilt godfrey fashioning wooden shovel from plank found among drift wood ostjaks took to snow shoe godfrey fashioned for luka two pair of runner such a have seen in use near st petersburg be about five foot long by a many inch wide slightly turned up at end strap be nailed across under foot went end be turned up by damping wood holding over fire string being fastened tightly from end to end so a to keep wood bent when be completed practised with steadily found that a soon a surface of snow hardened must get along upon at good pace on level ground completely distancing ostjaks on broader snow shoe ostjaks evidently admired greatly be too much wedded to own custom to adopt godfrey be so warmly clad that felt cold little eye however suffered from glare of snow at once adopted spectacle be made for by ostjaks be shape of goggles made of skin with hair on narrow slit being cut in slit being partly covered with hair so shielding eye from glare of snow be fastened on by leathern strap tied at back of head ostjaks seldom wore be used by samoyede kindred tribe dwelling generally farther north though many of at time came down even a far a yeneseisk early in ostjaks prepared for hunting expedition men since be confined to hut by snow have be busy in manufacturing trap of various kind getting sledge into order on large sledge be to be drawn by three reindeer be placed skin necessary for forming tent on be piled store of provision be chopped out from frozen mass by hatchet on smaller sledge be placed trap quantity of coarser kind of frozen fish a food for dog have be settled that godfrey luka must accompany have contributed liberally from store of goose fish added to load on reindeer sledge kettle frying pan parcel of tea tobacco when be ready three reindeer be harnessed to large sledge one to of three small sledge soon after daybreak on th of november started ostjaks being anxious to be off for weather again showed sign of breaking might be month before river be permanently frozen for winter six ostjaks including chief formed with godfrey luka hunting party others remained behind to look after rest of reindeer a be necessary to keep space clear from snow to enable to get at grass must too continue fishing keeping hole broken in ice catching fish by torch light men walked with sledge only went at walking pace across river route be easy surface of snow being crisp hard be hard work mounting opposite bank be exceedingly steep reindeer pulled well at difficult point men aided short distance from bank crossed post road in half hour be in forest godfrey have already be told that must travel for several day before began to hunt a villager with gun scared wild animal from forest in neighbourhood there be difficulty in travelling through forest for pine tree stood generally at distance apart there be little growth of underwood day kept steadily on when evening came cut young pole erected tent lit fire in centre by time godfrey have become accustomed to smoke escaped from top of tent by hole couple of goose be cut up broiled over flame cake baked in frying pan pipe be lighted lay down in circle with foot to fire for three more day journey be continued then a several track have be seen in snow halted prepared for hunt method be simple men scattered in several direction when struck upon recent track followed up man took with dog certain amount of provision box of match from godfrey store large skin to wrap in at night sometimes a godfrey found track have to be followed long distance before came up to animal always travelled in zigzag course hunting about for white mouse other prey sometimes be found to have taken to hole then trap be set to catch when came out animal be principally ermine one two sable be considerably larger with much more valuable skin marten be taken all belong to weasel family upper part of ermine being brown in summer like most animal in near arctic zone changing into pure white in winter with exception of tail remains black a in summer ermine be little larger than english ferret while sable marten be size of large polecat when ostjaks came up with knocked on head with club shot through head be then carefully skinned body being thrown to dog for food have be agreed that animal caught must be divided godfrey felt that be doing little for be unable to shoot a must have damaged skin however aided in tracking down in setting trap when traced to hole once twice came up with killed one with club occasionally shot squirrel little animal coming out from nest in hole in tree at sound of footstep curiosity costing dear after remaining four day at spot tent be pulled down packed up advanced two day journey into forest chapter xiii hunting at end of fortnight one of ostjaks started with large sledge for hut taking with skin have be collected have mounted up to considerable number ostjaks considering luck to have be extraordinary putting down in great degree to white companion for whom began to have almost superstitious respect since way have supplied village with food for winter seemed to almost miraculous reindeer with light sledge must accomplish return journey in two day with ease although distance have taken five day on way out be to return with fresh supply of provision especially for dog night after sledge have left dog barked fiercely for time slept in tent of ostjaks made pillow of others allowed to lie upon helped to keep tent warm din when began barking be prodigious what be about godfrey shouted in luka ear think must be bear luka shouted back why let dog out must drive bear away be too dark to see to shoot in morning will follow track dog presently ceased barking with low growl lay down again a soon a be light ostjaks turned out found great footmark round tent before starting from hut godfrey have exchanged head of fishing spear for iron spear head have purchased loading gun with ball godfrey with luka four of ostjaks started in pursuit taking six of dog sledge with on long runner must soon have left ostjaks behind luka translated warning that must keep together for a there be two bear must be dangerous to attack in lesser number in about hour arrived at dense thicket be evident that be lair of bear until took up permanent winter quarter in hollow tree dog be urged to attack must not be persuaded to enter far confining to barking fiercely how be going to get at godfrey asked ostjaks consulted together then collected dry pine needle twig two of went to windward side of thicket made fire upon a soon a be fairly alight threw dead leaf mixed with snow if be to light bush must drive out quicker than smoke godfrey said not good not good luka said earnestly once catch fire big flame run through forest burn mile mile did not think of godfrey said must be foolish trick however smoke have desired effect in minute two two bear burst out on other side growling angrily dog rushed at barking loudly taking care to keep at safe distance from paw bear raised on haunch ostjak bow twanged godfrey fired one of bear rolled over other charged at assailant godfrey fired second barrel then dropping gun grasping spear stood ready to meet charge bear did not reach for a rose on hind leg ostjaks luka again shot arrow bear rolled over dead two animal be placed on sledge reindeer harnessed ostjaks taking rope to aid with heavy burden returned to tent have scarcely reached when one of other hunter returned with news that have come upon track of elk bear be at once dragged into tent entrance securely fastened to prevent passing wolf ounce from tearing then taking with time dog three sledge started in hour came to where chief remaining follower be awaiting came along here yesterday afternoon chief said to luka there be one big stag one young one three female after three hour walking came to spot where snow be much trampled there be mark of animal having lain down be where slept chief said be travelling south will probably stop to feed before have gone far may catch then ordered one of men to stop with sledge rest proceeded onwards illustration godfrey brings down elk not word be spoken now a went took greatest pain not to brush against branch twig ostjaks be now walking fastest godfrey have to exert to keep up with footfall be so light a to be scarce audible after two hour travelling saw opening among tree here young pine be growing thickly chief pointed significantly towards godfrey understood that animal must probably be feeding there now went slowly chief whispered order that be to make circle round opening close round on other side a noiselessly a possible must enter thicket from side on now be crackling of pine twig must drive out on other side very quietly worked round took up station standing behind fir tree then waited must hear stamping of heavy hoof occasional breaking of twig presently there be louder more continuous sound of breaking bush then with sudden rush great elk followed by four others burst out of thicket a came along ostjaks stepped out from hiding place let fly deadly arrow leading elk came close to tree behind godfrey be standing a passed fired barrel hitting just behind shoulder elk ran few pace then fell three out of other four have be brought down by ostjak arrow young male escaped satisfaction of ostjaks be great for here in addition to value of skin be food for dog for time to come man be at once sent back for sledge while waiting for rest set out on various track of ermine have passed on way three of marten be killed before sledge came up big elk be placed on one sledge one of female on of others fourth be skinned cut up divided among three sledge lightly a sledge ran over snow men be obliged to harness to rope to assist deer be late in evening before arrived at hut fire be lighted at once godfrey undertook cooking while rest skinned bear elk cut up hung up carcass on bough beyond reach of dog have grand feast off offal while men be regaling with fresh elk steak for two month hunting be continued with much success then ostjaks said must return home godfrey however be anxious to continue hunting have small tent have be made for luka ostjak leader offered to leave one of sledge with six dog have be trained to draught work a soon a ostjaks have started on return journey tent store of provision fur be packed in sledge fresh start made a have be in present position for over week a went along two of pole be arranged so that made deep groove in snow by must find way back to starting point two day journey took into hilly country established in sheltered valley made that centre from hunted be now twelve day journey from yenesei well beyond range of ordinary hunting party have soon reason to congratulate on entering more mountainous country for here game be much more abundant than have be before dog have by time become attached to for godfrey be fond of animal have petted in manner to be quite unaccustomed from ostjak master one of especially young dog have taken regularly to accompany godfrey when hunting found animal of greatest utility a be able to follow back track with undeviating certainty be of importance for there be short twilight twenty four hour sun being below horizon except for hour two at noon be obliged to carry torch while following track of smaller animal ermine be found in considerable number in first week four fine sable be killed a well a two marten bear latter be specially prized have brought fortnight provision for dog be anxious to eke store out a long a possible a must no longer depend upon getting fresh supply from home body of ermine be mouthful for one of dog while sable marten gave mouthful round bear however contained large quantity of excellent food setting aside ham for own consumption hung up rest of meat on tree to serve out gradually among dog soon found however that need be under anxiety a to food a fox abounded principally red though two of valuable black fox fell to godfrey gun found many path in wood completely trodden down by animal here used ostjak method of catching putting up screen of branch across track looking at object with suspicion animal invariably refused to try to jump over crawl through went round at one end other here accordingly trap be fixed many animal be taken intense a cold be godfrey felt even le than have anticipated wide spreading wood broke force of wind while must sometimes see top of tree swaying beneath force scarcely felt breath below luka knew nothing of esquimaux fashion of making snow hut said have never heard of among ostjaks samoyede at of halt however godfrey piled snow high over low tent of reindeer skin have got woman to make for according to own plan resembled tent d'abri shelter tent seven foot long a much wide be permanently closed at one end have flap crossing other at entrance instead of depending entirely upon two upright ridge pole between godfrey when erecting put eight ten pole on side stretching from ridge out to side of tent so a to support skin under snow piled over bottom be covered with thick mat of fur side be lined with others be hung across entrance so that cold be effectually kept out large fire be kept burning in front of tent from from time to time red ember be taken out placed in cooking pot inside at night two three lamp fed by oil melted down from fat of animal killed be kept alight in way lying snugly in sleeping bag felt perfectly warm comfortable although temperature outside be from forty to fifty degree below zero dog slept outside with exception of one of godfrey have made special pet being allowed to share tent with high bank of snow be erected on side of entrance to tent served further to break force of wind to retain reflect back heat of fire dog therefore being provided with good supply of meat from proceeds of chase did very well one afternoon sky be very thick overcast luka said thought that be going to have snow in case luka godfrey said will set to work to make thing comfortable if there be heavy fall might be almost buried here ordinarily be sheltered if there be wind can see that be blowing now might drift very deep in hollow might find completely snowed up think tent be strong enough to stand pressure doe not contain much air will cut down strong pole lay side by side across snow wall in front of tent smoke will find way out through if deep snow come on will save dog from being snowed up besides will give lot of additional air may want two three hour will do time wo be thrown away anyhow for branch cut off pole will do for firewood snow flake began to fall just a finished work result being sort of flat roofed shelter with snow wall ten foot long six foot high in front of tent large quantity of firewood be piled up at entrance to shelter be capital idea luka godfrey said a retired into tent can sit with entrance of tent open now if like get benefit of fire outside for air having to pas close by on way to get comparatively warm when went out to build up fire for last time before lying down snow be falling steadily be already deep in front of entrance to shelter dog have be well fed lay thickly clustered round fire evidently greatly contented with unusual luxury of roof over godfrey crawled into tent again closed flap hung up skin before getting into sleeping bag lay there comfortably smoking pipe talking to luka be a snug here a if be in palace luka must not like to be caught out in wood to night have ever heard of of ostjaks samoyede being frozen to death must be frozen if have hatchet match with replied can always chop down branch make hut fire in middle to keep warm then snow come cover up keep out wind out on plain man might get frozen if stupid ought never to be if knew what to do must look for hollow where snow have drifted deep then make hole in side of drift crawl in ought to be quite warm there if fur be good often get lost never go very far from hut when snow in sky directly come on must make for home can always get along in snow shoe isvostchiks be often frozen in st petersburg in sledge at night godfrey said ca build hut in town luka remarked ca find snow deep enough to get into town not good in winter be there many wolf here luka do often attack people there be plenty of game in wood in russia game now so hear be scarce so wolf must take to eating men here there be plenty of game so often attack people have heard of hunter going out never coming back again then people say wolf eat not often so may be killed by elk hurt by falling tree climb hill fall down think be often wolf wolf great coward be glad to hear have heard howl sometimes at night wondered whether must come way not come here luka said decidedly keep plenty of big fire beast afraid of fire then have got dog gun much easier for wolf to attack elk even that seldom do unless be wounded have injured well think will go off to sleep pipe be out hot tea have made sleepy after sleeping for hour godfrey awoke with strange feeling of oppression outside must hear dog whimpering wake up luka said be very close in here fancy snow must have drifted very deep covered up completely let get up see about be quite dark outside except that ember of fire threw dull red light on snow shelter seemed former dimension snow have drifted in at entrance lay in bank piled up to roof bring spear luka mine shove up between pole must make few hole up through snow if can to let little air in spear be pushed up then worked little to fro to try to enlarge hole be eight foot long godfrey did not feel at sure that penetrated through cover of snow however when have made dozen of hole there be distinct change in air have gone nearly through if not quite anyhow be near enough to surface for air to find way out now have better set to work at once to dig passage out be one advantage of shelter there be place to throw snow back into going down on hand knee soon scraped snow away until reached entrance to shelter here snow weighted by pressure above be much denser harder must cut out block with hatchet now godfrey said must make tunnel sloping upwards must be a steep a can so that be able to climb up making step to give foothold will begin for only just want wide enough for one will hand block down to a cut pile regularly along side here a fill shelter up must drive dog back into tent will want inch of room for snow before get out for hour worked steadily taking by turn to cut to pile last four foot be much more difficult than first snow being lighter le packed falling in upon a dug once luka be completely buried godfrey have to haul back by leg atmosphere inside however improved a got upwards being able to penetrate between particle of light snow be six hour before struggled out followed by dog in impetuous rush took couple of hour to clear away beat down snow sufficiently to make easy entrance to shelter fire be lighted outside meal cooked for lamp be quite sufficient to keep tent sufficiently warm must have be well nigh stifled with smoke have attempted to light fire in shelter snow be still falling drifting sky showed sign of change entrance will fill up again by to morrow luka said will have more trouble than ever to get out must provide against luka must build sort of roof over entrance here then will only have to start from point again let set to work chop down pole at once after three hour more work cover be built over entrance roofed with pine branch so a to prevent snow from drifting in now luka there be one more job unfortunately long one must do that must get snow that have packed in shelter below out of way for if by chance passage fell through must have nowhere to pile snow besides may have passage a deep a present one to dig to morrow for snow be drifting down in cloud have deepened couple of foot since began to make roof over entrance luka who be always ready to work set to cheerfully short twilight have faded into deep darkness before work be completed if have have couple of good shovel with luka must have made short work of godfrey said a retired below into tent must do a much work in hour a one can in five with tool be heart breaking to shovel out snow with hatchet be a tired a dog be harder work than gold mine at kara by long way yes luka said there be man with gun make difference luka be free work other be not that one can call exactly free when have choice to do for four day snow continued to fall a wind have dropped snow no longer drifted work morning be comparatively easy wish must stop godfrey said for begin to want food for dog stock of dried fish have be exhausted since be shut up there be deer hanging to branch of tree close to tent be eight ten foot below snow a ca calculate exact position now must be big job to try to get at there be however change in aspect of weather on following morning luka announced that beyond tea handful two of flour there be nothing whatever for breakfast while dog have fasted on previous day well luka there be nothing to do to try get at venison have be thinking that will be easiest to try from below be much quicker work chopping out solid snow than be trying to make hole in loose stuff at surface tree be just about in line with front of tent be hung deer on branch stretched out nearly a far a tent must say hung about half way along branch not above twelve foot from tent luka agreed a to position very well then a know exactly direction a distance be twelve foot ought not to take very long to chop out passage just big enough high enough for one to crawl through when get near place where think be must make tunnel good bit higher for bottom of meat be quite five foot from ground so that must be well out of reach of dog now will go first will will begin luka said must make passage wide enough to push snow past a get down certainly must luka make pretty wide at bottom make top arched so a to stand pressure from above be easy enough work at first became more difficult foot advanced a one behind have to crawl backward time with snow that one at work passed back to at last tunnel be driven twelve foot long last four foot have be given upward direction by mean le snow have to be removed than must have be case have bottom remained level with ground height be increased be good twelve foot in now luka certainly high enough way do think have better try luka replied by calling one of dog taking with to end of tunnel animal at once began to snuff about eagerly then to scratch violently to right will do luka said pushing back past taking place have driven foot in direction in dog be scratching when hatchet struck something hard required care to dig round meat make hole large enough for luka to stand up beside cut cord by hung dog yelped with joy when dragged back to other end of passage fire be made now in passage under roof have made at end of first day work for outside snow fell so fast that damped fire greatly a smoke made way out through entrance be inconvenience to below good sized piece of raw meat be chopped off given to of dog ramrod be thrust through large piece held by luka over fire then godfrey carried rest of joint outside placed in fork of tree smell good luka said a returned to fire wish must attract bear luka shook head bear be asleep godfrey be hunted in summer sometimes may be found in early part of winter never when snow be deep must die of hunger there might be wolf want wolf skin fetch very little flesh be only good for dog want wolf must be on guard in such weather a food be very scarce might come attack yesterday heard howl once twice think when have done breakfast will be better to take meat down below why must smell a much a cooked meat luka be not thinking of if come may want mean might besiege luka yes shut up here wolf very patient wait long time when scent food well will have dog sleep up here for future will act a sentry there be none too much air down there that reminds will cut long pole two fasten together try drive down through snow to roof of shelter below luka shook head might drive down five six foot must never get down to roof if did must never pull up again know luka once saw driving down bar in tough clay when be making railway cutting at home think might do in same way godfrey after breakfast cut pole chopping off just below where two three small branch have shot from leaving bulge bulge shaped smoothed very carefully with knife so that be in form of peg top there said see be thicker here than be anywhere else so that hole make will be little larger than pole instead of snow holding pole way down will touch only on shoulder succeeded admirably be six foot long have cleared away loose snow to depth of eighteen inch holding be able to force pole down a much more then hammered with billet of wood until only foot showed then spliced to working up down jumped in until must again use mallet at last struck on something solid must only be one of beam forming roof of hut godfrey went below soon discovered spot where pole came down with knife managed to clear away snow round then went up assisted luka to withdraw pole left hole of about three inch in diameter be capital chimney said now will throw few fir branch over to prevent dog treading here shutting up think air look rather lighter luka that storm be nearly over there be howl again be afraid that be going to have trouble with wolf be there anything can do luka shook head might get up into tree said must be safe there then must lose dog must never do luka must have to haul sledge back hundred fifty mile will tell what will do will cut down young tree block up tunnel with beam leaving three four inch between to fire through use spear be very good plan luka said must be quite safe then took hour work to carry out idea middle of tunnel be closed by row of pointed stake four inch in diameter driven deep into snow reaching up to roof of shelter opening of foot wide be left in middle stake being placed beside in readiness to fill up if required operation be completed by light of fire a be pitch dark by time be done then meal be cooked eaten brand carried below where at bottom of descent fire be now kindled dog have for time be growling angrily in upper passage fire be sooner alight below than broke into chorus of fierce barking have better bring down here luka fill up opening think wolf must be gathering in number going up again sent dog down firmly lashed two cross bar to others to lashed pole have left in readiness thus completing grating across tunnel a worked smoke from fire below curled up round few month before godfrey must have found almost insupportable by time have like native become so accustomed to that affected very little still said to luka have better break off hot end of stick so a to have red fire only for present smoke make eye water so can scarcely see now sooner fellow come to get first lesson better kneeling by grating with gun in hand spear beside godfrey gazed out must presently distinguish outline of number of moving figure can see eye at entrance said will give shot will send arrow into fire luka replied bow make noise gun will frighten besides have only twenty arrow must get broken better keep till there be need godfrey levelled gun be charged with buck shot fired barrel terrific yell howl followed opening be clear in moment though godfrey must see two three dark figure on snow there be sound of whimpering snarling then of fierce fight outside illustration slaughtered wolf be killing eating wounded luka said when have done that will come again let get close up next time in few minute entrance to tunnel be darkened again then cleared dead wolf have be pulled away quarter of hour animal reappeared a be silent gradually approached godfrey must hear panting presently heard noise against bar moment later there be rush outburst of snarling growl then luka drove spear again again between bar yell of pain following stroke animal in front be unable to retreat others behind crowded in upon maddened with smell of blood trying to get first at prey quarrelled fought among while cry growl be answered by furious barking of dog in shelter below in two three minute godfrey who have reloaded gun fired barrel into mass at flash sound wolf again fled time did not venture to re enter passage occasionally one showed be instantly shot by godfrey luka who took turn on watch throughout night a soon a dim light broke removed bar issued out with dog dozen wolf lay dead outside bar seven be scattered round entrance godfrey shot two more who be lurking under tree while luka sent arrow through there be plenty of about still godfrey said let get three four of dead one upon branch out of reach a food for dog drag rest away from entrance to tunnel bring others up from below will give with three have shot now enough for big meal then must think must move off be accordingly done went below cooked breakfast while dog feasted on dead wolf then lay down for three hour sleep when went up again dead wolf have disappeared only few bone blood marked snow showing where have lain godfrey fired couple of shot to scare away might be lingering in neighbourhood then replacing bar went out hunting from time heard farther of wolf continued hunting shifting camp occasionally until be time to rejoin ostjaks then travelled east struck river thirty mile below camp crossed at once travelled up other side until arrived at hut be heartily welcomed by native remained there for three day to rest dog be very glad of getting supply of fish again ostjaks have in abundance a kept frozen pile for food when keenness of wind rendered cold so bitter that be forced to remain in hut at other time fished by torch light at hole that kept broken in ice spearing fish be attracted by light ostjaks be surprised at large number of skin of of most valuable kind godfrey have brought back be impatient for fresh start be time absent for only six week returning at beginning of may hunt be marked by adventure did fairly well be not fortunate in securing skin of black fox few of sable upon return fur have be taken during two hunt with ostjaks be fairly divided godfrey added luka share to have obtained there be over fifty in including three black fox six sable ten marten rest being of inferior value then list be made of necessary that luka be to purchase at turukhansk included ten pound of brick tea copper nail if must obtain store of ammunition more fish hook largest kettle must buy frying pan few pound of sugar ten pound of salt stout sheeting thirty yard of duck canvas three block coil two of rope needle twine saw couple of chisel other tool must make best bargain can for skin luka have idea how much be worth ostjaks be however able to tell price trader pay for skin of animal provided that be fine specimen in good condition black fox be worth from fifty to hundred rouble sable from thirty to fifty marten ten rouble other skin be worth from fifteen to thirty rouble took sledge reindeer started alone having gone over list of thing required again again until godfrey be convinced that be perfect took sleeping bag tent calculated that must be away five day a must take two to drive to turukhansk day there to make purchase on fifth evening returned with everything have be ordered to get few other thing that thought must be useful have obtained in six hundred fifty rouble a result of six month hunting of have expended hundred seventy rouble be well set up for money now luka godfrey said a added note to before possessed have still four hundred rouble out of what received from buriat so have now nearly nine hundred will be enough to pay way to england from point may land at chapter xiv break up of winter spring be rapidly approaching now occasionally for day two southerly wind set in rain fell in torrent then again arctic current prevailed everything be frozen a hard a before flock of goose passed over flying north returned again when cold set in afresh small bird too in great number made appearance crowding on patch of ground that sun rain have cleared of snow fluttering round tent in flock picking up scrap of food have be thrown out keeping dog in state of perpetual excitement ostjaks said that break up of ice might come day might be delayed for month depended le upon weather here than on higher up be not sun rain break up ice rise of river from snow melting thousand mile higher up over country drained by river running into yenesei woman be now making canoe under godfrey instruction have often gone out in canoe on severn on sea when staying at watering place there craft have done such good service before must not do for present undertaking required boat must be fairly fast sea worthy yet light for might be necessary to carry considerable distance be necessary that dimension must exceed of english canoe for must carry considerable amount of food although of course meant to depend chiefly on fishing line gun be made five twenty foot long three foot wide central compartment be thirteen foot long be covered in at side end leaving opening for to sit paddle fifteen inch wide five foot long underneath covered part provision fur cooking utensil c must be stowed away on side leaving room for to lie down at full length in centre two end compartment be entirely covered in have opening over cover be lashed must if necessary be used for holding store godfrey did not intend to put anything here except temporarily a be important that canoe must be a buoyant light a possible frame of boat be built of tough elastic wood of ostjaks made bow be very light rib being bound to longitudinal piece by fine gut be built a nearly a godfrey must lay out on line of english cruising canoe deck strip be similarly lashed when framework be completed godfrey tested strength by dropping three foot to ground rolling over over trying in variety of way when fully satisfied with work of putting on cover commenced be made of very soft well tanned reindeer hide stretched a tightly a possible then rubbed with seal oil keel of boat have be made very strong a rigidity of whole craft depended upon have be made flat skin have be taken over when be finished false keel six inch in depth in centre tapering away to nothing at end be fixed underneath keel be also made of tough wood little more than quarter of inch thick widening suddenly to over inch where touched boat in order that might be securely fixed with screw to keel inside boat be provided with light mast must be stepped unstepped at pleasure there be two stay of twisted one fastening to side of boat iron ring with cord travelled up down mast halliard running through small block a luka have be able to obtain sheave at sail be lug made of sheeting oiled boat carried beside triangular sail of very much smaller dimension stouter cloth for heavy weather also carried small mizzen mast sail in rough weather cockpit must be completely covered with light apron with opening where rower sat with sort of collar must be lashed tightly round waist edge of apron must be lashed down over gunwale round cockpit when completed canoe with mast sail weighed sixty pound must be carried with ease by one person on shoulder ostjaks greatly admired craft be entirely different from anything have ever seen false keel puzzled greatly godfrey explanation even when aided by luka failed altogether in making understand that must have effect of enabling craft to sail near wind without drifting to leeward additional draught of water be inconvenience whatever in craft designed for sea added materially to strength of canoe on th of may be freezing hard native going down to water edge in morning reported sudden rise of three foot in river continued to rise day by be fifteen foot above former level in evening north wind dropped suddenly hour later sprang up from south by midnight torrent of rain be falling godfrey must hear sound like report of cannon above pattering of rain on skin knew that must be ice breaking in morning when looked out whole mass of ice seemed to be moving black crack showed everywhere across white surface river have during night risen twenty foot by mid day scene be wild one indeed no longer be surface smooth hurrying along at rate of fifteen mile hour great mass of ice be dashed against other by force of current two mile lower down river narrowed suddenly here block be formed of piece of ice be thrust down others climbed over thrusting one on top of other till ridge thirty forty foot high be formed from bank to bank at time gave way then whole be whirled down stream while ridge at once commenced to form godfrey walked down to point stood for hour looking at scene great block of ice six eight foot thick seemed almost to be endowed with vitality a climbed one above other until thrust off crest of ridge by pressure of behind din be prodigious crackling rustling roaring sound with sharp explosion deep muffled booming whole air seemed to quiver with sound loudest shout must have be inaudible yard two away below ridge river so long a barrier stood be comparatively clear from time to time great mass of ice have be sunk by pressure swept along under ridge came to surface with surge lifted one end high out of water reminding godfrey of spring of enormous fish then ice must come down with mighty splash hasten away reeling rocking on rapid current entranced by mighty conflict of force of nature godfrey stood there until seven eight o'clock in evening must be light for three hour yet for sun now only sank for short time below horizon rain be still falling heavily when returned to river have risen thirty foot since evening before height of bank have decreased from hundred foot to about thirty for two more day rained incessantly river have now risen to high water mark ten foot below bank godfrey asked ostjaks if there be fear of overflowing told that there be cause for uneasiness for at present point overflowed at many place above below extended over vast tract of country at additional foot must spread so widely that must speedily begin to fall again ridge have now ceased to form although river be still packed with floating mass in two day ostjaks chief said ice will be gone except few block much of ice above be carried out by flood left to melt on land a water lower even without that river at present rate must soon carry down godfrey must well imagine for at rate of fifteen mile hour over three hundred sixty mile of river must have be emptying daily at end of three day few block of ice be visible godfrey now began to make preparation for start first canoe be to be tried be taken down placed in water side under half deck be filled in with frozen goose fish from pile be still little affected by thaw when be thus brought down to nearly weight must have to carry godfrey luka took place in dipped paddle in stream shot out paddled about for time in still water behind shelter of point godfrey found to satisfaction that paddled easily quite answering to expectation then luka who have already practised manoeuvre on shore stepped mast fastened stay hoisted sail there be light breeze from south boat ran rapidly along before till be again abreast of village then be put about made short tack in dead water godfrey found that stood stiffly up to canvas a far a must see made little leeway then returned to village ostjaks who seldom made use of sail then only when dead before wind be perfectly astounded alike at rapidity with boat glided through water at ease with came about be astonished beyond measure at seeing make zigzag progress in teeth of wind early next morning rest of preparation be completed tea tobacco cooking utensil other necessary be stowed away under deck astern of godfrey together with twenty pound of fat have be carefully set aside for purpose when animal be killed cut up have be melted down in chief large pot poured into tin drinking mug in four strand of unravelled cord have be placed to act a wick tin be dipped in ice water in few minute fat solidified then tin be dipped again time in hot water short fat candle with four wick then came easily out process be repeated candle weighed just about pound godfrey collected fat enough to make fifty being afraid of overburdening canoe decided that twenty must suffice believing that must be able to pick up drift wood a coasted along store of pine wood torch be lashed on deck on side of mast forward of luka fishing spear hatchet other article for trade stowed away fur winter garment laid thickly at bottom of boat took with jack godfrey favourite dog then bestowing rest of possession on ostjaks took hearty farewell of stepped on board started have at last moment decided to take old boat also with be fastened by tow rope behind canoe be filled with frozen provision having be first lined with rough fur others be laid closely over in way godfrey calculated that must remain frozen for long time rest of store of flour stock of firewood be added a to extra weight of towing canoe be immaterial a until reached mouth of river there must be occasion for paddling beyond that stock of provision must be transferred to own canoe to take place of used up on way craft must then be cast adrift a there be light breeze however sail be hoisted rather because gave steerage way than for increase to speed a soon a canoe shot out into rougher water in full force of stream godfrey be still more delighted with boat empty compartment fore aft rendering exceedingly buoyant have be built with somewhat higher side than canoe godfrey have seen at home rose good deal towards end floated a lightly a cork on surface of water afternoon passed turukhansk below river widened out in evening lowered sail a did not wish to run risk of striking shore piece of ice might have got delayed on journey night hurried on lying snugly in bottom of boat with apron closed overhead in morning found be not far from left bank that river now be more than four mile wide sail be again hoisted breakfast made after got out line hook baited dropped into water during course of day caught several fish picked up considerable quantity of floating wood stowed in large canoe think luka godfrey said that instead of letting old boat go may a well keep for time a long a there be wind make great difference to speed though of course must be heavy if be paddling if have bad weather must land turn bottom upwards there must be hut ready made for canoe be right for sleeping in when water be smooth with deep keel must not sleep in ashore luka be a usual quite of godfrey opinion after made old boat kitchen for there be little room in canoe for cooking purpose be moreover relief to get into roomy craft where must move about a pleased a drift wood be abundant made fire entirely of keeping candle for time when might have to leave store boat behind on third day river widened out greatly must no longer see right bank godfrey concluded that be now in gulf of yenesei weather be going to change luka said next morning wind will soon be coming from north going to blow hard in case luka sooner be ashore better current now be nothing like so swift a be think be going past land at more than three mile hour must be quite enough if wind come from north to knock up nasty sea in time let get paddle out there be not breath of wind in hour reached shore have to coast along for time before found place free of rock will do luka be not minute too soon puff just now be so strong that made way against now then jump out get canoe high dry have retained long boot stepped out into water up to knee then lifted canoe carried ashore be heavier than be when put in luka said must think so what with fur provision candle one thing there must be hundred fifty pound weight in there put down here luka let get other up must take thing out first quick man wind be getting up fast be cold will want fur jacket on directly firewood provision be carried up distance above water edge then boat be lifted placed beside thick sleet have now set in wind be blowing with tremendous gust now then look about luka see if can find sheltered nook will pile stone into well of canoe so a to anchor safely if be to be rolled over over skin must soon be cut to piece before have finished luka returned good place here said good shelter will finish job first luka be much more important than getting wet a soon a be done went to large canoe lifting carried away to place luka have found ridge of rock running back at right angle from shore with perpendicular face twelve foot high at one point there be deep cleft in eight foot wide at mouth narrowing gradually in capital luka will be a snug a possible here now turn over take in cleft be so deep that stern of boat be when be laid down bow foremost fully fifteen foot inside entrance now may blow a much a like godfrey said wo hurt here now do go get of firewood will fetch skin from canoe sail after getting out provision cooking utensil couple of candle godfrey returned to boat then made journey for more skin two sail by time wind be blowing so fiercely that must scarcely stagger along with load sea be covered with white head wave be breaking noisily against rock luka have already brought up plenty of firewood have thrown large skin over fur containing frozen fish piled stone on to prevent being blown away now where will put fire asked if put inside must burn boat if put outside must be no good to quite see that luka must make ourselves comfortable for storm may last for day for anything know must prop end of boat up so that can sit upright under with something to spare must pile up stone couple of foot high under gunwale in quarter of hour be done sail be then laid over boat end being kept down by stone be snug godfrey said now will put mizzen over forward so a to keep wind out right along there be four foot of head room at entrance to boat tent in front of fire be soon lit one of pine torch being cut up to start with skin be laid upon ground taking off wet coat put on fur jacket now can see about breakfast luka luka have run down filled kettle while godfrey be fastening down sail be placed on fire a soon a began to burn clear of fish have caught day before be laid on glowing ember together with two leg of goose thing be going to have most trouble about luka be fresh water godfrey said a ate breakfast luka looked surprised when once get beyond stream of yenesei went on water will be salt salt luka repeated yes too salt to make tea with will be right for time doubt what with melting snow rain have have there be sure to be lot of little stream running into sea when land dry will be in bad way luka looked serious be altogether beyond experience of course if can get plenty of fresh fish will get on fairly a sha' require much to drink will look about river when can get at map know there be small one called gida running in just between mouth of yenesei obi there be kara on farther then petchora a far a can remember be be marked of course there may be lot of little stream be not put down there be one thing if find that generally get wind can keep big boat with must make carry water a well a fuel must hold quantity for dozen barrel must not sink above inch must certainly get out of difficulty way gave quite fright at first felt so sure that have thought of everything there never for moment thought about sea being salt how be blowing outside be lucky indeed have found snug corner luka for if have be out in open must only have piled stone in boat to prevent blowing away lain at full length underneath must be well enough for one night must be frightful nuisance if have to go on for three four day so sheltered be indeed that scarce felt wind be howling above be a comfortable beneath boat a have be in hut by river side when be a rough a in gulf luka will be tremendous out at sea luka have never seen wave higher than in of rapid of upper river be astonished at white headed wave at shower of spray sent up a struck rock be wave ever much bigger than asked bigger must think so out in open sea one of wave must make hundred of then must break vessel to piece godfrey be built very stout strong very big get broken to piece if sea drive against rock sometimes in very great storm get so beaten by wave that plank open water run in sink must not like to go to sea if wave be like luka said thoughtfully be terrible why if have not come ashore in time boat must have sunk must have made good fight for luka with apron tied in round must stand very heavy sea so long a keep head to wave water might wash over must not get in even if did fill space where sleep compartment at end be quite buoyant enough to keep up what must do if be out in what call great sea godfrey must lash mast sail paddle firewood together fasten mooring rope to throw overboard must keep head to sea because thing must float in water wind must not get hold of call contrivance like floating anchor then must lie down in bottom button flap over hole in cover lie there a snugly a possible see weight must be down quite low in boat then must keep steady oh must get on capitally if there be plenty of room for to drift how far have to go now ca exactly tell wish knew from long jagged cape be northern point of land on western side of gulf of yenesei form separation between mouth of gulf of obi to waigatz strait between mainland waigatz island lie south of island called nova zembla be about two hundred fifty mile in straight line must think be quite three time that if have to follow in out of shore from there to archangel if go in to archangel be about three hundred fifty mile more cutting across everything if have current with like stream of yenesei must make very short work of unfortunately there be nothing of sort paddling steadily might go three mile hour say hundred mile in three day if have wind must help of course must go great deal faster because must paddle sail too if go to place call archangel where must go must keep far north of luka sailing in straight line nearly due west must strike northern coast of norway somewhere other must say from what saw of on map must be five hundred mile from waigatz must be madness for to attempt might get caught in terrible storm might get into fog a have compass there must lie not knowing way to go must stick to land till get to mouth of white sea with favourable wind must get across in day then go on coasting again till get beyond russian frontier then at first village come to land find out about distance arrange to get taken in reindeer sledge to regular settlement what sort of people be there luka asked be same sort of people a samoyede know that be just same anyhow speak same sort of language well know northern ostjaks stayed with speak nearly same a samoyede must hardly get on with at first because talk be so different to of southern ostjaks got to speak quite easily at last so have doubt will be able to make native may meet whether be samoyede anything else understand without difficulty what be jack what be whining about asked dog who having made hearty meal have be lying down between while be talking who now sat up snuffing whining uneasily may be fox bear luka said making way farther back into hut returning with bow arrow godfrey gun two spear hope be bear godfrey said a removed charge of shot rammed down bullet in place want more skin unless happens to be black fox must be worth having supply of bear meat must come in very handy dog whine presently changed into angry growl bear sure enough expect know of place have come here for shelter have much better have left alone be lucky for that fire have burnt low must have scared if have be blazing lie down jack lying perfectly still presently heard sharp snuffing noise minute two later bear came round corner of rock astonished at sight of white object animal sat up on haunch now luka exclaimed discharged arrow at same moment that godfrey have pulled trigger arrow struck bear in throat such be force with be sent that head showed at back of neck godfrey bullet struck in chest bear at once rolled over thinking be killed crawled from under boat ran forward animal suddenly rose to foot running up alongside placed muzzle close to ear pulled other trigger illustration luka face bear be dead now luka shouted a bent over at same moment heard cry of warning be simultaneously struck heavy blow stretched on ground beside bear flashed through mind that assailant be female bear have heard from ostjaks that best plan if attacked by enraged bear be to sham death therefore lay without moving muscle a be struck down heard twang of luka bow jack sharp barking close to ear then with deep angry growl bear left rushed towards tent godfrey at once sprang to foot have not brought spear with a crawled out sprang to fire dragged out brand luka have discharged arrow jack be harassing bear by snapping at hind leg in terror for safety of canoe rather than of luka who must knew well defend godfrey leapt forward struck bear across nose with brand with roar of fury turned upon a did so exposed side to luka who discharged arrow behind shoulder rolled over over again gained foot pause however have given luka time to emerge from under boat with spear in hand running up thrust right through body bear fell over dead then ran to godfrey be hurt asked be hurt bit luka for felt sharp pain a beast knocked over think can be much be very lucky that put fur jacket on again if have be for expect must have regularly laid open shoulder took off coat bear claw have penetrated through skin have scored three gash on shoulder luka said be of great depth beyond making arm stiff for paddling for day two must matter little at once set about skinning two bear put four ham carefully aside cut off most of meat gave jack hearty meal then retired again to shelter heart be in mouth when saw rushing at tent if have struck boat thrown weight upon must have be terrible business be afraid too luka said be just going to shoot again when struck on nose so gave chance of hitting in vital spot if have be for blow must hardly have stopped be so close that even if wounded mortally must have come down on boat well be fortunate have ended so luka will be lesson to when shoot bear next to look out for mate also not to leave spear behind to advance towards bear think dead until have loaded gun again for two day longer have to remain in shelter third morning when awoke wind have died away sun be shining brightly a there be still sea on godfrey determined to stay day explore coast little leaving luka to look after boat good in case more bear might be in neighbourhood started with jack be amazed at quantity of bird that met with thrush wagtail warbler chifchaffs fieldfare red pole rose at step air quivered with song of innumerable lark mingled with of willow warbler snipe in considerable number sprang up darted off with sharp cry from almost under foot plover circled round round duck of various kind passed between shore a godfrey supposed inland swamp lake martin in great number darted hither thither hawking for insect occasionally bird supposed to be grouse rose with loud whirr short a be time since snow have cleared off ground spring have come in with marvellous rapidity grass be already well nigh knee deep flower of various kind be in full bloom where ground be comparatively bare of grass be studded with yellow blossom of wild heart ease amongst stunted alder tree godfrey found dwarf rose already in bud wild onion wild rhubarb in flower then came upon broad expanse of shrub looked to like rhododendron with flower with strong aromatic scent several time heard call of cuckoo on patch of sand there be wild anemone in blossom godfrey pulled bulb of wild onion cut off slice tasted be similar in flavour to cultivated plant very sharp acrid however set to work pulled up several dozen bulb be small not exceeding size of radish must be very valuable a one of chopped fine must be sufficient to give savour to whole goose turning to right coming down upon shore saw that edge of water be fringed with seagull of various kind picking up tiny fish a wave broke in sandy cove scuttling into water making sudden dip dive into farther out flock of black duck be feeding while two three pair of swan passed overhead going north presently saw three four native hut ahead reindeer be grazing near three boat be hauled upon shore be doubtless samoyede a soon a caught sight of turned have heard that samoyede although more friendly than tungus with stranger be much le to be depended upon than ostjaks a have faith in being able to explain what be doing there with comparatively limited command of ostjak language thought better to return at once to luka found when reached tent that tartar be beginning to feel anxious for have be four hour absent a have abundance of food have occasion to trade with native at present decided not to pay visit to a soon a dinner have be cooked set to work to get everything in readiness for start store be taken out of canoe be carried down to within few foot of water tent be dismantled boat also carried down then devoted for rest of afternoon to collecting more drift wood for water be again falling highest level have reached be strewn with debris a there be now practical distinction between night day lay down slept for four five hour then put large canoe into water placed firewood in with stock of flour frozen meat bear flesh then with kettle frying pan baled eight ten bucket of water into for godfrey did not know how soon river must become brackish spread bear skin over then having carefully repacked canoe put also into water stepped mast took place in hoisted sail with boat in tow started north again wind be from south with assistance of current went along rapidly nevertheless paddle be got to work a now that be fairly on way again mile gained be of importance kept about mile from shore so a to take advantage of current in twenty minute native encampment be passed saw one moving about there supposed that must be asleep for sun be low down on horizon godfrey watch be still going a have have opportunity of comparing with other timepiece for just year must only consider to be approximate guide once month so have made point of setting did by sticking up pole measuring shadow cast knowing that must be at shortest at twelve o'clock by mean calculated that be never more than hour wrong shore continued very flat once twice saw sand bank stretching out considerable distance sometimes paddled sometimes godfrey steered only luka laid in paddle three time in course of day big canoe be pulled up luka went on board cooked meal flat slab on lit fire having be raised three four inch above bottom to keep out of water hitherto godfrey have done steering when boat be under sail now instructed luka little teaching be indeed needed a steering be done with paddle luka be accustomed to keeping boat straight when paddling be however nervous with sail be boomed straight out with light spar godfrey have cut for purpose however a wind be dead aft there be fear of jibing so long a boat course be kept true be rendered more easy by steady drag of boat astern twelve hour after starting godfrey told luka to lie down sleep a intended that so long a have favourable wind must continue voyage without stopping there be occasion for going ashore bear flesh must last a long a kept good have plenty of water on board for at least fortnight in few minute luka be sound asleep jack lay on deck in front of sometimes sleeping sometimes waking up giving sharp bark in reply to cry of sea gull passing overhead flock of black duck skimming along close to surface of water within fifty yard of boat chapter xv coasting current be now losing power godfrey dipping hand into water then putting to lip found that be distinctly brackish congratulated upon having laid in stock of water when did after luka have slept for six hour godfrey roused now luka must take place steer move very carefully else will capsize be now if there be change lean forward touch will wake in moment if sail must shift over to other side have got to do be to shift sheet to fastening on side with light wind jibing doe not matter at if wind freshens wake at once for quarter of hour godfrey watched to see that luka steered steadily then worked down in cockpit closed eye did not seem to that have be asleep long when luka touched must not have woke luka said land seems going right away from godfrey sat up so be luka must not be surprised if be extreme northern point of course may be only deep bay at rate must see looked at watch why have be asleep nearly seven hour now luka have better haul boat alongside see about cooking forgot to try onion yesterday cut one up small put in pan with meat by by have better tie piece of cord to four bear ham let tow overboard for two three hour water must be quite salt now when take out will rub little fresh salt into ought to keep well then a soon a luka have got into boat jack jumping in with a always made point of superintending cooking operation godfrey took place in stern jibed sail have before be on port quarter over to starboard brought head somewhat to north of west hauled in sheet lying over till water nearly touched gunwale light little craft must have gone speedily along have not be for drag of boat astern however towed lightly for be loaded with very small proportion of weight must carry godfrey judged by object on shore that must not be going along le than three mile hour in six hour land trended away due south knew that have now reached first of two deep bay must have to pas before reaching northern extremity of cape kept on course hour later with exception of low coast nearly astern land be to be seen luka who be paddling steadily looked round have such implicit confidence in companion that be quite sure boat be keeping right course have vague sense of uneasiness at seeing nothing sea around how do know way to go asked know that by keeping on same way be going past last land will strike coast again on other side of bay think be twenty thirty mile across can tell way by wind in first place in second place by position of sun see be over right shoulder at present there be mark of shadow on side have got to keep about there making allowance for change in position of sun luka understood suppose wind be to change said must know by position of sun see at present come nearly due south be blowing almost straight towards sun if be very cloudy at night when must not see sun must not be able to tell then after holding on till felt sure that be well past mouth of bay must put about on other tack must be sure to come upon land sooner later anyhow even in darkest night must know if wind have gone round to north a must be so much colder besides there be never great shift of wind like without knowing one wind be sure to drop there must be something like dead calm before other set in anyhow with bright sun steady wind like can not go wrong will see land ahead in seven eight hour be le than six hour when godfrey saw low land ahead be presently coasting along again with wind free for be now running little to west of north thirty mile farther there be break in coast be first rate map made tracing from godfrey said coast line be most accurately marked now have run of about same distance a last then there be about fifty mile almost due north then will be round other cape made passage safely across although took longer than first for wind dropped lighter have to use paddle have just done in time luka be if have be hour later there must be nothing for to anchor look at white cloud on water be fog be only just in time be heading for cove paddle hard luka will be on now before get there have just entered cove be forty fifty foot wide ran a many yard into land when fog rolled over be like wet blanket godfrey said be thirty forty degree colder than be minute back paddle very slowly carefully now luka dip paddle deeply in want to go a far up creek a can want to run ashore very gently paddled on until godfrey felt ground at depth of about three foot will do nicely said now will drop anchor over anchor be one of ostjak manufacture consisted of long flat narrow stone weighing about six pound to of flat side be lashed two piece of fir about inch half in diameter projected few inch below stone be cut off just below branch of about inch in diameter eight ten inch long branch when growing bent downwards slanted at angle closely resembling that of fluke of anchor with upright whole therefore be excellent imitation of anchor with four fluke two on side stone serving a weight be thrown out of bow of canoe couple of fathom of line let out then godfrey hauled up larger boat fastened alongside must just make out outline of shore about fifteen foot on side of must take to fur jacket again luka teeth be chattering after working a hard a have be doing for last three four hour wo do to get chill be a hungry a hunter have breakfast at five o'clock by watch be three now luka soon lit fire in boat provision in canoe have be finished two day before a have be obliged to throw overboard what have not eaten owing to having become unfit for use food however wrapped up in fur in boat be still solidly frozen cut couple of fish out of mass placed in frying pan stuck wooden skewer through piece of bear meat held in flame hung bear ham a did time cooked in smoke of fire must try to get more fish next time set sail luka be sure passed through several shoal of fish by swirling of water be thirty six hour before fog cleared off swept away by south westerly wind a have nothing to do to eat sleep during time got up anchor hoisted sail moment fog cleared off in eighteen hour reached sharp point of cape rounding godfrey said now luka be at mouth of gulf of obi be nearly two hundred mile according to map to opposite side dare try to make besides wind have be getting more to west must be right in teeth for see by tracing opposite point of land be good bit to south of west there be nothing for for to keep along shore for something like hundred fifty mile can lay course well with wind gulf wo be more than eighty mile wide there can strike across coast down opposite bank seems long way round will do a quickly a must beating right across in teeth of wind doubt if must do at with craft behind fortunately wind be not high must not have ventured out a heavy swell must have set in from other side of gulf kept course within mile of shore what be black thing on low point godfrey asked can hear barking must be tremendously big dog if be dog be seal luka said go right up river in summer samoyede yuruks kill great number on coast eat flesh sell teeth for ivory well want at present godfrey said if fall short of food will see whether can kill at present great thing be to get on night day canoe kept on way except when godfrey be asleep luka did not steer for did not like management of sail especially now that boat at time heeled over great deal with beam wind took sleep by fit start two three hour at time except when cooking paddled away assiduously twice godfrey be lucky enough to bring down duck when flock swept past boat within shot have too supply of fresh fish for godfrey now always have two line out towing astern with white goose feather fastened to hook a bait ordinarily caught nothing passed through several large shoal of fish at time pulled out a fast a must haul in let go line sometimes bringing in three four at time a there be six hook on line fish be herring formed welcome change luka have never seen one before for although penetrate for distance up great river never ascend to upper water jack too benefited greatly for of late have be kept on somewhat short ration a have now be reduced to four half cured bear ham comparatively small stock of frozen food on fifth day after rounding cape wind have be gradually getting lighter dropped altogether for next two day of worked steadily with paddle must have made good two hundred mile godfrey said must safely venture to strike across in such quiet weather a there be river marked on chart a coming in somewhere here want to find if can there be water enough for week begin to taste horribly of skin besides that have considerable mixture of ash be sure must be very close to indeed according to calculation of two hundred mile ought to have passed already anyhow will keep on until get there godfrey be not far out for late in day saw opening of fifty yard wide in bank at once made for entering paddled along a near bank a must go to avoid current godfrey tasted water from time to time after paddling for two hour pronounced perfectly sweet will land here luka be sure want to stretch limb bit have rest look about for good place to land bank be too steep to be able to get big canoe up can carry other be light enough now presently found place where portion of bank have fallen in left gap here landed moored large canoe to shore carried other up bank exclamation of pleasure broke from godfrey at wide expanse of bright green dotted with flower jack be exuberant in delight circling round round like wild thing barking loudly occasionally throwing down to roll two paddle be driven firmly into ground sail unlaced from yard be lashed to paddle a ridge pole over sail be thrown fur be taken out of boat spread in tent will have cup of tea luka then turn in for twelve hour sleep be sure deserve after long rest woke thoroughly refreshed then while luka be lighting fire godfrey went down to river stripped have short swim water being too cold to permit stopping more than two three minute in when have have breakfast said now luka do go down to boat take firewood out then sluice boat thoroughly with water get perfectly clean by time have done that will be back will then lift out of water turn bottom upwards to dry thoroughly then will melt down of bear fat saved give thorough rubbing with will leave job until to morrow will take four twenty hour for to dry be going out with gun to see what can shoot whole place seems full of bird though be mostly small one still might come across something better have better keep jack with godfrey expedition be not very successful one brought back four grouse dozen small bird have killed with single shot firing into thick of flock flew by overhead grouse be roasted for dinner godfrey found to satisfaction that luka have baked pile of cake being first time have tasted bread for fortnight a demanded more time attention than must spare to in boat luka told that several flight of black duck have passed up river while have be at work at boat volunteered to grease boat next day if godfrey must try to get shot at will be of use trying to shoot on river godfrey said a must have mean of picking up can tell found water too cold morning to care about stripping swimming out for will have try on plain saw four five deer to day only first passed within shot a have not bullet in gun got off without firing at will try to morrow if ca stalk one accordingly next day godfrey set out after hour walking saw three deer worked round very cautiously so a to get clump of bush between then crawled up to looked through be hundred fifty yard away have confidence in gun at distance stood for time thinking then remembered have read that on american plain deer be often decoyed into coming close up to hunter by working upon curiosity drew ramrod out from gun put cap wore be fur one with tail on to end of pushed through bush began to wave to fro deer caught sight of immediately stood staring at for minute two ready to bound away must strange object seem to threaten danger a nothing came of began to move towards slowly with hesitation until gathered in group at distance of not more than fifty yard godfrey while waving cap with one hand be holding gun in readiness with other feeling sure that must not miss mark now gently lowered cap raised gun to shoulder slight a be movement startled deer a turned to fly fired barrel at shoulder of one nearest to have satisfaction of seeing fall while companion dashed away over plain ran up to fallen animal found that be already dead bullet having struck in region of heart proceeded to cut off head lower part of leg opened cleaned be then able to lift on to shoulder a neared tent jack came tearing along to meet with loud bark of welcome yes have got food for for time jack though doe not seem to that do much to earn luka be at work greasing boat godfrey called up on to bank must try do something to preserve meat luka will rub with salt godfrey can spare salt not much must never do to be left without that can do well enough without bread ca do without salt smoke well luka said might try be afraid ham be beginning to go not smoke enough godfrey suppose not must have plenty lot of smoke well there be plenty of wood to make smoke with must keep close luka said ought to smoke for two day can keep close enough by cutting pole making circular tent with sail will spoil whiteness be of great consequence have better leave boat for present luka come with cut pole bough for fire taking hatchet started out presently cut eight pole ten foot long now be best wood for smoking with pine make best smoke next to oak there be plenty of stunted pine about must think of aromatic shrub with must be good will make up two big bundle of will take pole back first then will cut pine bough a be obtained within few hundred yard of camp have soon material for fire pole be then stuck in circle lashed together at top sail taken down wrapped round be not large enough by adding storm sail hide of deer covering be made complete then number of stick be tied from pole to pole across deer flesh be then cut up into strip of about foot long three four inch wide inch thick be hung over stick until whole of deer be so disposed of three remaining bear ham be also hung up fire of pine wood be then with difficulty lighted of sweet smelling shrub laid on godfrey who have undertaken part of business while luka went back to boat crawled out from tent almost blinded by jove said a closed aperture if be a bad a now that be only just lighted meat ought to be smoked a dry a chip by to morrow godfrey have nothing to do now to watch smoke rising from opening at top of tent opening entrance little whenever slackened drawing stick together with iron ramrod throwing on fresh armful of fuel having finished greasing boat luka did same to canoe spent next twenty four hour in alternately sleeping collecting drift wood on river bank attending to fire have to be watched carefully dry splinter added from time to time to get green wood to keep alight hour two piece of meat be taken out examined in thirty hour from time of lighting fire luka pronounced that be done strip have shrivelled to half former thickness be almost black in colour will give plenty of work for teeth luka godfrey said look almost like shoe leather perhaps will be better than look once tasted smoked reindeer tongue at least called reindeer tongue suppose be be first rate now there be nothing more to do let get ready for start sail be taken off pole chopped into five foot length will lay in bottom of boat luka four longways four crossway a there be sixteen of will make top line five six inch above floor then will lay firewood on in way wo get wet with water what be quite a important wo dirty water be done flour deer flesh be stowed on similar platform fore aft of firewood covered with skin twelve bucket of water be then baled in what remained of frozen provision be inspected be agreed that a have already melted good deal must not be eatable much longer a have food enough to last for time be of use keeping be therefore broken up jack be allowed to eat a much a wanted rest be left when everything be packed canoe be carried down placed in water took place jack jumped on board fresh start be made a soon a emerged from small river struck out straight from land wind be light from north took paddle four day rest have done good canoe under influence of sail oar went fast through water twenty four hour ought to take across godfrey said gulf look from eighty to ninety mile across at point where river run into must head rather to south for there be sure to be current out in middle a obi be big river be however thirty hour before reached opposite shore godfrey accounting for difference on supposition that stream must have be good deal stronger than expected must have drifted down long way found indeed that even inshore be passing land at rate of nearly two mile hour be better luka for with north wind sail will be no good to may a well get down at once stow shore be muddy see so will not hurt canoe if must drift up against be comfort for can go to sleep be sure after thirty hour paddling with only two three long easies deserve rest first of must have meal one doe not know whether to call dinner supper when there be night sleep just when be tired have caught eight ten fish a came across passing through great shoal of herring in hour kettle be boiling over fire fish be hissing crackling in frying pan over strip of deer flesh with ramrod run through be frizzling be pronounced excellent there be slight aromatic bitterness gave zest flavour to flesh inside be by mean so tough a godfrey have expected to find when three of voyager have satisfied hunger brand be a usual extinguished ember thrown overboard then returning to canoe lay down be in very few minute fast asleep slept for six hour when woke land be longer in sight be lucky there be fog godfrey said that have sun to act a compass ca be many mile out wo make straight for shore luka will head about north west so a to edge in gradually there must be good deal of current here will be helping along in hour low line of coast be visible then headed still more to north there must be good three mile hour current here godfrey observed presently be going along first rate past shore took over five day to come up at rate will go down in two paddled steadily for twelve hour stopping once only to cook meal then went close inshore again have supper slept when woke found be still within mile of shore current be now taking along more than mile hour gulf must be wide here luka think must gain anything by going out four five mile farther so will keep about a be ought to be at point by end of to day work be two hundred mile up expect drifted down five twenty mile in crossing must have passed land at good five mile hour yesterday so that ought not to be more than thirty forty mile from point for peninsula doe not go a far north a other by twenty thirty mile after eight hour paddling found at mouth of deep bay be right godfrey said examining tracing land on farther side of bay be northern point of gulf will paddle across there anchor by shore for to night to morrow will have long paddle for be seventy eighty mile nearly due west to sheltered bay lie just side of cape golovina once round that have nearly four hundred mile to go nearly due south into kara bay long tongue of land be working round be called yamal peninsula once fairly down into kara bay will leave siberia behind land will be russia struck across bay landed under shelter of cape land be higher here than have before met after sleep godfrey took gun accompanied by jack ascended hill be rum said to a gazed over wide expanse of sea to north that must be one sheet of ice in winter like look of cloud away to north think be going to have fog gale wo make move till see coast seems rocky wo do to make along unless have settled weather returned told luka then wandered away again a have seen that bird be very plentiful returned in three hour to boat with dozen grouse six ptarmigan capercailzie godfrey be now good shot bird never having be disturbed by approach of man be so tame that have difficulty whatever in making bag a went down to boat congratulated that have not made start for sky be now overcast wind be already blowing strongly will have bread to day luka bird deserve something to eat with flour be holding out well have not eaten above twenty pound since started wish have yeast something to make rise by by have idea mix till come back luka here a when landed on yenesei have seen number of rough nest on ground bird being so tame that often did not fly off even when passed quite close to returned to spot where have seen nest quite thick have difficulty in collecting large number of little egg of great variety of colour expect about two out of three be bad said will have to break singly to find out good one fancy making cake of sparrow egg upon breaking found that not more than one in five be good still there be quite enough for purpose frying pan be used a basin in made sort of batter of egg flour by time have done four of grouse be nearly roasted poured batter into empty kettle melted deer fat in pan then poured in batter again then washed out filled kettle placed upon fire now by time water be boiling luka batter grouse will be cooked be what call yorkshire pudding at home will go splendidly with bird pudding turned out really good enjoyed meal immensely jack having bone of four bird for share together with solitary fish have caught day before by time have finished be glad to get up tent pitched with entrance close to fire for even in sheltered spot where be fierce gust of cold wind swept down upon canvas of tent be fastened down by heavy stone placed upon fur brought in everything made snug for three day storm raged be nuisance losing so much time godfrey said be somewhere about middle of june when started there be only three month of open weather here day be of importance sha' so much mind when get to mouth of petchora for heard from one of russian in prison canoe often go a far a from archangel to trade so will feel when get there that be getting into civilized region be about four hundred mile from kara bay so that have good eight hundred mile to travel before get there can certainly paddle forty mile day by sticking to steadily allowing for stoppage of four day ca allow le than will be fortnight how long have be now luka there be nothing to count time from luka shook head well be somewhere above three week godfrey went on so that by time get to mouth of petchora will be last week in july will give couple of month fancy ca count much on weather in september still if canoe go from archangel to petchora back ought to be able to do from petchora for distance from there to archangel be good deal le than from mouth of yenesei to petchora there be one thing if weather get very bad on way get laid up by bad weather for long time on way to petchora can go up river hear to place called ust zlyma from there go overland to archangel be about two hundred two hundred fifty mile across must walk that in ten day be quite sure that must not be suspected of being anything what look at archangel there be sure to be british consul must put up to best plan of getting out of country however there will be plenty of time to see about that a get on wind fell on morning of fourth day must be hour before sea must have gone down sufficiently for to make start godfrey again went out shooting time accompanied by luka godfrey be a fortunate a have be before shooting three capercailzie nineteen grouse while luka brought down with arrow four capercailzie found sitting on stunted tree on way back to boat collected great quantity of egg came upon rabbit warren shoot luka said a godfrey cocked gun will frighten into hole if will go on with dog will lie down here will bring a many rabbit a can carry two hour later came down to tent with two dozen rabbit have shot after cooking two of giving one to jack a share packed up belonging again took to canoe used paddle until round cape then heading westward hoisted sail for what wind there be be still from north help afforded be sufficient greatly to reduce labour of paddling kept steadily on one other taking occasional snatch of sleep with exception that of time spent by luka in cooking continued to paddle until forty hour after starting reached cape golovina passing between beloc island did not make halt have intended under shelter of cape for weather be fine godfrey wanted to take advantage of north wind a long a lasted once round cape headed nearly due south wind freshening little drove along merrily be able to cease paddling to take fair proportion of sleep alternately luka be now getting more accustomed to management of sail longer feared occasional jibe night day if must be called night when sun never set continued voyage along coast of yamal peninsula at end of fourth day wind freshened so much that large sail be taken down leg of mutton sail substituted for a wind continued to rise sea to get up fast godfrey began to look out for spot into to run for shelter coast be very indented broken in two hour passed mouth of deep bay into boat be at once directed be presently moored under shelter of northern bank be splendid sea boat godfrey said if be for boat in tow must not mind what weather be out in stay be of short duration for in few hour wind sank again think be done yet godfrey said when be beyond shelter of bay fancy will blow up again presently still may a well push on think be rather more from east than be for next twenty four hour however there be very marked change in force of wind have now veered round to north east be getting well down now godfrey said have be sailing for five day have certainly be running good three mile hour from time rounded cape so be three hundred fifty mile down must say must be entering kara bay very bad weather coming luka said looking back godfrey turned round heavy black cloud be sweeping up with misty line below by jove be right be big squall mistake there be bay to run to here luka must not get there in time if there be must do a talked about quick lower sail down there be not moment to lose wait until bring up head to wind now then down with now unstep mast lash boom other sail spar together be way with joint effort work be accomplished in couple of minute now then fasten rope to end luka will tie other end to mine be right be long enough to make good big angle now fasten head rope to middle be sure be put in middle luka be right now launch overboard work be done a quickly a be described in three minute from time mast be lowered canoe be riding to floating anchor now then luka on with apron will sit up will lie down cover up hole lash carefully when be in be going to be drencher be of use getting wet through to begin with must not do anything with paddle have scarcely made snug when with roar deluge of rain fell on deck cover moment later even sound be partly deadened by howl of wind although head be close together godfrey felt that must be utterly useless to make remark felt under uneasiness for with weight well down anchored head to sea felt sure that light canoe must ride over anything like cork bottle motion of boat rapidly increased rode lightly over wave a increased jerking of boat behind at rope became more more violent canoe quivered from end to end with shock will never do godfrey said to boat will pull stern out of will be awful loss to cut adrift ca be helped unlashed fastening of cover of circular hole above reached hand forward got hold of luka paddle passed with own out through hole then sat up confident a felt in canoe be almost frightened at wild aspect of sea wind be literally howling driving rain before with force stung godfrey neck a struck got out strip of deer skin lashing of there be supply always close at hand under deck lashed paddle together then leaning aft lashed at centre firmly to tow rope then with difficulty got out knife cut rope close to fastening paddle flew overboard boat drifted rapidly astern drag of paddle being a godfrey observed with satisfaction sufficient to keep head to wind then wriggled down underneath apron again lashed down cover of hole chapter xvi samoyede encampment action of canoe be altogether changed a soon a be released from strain of boat behind there be more tugging jarring rose fell on wave almost imperceptibly well jack old fellow what do think of godfrey said to dog a nestled up close to here be now out in regular storm be lucky have plenty of sea room jack reckon be seventy eighty mile across to other side of gulf suppose can drag spar through water much more than mile hour so have plenty of time before must put away a much time in sleep a can have lost almost provision old boy water be of still more consequence be very lucky always made rule of having kettle filled put on board here after meal of keeping dozen pound of meat here thought might be obliged to cast boat adrift suddenly well if have luck may find again will drift in same line there be reason why must live through stock of firewood have gone down have not got above couple of hundred pound weight in altogether be afraid will take enough salt water on board to spoil supply of fresh think be drifting pretty straight for kara river calculated that lay dead to leeward of when wind went to north west be considerable time before godfrey went off to sleep owing to rapid change of angle at be lying sometimes head be two three foot higher than foot directly afterwards position be exactly reversed rolling be slight scarcely felt being too tightly packed in along with fur dog to move much at last noise of water roar of wind lulled to sleep woke once then went off again watch told that have be altogether asleep twelve hour when next woke felt at once that motion be slighter than have be that wind have greatly abated be asleep luka shouted be not asleep now luka replied drowsily storm be pretty nearly over will get cover off look round then will see if ca boil water have tea have never used of candle yet will be good opportunity to try unlashing removing cover godfrey sat up looked round gale have broken black cloud be hurrying past overhead there be patch of blue sky sea be still very heavy be rarely that canoe dipped nose under wave so lightly did rise fall over in few hour will have sail up again luka said a tartar thrust head up through opening be for moment instantly dived under again replaced cover appalled at sea be infinitely rougher than anything have ever before witnessed look pretty bad doe godfrey said laughing a too resumed position of shelter be terrible luka said expect have be worse at rate a can see have got through without taking drop of water on board thanks to floating anchor now will pas kettle forward to be very careful with for be water have water why what have become of boat luka exclaimed have to cut adrift hour after squall struck did not hear look out when took paddle felt take paddle there be too much noise to hear anything be too frightened to listen thought that surely must go to bottom why did cut loose because be tugging so hard must have pulled to piece be better to let go than to risk that will have drifted same way have done only will have gone three time a fast for be good deal higher out of water paddle fastened on to head rope wo have anything like hold on water that spar have will keep in same direction when get sail up if have lived through will very likely find ashore somewhere along coast now be sure lash kettle securely to deck beam luka put a near one side a can get then there will be room for to lie alongside watch stop before fasten pour out mugful of water for jack doe like tea there will be nothing tea for after have once made candle be lighted fixed under kettle four wick gave out such odour that godfrey be glad to sit up again remain outside until nudge from luka told that tea be ready ate with slice of raw bear ham luka offered to cook godfrey have have candle put out moment got under cover must not hear of being lighted again be not at bad raw said eat raw ham in germany that last smoking got be almost a good a cooking expect sea will have gone down in few hour then can have regular meal if be to light smelly thing again now must make ill now jack will light pipe look out again will come out too for breath of fresh air will hold tight see that go over in twelve hour sea have almost gone down floating anchor be hauled up unlashed mast be stepped large sail hoisted free from dead weight have hitherto checked speed little craft sped along gaily before gentle wind godfrey keeping a near a possible dead before on chance that might catch sight of boat if drifted mile hour drifted three said must have gained four twenty mile while be asleep perhaps since then have be gaining mile hour so be from thirty five to forty mile ahead of must be quite half way across gulf anyhow need not begin to look out yet be going about four knot hour must think suppose be going more than one in about ten hour must begin to look about for before end of time sea have gone quite down wind have fallen so light that godfrey thought be scarce making three knot hour hope wo fall altogether said for a have paddle must be awkward for two of bottom board will do for paddle yes know that luka be steering with one of must do very little good for be so thin that must break off directly put strength on to godfrey occasionally stood up looked round must see sign of boat indeed must hardly have done so unless have passed within couple of mile at most of wind may have changed little said though think have done so anyhow will head little more to south so a to be sure that will strike shore to east of kara river point be likely to drift to four hour later made out land ahead of six mile away a guessed holding on reached in two hour half time stepped out a soon a got into willow water carried canoe ashore drank mug of cold tea ate raw meat then lay down for long sleep when woke collected drift wood lighting fire cooked meat what be going to do godfrey luka asked be going to set out at once to look for boat have better wait for few hour may not have drifted to shore yet though think can be far off still be a well to give plenty of time at rate can shoot bird so time wo be lost having made fair bag be absent from canoe for five hour returned after cutting up capercailzie grilling over fire got boat into water started have sailed about eight mile to west when luka exclaimed there be something there by shore close to point may be boat may be rock be quarter of hour before godfrey be able to assure that be really boat thank god for luka exclaimed have reason to thank for great many thing do so hour hope do so too finding boat again safe seems to greatest blessing have have yet know what must have done without quarter of hour brought to point boat lay just afloat bumping on sand a little wave lifted left sprang out of canoe into willow water threw out anchor then waded to boat have about four inch of water in be entirely uninjured hurrah godfrey shouted be a good a ever now luka get everything out of a soon a can then can turn over empty put thing in again be off at once have got time to lose for must remember there be not much more than quart of cold tea left in kettle be sure kara river ca be very far off ca say whether be three mile thirty in hour be again afloat working paddle to assist sail two hour later luka said hut on point ahead of so there be godfrey said six eight of lot of cattle reindeer luka corrected samoyede village why there must be hundred of godfrey said in surprise yes ostjaks told in old camp that many of samoyede have five hundred of thousand reindeer keep just a do cattle wealth be counted by reindeer make clothes of skin milk flesh be chief food draw sledge when want money can sell of did ask how much can be sold for yes ostjaks said that be worth here two three rouble then if there be many of encampment along shore luka need not trouble about food if anything happens to boat can make couple of sledge buy four reindeer start by land then must have to wait until winter luka said yes must be nuisance must not be so very long to wait have idea reindeer be so cheap if have think instead of spending winter hunting must have bought reindeer started to drive still must have be terrible journey perhaps have done better a be well will land what do think want anything luka said samoyede be generally friendly be not like tungus yuraks see there be two of have hatchet knife other thing value if wanted anything must say let land a must be better to go on be right luka suppose there must be risk of being robbed still be just a well not to run even smallest chance of trouble when everything be going on so well on passing point on encampment be situated saw wide opening kara godfrey exclaimed joyously will cross to other side coast up on shore till water becomes fresh required four hour sailing paddling before got beyond influence of sea then landed shot hunted for couple of day took in fresh supply of water started again have passed line of ural mountain now godfrey said kara rise in range may almost consider ourselves in russia one morning luka woke godfrey soon after have down for turn of sleep fog coming said godfrey sat up looked round that be luka must head for shore directly seized paddle fog cloud have drifted rapidly down upon before be half way to shore drift of white cloud floated past on water five minute later be surrounded by dense white wall so thick that even canoe towing behind be invisible ceased paddling there be nothing to do to wait godfrey said get fur coat on be bitterly cold there be one comfort what wind there be be towards shore will drift way ca feel wind at luka said be very slight there must have be to bring fog down from north be not more than mile from shore when closed in upon if only drift fifty yard hour will be there in time let have cup of tea then will rig up cover turn in have lot of sleep to make up for there be one comfort there be chance of being run down godfrey saw by watch when woke that have be asleep for four hour sat up looked round fog be a thick a before movement woke luka too sat up listen luka godfrey exclaimed a be about to speak bird chirp sound be repeated be over there godfrey said hurrah will soon be ashore seized paddle after rowing for minute two stopped again listened there be again godfrey said right ahead paddle gently luka sha' see shore until be on must not risk running head on to rock presently something dark appeared just in front of canoe hold water godfrey exclaimed a stopped way boat drifted quietly against rock brought broadside to stepped out be comfort fog can last for week now let get canoe ashore can moor boat water be a smooth a glass there be risk whatever of damaging bring armful of firewood ashore went on a laid canoe down gently on flat rock will look about for place for tent go far will lose will take care of wo go beyond speaking distance godfrey soon found patch of sand large enough for tent be soon erected fire lit jack a usual indulged in wild scamper returned to godfrey whistle go too far jack will be losing way too fog did not clear off for forty eight hour when at end of time looked out of tent sky be clear bird be singing gaily ground rose almost perpendicularly behind to height of from twenty to thirty foot be rocky with deep indentation will do shooting luka a there may be native near will hide canoe be use running risk will stow tent get everything packed before start then will be able to set out when return canoe be packed carried fifty yard along shore then laid behind great boulder have fallen at mouth of cleft in rock will pull up boat luka asked think be worth while there be nothing there worth stealing native have got plenty of fish of own doubt drift wood too now let be off bird be scarcer than usual wandered long distance before have made up anything like usual bag have be eight hour out godfrey said looking at watch may a well have meal before start back will take two three hour to get to boat again there will be loss of time take no longer cooking here than must there may a well carry bird inside a out be engaged in eating meal when jack suddenly gave angry growl looking up saw party of dozen samoyede with bow arrow at distance of fifty yard behind sprang to foot will shoot luka asked luka intention may be friendly besides though might kill three four of must riddle with arrow have best meet a friend when samoyede came up luka gave ordinary salutation of friendship where come from man who seemed to be leader of native asked suspiciously long way from east luka said pointing in direction who be ostjak luka said knowing that samoyede must have heard of tribe must know nothing of own who native asked pointing to godfrey friend of ostjaks luka said come to hunt shoot come with samoyede country native said not want ostjaks here do harm luka said go west far along not want samoyede country buy milk of samoyede good friend samoyede talked together then leader said come without appearance of hesitation godfrey luka set off with native language though differing from of northern ostjaks be sufficiently alike for to be able to understand other do think mean to be friendly godfrey asked in russian know luka replied perhaps not made up mind yet be going down to coast be comfort luka be going to west of boat suppose have encampment there expect heard gun have be following at distance until saw sit down must have seen luka said only one may have be following may have sent others back to fetch up rest from tent well doe not matter now have got if ask where came from a expect will have better tell luka came in boat will guess without telling will very likely look for be better to make concealment two hour walking brought to little valley in middle of ran small stream followed down for mile then at sudden turn saw sea in front of cluster of ten samoyede yourts herd of reindeer feeding on slope behind number of woman child five six old men came out to look at a approached sit down let talk leader said a reached village set example by seating by large fire godfrey luka at once did same ostjak friend have come very far said long distance luka replied have travelled many day be going to petchora have reindeer did walk way have reindeer came in boat will find along shore how far about hour walk must say samoyede gave order two of men at once left circle got into canoe paddled away stranger will stay here for day two have plenty of milk fish luka nodded be in hurry to go on have plenty of time to reach petchora before winter set in samoyede spoke to one of woman set to work to clear out one of tent chief got up walked away conference be evidently over three hour later saw canoe reappear at mouth of river with boat towing behind samoyede gathered on shore to examine evidently surprised at form size differed entirely from own be little craft capable of holding two at most tasted water at bottom of boat found to be fresh stove for cooking spoke for a there be firewood meat flour rough fur there seemed be necessary for journey when returned chief asked luka be that ostjak canoe yes be built much larger than canoe generally be a be for long journey presently woman brought large bowl of reindeer milk fried fish a be eating four of men who be standing behind suddenly threw upon godfrey luka while others closed in in minute be securely bound hand foot godfrey made struggle for felt that must be useless might result in being shot stabbed hatchet knife be taken from belt be then carried to tent thrown down jack have fought fiercely biting several of native until be struck with spear in shoulder by chief when limped off uttering piercing yell what do think mean to do with luka godfrey asked will hand over to russian do think cowardly blackguard wish now have fought at first wo hand to russian too far off think of that have taken for sake of hatchet knife of gun perhaps will keep to work for perhaps will cut throat be not pleasant look out way still if keep be safe to get away before long must hope for best wonder have taken ammunition other thing not know about pocket luka said must have taken if have two three hour later samoyede came in carefully examined captive lashing hand be tied behind with reindeer thong be so tightly bound that almost cut into skin foot be equally firmly lashed in few minute sound of talk ceased camp became quiet suppose be bedtime godfrey said if fool set guard over will soon be free how be that luka asked will gnaw through one of thong of course there can be difficulty about will give hour to get to sleep then will set to work what be ah jack be a dog crept in between with low whine poor old chap did best ca pat now roll to door look out luka there be three of sitting by fire will be darker presently will not see for although must scarcely be called night sun now dipped for hour two below horizon at midnight well see not see will go luka if be to be killed will be making fight for not having throat cut like sheep now think be more accustomed to chewing tough food than be so will roll over on face do set to work bite through thong luka sharp teeth cut through twisted hide in five minute be quarter of hour more before godfrey hand recovered usual feeling a soon a be efficient unfastened thong round companion wrist round foot now then luka put head out see if can see gun gun sure to be in chief tent luka said looked out ca see gun bow arrow be lying on ground by chief tent very well then have better crawl round fetch first will be something to begin fight with anyhow here will slit open tent behind with knife then can crawl along past others till get to chief tent without fellow at fire seeing be more afraid of beastly dog giving alarm than of men godfrey cut slit with pocket knife in reindeer skin covering then luka crawled out lay flat on stomach dragged along looking a godfrey thought in twilight just like seal have seen crawling over rock passed three of yourts then turned off in four five minute reappeared with bow quiver of arrow two native spear crawled back a carefully a have gone give knife godfrey godfrey handed to be not going to kill anyone luka if attack of course will shoot down in self defence must not have anyone killed in cold blood on account tartar shook head be not going to kill anyone looked into tent gun be leaning by side of chief woman child be lying round must get in will cut slit in skin take gun will be first rate if can manage luka can make good fight of if can manage to get gun godfrey be able to watch luka proceeding now stopped behind fourth tent placed ear against skin listened intently then inserted blade in skin two foot above ground very quietly with sawing motion cut downwards then began at top again made horizontal cut four five inch long then cut again down to ground removing flap of skin peered into tent then inserted arm moment later withdrew with gun then returned to godfrey latter first step be to charge gun for have fired two shot while luka be cooking meal before be surprised now luka do think have better do make for canoe go off on foot want big canoe luka said ca well do without have better go to think so too godfrey said if can once get on board can beat off of course there be more risk of being discovered that way think have better chance kept along for distance on side of hill then when about hundred yard from hut crawled down to river crept back along bank until reached boat be hauled up with native canoe on shore how be to get down luka godfrey whispered if stand up to carry down fellow by fire who be not twenty yard away must see if try to push down be safe to make noise wait moment give knife again luka said having obtained went along line of canoe cutting slicing skin from end to end then returned to godfrey ca follow now said once on board be safe have be thinking luka best plan will be to lie down one on side to hoist up a well a can move forward inch by inch luka nodded separated to carry out plan when jack decided matter by leaping on board sending paddle with rattle to bottom of boat jump up luka in with a sprang up there be shout from three native by fire be answered by fierce barking of two three score of dog after moment hesitation two of native rushed back to yourts for bow while third who happened to have close at hand fitted arrow discharged hastily a be running boat down missed mark before must shoot again boat be in water have sprang on board native ran down to edge with bow bent luka bow twanged man fell back with arrow through body seized paddle drove boat twenty yard into stream when whole of samoyede rushed down to bank began to discharge arrow illustration godfrey luka escaping from samoyede lie flat down luka godfrey said setting example stream will take there be great jabber of voice on bank chief be telling to take to canoe luka said laughing will hear shout directly water wo begin to come in through slit till put weight in canoe godfrey lifted head for moment saw five six of native on bank abreast of standing in readiness to shoot quickly a withdrew again two arrow struck boat within few inch of point where have looked over luka said must get little further out be afraid stream might set in towards bank will put cap upon piece of firewood hoist up will shoot at moment do must spring up give two three strong stroke to take further out lying flat on back at bottom of boat godfrey raised cap almost instantaneously there be three four sharp tap on side of boat one arrow passed through inch above chest in moment sat upright with paddle in hand couple of sharp stroke sent boat out into centre of current at moment heard series of yell splash lucky for luka laughed made slit so big if have got out farther must have be drowned people be not able to swim must think not godfrey said look a if water have ever touched from day be born be safe now in ten minute will be clear of river have only got to paddle back fetch canoe may have to fight yet luka said sure to follow meat flour be gone expect gave to dog be what made sleep so sound will know that will have to land somewhere to get food think will have then will mend canoe very quick of will come after will be worse for if do godfrey said with gun bow must keep score of canoe at distance still a say may have trouble in getting canoe however must have that if have to fight whole tribe for godfrey looked up from time to time must do so safely now for be fifty yard from bank there be time for to withdraw head before arrow must reach native however have ceased to follow boat having doubtless run back when heard companion cry godfrey thought a well not to take to paddle until be well out of river lest one might have run on hidden in clump of bush a soon a be out of river took up paddle rowed straight out for distance of couple of mile how long will be in patching up canoe luka will do in hour luka said woman will sew slit together men melt fat smear over very well then have better turn now make for place where canoe be hid wo expect to land so soon most of men will be waiting to follow with canoe if only four five follow along bank can manage easily enough fortunately canoe be light enough for one of to carry down to water while be doing that can keep off boat paddle lot heavier than other luka luka grunted in assent do think will know place where hid canoe godfrey asked presently let go close in to see luka said went ashore in fog know how look from sea coast be alike here must keep very close how far along do think be luka ca be much more than hour to paddle luka replied samoyede be away three hour to fetch boat be in hurry have to tow back with canoe for hour kept boat parallel with land then inclined towards shore presently luka said there be six men walking along on bank well there wo be six left to walk back godfrey replied grimly if interfere with now luka be nearly hour since turned will go in within hundred yard of shore bow of theirs be not like yours wo carry more than forty fifty yard now will just give gentleman hint that have better keep away from edge of cliff so saying laid down paddle took up gun fired aimed high a wished to frighten not hurt native instantly disappeared from edge now luka do keep on paddling will watch top of bank if one of show head will fire wo suspect have idea of landing will probably keep bit back want be time to land climb bank keep inshore now so that next time fire may be able to send bullet pretty close gun be not much use at more than fifty yard distance only once did godfrey see head above bank instant did so fired that will show be keeping sharp look out think will come near for little time now daresay be puzzling first why be coming way secondly why be keeping so close there be place where have tent luka exclaimed suddenly do see ash of fire be sure enough now run ashore dash up bank a soon a canoe touched shore leapt out ran up bank not twenty yard away be samoyede godfrey uttered shout raised gun to shoulder native with yell ran off at full speed now luka do go get canoe in water be careful if find heavy for with store on board take out there be occasion for hurry fellow wo venture within range of gun again will keep at distance send up word to tent that have landed so take time over if be to make slip damage canoe must be fatal to native stopped at distance of quarter of mile then a godfrey expected one of started at run back towards village in ten minute godfrey shout from below looking round saw canoe safely by side of boat ran down took place in paddled out towing boat behind chapter xvii sea fight a soon a have reached distance of two three hundred yard from shore godfrey ceased paddling now can talk matter over luka there be occasion for hurry now if fellow in canoe be disposed to fight ca prevent will certainly be out of river before must get back there even if did pas first must easily overtake for light craft of theirs must go two foot to one unless have wind for sail so may a well take thing easy decidedly first thing to do be to wash dress jack wound then to get tea something to eat have have nothing since be caught yesterday between twelve one o'clock what lucky thing be hid canoe luka went on a tartar pulled boat up alongside canoe began to prepare to light fire chance be must not have be able to get off a well a boat even if have must have taken out store meat might replace loss of tea tobacco above of match must have be terrible besides must have got spare hatchet knife fish hook line fur want fur for warmth now must make deal of difference to comfort if have to sleep on hard board know how to feel thankful enough that hid canoe away must not have gone without thing luka said must have fought killed rather than lose tea tobacco godfrey laughed at companion earnestness think must have be paying too dearly for luka still must have missed badly just a have finished meal saw black spot ahead of close inshore must not be surprised if have be picking up fellow who followed luka doubt man who ran back must tell must hing against arm think will dare attack in boat even if have got men there there be only twelve at first not counting old men who be in camp when be brought there shot one of so there be only eleven even if have got on board who followed have always heard that be plucky little fellow think must be fool enough to attack on water feel sure ca have intention of doing so expect original idea be to hover about night day then when went ashore to get food to steal boat hunt down now find have got second boat will see that be longer job than expected for will guess that real valuable be on board boat hid that may have enough provision here to last for time canoe a approached sheered off to distance of quarter of mile then gathered together evidently in consultation then turned paddled rapidly back again soon leaving canoe boat far behind wonder what be up to now godfrey said mischief have doubt perhaps more yourts on farther might send on man with fast reindeer long way ahead so that might attack with forty fifty canoe so might luka must be very awkward must be afraid of landing anywhere may pas news on from camp to camp for number of mile yes be very serious business only thing see for be to make right out beyond sight of land then push on a fast a can fortunately know anything about sail a left so fast just now will reckon that can not make much more than two mile hour while when get wind can go six if help with paddle may a well keep on a be at present a if determined to keep near land till at rate be distance past mouth of river there be not likely to be of camp for distance along for of course must always be near river a must have water for reindeer paddling quietly continued on course until have passed mouth of river when have gone mile saw nine canoe containing one man come out from river follow mean to stick to godfrey said uneasily be afraid be going to have lot of trouble with luka after paddling for two hour turned head seaward canoe did same in four hour more land have almost disappeared clump of canoe still maintained position behind be of use going out further luka be long way out of sight of one on shore now now let head west again hour later one of canoe left group paddled rapidly towards land be what game be godfrey said have sent off to tell friend ashore course be taking do what will will keep informed of may have fleet of canoe out at moment after do think must leave behind if be to cast off boat luka shook head decidedly canoe be very small paddle quick much quicker than must be very fast luka yes too many thing on board if threw over everything food kettle dog fur might go a fast a must even then think must beat well wo try anyhow luka must rather risk fight than see anything to do to wait for wind be not often calm like long have have three four day already if do get wind can certainly beat by cutting loose boat beat anyhow luka said with wind paddle might keep up with rowing very hard for bit men tire wind never tire sure to beat at last think will have wind before very long hope so luka not too much of well a ca get away from by paddling luka may a well lower line have only got two three day provision on board may just a well lay in stock while can hook be baited with piece of meat lowered paddle laid in scarcely be line out when godfrey felt fierce tug hulloa exclaimed have got something bigger than usual hauled up gave shout of satisfaction a pulled cod of fully ten pound weight from water five minute later luka caught one of equal size will do luka will throw mine into boat will keep yours on board now have got among cod there be fear of not getting plenty of food know catch enormous quantity off northern coast of norway be evident that come a far a water be time since tried deep sea fishing account for not having caught before be good fish luka asked have never seen like first rate luka especially if have oyster sauce to eat with a have must do without be capital be not full of bone like herring now will paddle on again leave fish alone jack will have of for supper there be dark line on water over there luka said presently wind coming be comfort luka hour later breeze came up to will get up sail godfrey godfrey did not reply for minute two yes think may a well luka whether go fast slow fellow will be able to send word on shore may a well tire bit sail be hoisted godfrey took sheet laid in paddle wind may freshen said must not do to fasten sheet luka who seemed tireless continued paddling boat went through water at considerably faster pace than before effect on pursuer be at once visible instead of paddling in leisurely manner in close group paddle must be seen to flash faster faster have to row pretty hard to keep up with now luka said looking over shoulder at up to now felt comfortable think everything right quite sure to catch presently now begin to see be not so easy after maintained relative position till sun be near horizon be ten o'clock luka sun will set in hour lay paddle in get cup of tea bit of dry meat have better boil kettle over one of candle then lie down to sleep for four hour after will take turn be deal better off than fellow behind must keep on paddling night a only have one man in boat there be relief for luka did a be ordered after drinking tea godfrey lighted pipe luka lay down godfrey did not feel very sleepy although have not closed eye night before have have long bout of sleep when compelled to keep tent by fog excitement of chase kept up now a grew dusk must see that canoe drew closer have hope in case of giving slip for be never perfectly dark when four hour later woke sky be brightening again more wind come presently tartar said looking at sky wo lie down just yet luka will be quite light in hour want to have good look towards shore before go to sleep luka at once took paddle wind be perceptibly freshening canoe be slipping fast through water now luka godfrey said presently stand up have look round be careful how do must not do to capsize now two minute later luka exclaimed see whole lot of canoe twenty thirty over there pointed towards shore somewhat ahead of sit down luka will stand up have look yes be a much a will do to cut off did not calculate on coming along so fast will luff up little more will pas ahead of however hard paddle so saying sat down hauled in sheet headed nearer to wind fellow behind wo see for time said canoe must be four mile away at least suppose must see other more than half distance being so low in water if have just little more wind must do nicely hour later sheet be eased again boat resumed former course a godfrey saw that must pas well ahead of canoe coming out from shore moved faster with wind abeam than did close hauled even while sitting down canoe must be seen now native be paddling hardest light craft danced over surface of water be now beginning to be ruffled by breeze hour later joined pursuer astern yell must be heard although be mile away godfrey counted a passed ahead of fleet there be thirty three canoe with two paddler yourts must be thick along coast here luka must have gathered up canoe from at least dozen camp now will lend hand eased sheet still further so that boat must heel over le fastened in loose knot must be slipped in instant then betook to paddle fellow behind have have long row out against wind have doubt be working hardest ever since caught sight of sail stern chase be long chase fancy wind have freshened little be very little occasionally looked back over shoulder be gaining slowly luka be good half mile behind still will take two three hour to pick up be quite sure now that if cut boat adrift can forge ahead hand over hand must be last resource be almost matter of life death to be able to keep with still be satisfaction to know that if worse come to worst can get away from jack fully entered into excitement of chase taking seat on covering near stern barking defiance at pursuer hour paddling space between canoe native be lessened by half now luka will send couple of bullet a reminder that have got weapon laying in paddle took gun turned round knelt looking astern fired barrel at fleet of canoe have not taken particular aim for gun be of little use at distance exceeding hundred yard motion of canoe must have prevented anything like accuracy of shooting even with rifle intended to frighten rather than to hurt gave gun considerable elevation saw however men in one of canoe cease paddling drop behind rest must make out that one of occupant be doing something hit one of canoe luka fancy be trying to patch up hole loaded gun again time with largest sized shot laid down resumed paddle have put in buck shot time luka want to kill of poor beggar shot will spread have put in double charge so a to give good dose a come up small shot must be of use must not get through thick leather coat of theirs now then let send along wind be certainly freshening for be not until four five mile have be traversed that canoe have crept up to within hundred yard distance at last godfrey felt be time to fire again waiting till canoe be within about seventy yard distance fired barrel slightly shifting aim between shot series of yell arose from canoe four five of at once dropped behind paddle hardest luka while load again beggar be coming up fast now native with yell of fury be sending canoe through foaming water be fifty yard away when again fired time five six of native dropped paddle two of canoe be upset volley of arrow fell thickly round boat one two spear skimmed along water close to godfrey seized paddle again head towards shore luka said a boat headed round slackened sheet so brought wind nearly dead aft boat be on even keel now must feel by lessened strain on paddle that speed be considerably increased in two three minute godfrey looked round canoe be hundred yard behind be gaining on luka ten minute interval be more than doubled be beginning to get tired godfrey said be going good deal faster of course now have got wind astern think be going a fast a did expect last dose of buck shot took heart out of good deal have reckoned that must be only able to fire once twice before came up must use bullet handful of buck shot evidently peppered good many of know if come up will have four more barrel at least among think fighting be over now hour canoe be mile astern land be now four five mile away godfrey thought that must safely resume course west especially a wind have distinctly freshened will lay in paddle now luka must give attention to sail expect will give up will think when see cease paddling that know can get away from whenever like godfrey surmise turned out correct native did not attempt to follow held on course straight for land paddling slowly now be in two division five six of canoe being good deal astern of others with single rower have followed so long having dropped behind to pick up occupant of canoe have capsized in several of canoe in division godfrey must make out that only one man be paddling guessed that other be more le disabled by shot think will be troubled more by said will be couple of hour before reach land by time will be out of sight even reindeer will hardly take news along shore with deep indentation a quickly a will sail besides fancy will come to conclusion that game be not worth candle now lay in paddle let have breakfast comfortably be just twelve o'clock day after day coasted along passed through waigatz strait between island of name mainland then touched at four island lying across mouth of large deep bay then held on until reached mouth of petchora distance to point from kara river be godfrey calculated about three hundred fifty mile took fifteen day to cover distance a stopped spent day shooting several time for be not fortunate along here in catching many fish a went on passing one of island godfrey seal flesh of found be by mean bad weather continued very fine there be so little wind during whole distance did not once put up sail depended entirely upon paddle upon one of shooting expedition godfrey have good luck to shoot very fine black fox have have meal be stretched at full length by fire luka have gone off to sleep godfrey be almost dozing when heard slight rustle in grass opening eye saw black fox standing at distance of ten pace have evidently be attracted by smell of fish have be frying stood with nose in air sniffing godfrey gun be lying beside left hand barrel always kept loaded with hand stole quietly to a grasped sat up fired snap shot at fox a turned darted away to surprise a well a delight rolled over there be piece of luck luka said a latter sprang to foot bow in hand at report be pure fluke for fired without raising gun taking least aim luka examined fox be one of largest ever saw said fur be in splendid condition skin will come in handy luka must put in replenish store at droinik at mouth of petchora be running very short of tea tobacco have be very extravagant lately have have flour since scamp robbed be very lucky jack be so sound asleep often scold jack for being such sleepy little beggar for once be lucky for if have heard fox coming must have be off without getting shot at accordingly when reached mouth of petchora landed three mile from droinik luka taking fox skin of other smaller animal have shot during excursion went into town returned with four pound of tea a much tobacco forty pound of flour two large tin kettle capable of holding gallon of water to carry extra supply sixty silver rouble be heartily glad be back luka for have be nearly eaten alive mosquito be awful worse think than at place have landed have indeed entirely given up sleeping ashore since forced stay on gulf of obi always pushing off two three hundred yard from shore anchoring for mosquito be terrible upon hunting expedition always smeared face neck hand thickly over with bear fat even with suffered severely nowhere indeed be mosquito so great scourge a along shore of arctic sea have already determined that must at rate make for kanin peninsula must then be guided by weather if still remained calm quiet must sail across entrance to white sea coast along until reached frontier of norway must be about four hundred mile from point of kanin peninsula if weather showed sign of changing must go up white sea to archangel must be about same distance two day paddling took to western mouth of bay course from here lay due west to kolgueff island nearly two hundred mile away godfrey did not hesitate to strike for a be seventy eighty mile saved there be risk of missing four long day paddling took there equal time brought to western point of kanin peninsula weather continued still clear sea be a smooth a glass there be sign of change september have begun hour be of importance therefore determined now to abandon boat made considerable difference in speed candle will do for cooking have still forty pound of dried flesh twenty of flour may expect to get few fish anyhow three kettle will hold two gallon half of water enough to last seven eight day in three day at most ought to strike coast again be sure to find stream running down to sea in very short time so will risk know that two of can send along good five mile hour accordingly dried meat flour be transferred to canoe kettle be filled up with fresh water after taking long drink letting jack lap a much a must take took seat in canoe again threw off tow rope started due west accustomed a now be to work muscle hardened by exercise sent boat rapidly through water must exert too much luka godfrey said after first quarter of hour long slow stroke be one to send along can keep up for time must do very best till sight coast again after way behaved in storm be not afraid of wind be horribly afraid of fog if have compass must not matter to one way other if fog came down when be good way off land there must be nothing to do to lay in paddle wait even if lasted for fortnight still a long a there be change of weather there doe not seem reason why fog must set in will not feel happy till have got land alongside of for three day paddle be kept going taking alternately six hour sleep working together for twelve jack having nothing to do be most uneasy of party sometimes lying down with nose between paw sometimes getting up giving series of short impatient bark early on second day be fortunate in passing through large shoal of herring godfrey laid in paddle attended to line in hour have forty five fish after paid further attention to fishing being now amply supplied with food herring too required le water than dried meat fried over candle whenever mouth be parched chewed piece of raw herring found great relief from jack be allowed two raw herring day with very small allowance of water did very well on third day light southerly wind sprang up at once hoisted sail found that eased labour materially must think ought to see land to night luka three day at eighty mile day be two hundred forty mile if see by evening must head little more to south of course can not depend very accurately on steering may have be going trifle north of west time be right for coast be making for keep on trending north be certain to hit sooner later at six o'clock have meal luka have be cooking then godfrey said now will have six hour sleep stood up to change place let luka come astern to steer when exclaimed look be that cloud ahead of be land land luka said after gazing at attentively be high land idea of sleep be given up godfrey seized paddle again in four hour be within mile of land differed widely from low coast have so long be passing steep hill rose from very edge of shore clad in many place with pine forest be not long before found suitable place to land soon have canoe ashore tent erected for night be already becoming unpleasantly cold luka went into wood soon returned with dried branch quantity of pine cone godfrey cut three stick made tripod from small kettle be suspended fish meat be soon grilling over fire a soon a kettle boiled handful of tea be dropped into be taken off fire three companion made excellent meal then luka godfrey lighted pipe sat smoking by fire for hour then lay down in tent for sound sleep when godfrey woke found that luka be already up have stirred up ember put on fresh wood filled kettle hung over fire have then evidently sauntered off into wood godfrey after luxury of rapid bathe began to prepare breakfast by time be ready luka came down with dozen squirrel have shot lot of in wood said if stop here three four day get lot of skin think must be much good to luka though shot will be useful for food have be obliged to stand with head over smoke of fire to keep off rascally mosquito face be so swelled with bite when woke must hardly see out of eye till bathed face with cold water sooner be off better if want to be eaten alive accordingly a soon a meal be finished packed up continued voyage after eight hour paddling came upon mouth of river must be seriberka godfrey said be only river marked in map anywhere about here will paddle mile two up fill kettle if be that river will come upon island few mile off coast in twenty thirty mile see luka how near be getting to end of map be not very much more than hundred mile from line be division between russia norway once land on other side of line be free in seven eight hour after leaving river godfrey said there be kildina island luka will land over there instead of upon shore there may be laplanders about there be russian place called kola about twenty mile up river little way past island native might take there if came upon for must not understand either ostjak samoyede dialect suppose must talk russian anyhow may a well be on safe side after coming seven eight thousand mile wo run risk of failure in last hundred much like look of sky away to north fancy be going to have storm thank god did not come two day earlier landed on island hauled up boat then godfrey took time in finding hollow where must light fire without risk of being seen on mainland a if there be lapp there might cross in canoe to see who have made have trouble in collecting plenty of drift wood along shore carefully choosing driest so a to avoid making great smoke lit fire erected tent to leeward of so that smoke might blow through so keep out enemy mosquito godfrey prediction about weather be speedily verified wind got up very rapidly in two hour be blowing gale from north fear of canoe coming across luka said fear at suppose there be real risk of in case feel more nervous now than have done time at rate storm have made perfectly safe there will soon be sea on canoe must face for three day storm raged be glad to resume fur jacket jack lay coiled up in fur in tent nothing must persuade to move except for breakfast dinner waited twelve hour after gale ceased to allow sea to go down then started again hoisting sail a there be enough wind to help chapter xviii home again godfrey felt in wild spirit a hoisted sail for end of journey be close at hand unless altogether unforeseen misfortune be to befall must have accomplished undertaking have be deemed almost impossible kept well out from land increasing distance a sailed west until be ten mile out for map showed that five twenty mile from point where have camped rocky peninsula jutted out in three hour must make out outline for land be bold high took four hour before be abreast of eastern point cape navalok then coasted along peninsula until arrived at cape kekour western point have now be paddling nearly twelve hour for godfrey be too impatient to be content with sail only just before arrived at cape luka seeing good place for landing suggested halt godfrey said will not risk landing have be marvellously fortunate up to now must be folly to run even slightest risk when be so near end of journey will keep on there be only thirty forty more mile to go then will enter voranger fiord then will be in norway think of luka can snap finger at russian tell everyone meet that have escaped from prison who will meet luka asked ah be more than can tell sooner meet one better norway be not like country have be passing along be covered with great mountain forest know anything about coast fancy be tremendously rocky must have poor chance there if caught in storm from north there be laplanders who be people just like samoyede who have got reindeer if find of a hope will ought to be all right have got hundred silver rouble if show man money make sign want to go somewhere much care where be pretty safe to take now take sleep luka will steer there be occasion to paddle wind be taking along nearly three mile hour time be particular object to now get three hour then will take three then will set to with paddle again eight hour later must make out high land on starboard bow knew that be approaching entrance to fiord have not taken to paddle again for wind have freshened be going fast through water luka cooked meal a be growing dark land closed in on side to distance of about eight mile hour later saw light on right hand hurrah godfrey exclaimed there be village there wo land to night might find difficult to get place to sleep in one night longer on board wo do harm thank god be fairly out of russia at last will land a free men in morning drew in towards shore mile so above light paddled cautiously on until close to land there dropped anchor overboard wearied out by long row be speedily sound asleep be broad daylight when woke godfrey when sat up gave loud cheer set jack off barking wildly look godfrey shouted be town there be two steamboat lying there thank god trouble be over have better get breakfast luka be of use going ashore till people be awake breakfast over anchor be at once pulled up in quarter of hour be alongside quay appearance be so similar to of lapp that must have attracted little notice canoe be so different in appearance to used by people that several person stood on little quay watching a came alongside surprise at boat be increased when godfrey came up on to quay laplander finn of height have ever be seen moreover face hand be clean addressed in language that did not understand replied first in english then in russian apparently recognized latter language one of motioned to godfrey to follow wait here till come back luka daresay people be honest enough want of fur
