sanderson replied passed close to saw that be about height build of course did not notice likeness man doe not know own face much anyhow only see full face doe know how look be civilian be yes believe so know that general be putting up at quarter have be here about week think be man from england traveling suppose to see world heard adjutant speak of a mr simcoe when be talking about affair of

changed bearer have have little ice between lip drink of lime juice water with dash of brandy in have known time whispered word two asking after other how be have doubt that will do be of course if fever doe not set in badly wound be not so severe a general be much younger man a must say with good constitution if there be complication ought to be about again in month time be perfectly sensible let lie quiet for day two after that must be a well if of who have met at general must drop in occasionally for short chat with of course must wait to see if there be going to be much fever did happen

general life killed animal be sadly hurt be about except that did not kill tiger metcalf colvin smith ran in firing together knocked over stone dead be extraordinarily plucky action of simcoe for have emptied rifle have nothing knife when ran in say so by jove be extraordinary act of pluck one must almost say of madness if have succeeded in drawing brute off mathieson so gaining time for others to come up be miracle that be killed well will not have quite so easy time of for bit of course murdock a senior officer will take command of brigade wo be half a considerate for comfort a mathieson have be be rather scoffer at what call new fangled way will be a likely to march men out in heat of day a at five in morning two sergeant who have be talking walked back together to quarter of be on brigade staff sanderson be paymaster clerk nichol worked in orderly room at sergeant mess conversation naturally turned on tiger hunt consequence have be in tough fight one of older men said know that ever felt badly scared one have time to think of when one be at work to rush in against wounded tiger with nothing empty gun hunting knife be not sort of job must like to tackle make one blood run cold to think of consider that everyone in brigade ought to subscribe day pay to get something to give man a token of admiration for pluck of gratitude for having saved general mathieson life there be general expression of approval at idea then sanderson said think be thing ought to be done be not for to begin if hear of anything of sort done by officer two three of might go up say that be general wish among non coms men to take share in must never do for to begin be right enough officer certainly must not like such thing to begin from below have better wait see whether there be movement way dare say that will depend great deal on whether general get over not opportunity did not come at end of five week mr simcoe be well enough to travel by easy stage down to coast acting upon advice that must for present give up idea of making tour through india have better take sea voyage to australia cape better still take passage home at once have day hour of leaving be known there be not white soldier in cantonment who must not have turned out to give hearty cheer although going on well doctor said that excitement must be avoided must be quite enough for to have to say good by to friend who have be in habit of coming in to talk with daily anything like public greeting by men must be likely to upset be not therefore until simcoe be way down river that departure became known to troop six week later there be sensation in cantonment general mathieson have so far recovered that be able to be carried up to hill camp be still growling at irritating order regulation of temporary successor in command when news spread that staff pay sergeant sanderson have deserted have obtained fortnight furlough saying that wanted to pay visit to old comrade at allahabad at end of fortnight have not returned staff paymaster have gone strictly into account found that there be deficiency of over l must of course be called upon to make good have indeed helped to bring about deficiency by placing entire confidence in sergeant by neglecting to check account regularly letter be at once written to head of police at calcutta bombay to principal place on road to port be felt that with start a have got chance be in favor be soon ascertained at allahabad that have not be there inquiry at various dak bungalow satisfied authority that have not traveled by land if have gone down to calcutta have gone by boat might have started on long land journey across to bombay have even made for madras distinct clew however must be obtained paymaster obtained leave went down to calcutta inspected list of passenger made inquiry a to there be then few white men in country save holding civil military position merchant at large port therefore there be not much difficulty in ascertaining identity of everyone who have left calcutta during past month unless indeed have taken passage in native craft to rangoon possibly singapore on arrival at calcutta heard of event caused deep general regret when known at benares for time threw even desertion of sergeant sanderson into shade nepaul in john simcoe have sailed have be lost in typhoon in bay of bengal when six day out there be possible doubt a to fate for vessel mile distant have seen founder must render assistance being dismasted unmanageable sea so tremendous that boat must have lived in for moment a ship belonged to east india company be well known to other captain official of ceylon have doubt whatever a to identity indeed remains of boat bearing nepaul name be picked up few day later near spot where have gone down be hard luck be what call sergeant nichol said with great emphasis when matter be talked over in sergeant mess here be man who face wounded tiger with nothing hunting knife recovers from wound here be general whose life saved going on first rate yet loses life drowned at sea call about a hard luck a anything have heard of hard luck indeed said if have died of wound must have be only what might have be expected to get over then to get drowned almost a soon a have started be a say nichol very hard luck be sure general will be terribly cut up about heard major butler tell captain thompson that have heard from dr hunter when general began to get round heard that simcoe have gone while be lying there too ill to know anything about regularly broke down cried like child be sure fact that will never have chance of thanking now will hurt a bad a tiger claw so there be news of sanderson not have heard maybe have got clean away must say be more likely that be lying low in sailor haunt until matter blow over then like enough will put on sea togs ship under name before mast in trader knocking about among island by time come back must take passage home without question being asked be sharp fellow be sanderson never quite liked never thought be rogue will teach captain smalley to be more careful in future heard that be going home on long leave in spring suppose will not be able to do so now for year so three hundred pound be big sum to have to fork out news of loss of nepaul with hand did indeed hit general mathieson very heavily for time seriously delayed progress that be making towards recovery be bad enough to think said that will never have opportunity of thanking gallant fellow for life be even worse to know that rescue have brought about death for have not be for that must have by time be up at delhi in oude instead of lying at bottom of sea must give half fortune to grasp hand again tell what feel general mathieson ill luck stuck to gained strength so slowly that be ordered home be three year before rejoined four year later daughter came out to for time home in delhi where be now stationed be happy one girl showed desire to marry refused several very favorable offer

excellent nurse be obtained boy throve under care general now much regretted having remained so many year in india if old comrade remarked never must make out why stuck to so long mathieson be ridiculous for man with large private fortune such a have must reply can only suppose be because be old fool see have particular reason for coming home lost only sister three year after went out have never seen only daughter niece mary covington of course hoped for bout of active service when chance came at last up in north there be stuck down in calcutta if have be for jane must certainly have given up in disgust when found be practically shelved always used to come down stay with for month two in cool season a be only person in world cared for held on from year to year grumbling of course a pretty well anglo indian doe without having sufficient resolution to throw up ought to have stayed at home for good after mauling got from tiger see be never really while be at home did not feel up to going to club must not enter into london life at spent most of time at own place be within drive of mary covington who have then just married well see got deucedly tired of life down there knew nothing whatever of farming though tried to get up interest in failed altogether of course there be certain amount of society of sort everyone called one have to go out to dinner party such dinner party why dinner in india be worth score of most of be very stiff formal after woman have gone upstairs men talked of nothing hunting shooting crop cattle so at last must stand no longer threw up six month of furlough went out again yes of course have jane at time be fourteen be girl at school when talked of bringing home having governess everyone seemed to think that must be worst thing possible for doubt be right for life must have be a dull for a be for of course now be different feel a young a well a did twenty year ago can thoroughly enjoy life in london though still fight very shy of country be satisfaction to to know that thing be pretty quiet in india at present so be losing nothing way if be out there must be only holding inspection at barrakpoor dumdum on maidan at calcutta of course be pleasant enough in way for never felt heat a man get on in life doe have quite so much enjoyment out of a used to do men around be good deal younger than know old messroom joke one bit of

captain bulstrode got company within few day of other of course be only lieutenant colonel while be major general be because have good sense to quit service year ago there be score of others in club just about own standing one get one rubber of whist in afternoon dine together run down cooking wine although one of know at heart that be infinitely better than got in india except at club in presidency town then of course agree that service be going to dog that sepoys be over indulged will day give lot of trouble keep liver right by taking long ride morning altogether think can say that thoroughly enjoy general on first visit to england have endeavored in vain to find out family of john simcoe have advertised largely without effect want to find out said to niece owe man debt of gratitude can never repay doubtless there be of family who may be in circumstance where must give helping hand there may be young brother of course must get cadetship in indian army maybe portionless sister if be traveling in india for pleasure must have be well to do young fellow men can not wander about in east without having pretty full purse yes doubt fancy be so in case said casually that have come in for money a have always have great desire to travel thought that must hing better than spend year two in east that hoped before be gone must fall on leg obtain sort of employment did not care much what be so that be not quill driving thought that must turn hand to most thing laughed at time for be by mean sure that be in earnest have felt since that must have be if have not be so advertisement must surely have caught eye of someone who knew family family wealthy enough for one of son to start on two year travel must be in fair position whether in town country have be so must have heard of therefore think that what said must have have foundation in fact be certainly gentleman in manner idea now be that belonged to middle class family probably in provincial town that having come into money at death of father other relative followed natural bent started on sort of roving expedition thinking a many people do think that india be land where have only to stretch out hand shake pagoda tree must have found out mistake poor fellow if have lived day be long past when dashing young adventurer can obtain post of honor in pay of indian rajah still of course after what did for have remained in india found that really wanted berth might have done something for know number of indian prince of intimately to have be of very considerable service fancy might have got berth of kind other without much difficulty have made up mind to return to england must have set up in business have fancy for have gone now wish must pay someone cared for little of debt of gratitude owe well have done best have failed from fault of own remember that if ever hear of family of name of simcoe want to make inquiry about to give full particular concerning news ever reached general on head be frequent cause of lamentation to when finally settled in town that although have again advertised have heard nothing of family of be in search chapter ii in south sea island in pacific sun be shining down from cloudless sky sea be breaking on white beach there be just sufficient breeze to move leaf of cocoanut tree formed dark band behind sand small brig of about hundred ton burden lay anchored short distance from shore paint be off in many place everywhere blistered by sun sail hung loosely in gasket slackness of rope general air of untidiness alike showed absence of sort of discipline on board in front of rough shanty built just within line of shade of cocoanut sat three men two drunken sailor lay asleep fifty yard away on stump of tree in front of bench on three men be sitting be placed several black bottle three tin pannikin while two gourd filled with water covered with broad banana leaf stood erect in hole dug in sand tell what be atkins men be carrying on too far bill here be good friend with native chief gave wife got on well enough with with cocoanut be free to patch of ground to cultivate have wanted with store of bead bright cotton brought here with paid native to

musket shot must send flying see though be men have share do pretty much a like at present like to stay here suppose will stay here till be tired of well atkins if be in place must very soon make change if like bill will help have got six men well if shot three of other three must think better of if did must settle too be very well talking like sim how must sail brig without hand if only kept three of must be very short handed if ever did manage to get to port must lay complaint against for shooting others be very well for to talk have lived here long enough to know that one can only get very worst class of fellow to sail with one in craft like for sort of trade pay well if one get back safely what with risk of being cast ashore being killed by native who be savage enough in of island stand to reason that man who can get berth in other sort of craft wo sail with be just sort of life to suit chap like mean easy work plenty of loafing about if thing turn out well good lump of money at end of voyage however ought to have have enough of job rum be nearly gone if will come off to morrow will let have what remains though if be sober doubt if will let take away will risk that third

mind to wipe white out altogether said that if have be here brig must not have come be like enough for atkins only put in because be old chum of ours thought that must have got copra enough to make

away when have done stood at table ate remains of supper hour later man be sitting on bench outside smoking pipe when heard sound of heavy footstep among tree knew be native tread what be bill asked a man came up well came to tell that there be big row going on among native can hear tom tom thing beating furiously occasionally set up tremendous yell tell like simcoe like bit sent woman to see what be about though have be away three hour have come back when started out to talk over with there have be biggish row going on on board brig too other said have heard atkins storming good deal of shouting among men suppose have got pearl right in belt thing begin to have awkward look may have to bolt at short notice trust for simcoe have have on ever since brig came in have fear of native stealing out of hut if one of fellow be to drop in see must think nothing of knifing woman carrying off see have brought gun with yes pistol too suppose be loaded ready to catch up at moment notice yes girl have be carrying down cocoanut plantain to canoe so if have to make bolt can hold on comfortably enough until get to next island be not above three day sail lie dead to leeward a wind be at present still bill hope be not coming to think be likely enough may attack brig in canoe have always be so friendly with really think can turn against now must know that can not help people doings be very well other said know dozen case in nigger have attacked ship in case beachcomber be killed too simcoe made answer knew that be so must hardly hope that there must be exception in case after thinking for minute said well bill in case think safest plan will be to take to canoe at once can stay away few week then come back here see how matter stand how about atkins well will shout get ashore tell what think of give choice of stopping going with nothing can be fairer than if chooses to stop harm come of can not blame if come back in few week of course must not land until have overhauled one of canoe found out what feeling of people be will have got over fit of rage like enough will have said to other be better off when two white men be here paid for fishing copra never did harm wish be back again be reasonable enough other agreed what about trade thing well have only got bead small knick knack left polly will carry down to canoe will want for trading till come back here again said few word to woman who at once began to carry thing down to canoe then went down to beach shouted atkins hullo came back from brig come ashore want to talk to about something particular saw

now know be slow unless be blowing gale be like enough that native may be watching now if saw get under way must be after must go six foot to one a to fighting what must three do others must be of use whatever like plan best by far well know what to say atkins said be hard to make choice of course if be sure that native really meant mischief must go with can not be sure of feel pretty sure of anyhow bill said girl must be safe to follow here when got back found hut empty be mightily afraid that harm have come to must have be back long before be mile to go might have be there back in hour have be gone now over three hour feel nasty about can tell wish crew be sober atkins that have score of men must put hand on among island must not be talking about taking to canoe then must just go in give so hot that must never try prank on again have got thing in polly simcoe asked woman a crouched down by door of hut got in said why not go very bad wait here well think be about right at rate will go get on board wait spear throw off shore for hour so if bill susan come here find have gone be pretty safe to guess that will be on board canoe waiting for what do say to bill that suit nothing

amusement when hilda covington be ten year old have after severe attack of scarlet fever lost hearing though parent consulted best specialist of time remedy proved of avail at last must only express hope rather than opinion that in time with added health strength nature might repair damage year after illness mr covington heard of aurist in germany who have european reputation mr covington took hilda over to after examining said mischief be serious not think irreparable be case requiring great care a to dieting exercise clothing if must be managed must like to examine ear once fortnight once month at least have house here where patient live when under treatment must not for moment advise being placed there child to keep in good health requires cheerful companion if will call again to morrow will think matter over let know what recommend mr mr covington retired much depressed opinion be perhaps little more favorable than that have received thought that only child must either make considerable journey once month live there altogether be very painful to however on talking over agreed that be far better that must reside in hanover for time with hope of coming back cured than must grow up hopelessly deaf will only be a if be at school here mr covington said will doubt be taught to talk german french even if be never able to converse in language will add to pleasure if can read next day when called upon doctor said if can bring to part with child have think found very thing to suit in first place must know that there be in town establishment conducted by professor menzel for instruction of deaf mute be quite new system consists in teaching to read from lip of person speaking to word that be saying system be by mean difficult for who have still like daughter power of speech who have lost only hearing even born deaf dumb have learned to be able to converse to certain degree though voice be never quite natural for in nine case out of ten deaf mute be mute only because have never learned to use tongue however happily be beside question in daughter case hope that will regain hearing must unfortunately not be case will at least be great mitigation to position to be able to read from lip of who address what be said therefore to converse like ordinary person can assure that many of herr menzel pupil can converse so easily rapidly that one must have least idea of misfortune from suffer a in fact feel inconvenience beyond fact that be not aware of being addressed by anyone standing behind whose face happen to be watching must indeed be blessing mr covington exclaimed never heard of system be quite new a to success there can be question called upon professor menzel last evening said that a daughter did not understand german difficulty of tuition must be very great have however among pupil young english girl two year older than daughter life with maiden aunt who have established here in order that niece might have benefit of learning new system here be name address professor have reason to believe that income be small one imago that must gladly receive daughter a boarder niece who be bright girl must be pleasant companion moreover having in two year that have be here made very great progress must be able to commence daughter education by conversing with in english must act a teacher in german also so soon a language be fairly

loses patience must be delightful before going to see miss purcell mr mr covington talked matter over together agreed that if miss purcell be sort of person with whom hilda must be happy plan must be better than proposed certainly must not be nice for mr covington said to be living on second floor in street have always be accustomed to be so much in open air a doctor agree that much depends upon

there of course must pay liberal sum for board if must agree must say that must be best that must treat house a ours must pay expense of keeping up altogether suppose keep servant at present there be many little luxury that hilda have be accustomed to then of course must pay so much to niece for teaching hilda german beginning to teach system suppose whole thing must cost more than three hundred

must turn up when money be gone be out week have fair sport a have often heard say be passionately fond of big game shooting have have many narrow escape in course of life never have so narrow one a happened to on occasion have wounded tiger have lost have spent couple of hour in beating jungle without success have agreed that brute must not have be hit a hard a have believed must have made off altogether be within fifty yard of edge of jungle when there be sudden roar before must use rifle tiger sprang be not in howdah on pad tiger struck one of forepaw on knee with other clung for moment to pad then went down together brute seized by shoulder sprang into jungle again carried dozen yard so then lay down still holding by shoulder be perfectly sensible felt somewhat dazed stupid found vaguely thinking that must after have be very badly hit instead of making off have hid up within short distance of spot where saw be unable to move hand foot for be lying on weight be pressing life out of know that vaguely hoped must die before took bite at shoulder suppose that whole thing did not last minute though to seemed interminable time suddenly there be rustling in bush with deep growl tiger loosed hold of shoulder rising to foot faced half round what happened after that only know from hearsay simcoe seems be riding in howdah on elephant behind mine a tiger sprang at elephant fired hit beast on shoulder be that doubt that caused hold to relax brought to ground together a tiger sprang with into jungle simcoe leaped down from howdah followed have only empty rifle large hunting knife be easy work pushing way through jungle in minute came upon clubbing gun brought down on left side of tiger head before brute who be hampered by broken shoulder weak from previous wound must spring have not be that be right shoulder be broken blow heavy a be must have have little effect upon brute a be having support on side reeled half over then with snarling growl sprang upon assailant simcoe partly leaped aside striking again with barrel of gun butt have splintered with first blow so far turned aside that instead of receiving blow direct must certainly have broken in skull fell in slanting direction on left shoulder force be sufficient to knock down a fell drew knife tiger have leaped partly beyond so that lay under stomach must not for moment use teeth claw pressure be terrible with last remaining strength drove knife to full length of blade twice into tiger body animal rolled over for moment there be still life in again sprang to foot when couple of ball struck in head fell dead three officer have slipped down from howdah when saw simcoe rushing into jungle coming up just in time fired so finished conflict there be not much to choose between simcoe though have certainly got worst of flesh of arm have be pretty well stripped off from shoulder to elbow shoulder have be broken flesh torn by brute teeth a have not shifted hold from time first grasped till let go to face simcoe be not so bad a might have be wound on leg be more serious claw have struck just above knee cap have completely torn off be insensible when be lifted up carried down to camp in fortnight simcoe be about be month before must walk again a know right leg be still stiff have very narrow escape of life fever set in when simcoe went down country month after affair be still lying between life death never have opportunity of thanking for manner in practically unarmed went in to face wounded tiger in order to save life may imagine then regret when month later got news that nepaul in have sailed have be lost with hand be gallant action indeed uncle told something about soon after came here when happened to ask how be that walked so stiffly did not tell so fully what be going to do now be going to settle in london have be a say knocking about in east ever since being engaged in sort of adventure have be for time in service of native chief way up near border of burmah siam china somehow got possession of large number of ruby other precious stone have turned into money now intends to take chamber settle down to quiet life join club so on of course promised to do in power to further object to introduce into a much society a cared for what be like uncle be about height suppose about five forty though look rather older wonder after life a have led carry well be altogether much more presentable than must expect under circumstance indeed have not known that have never served must unhesitatingly have put down a having be in army there be something about way carry shoulder that seldom see except among men who have be drilled be coming here to dine to morrow so will see relief of anxiety uncle for know have letter morning from colonel fitzhugh saying that have be unexpectedly called out of town said that must ask somebody at club to fill place know very often forget thing that ought to remember certainly have forgotten that when asked to come a came home blamed for not having asked someone else so a to make up even number month later mr simcoe have become intimate of general mathieson house have always be matter of deep regret to general that have be unable to thank man who at terrible risk to life have saved from death that feeling be heightened when news came that preserver have be drowned that opportunity of doing so be forever lost now spared pain to further wish constantly invited to lunch dinner at club introduced to friend in term of highest eulogium repeated over over again story of heroic action a own club be military one must not propose there have difficulty in getting friend to propose support for two other club of good standing several of officer to whom introduced simcoe have be at benares at time be hurt recognized at once be able to chat with of mutual acquaintance indeed surprised by knowledge of matter at station that must hardly have thought must be known to one who have made short stay there one of said a much simcoe said laughing forget be laid up for month everyone be very good to have generally one two men sitting with amount of gossip picked up about station be wonderful of course there be nothing else to talk about a have good memory think must tell something about private affair of pretty nearly civilian military man on station everyone agreed that simcoe be very pleasant amusing companion be full of anecdote of wild people that have lived among of adventure escape have gone through although none of benares friend of general recognized simcoe when first met speedily recalled feature instant recognition of acquaintance with person scene at around benares be such that never for moment doubted identity a remembrance of general visitor returned even wondered that recognition of have not be a instant a of a to mean not even to general have simcoe explained exact position have taken good apartment in jermyn street gave excellent little dinner there kept undeniably good wine equally excellent cigar dressed well be regarded a being thoroughly good fellow general be not close observer have be so must speedily have noticed that niece although always polite courteous to mr simcoe did not receive with warmth pleasure with greeted who be favorite on part visitor spared pain to make agreeable to must at once volunteer to execute commission for if happened to mention in presence anything that wanted one evening when be going to ball sent expensive bouquet of flower next day when saw said be very much obliged to for lovely flower carried bouquet last night please send more think that be quite nice to accept present from anyone except very near relation be very kind of to think of must really rather that did not do again uncle give carte blanche in way of flower avail of very largely for scent be apt to make feel faint beyond smallest spray seldom carry made exception last night for sent be most lovely mind saying that do not at miss covington quite understand what mean seemed natural to to send flower out in pacific island especially at samoa tahiti indeed more le everywhere woman wear profusion of flower in hair present be so acceptable to fancy flower cost so much there a do here mr simcoe no latter laughed for dollar one can get enough to render girl envy of others think be right to ask mr simcoe not to repeat present hilda general said particularly noticed bouquet that carried last night yes uncle there be nothing equal to in room must have cost three four guinea think that quite like do hilda like uncle because saved life in other respect know that do like particularly be very pleasant very amusing feel that quite understand how do mean that understand can not quite explain uncle to begin with seem to get nearer to mean to what really be know more of adventure life than did know more of than did three month ago when first met at dinner at rate know that be general said somewhat gravely yes know that of course man can be brave exceptionally brave yet not posse other good quality did behave like hero in case need not say that feel deeply grateful to for service that rendered still be only side of nature that feel certain about pooh pooh hilda general said with irritation what do know about nine tenth of men meet can not even tell that be brave uncle know only side choose to present to be pleasant side care to know more be different in case mr simcoe be here nearly day have become one of inner circle be naturally deeply interested in be therefore interested in also want to know more of than have got to know be brave pleasant be also honest honorable be man of thoroughly good principle know what tell of life adventure only tell what chooses general shrugged shoulder dear child may say same thing of pretty nearly unmarried man meet when man marries set up household one doe get to know something about there be wife relation who a rule speak with much frankness concerning man who have married daughter sister cousin a to bachelor a rule one have to take at own valuation of course know more than do a to whether simcoe be in respect honorable gentleman be quite sufficient that saved life almost at sacrifice of own life may have led since be business of mine be distinctly popular among have introduced to be not likely in way to discredit introduction that hilda be not entirely satisfied be evident by letter wrote when uncle have a usual gone up one afternoon to club dear netta have told several time about mr simcoe who saved uncle life out in india who be so intimate at house ca say that acquaintance with liking for increase doe not stand test of system more watch lip le understand talk fluently quickly yet somehow feel that there be hesitation in speech that lip be repeating what have learned not speaking spontaneously know that have noticed same thing among who have learned to speak by system be not yet perfect in so need not explain further what mean a will understand for example can always tell at public meeting when listening to preacher whether be speaking absolutely extemporarily whether have learned speech by heart beforehand really strongly misdoubt man of course know that saved uncle life beyond know nothing of be very feeling that do know nothing disquiet can no more see into than can into stone wall can quite understand that be of very great importance to to stand well with general came here stranger with queer history knew one have money wanted to get into society through uncle have done so have be elected to two club have made great number of acquaintance go to row royal academy theater so on be at rate on nodding term with very large number of people owes to uncle fail to see what else can wish for must be natural with so many other engagement that must not come to so often a used to do there be falling off in respect be tame cat of establishment dare say think silly to worry over such thing ca help worrying hate thing understand understand man thing be walter doe not like constantly brings child toy walter doe not take to refuse absolutely to sit upon knee to be petted by in way always think that be bad sign when child wo take to man however will not bother more about now will keep out of letter a much a can wish must keep out of mind also a tell over over again be nothing to whether posse virtue none of be at rate must be matter of indifference to ca help wishing that have come over here two month later then must have have benefit of advice opinion for know netta how accustomed be for year to consider almost if not quite infallible chapter vii john simcoe friend there be great sensation among frequenter of house in elephant court when be told that wilkinson have sold business new proprietor must come in at once feeling among who be in debt be one of absolute dismay for seemed to certain amount must be at once called in to surprise relief wilkinson went round among foreigner whose debt in case exceeded five pound handed to note of hand be going out of business said will be leaving for abroad in day so might of course have arranged with new man for to take over paper might not be a easy a have be must not like of to get into trouble have never pressed anyone since have be here still le taken anyone into court must like to leave on friendly term with so here be paper tear up be fool enough to borrow again towards english client whose debt be generally from ten to twenty pound took same course adding little good advice a to dropping billiards play altogether making fresh start have have sharp lesson said know that have be on thorn for last year wanted to show folly be to place in power of anyone to ruin fancy have succeeded very well there be harm in game of billiards now then if can not play without betting have better cut altogether a for table be simply madness must lose in long run be quite sure have got out of several time amount of o u hold never be men more surprised more relieved must hardly believe that be once more free men until fresh set of player have succeeded billiard room be frequently almost deserted to dawkins wilkinson be somewhat more explicit know said interest took in will of general mathieson be not will so much a man be so interested in showed that be most liberally disposed to who have done service now happens that year ago when be at benares saved life from tiger got mauled in doing so have not thought of matter for many year mention of name recalled to have name in day men often change name when knock about in queer place a have done however called upon expressed most grateful need not say that did not mention billiard room to naturally supposed that have just arrived from abroad have offered to introduce to many of friend think have good chance of being put down in will for decent sum brought money home with from abroad have made goodish sum here so will resume proper name go west drop affair altogether be not likely to come against of crew here a see removed false beard whisker from face have shaved though got hair to wear until have finally cut court so see have unintentionally done considerable service in return will say nothing about fifty pound owe now lad try keep straight in future may not get out of scrape a have out of ask be that will not mention what have told to anyone else there be fear of being recognized with clean shaven face different toggery altogether at rate be a well that everyone must believe that a have given out have gone abroad again will keep o u promise that will hear more of a long a hold tongue a to what have just told possibly may day need assistance in case will know where to write to be not until after great deal of thought john simcoe have determined thus far to take dawkins into confidence concluded at last that be safest thing to do be a knew often sent by firm with communication that might have to make to client must meet at general might recognize give trouble have made secret that have turned hand to many calling that doings in southern sea must not always bear close investigation fact that have once kept billiard room must do special harm a to will dawkins certainly must not venture to own that have repeated outside what have be done in office man might be useful to in future be more than probable must again involve in debt be just weak empty headed young fellow who might be made convenient tool must require one so elephant court knew mr wilkinson more certainly none of habitue must have recognized in smooth shaven faultlessly dressed man whom might meet coming out of west end club dawkins often turned matter over in mind after first relief have passed at finding debt have weighed so heavily upon perfectly wiped out there ought to be money in said to see where come in in first place must not say have kept gambling place without acknowledging have often be there must not say that be conversation of mine about general will put into head to call upon lastly have on hip with o u possibly if general doe leave money may manage to get out of though be by mean sure of that be not safe man to meddle with might certainly do more harm than must do matter have dropped somewhat from mind when three month later general mathieson came into office to have interview with principal after have left managing clerk be called in on returning handed dawkins sheet of paper will prepare fresh will for general mathieson be to run exactly a at present legacy be to be inserted after to miss covington might just a well have be put in codicil general preferred to have in body of will dawkins looked at instruction contained word to john simcoe at present residing at jermyn street bequeath sum of ten thousand pound a token of gratitude for heroic conduct in saving life at cost of great personal injury to from grip of tiger in year by jove have done well for dawkins muttered a sat down to desk after managing clerk have handed general will from iron box containing paper document relating to affair ten thousand pound wish must light upon general in fix of sort though know must care about tiger be wonderful what luck men have ought to get something out of if must see way to fancy keeper of billiard room gaming house coming in for such haul a be disgusting set about preparing draft of will found difficult to keep attention fixed upon work when chief clerk ran eye over looked up in indignant surprise what on earth be matter with mr dawkins thing be full of most disgraceful blunder in several case be not even sense during time have be in office have never have disgraceful piece of work come into hand before why if office boy have be told to make copy of will must have done vastly better what doe mean be very sorry sir dawkins said feel very well to day have got headache can scarcely see what be writing well well superior said somewhat mollified that will account for thought at first that must have be drinking have better take hat be off go to nearest chemist take dose then go home lie down be worse than of use in state that be hope that will be right in morning for be a know very busy at present can not spare hand tear up draft hand will instruction to mr general will be down here at ten o'clock to morrow to see be like most military men sharp prompt when want thing done expects to have done at once be feeling better hope morning said when dawkins came into office at usual hour next day though must say that look far from well do think that be capable of work think so sir at rate head be better be true that clerk did not look well for have have sleep night have tossed restlessly in bed endeavoring in vain to hit on manner of extracting portion of legacy from ex proprietor of gambling house more thought more hopeless seemed prospect john simcoe be eminently man whom must be unsafe to anger promptness decision of method have gained at least respect of frequenter of establishment just a have sternly kept order there so must deal with individual who crossed path held best card too while disclosure of past must hardly injure seriously have mean of causing ruin disgrace of dawkins if ventured to attack clerk be shrewd in own way have sense to feel that be match for john simcoe conclusion that finally came to be that must wait watch event so far a must see only chance of obtaining penny of legacy be to follow implicitly instruction simcoe have given in case possibly might receive present when money be paid about fortnight after knew will have be signed by general mathieson simcoe went down to small house on pentonville hill where one of ablest criminal in london resided passing unsuspected under eye of police in character of man engaged in business in city peculiar knock brought to door ah be simcoe said why have not seen for month did not know for moment for have taken hair off face have made change harrison have given up billiard room be now swell with lodging in jermyn street be change thought said billiards card paid well suppose have got something better in view did pay well have very big thing in hand be right line to take up other

about fortunately dr pearson who always attends be one of party sent off cab for two others dr pearson came home with of course asked what be said that be very unusual case that other doctor have not yet come to decision upon a none of have ever seen one precisely like said that of symptom be of epileptic fit convulsion be so violent that rather resembled tetanus than ordinary fit altogether seemed greatly puzzled must give opinion a to whether be likely to recur uncle be better to day told that mr simcoe four others have be dining together have just drunk coffee when room seemed to swim round remembered nothing more until found in bed at home mr simcoe came home with doctor said must acknowledge that one must have be kinder than be looked quite ill from shock that have have still like netta in fact think dislike more more day often tell have not shadow of reason for doing so ca help may call prejudice call instinct can well imagine how have shocked uncle seemed so strong well have always thought must live to great age be sixty eight be sure look ten year younger at least did so at present might be ninety can only hope that change be temporary that will soon be dear self again three doctor be going to have meeting here to morrow will be anxious indeed to hear result hope that will order change that can go down together either to place mine then can always be with whereas here go way go mine except at meal time scarcely meet if doe go will try persuade to engage medical man to go with of course know whether doctor must be of actual use in case of attack must be great comfort to have one always at hand letter stopped here be continued on following evening consultation be over dr pearson have long talk with afterwards said that be without doubt epileptic fit that differed in many respect from general type of malady that of be to extent puzzled have brought with fourth doctor sir henry havercourt who be greatest authority on such malady have seen uncle asked few question have talk with dr pearson have from minute account of seizure pronounced most interesting a far a knew unique case expressed wish to come a friend to see how general be getting on of course inquired about habit asked what have have for dinner so on 'the great point dr pearson ' said after consultation be over 'be of course whether there be likely to be recurrence of attack 'that be more than can say answered gravely 'at present can hardly be said to have recovered altogether from effect of one be in unusual feature in case a rule when person recovers from epileptic fit recovers altogether be to say be able to walk talk a before face show little sign of struggle that have undergone in case recovery be not altogether complete may have noticed that voice be not only weak there be certain hesitation in face have not altogether recovered natural expression be slightly very slightly drawn on one side must seem to point to paralysis while in other respect attack be a unlike paralytic stroke a must well have be thus see be difficult in extreme for to give positive opinion concerning case be so entirely exceptional one can only hope for best trust to strength of constitution at rate agree that need absolute quiet very simple plain diet see have be great diner out though abstemious man in way of drinking thoroughly appreciates good dinner must be given up at rate for time must say that a soon a be little stronger have better take down into country let see a few visitor a possible only very intimate friend mean that must be lonely left to on contrary quiet companionship talk be desirable ' said that though country might be best for there be medical man within three mile of place must be terrible be to have attack not know what to do for said that doubted if anything must be done when be in such state a be other night beyond sprinkling face with water that felt powerless in case of attack be altogether beyond experience of course said be out of question must be down there alone with must take down experienced nurse strongly recommended that must not wear hospital uniform a must be constant reminder of illness said must very much like to have medical man in house money be object seemed to from what said that must also be desirable that besides being skillful doctor must be also pleasant agreeable man who must be cheerful companion to a well a medical attendant agreed that must certainly be very desirable that others be anxious that case must be watched very carefully said that must think matter over that if must not find just man must suit must ask sir henry havercourt to recommend one said there be many clever young men to whom engagement for few month must be godsend intended to run down once fortnight from saturday until monday must do a practice be to large extent consulting one must see plainly enough that though evidently put a good face upon a must other doctor took by mean hopeful view of case be most dreadful netta can hardly realize that only three day ago everything be bright happy while now seems that everything be uncertain dark there be one thing doctor said that pleased be let of town friend in to see think that must be a well that none of must go down to visit in country let be kept altogether free from anything must in smallest degree excite set brain working ' told that one have seen yet must take good care that one must see need hardly tell that mr simcoe will be first person to be informed of doctor order week later general mathieson came downstairs for first time change in be even greater than have seemed to be when be lying on sofa in room tom robert who have be general soldier servant year before have be in service since left army have difficulty in restraining tear a entered with master leaning heavily on arm be shaky dear hilda very shaky general said feel just a did when be laid up with bad attack of jungle fever in india however doubt will pick up soon just did then pearson tell that others agree that must go down into country suppose must obey order where be be to go to own place uncle own place repeated doubtfully then after pause oh yes of course oh yes there be troubled look in face a if be trying to recall memory have somehow escaped hilda resolutely repressing impulse to burst into flood of tear said cheerfully yes will be very glad to be back at holmwood wo go down by train uncle dr pearson doe not think that be strong enough for yet be going to arrange for comfortable carriage in can lie down rest will make early start will arrange for horse to be sent down so that can change ten twelve mile arrive there early in afternoon be only seventy mile know yes have driven up from there by coach many time when be boy sometimes since have not tom yes general railway be not made till six seven year ago no railway be made hilda at least not way hilda made sign to tom not to leave room stood by master shoulder prompting occasionally when memory failed must get strong very fast uncle for dr pearson said that can not go until be more fit to bear fatigue will soon get strong dear what be to day to day be friday uncle somehow have lost count of day said well must think that will be fit to go early next week be not a if be going to ride down be always fond of riding hope will soon be after hound again let see what month be be early in june uncle country will be looking best yes yes will have plenty of time to get strong before cub hunting begin so conversation dragged on for half hour general word coming slower slower at end of time dropped asleep hilda made sign to robert to stay with then ran up to own room closed door behind burst into passion of tear presently there be tap at door maid came in tom have just slipped out from dining room miss told to tell that general be sleeping a peacefully a child thought be like enough that must not wake for hour said that when woke william must get up to own room thank lucy door closed again hilda got up from bed on have lain down buried in depth of large cushioned chair there sat thinking for first time realized how immense be change in uncle have seen several time day have spoken few word only seemed to that be drowsy disinclined to talk now saw how great be mental a well a physical weakness be terrible repeated over over again to herself what wreck oh what dreadful wreck will ever get over seemed absolutely unable to think sometimes burst into sob sometimes sat with eye fixed before seeing nothing finger twining restlessly round other presently door opened very gently voice said may come in sprang to foot a if electrified while glad cry of netta broke from lip moment later two girl be clasped in close embrace oh netta how good of hilda said after have sobbed for time on friend shoulder oh what relief be to of course have come foolish girl did not suppose be going to remain away after letter aunt be with be downstairs tidying up shut up house left gardener in charge here be a long a want pupil netta handed over to of professor assistant so need not bother about told aunt must not be down for hour mr brown be looking after getting cup of tea asked to bring two cup up here thought that must prefer for to have chat by ourselves now tell about dear be if there be anything fresh since wrote told doctor opinion plan have be formed dr pearson brought dr leeds here with morning say be very clever term a house surgeon at guy st bartholomew forget have just expired a have not made definite plan be glad to accept doctor offer to take charge of uncle seemed from what little saw of pleasant man spoke in cheerful voice will be great thing for uncle must think that be six seven twenty dr pearson said be likely to become very distinguished man in profession day be going to begin at once will not sleep here will spend most of time here partly because want to study case partly because want uncle to get accustomed to will travel down with will be great comfort to for there be saying how uncle may stand journey suggested that must have carriage a invalid carriage have room for only one inside besides patient laughed said that must ride on box with tom robert there will be room for two there a be going to post down of course aunt will go down by train be there to meet will make so much brighter more cheerful having to receive than if have to arrive alone with one to say welcome be uncle so very weak terribly weak weak mentally physically gave account of interview afternoon be bad indeed hilda worse than have expected with country air to amuse to say nothing of doctor may hope that will soon be very different man well will not stay talking here longer netta have left aunt hour alone if be not kindest soul in world must feel hurt at being so neglected after coming way for sake know what good coming have effected before opened door be in depth of despair everything seemed shaken everything looked hopeless there seemed to have be sort of moral earthquake have turned everything in life topsy turvy now feel hopeful again with by side think that can bear even worst went down to drawing room where found mr brown housekeeper having long gossip over what have taken place with miss purcell whom although stranger be unaffectedly glad to see a seemed to take of responsibility off shoulder knew that netta society must be invaluable to hilda be not until week later that after consultation doctor agreed that be a well that general must be moved down to country place dr pearson be opinion that there be improvement that be very slight others must see change since have seen ten day before however agreed with colleague that although there might be certain amount of danger in moving to country be best to risk that a change might possibly benefit materially have formed opinion of case dr leeds sir henry asked can scarcely be said to have distinct opinion sir henry symptom tally with one must expect to find after ordinary sort of seizure although certainly must point to paralysis rather than epilepsy must have case come before in ordinary way in ward of hospital have come to conclusion that seizure after effect pointed rather to administration of drug than to other cause admit be not acquainted with drug whose administration must lead to such result then know of other manner in must be brought about save by lesion of blood vessel in brain of so unusual character such case have hitherto be reported in work with be acquainted say must be first theory in case of patient of whose previous history be entirely unaware who came under charge in hospital ward admit that in present case can not be entertained for moment must during attendance upon general mathieson watch closely for symptom must aid in localizing brain lesion other cause spoke modestly quietly in presence a be of of leading men of profession theory have enunciated have not occurred to of a spoke recognized that symptom might under other circumstance have led to similar conclusion be silent for minute when ceased speaking then sir henry said gravely admit dr leeds that of symptom indeed fit might in case of patient of whose history be ignorant seem to point to obscure form of poisoning since accord with what one must expect in ordinary form of brain seizure of kind however there be doubt that be somewhat prone when meet with case possessing unusual altogether exceptional feature to fall back upon theory of poisoning in case fortunately circumstance be such a to preclude possibility of entertaining idea for moment a say must endeavor to find watching a will do other cause of what admit be mysterious obscure case knowing a do be sure that will mention theory even a theory to one be aware that there be many case come before where may entertain suspicion strong suspicion that patient have be poisoned yet dare not take step because in first place have clew a to how by whom have be poisoned because if after death autopsy must prove that be mistaken must be nothing short of professional ruin here a said theory be happily irreconcilable with circumstance of case drug known to european science must produce so strange seizure after effect of course a know on west coast of africa be believed in india native be acquainted with poison be wholly unknown will probably remain unknown since medical men who have endeavored to investigate matter have almost always fallen victim to poison administered by people whose secret be endeavoring to discover however can happily put that altogether aside dr pearson tell that intends to go down once fortnight have promised to furnish with result of own observation own report of very interesting case if general mathieson have in course of military career ever be struck in head by bullet must say unhesitatingly splinter possibly very minute have obtruded into brain matter have learn not be case only serious injury that have ever received be when be terribly torn nearly killed by tiger twenty year ago in india may be useful to dr leeds to keep in mind there can be doubt that scratch bite even of domestic cat occasionally give rise to violent inflammation probably indeed believe to be case of great cat of india be still more poisonous a be case with bite of mad dog poison may in case remain latent for considerable time until circumstance may arouse into activity must suggest must scar caused at time remain must examine carefully ascertain whether there be sign of inflammatory action there grant improbability of consequence arising so many year after event at same time in case of kind where be perfectly at loss to explain what see be a well to look for cause in direction however improbable may appear thank sir henry will certainly do so be not aware before of general having suffered such injury will go afternoon spend few hour in looking through medical work at library of india office to see if there be record of serious disturbance caused in system by wound inflicted by tiger considerable time after have apparently healed meeting then broke up two day later general mathieson be taken down to seat in warwickshire post horse be in readiness all along road journey be accomplished quickly without fatigue to patient who slept greater part of distance at change dr leeds got down have two three minute talk with hilda when general be awake gave spoonful of restorative medicine presence close at hand be great comfort to hilda upon whom strain of watching uncle be very great be thankful indeed when arrived at end of journey found netta aunt who have gone down by morning train together with housekeeper own maid waiting on step to receive chapter ix strange illness for three month general mathieson remained in country improvement be very gradual so gradual indeed that from week to week be scarce noticeable be only by looking back that be perceptible at end of time must walk unaided there be le hesitation in speech memory be distinctly clearer passed much of time on sofa placed in shade in garden with hilda netta sitting by working talking netta have always be favorite of from time that first met in hanover have when be staying with niece year before offered very handsome salary if must remain with a companion girl however be reluctant to give up occupation of be very fond still le must leave aunt although general must willingly have engaged latter also a inmate of house to act a sort of chaperon to hilda when drove out alone shopping netta refused in name must not have left army general temptation might have be held out to be happy in thinking that be doing good useful work think that offer even one so kind liberal a yours must induce to relinquish presence now be not only inestimable comfort to hilda of great advantage to general alone hilda must have found next to impossible to keep invalid interested amused liked to talk be talked to be like work of entertaining child netta however have inexhaustible fund of good spirit after long intercourse with child who needed entertainment with instruction whose attention be absolutely necessary to keep fixed have difficulty in keeping conversation going anecdote connected with life in germany child have taught be just suited to general mental condition little walter be of great assistance to have come down with nurse a soon a be fairly settled at holmwood prattle play be great amusement to grandfather whenever conversation flagged netta offered to tell story not only kept quiet be listened to with a much interest by general a by child dr leeds be often member of party cheery talk always have effect in soothing general when a be sometimes case be inclined to be petulant irritable have be fortnight at holmwood before doctor discovered netta infirmity happened to be standing at window with back to when asked question receiving reply repeated in louder tone be still unanswered somewhat surprised went up to touched faced round immediately be speaking to dr leeds yes spoke to twice miss purcell did not hear have be perfectly deaf from childhood said can not hear sound never talk about people ask question wonder then forgetting that hear persist in addressing in loud tone be possible that be deaf be melancholy fact said with smile then added more seriously came on after measles when be eight year old good aunt who have taken to of best aurists in london happened to hear that professor menzel have opened establishment in hanover for teaching deaf mute to speak by new system of watching people lip took over there a see result be undoubted success now earn living by acting a one of professor assistant by teaching two three little girl who board at aunt system must be admirable one indeed doctor said have of course heard of must not have believed that result be so excellent never entered mind for moment that be in way deficient in hearing still le that be perfectly deaf have noticed that more than be common always kept eye fixed on face when be speaking to must have noticed earlier have be often alone together said for unless have kept eye always upon must not have known when be speaking when a here there be always several of together eye be at once directed to face when speak by seeing others look at be necessary to be quite close to when one speaks oh not at of course must be near enough to be able to see distinctly motion of lip say at twenty yard be great amusement to a walk about for can see what be being said by people on other side of road passing by in vehicle of course one only get scrap of conversation sometimes be very funny must be quite dangerous person miss purcell be laughed must be careful not to say thing want to be overheard when be within reach of eye yesterday for instance said to hilda that aunt seemed wonderfully kind intelligent old lady be good enough to add complimentary remark about dr leeds flushed well must not have said in hearing miss purcell a be complimentary harm be done think said that be invaluable here be certainly case for really know how must be able to amuse patient if be not for assistance hilda have laugh about said said too that be not fair being kept in dark a to accomplishment 'our accomplishment ' repeated in surprise do mean to say that miss covington be deaf also be impossible for called to yesterday when back be turned general wanted answered immediately tongue have run too fast girl said suppose must mind knowing what never speaks of be a know living with in hanover for more than four year temporarily lost hearing after attack of scarlet fever doctor who be consulted here feared that might be permanent father mother hearing of dr hartwig a having reputation of being first aurist in europe took out to held out hope that must be cured recommended that must be placed in professor menzel institution a soon a must understand german so that in case cure be not effected might be able to hear with eye by great good fortune recommended that must live with aunt partly because spoke english partly because a be already able to talk must act a companion instructor in system in german in three year must get on a well a must need for happily passed away a hearing be gradually restored still continued to live with while education went on at best school in town of course always talked with a talked with so kept up accomplishment have done so ever since mother advised very strongly to keep knowledge of ability to read people word from lip profound secret a might tend to disadvantage for people might be afraid of girl possessed of faculty of overhearing conversation at distance explains what rather puzzled other day doctor said when came out into garden be sitting together be laughing talking did not notice struck a strange that while laughing did not hear sound of voice until be within few pace of when miss covington noticed at once heard voice yes gave quite start hilda said must either give up talking silently let into secret so think that will be vexed when tell have let out be glad to have matter explained said for really asked whether must not have be temporarily deaf must have thought be so have not heard laughing a distinctly a usual came to conclusion that must for reason other have dropped voice to whisper that one other be telling important secret that did not wish even wind to hear think that be only secret that have netta laughed seriously be most interesting to a doctor be thousand pity that system act so admirably must not be introduced into country must set up similar institution here miss purcell have be thinking of doing so day hilda be always urging to feel that be too young yet to take head of establishment in four five year time will think seriously about can introduce to aurists in london miss purcell be sure that will soon get a many inmate a may choose to take in case where own skill fails altogether must be delighted to comfort parent by telling how child may learn to dispense altogether with sense of hearing not quite altogether said have happened very often a did just now have be addressed by someone at whom did not happen to be looking then have to explain apparent rudeness by owning to be entirely deaf unfortunately have not always be able to make people believe have several time be soundly rated by stranger for endeavoring to excuse rudeness by palpable falsehood really be hardly surprised dr leeds said for must have found difficult to believe that one altogether deaf must have be taught to join in conversation a do well must be very careful what say in future while in society of two young lady possessed of such dangerous exceptional power need not be afraid doctor feel sure that there be one here to whom must venture to give bad character think went on more seriously that miss covington mother be very wise in warning against letting anyone know that must read conversation at distance people must certainly be afraid of for gossipmonger must be convinced that be overhearing if may use word what be said if happened to look at only casually at end of three month general became restless be constantly expressing wish to be brought back to london what do think dr leeds dr pearson said when paid one of usual visit be of course great deal better than be when first came down former replied there be still that curious hesitation in speech a if be suffering from partial paralysis be not surprised at wanting to get up to town again a improves in health naturally feel more more loss of usual course of life must certainly have advised remaining here until have made good deal further advancement a have set mind upon believe that more harm must be done by refusing than by going in fact think that have if anything gone back in last fortnight above thing be necessary to avoid course might cause irritation so set up fresh brain disturbance be quite of opinion leeds have noticed that hesitates more than did short time since sometimes instead of joining in conversation sits moody silent be beginning to resent being looked after checked yes said to other day quite angrily ' want to be treated a child helpless invalid doctor took mile walk yesterday be beginning to feel quite again will do world of good to be back in london to drive down to club to have chat with old friend again well think best that must not be thwarted have looked at scar from time to time suppose yes there have be change in be very red tell what be more to point man tell that have always be so what do think leeds will ever be again watching case from day to day a have done opinion be worth good deal more than mine have not slightest hope of young doctor replied quietly have seen a complete wreck a be gradually pull round again have be case where have be victim of drink of malady from have be restored by successful operation in case have failed altogether to determine cause of attack nature of have be feeling in dark hitherto have failed to discover clew that must follow up so far there have be recurrence of first seizure with returning strength returning brain work be in opinion more than likely that will have recurrence of shock have be tremendous one to system be younger man might have rallied from doubt whether at age will ever get over actually be believe under seventy physically mentally be ninety be so between ourselves can not think that long continuance of life be not to be desired believe with that will be confirmed invalid requiring nursing humoring like child for sake of miss covington around one can not wish that life must be prolonged trust when end come dr pearson will be gradual painless that there will be recurrence of dreadful seizure hope so indeed have seen many men in bad fit never saw anything to equal that can assure that several of men who be present men who have gone through dozen battle be completely prostrated by at least dozen of men whom have never attended before knowing have be present called upon within next two three day for advice be so evidently completely unstrung that ordered entire change of scene at once recommended to go to homburg take water play at table to do anything in fact must distract mind from dwelling upon painful scene that have witnessed have not be for one must have have hesitation in assigning illness to obscure form of paralysis a be be unaccountable except added with smile by theory of poison younger doctor did not smile in return be only cause can assign for said gravely more study case more investigate writing of medical men in india on east west coast of more seems to that attack be work of drug altogether unknown to european science known to obi woman fetich men others of class in africa in of account of people accused of crime by fetich men given liquor to drink be told will not affect if innocent will kill if guilty find report of being seized with instant violent convulsion similar to that witnessed convulsion often end in death sometimes where suppose dose be larger than usual man drop dead in track while drinking sometimes dy in convulsion at other time recovers partially lingers on mere wreck for month in other case where suppose dose be light one man relative be ready to pay fetich man handsomely recovery be speedy complete be to say if a be usually case man be not put to death at once upon supposed proof of guilt by what possible mean such poison must have found way to england for there be instance of nature being divulged to european know not how must have be administered own that be still only theory by can account for general state need not say must never think of giving slightest hint to anyone a to opinion in matter trust most sincerely that be mistaken although have tried utmost can not overcome conviction that theory be correct one think dr pearson that if be to look into account of various way in poison be sold by old negro woman to anxious to get rid of enemy person whose existence be inconvenient to by fetich men in ordeal will admit at least have be practicing on west coast white man there have such attack a through general have passed must without hesitation have put down to poison by negro who have grudge against doubt doubt other doctor admitted see be not on west coast poison be a admit absolutely unobtainable by white men from men woman who prepare if obtainable when must have be brought here by whom lastly by whom administered from what motive admit that say about african poison lately have long talk about with medical man who have be on coast for four five year until other question can be answered must refuse to believe that similarity be more than accidental in possible way due to same cause be what have told score of time must be relief to indeed must find other explanation of matter then think that have better come up to london leave matter in hand dr leeds must give few day longer try effect of slight sedative possibly desire to get up to town may die out if so be without doubt better here if however see that irritation increase becomes more more set upon by mean take up how must do so by rail road certainly by rail have be trying to make feel that be free agent encouraged in belief that be stronger better if then say to bey dear general be of course free to do a like may be that change will be beneficial to if lady can be ready to morrow let start without further delay ' consider quite possible that ready cheerful acquiescence may result in no longer desiring one know that in respect sick people be very like fractious child set mind on special article of food a child doe on toy when come will refuse to touch a child will throw coveted toy down turned out so in case moment general found that doctor be willing that must go up to town lady quite ready to accompany at once began to raise objection perhaps must be a well that must wait month replied little pretended opposition strengthened view return be postponed at end of month have made so much progress that when longing for london be again expressed dr leeds offered opposition two day later whole party went up chapter x two heavy blow during four month that general mathieson have remained at holmwood one have be more constant in inquiry a to health than mr simcoe have seen hilda before started have begged to let have line once week saying how uncle be going on will get dr leeds to write said own opinion will be worth nothing will be valuable be afraid that will find time hang heavily on hand will not mind writing like writing letter at best of time in trouble be in now be sure that will not be equal to dr leeds willingly undertook duty of sending short weekly bulletin not only to mr simcoe to dozen other intimate friend be not hour work said when netta offered to relieve by addressing envelope copying out report very few word will be sufficient 'the general have made slight progress week ' general remains in very much same state ' be glad to be able to record slight improvement that with signature will be quite sufficient when said that hour must be enough exaggerated fancy that will be done in five minute mr simcoe occasionally wrote few line of thanks scarcely day passed that did not send little present for invalid bunch of finest grape few choice peach other fruit from abroad of flower have plenty in own conservatory at holmwood while game be abundant for from neighbor from club friend received so large quantity that considerable proportion be sent back in hamper to london hospital of mr simcoe

enjoyed life there must have be ever present anxiety dread of recurrence of fit will see in time that be better for for that must be a be although of course can hardly see just at present now must leave to kind friend here miss purcell knew well enough that just at present word of consolation must be thrown away that be time only for silent sympathy gentle word warm pressure of netta hand did more to restore hilda composure than repetition of doctor well meant assurance that be for best must do must like to write line in name to colonel bulstrode asked hilda cried must look a if have made up mind that uncle be going to die if be conscious must be different for know colonel bulstrode be greatest friend be named one of trustee uncle might want to talk to oh how one wish at time like one

recovers consciousness be sure to ask for have come to be very fond of walter have be so much with lately yes eye always used to follow child about in play miss purcell said think be best that must be here a nursery be at top of house will not be in anyone way there be little change in general mathieson condition next morning although slight movement when hilda spoke to showed that be dimly conscious of presence when brought child down laid hand on of general said good morning grandfather according to custom opened eye for moment there be slight movement of lip a if be trying to speak thank miss covington dr leeds said experiment be worth making prof that state of unconsciousness be not complete walter always took dinner with others when lunched where be child hilda asked footman have sent up to tell nurse that lunch be ready have not sent up miss because nurse have not come back with from walk doubt will be back in few minute hilda said be very punctual never knew late before illustration nurse be sitting on chair sobbing bitterly page lunch be half over when tom robert came in with scared expression on usually somewhat stolid face if please miss nurse wish to speak to what be matter robert hilda exclaimed starting up have walter met with accident well miss not a know of have come home be just like wild thing somehow other master walter have got lost hilda followed by netta miss purcell ran out into hall nurse woman of two three thirty daughter of one of general tenant who have be in charge of child since arrived baby from india be sitting on chair sobbing bitterly bonnet hung down at back of head hair be unloosed have evidently be running wildly to fro appearance at once disarmed hilda who said soothingly how have happened nurse stop cry tell be sure that must not have be fault for be always so careful with there be occasion to be so terribly upset of course will soon be found first policeman who see will be sure to take to station now how did happen be walking along queen road miss woman said between sob master walter be close beside know special because have just passed crossing took hold of hand a went over when man looked like respectable working man came up to said ' see be mother ma'be ' 'not at said 'how dare say thing be nurse be in charge of young gentleman ' 'well said ' can see that have kind heart anyhow be what made speak to be carpenter be have be out of work for month have child at home just about one age be starving have bit to put in mouth parish buried wife three week ago be well nigh mad must give money to buy loaf of bread ' man be in such distress miss took out purse gave shilling thankful be be cry must not say enough to thank then turned to take hold of walter hand found that child have gone must not have be more than two three minute talking though always doe take long time to take purse out of pocket still know that must not have be three minute altogether first of went back to crossing looked up down street be there then thought that perhaps have walked on be hiding for fun in shop doorway when must not see up down got regular frighted ran up down like mad thing once came back a far a house there be sign of knew that must not have got a far a even if have run way then thought of mew ran back there master walter be very fond of horse generally stopped when got to entrance of mew stood looking for minute two at groom cleaning horse thought that might have gone in there there be two three men about none have seen child still ran on looked into several stable calling for time when be there went well nigh stark mad ran up down street asking everyone met have seen child then came back here to tell will soon hear of nurse robert do william start out at once go first to police station give notice that child be missing can not have wandered far then do james go round neighborhood tell policeman that meet what have happened can ask in shop in queen road street near may have wandered into one of a be alone may have kept until someone came to inquire after now netta will put on bonnet come out with will come with too hilda thank miss purcell in first place will walk too fast for in second must be a well for to be here to comfort if be brought back while be out will come half hour to hear if there be news of have better go upstairs make tidy nurse then can come out join in hunt look so utterly worn out exhausted that think perhaps have better sit quiet for time may be sure that will not be long before of bring back must not sit still miss covington woman said will just run upstairs put straight then go out again try calm nurse will be taken for madwoman certainly looked like one when came in two minute later hilda friend started let go first into kensington garden netta often went there to play if came down into main road must very likely wander in be probable that nurse may have be longer speaking to man than think that have time to get good way before missed garden be thoroughly searched park keeper questioned there be sign of walter then called at house to see whether there be news of finding that there be not again went out have real hope of finding now for hilda be convinced that be not in of street near have be nurse men must have found have doubt be either taken by kind hearted person who have found lost said who have given notice to police have be taken by to police station still relief one to walk about must be impossible to sit quiet doing nothing others will have searched street near have better go up edgware road search in direction give notice to policeman find afternoon went on news be received of missing child be relief to when dr leeds who have gone off watch for few hour at twelve o'clock returned looked grave for moment when heard news said cheerfully be very annoying miss covington need not alarm walter be bound to turn up ought to have be sent to police station long before hilda said tearfully of course ought if people possessed common sense unfortunately expect at present moment be eating bread jam something of sort in house of kind hearted old lady who have taken in idea of informing police have never occurred to for moment unfortunately may not occur for little time however if will give detail of dress will go at once with to printer get two three hundred notice struck off sent round to be placed in tradesman window stuck up on wall saying that will bring child here will be handsomely rewarded be sure to fetch before long there be little sleep night at general mathieson master of house still lay unconscious from time to time dr leeds came down to say few cheering word to anxious girl tom robert walked street night with faint idea of finding child asleep on doorstep went three time to police station to ask if there be news first thing in morning hilda went with dr leeds to scotland yard description of child be at once sent to station in london then drove by to office of messrs farmer pettigrew waited there until latter gentleman arrived mr pettigrew who be very old friend of family looked very grave over news will not conceal from miss covington said when have finished story that affair look to somewhat serious be afraid that will have to make up mind that may not see little fellow a soon a expect have be merely lost must certainly have heard of in few hour after various may say judicious step that have taken child who loses in street of london be morally certain to come into hand of police in very few hour then what can have become of mr pettigrew may be that a not unfrequently happens child have be stolen for sake of clothes in case will probably be heard of before very long may be case of blackmail someone possibly acquaintance of one of servant may have known that child a grandson heir of general mathieson must be valuable prize that if must be carried off friend might finally be forced to pay considerable sum to recover must say that look to like planned thing one of confederate engages silly woman nurse in long rambling talk other pick child quietly up entices away to next corner where have cab in waiting drive off with at once however in case need fear that child will come to serious harm if have be stolen for sake of clothes woman will very speedily turn adrift will be brought home to by police in rag if on other hand have be taken for purpose of blackmail may be sure that will be well cared for for will in eye of who have taken be most valuable possession in case may not hear from abductor for little time will know that a search continues news be obtained friend will grow more more anxious more ready to pay handsomely for return of course be most annoying unfortunate business really think that have occasion to feel anxious about safety be morally certain that in time will have back safe sound now how be uncle hope that show sign of rallying be sorry to say there be sign whatever of doing so up to eight o'clock morning indeed dr pearson told that have little hope of doing so think that there have be slight shock of paralysis dr leeds speaks little more hopefully than dr pearson be way think that too considers that end be not far off friend miss purcell niece be still with hope yes will not leave a long a be in trouble know what must do without especially now new blow have fallen upon well dear if receive communication respecting boy send straight to know whether be aware that have be appointed guardian yes uncle told so month ago never thought then that must not live till walter came of age thought that be mere form doubtless seemed so at time mr pettigrew agreed uncle be apparently excellent life be a likely a anyone know to have attained great age there be nothing can advise to do at present nothing besides what have done police over london will be on lookout for lost child will probably assume at once that have be stolen for clothes will expect to see child be in search of in rag will know too quarter in be most likely to be found if be for purpose that have be stolen can confidently expect to have back by to morrow at latest woman must be anxious to get rid of without loss of time if other hypothesis be correct may not hear for fortnight three week fellow in case will be content to bide time hilda drove back with heavy heart netta opened door swollen eye at once told truth uncle be dead hilda exclaimed yes dear passed away hour ago few minute after dr leeds returned doctor ran down for moment almost directly have gone up said that general be sinking fast that end might come at moment ten minute later came down told that be over chapter xi startling will mr pettigrew at once took management of affair at house in hyde park garden into hand a one of trustee a joint guardian of heir a family solicitor hilda be completely prostrated by two blow have so suddenly fallen be glad indeed that necessity for attending to business be taken off hand need not talk about future at present mr pettigrew said to be matter can be considered afterwards be most fortunate in having lady with whom so long lived here with trust permanent arrangement may be made in case must not of course well remain here alone have not thought anything about yet said wearily oh wish be man mr pettigrew then must do something towards searching for walter instead of being obliged to sit here uselessly if be man miss covington must hing more at present than be being done police be keeping up most vigilant search have offered reward of five hundred pound for news may lead to child discovery notice have even be sent to constabulary of home county requesting to make inquiry if tramp tramp accompanied by child of about age of young ward have be seen passing along road a told when called upon have little doubt that be case of blackmail that will not be long before hear of be probable that general death have somewhat disconcerted be likely that may wait to see how matter go who be person with whom have best open negotiation have doubt that be in way other keeping well informed of what be taking place here funeral be over general being followed to grave by number of military friend comrade blind at house in hyde park garden be drawn up again on following morning mr pettigrew came to house early be man who be methodical in doings very rarely ruffled a soon a entered however hilda saw that something unusual have happened have heard of walter exclaimed dear have strange unpleasant news to give yesterday afternoon received intimation from messrs halstead james saying that have in possession will of late general mathieson bearing date th of may of present year need not say be almost stupefied at news firm be one of high standing be impossible to suppose that mistake have arisen at same time seemed incredible that general must thus have gone behind back especially a be only three month before have at request drawn out fresh will for still be bound to say that such case be by mean rare man want to make fresh disposition of property in direction of feel that own solicitor especially when be old family solicitor will not approve therefore get done by other firm with result at death come like bombshell to concerned can hardly doubt that be so in case although what disposition general may have made of property other than contained in last will drew up be unable to say at rate one of firm will come round to office at twelve o'clock with precious document think that be right that must be present when be opened will be punctual will not can rely upon being there few minute before twelve mr pettigrew seems very strange knew what be general purport of uncle last will for spoke of to be said same a one before with exception that have left handsome legacy to man who have saved life from tiger be not surprised at at have taken very great fancy to mr simcoe who be constantly here seemed to only natural that must leave of money to man who have done so great service who a told have nearly lost own life in doing quite so lawyer agreed seemed natural to property be large enough to permit of doing so without making material difference to grandchild who will come into fine estate with large accumulation during long minority now must be off there be little council held after lawyer have left say trouble never come singly hilda remarked certainly adage be verified in case must hope that will not be so dear miss purcell said can not be personal trouble aunt for hilda have fallen back into old habit of so addressing because uncle told that a be so well off have only put down for small sum in will just to show that have not forgotten feel sure that will have made change in respect that alteration may have made can not affect in least except of course may have come to conclusion that must be better to appoint two men a guardian to walter hardly think that must have done however there must be something strange about must not have gone to firm of solicitor feel convinced that there be fresh trouble at hand carriage drew up at office in lincoln inn at five minute to twelve mr pettigrew have not included miss purcell netta in invitation hilda insisted upon coming with be shown at once into private room where extra chair have be placed colonel bulstrode be already there mr farmer joined partner a soon a be seated be most singular affair miss covington said need hardly say that be matter of great annoyance a well a surprise to pettigrew of course general mathieson be perfectly free to go to other firm of solicitor a have made will for family yours for last hundred year a well a conducted legal business be unpleasant shock to find that have gone elsewhere must say that be awaiting reading of will with great curiosity a content will doubtless furnish with reason why have thus prepared just at stroke of twelve mr halstead mr james be announced thought a well former said for to come mr farmer for can understand surprise at finding that later will than be doubtless in possession be in existence be ready to explain whole circumstance under be drawn out by general mathieson came one day to office brought with card of colonel bulstrode be unnecessary for month ago general be at office with colonel be only there for purpose of fixing name a witness to colonel signature a client like many others preferred having personal friend to witness signature instead of being done by one of clerk be so colonel interjected general mathieson mr halstead went on be only in office minute two on occasion of course be sufficient for to recognize when called again told that desired to draw out will that a have determined to appoint mr pettigrew one of trustee guardian to heir thought a well to employ firm to draw up will pointed out that precaution be altogether needle when dealing with firm like yours then said ' have reason be making change in one of provision of will fancy farmer pettigrew might raise argument upon here be instruction said 'you will permit to read through general before giving decided answer ' have will contained provision that considered unjust must have declined to have have anything to do with matter a in way diverted property from natural heir be a far a must see just reasonable one saw cause for refusing to carry out instruction for have known a doubtless have known many similar instance in men for reason other have chosen to go outside family solicitor in matter desired must remain entirely secret until after death have general mathieson come to a altogether unknown person must have point blank refused to have have anything to do with business a intimate friend of client colonel bulstrode a being known to to extent personally decided to follow instruction given in writing will now with permission read will first let introduce miss covington to mr farmer said be general nearest relative with exception of grandson lady be here with a friend mr halstead bowed then broke seal on large envelope drew out parchment proceeded to read messrs farmer pettigrew listened with increasing surprise a went on legacy be absolutely identical with in will that have last prepared same trustee guardian for child be appointed be unable to understand what have induced general mathieson to have what be almost duplicate of previous will prepared so secretly last paragraph however enlightened instead of hilda covington john simcoe be named a heir to bulk of property in event of decease of walter rivington grandson before coming of age hilda gave involuntary start a change be announced two lawyer looked at other in dismay mr halstead to whom general have explained reason for gratitude to john simcoe saw nothing unusual in provision indeed be heralded with word a only near relative hilda covington be well endowed hereby appoint dear friend john simcoe sole heir in event of decease of grandson walter rivington before coming of age in token of appreciation of heroic rescue of from jaw of tiger in course of rescue be most seriously wounded when have finished laid down will looked round hope said that will be satisfactory to party by gad sir colonel bulstrode said hotly must call last part a unsatisfactory a possible will be identical mr farmer said without heeding colonel interjection with one general mathieson last executed person benefited amount left to be in case same will understand dismay with have heard concluding paragraph when tell that general mathieson heir walter rivington now child of six seven year old disappeared think may say be kidnaped on day preceding general mathieson death that effort to discover whereabouts have so far be unsuccessful mr halstead partner looked at other with dismay even greater than exhibited by other lawyer god bless mr halstead exclaimed be bad business indeed very strange one do think that mr simcoe can have be aware of provision in favor be likely enough that be aware of mr pettigrew said be constantly in company of general mathieson latter who be one of frankest of men may very well have informed whether actually did do so not of course can not say must have objection to looking at written instruction certainly not brought with in order that may be referred to a to question might arise be certainly in general own handwriting mr pettigrew said after looking at paper indeed identity of legacy given to twenty thirty person of other provision of will including appointment of trustee guardian with of will in possession must seem in to set matter at rest be present when general signed certainly mr james be present can now only express deep regret that acceded to general request to draw up will be unfortunate certainly mr farmer said see that under circumstance of introduction by old client fact that have seen before anyone must blame for undertaking matter such case be a said by mean unusual be quite sure that must not have undertaken have considered for moment that injustice be being done by provision may ask to whom property be to go to by first will be to go to miss covington be sure that can say in name that under other circumstance must not feel in way aggrieved at loss of property can well dispense with especially a chance of provision coming into effect be small a child be healthy little fellow in respect likely to live to come of age care in least for hilda said impetuously on contrary must much rather that have gone to someone else must not have at liked thought might benefit by walter death must rather that have be left to anyone man whom have always disliked whom walter also disliked can not give reason why suppose be instinct now instinct be justified for feel sure that be at bottom of walter disappearance hush hush dear young lady mr farmer said holding up hand in dismay must not say such thing be libelous in extreme suspicion may have own at present thing look awkward must not mention suspicion until obtain evidence in support disappearance of child at moment may be mere coincidence singular one if like will of course examine matter to utmost sift to bottom nothing must be said until have something to go on hilda sat silent with lip pressed tightly together expression of determination upon face other solicitor speedily left after more expression of regret what be going to do next mr pettigrew hilda asked abruptly a door closed behind be too difficult matter to decide off hand after going into whole matter with co trustee colonel bulstrode with assistance of partner will come to agreement a to best course to take of course must oppose probate of new will doe not seem to that have leg to stand upon in respect have doubt that halstead james will retire altogether from matter refuse to act further in case will be duty of course to acquaint simcoe with provision of will to inform that a trustee will not proceed to take further step in matter until fate of walter rivington be ascertained will until then administer estate in behalf will then be for to take next step certainly will not move for month after time will of course apply to court to have declared that walter rivington having disappeared for long time there be reasonable presumption of death will then in name mine a child guardian be heard in opposition feel sure that court will refuse to grant petition especially under serious most suspicious circumstance of case in time simcoe will repeat application will of course oppose in fact think likely that will be good many year before court will take step asked time will be quietly making inquiry about man antecedent will of course keep up search for child may be that disappearance be only coincidence that have a at first supposed be stolen for purpose of making heavy claim for return may be sure that will not rest until find mr pettigrew hilda said will devote life to love child dearly even be perfect stranger to must do everything in power if only to prevent man from obtaining proceeds of villainy mr farmer again interposed dear miss covington said really must not speak like of course with be perfectly safe admit that have good reason for indignation must really moderate expression might cause infinite mischief be to use before other people in eye of law man be innocent until be proved guilty have not shadow of proof that man have anything to do with child abduction moreover might do harm in other way to begin with might render discovery of child more difficult for if abductor be aware even suspected that be searching in direction for must take greater pain to conceal hiding place will be careful mr farmer will proceed to have search made at workhouse night refuge place of sort in london within twenty mile round issue more placard of offer of reward of five hundred pound for information there be harm in certainly not be measure one must naturally take in case indeed must already have pushed inquiry in direction have hitherto felt sure have be merely taken for clothes police must have traced before now a have not be able to do so that be case of blackmail that must hear very shortly from people have stolen sincerely trust that may case that will turn out that man simcoe have nothing to do with will come down let know what step be taking from time to time learn direction in be pushing inquiry miss purcell netta have spoken from time have entered room a soon a took place in carriage waiting for burst out what extraordinary thing hilda yet miss purcell added search for walter may do good in one way will prevent from turning thought constantly to past to loss that have suffered if have not be for walter being missing aunt must have thought nothing of uncle appointing mr simcoe a heir to property if anything must happen to man have obtained extraordinary influence over there can be doubt from uncle statement to that owed life solely to that simcoe indeed be seriously injured in saving knew that have occasion for money have already more than be good for girl to have at absolute disposal therefore be in way surprised that must have left estate in event of walter death be quite right have nothing to say against except have always disliked man be only extraordinary disappearance of walter just at moment seems to to render certain that simcoe be at bottom of one else must have have motive for stealing walter more than other rich man child interest in disappearance be immense have doubt uncle have told what have done man must have seen that chance of getting estate be very small unless child must be put out of way think netta began that harm can have happened to think that whether man must have shrunk from if there be other way need not ask there must have be occasion for walter be so young that will very soon forget past might be handed over to gypsy grow up little vagrant a there be mark on by might be identified must be lost to forever see man can afford to wait have doubtless mean of own how large know have heard uncle say that have handsome chamber certainly lived in good style now will have legacy of ten thousand pound if court keep waiting ten fifteen year before pronouncing walter dead can afford to wait anyhow will have plenty of time in to act will require lot of thinking over before decide what have best do lost time however in beginning to work poster offering reward of five hundred pound for information of missing boy be at once issued stuck up not only in london in town village within thirty mile then obtained from mr pettigrew name of firm of trustworthy private detective set to make inquiry in first place at institution where lost child must be likely to be taken if found where might have be left by tramp two day after reading of will received following letter from john simcoe dear miss covington have learned from messrs farmer pettigrew liberal may say extraordinary generosity shown towards by late general mathieson whose loss most deeply deplore feeling of gratitude be at present moment overwhelmed by very painful position in find have of course heard upon calling at door to make inquiry little walter be missing be deeply grieved at news though not at time dreaming that must affect personally now however circumstance of case be completely changed for by provision of will must benefit pecuniarily by poor child death will not for moment permit to believe that be not alive well doubt that will speedily recover until occurs feel that sort of suspicion must attach to who be only person having interest in disappearance thought that may be so be distressing to in extreme since heard of disappearance have spent greater part of time in traversing slum of london in hope of lighting upon will now undertake wider research will to day insert advertisement in daily paper offering one thousand pound for recovery feel sure that at least will not for moment entertain unjust suspicion concerning who know well may do so although at present none of fact have be made public feel a if be already under cloud that men in club look askance at unless child be found position will speedily become intolerable only support in trial be consciousness of innocence will excuse for intruding upon sorrow at present moment felt compelled to write a have done to assure will use effort in power to discover child not only for own sake yours because feel that until be discovered must continue to rest under terrible if unspoken suspicion of being concerned in disappearance believe yours very truly john simcoe chapter xii dr leeds speaks after reading john simcoe letter hilda threw down with exclamation of contempt read said to netta who be alone with letter be good enough a stand netta remarked a finished good enough if coming from anyone else hilda said scornfully perhaps better than most men must write think that rogue can generally express better than honest man now be getting cynical new unpleasant phase in character hilda have heard say that like man have never given particular reason for beyond in one of letter saying that be instinct now do try to give more palpable reason than at present seems to be only case of dr fell like because like because from first distrusted personally have reason to complain on contrary have be extremely civil indeed willing to put out in way to do small service then a told walter disliked too although be always bringing chocolate toy for so that child dislike must have be also sort of instinct felt a did that man be not true honest always gave impression of acting part have never be able to understand how man of class must have performed so noble heroic act a rushing in almost unarmed to save who be almost stranger to from grip of tiger so absolutely did feel have at time even doubted whether must be john simcoe who have performed gallant action dear hilda be getting fanciful do think that uncle be likely to be deceived in such matter that must not have vivid remembrance of preserver even after twenty year depends on how much saw of uncle told that mr simcoe brought good introduction from friend of at calcutta who came out in same ship with doubt dined at uncle two three time may even have stayed few day in house possibly more a commanding district uncle must have be fully occupied during day can have seen little of until suppose week so after arrival when invited to join in hunt for tiger although much hurt on occasion simcoe be much le injured than uncle who lay between life death for time simcoe have left before be well enough to see if have dined with uncle few time after affair undoubtedly feature must have be so impressed on that must have recognized even after twenty year a be must have particular interest in gentleman can have entertained hazy recollection of feature in fact general did not recognize when first called upon until have related certain detail of affair have always be sore point with uncle that have never have opportunity of thanking preserver who have a believed lost life at sea before be off sick bed when heard man story be naturally anxious to welcome with open arm to do in power for admit that man must either have be in benares then shortly afterwards for remembered various officer who be there little incident of cantonment life must one must think be only known to one who have be there at time say be only there week hilda only week before tiger business be month before be able to travel doubt officer there must make good deal of man who have performed deed must go sit with chat to while away hour so that must in time pick up great deal of gossip of station well then what be theory hilda real man a say doubt made great many acquaintance there man seems to have be behind scene also unquestionably knew many of officer for uncle told that recognized several men who have be out there when met at club went up addressed by name did know also at first none of have idea who be be not surprising for have seen principally when be greatly pulled down believing to be drowned must have be strange indeed if have recalled face until have mentioned who be well seems to that be arguing against hilda everything say point to fact that man be john simcoe claim to be if be not simcoe who can be ah there ask question can not answer in fact hilda have nothing beyond fact that like man believe that be not sort of man to perform heroic self sacrificing action on behalf of curious theory of yours be at present mean to set to work to find out more about if can find out that man be impostor will recover walter if not doubt whether will ever hear of again netta lifted eyebrow well at rate have plenty of time before hilda next morning dr leeds who have not called for last three four day came in to say that be arranging partnership with doctor of considerable eminence who be beginning to find pressure of work too much for wanted aid of younger more active man be chance in thousand said owe largely to kind manner in sir henry havercourt dr pearson spoke to a to ability will excuse went on after hilda have warmly congratulated for talking of before have asked question know have obtained news of walter must have let know at once certainly must have news really important news to give related production of new will gave detail of provision looked very serious be certainly ugly outlook said have never seen simcoe know from tone in have spoken of at least two three time that be by mean favorite of yours can tell anything about not beyond fact that saved general life from tiger great many year ago shortly after that be supposed to be lost at sea certainly vessel in sailed went down in hurricane with a be reported hand say that be picked up clinging to spar of life for twenty year following have never given very connected account at least a far a know of story have heard tell show that led very wild sort of life sometimes be working in small trader among island of pacific believe have share in of enterprise then claim to have be in service of native prince somewhere up beyond burmah according to account took quite active part in many sanguinary war adventure of sort doctor face grew more more serious a proceeded do gather miss covington that believe that man be what claim to be frankly be opinion doctor own have ground whatever for disbelief except have naturally studied man closely have watched lip a spoke when have be talking about adventure with savage spoke without effort have doubt that did take part in such adventure when be speaking of india especially when at of bachelor dinner uncle gave there be officer who have known out there be clear to that did not speak with same freedom weighed word a if afraid of making mistake believe that man be playing part tone be genial sometimes little boisterous a might well be on part of man who have be year away from civilization always thought from manner that be false be convinced that be double faced man when spoke observed that watched in furtive sort of way person to whom be speaking to see effect of word above formed opinion upon fact that be absolutely convinced that man must never have performed splendid action of facing wounded tiger unarmed for sake of one who be in fact casual acquaintance will excuse if make comment on what have told miss covington be matter far too serious for man to form hasty opinion upon have never seen man be content to take estimate of character one trained a be for year in habit of closely watching face can not be far better judge of character than who have not have such training will take two three day to think matter over now will tell what step be taking at present to discover walter told of what be being done can suggest anything else dr leeds nothing seems to that key to mystery be in hand of man that be there must be sought though at present can see way in matter can be set about when one enters into struggle with man like one must be armed at point prepared to meet craft with craft above to have well marked out plan of campaign now will say good morning suppose miss purcell niece will stay on with at rate for time for long time hope said may ask if have stated view that have given to miss netta purcell yes have told be disposed to treat a absurd fancy on part if can get anything to go upon will convince that there be even faint possibility of being right will go through fire water to assist can well believe that doctor said be sure that have strong character although so lively full of fun of course having be thrown with for four month be able to form very fair opinion of disposition after dr leeds have left hilda began to build castle for friend must be splendid thing for said be certainly not man to speak in way did unless thoroughly meant must think that be just suited to other though must be really pity that scheme have set mind upon for getting over here a head of institution for teaching deaf dumb child on professor menzel plan must come to nothing perhaps though might be willing that must act a head of such establishment getting trained assistant from know in hanover giving few hour day to general supervision if only for sake of good that institution must do among perhaps most unfortunate of being be quite sure that so far have thought of such thing however perhaps be running on too fast that only mean what said that admired character suppose there be reason because man admires girl character must fall in love with yet netta be so bright cheerful at same time so kind thoughtful can hardly imagine that man thrown with a have be must help falling in love with netta be surprised when hilda told that dr leeds have be inclined to view theory seriously really hilda certainly be not sort of man to be carried away by enthusiasm so please consider have said upon subject a unspoken will stand neutral until hear further what say did not say very much admit netta said that must take matter seriously into consideration let know what think in two three day be afraid that want to let down gently netta said well well looked vexed will say no more about until solemn judgment be delivered netta be in room when dr leeds called two day later netta be in counsel dr leeds hilda said be a rule capital hand at keeping secret though did let mine slip out to there be smile on doctor face girl felt at once that interview be to be serious one be well aware that can speak before miss purcell said although there be very few people before whom must repeat what be going to say have two question to ask miss covington what be date of last will of uncle be dated th of may about fortnight before general alarming seizure hilda bowed head in assent next question took quite by surprise do know whether man simcoe be one of party when seizure took place be doctor uncle told that be going to dine with dr pearson mentioned to that be next to general caught a fell from chair dr leeds got up walked up down room two three minute think that now thing have come to present pas ought to know what be opinion originally formed of general mathieson illness dr pearson sir henry havercourt differed from treated theory a fanciful one without foundation of course yielded to such superior authority henceforth kept idea to myself nevertheless during time general be under charge failed altogether to find theory explanation for strange attack subsequent state except have first formed be theory that medical man be always most reluctant to declare unless be in position to prove at least to give very strong reason in favor for mistake must not only cost reputation might involve in litigation ruin career altogether think ought to tell what opinion be miss covington must not take for more than be worth namely a theory may possibly set on new track aid in endeavor to discover missing child surprise of two girl increased a continued after pause ever since day when be first requested to act a general resident medical man have devoted considerable time to study of book in here there must be found account of action of herb in use among obi woman fetich men so called wizard on west coast of africa also in india among savage tribe of malay archipelago pacific island what drug use have never be discovered although many effort have be made to obtain knowledge of in india on west coast doctor have found necessary to abandon attempt several of having fallen victim of jealousy of people because of research be making at least effect of administration of drug have be frequently described in respect correspond so closely to noticeable in general case that say now a said at first believe general illness be caused by administration of drug absolutely unknown to european science think that uncle be poisoned hilda exclaimed in tone of horror while netta started to foot with clenched hand flushed face have not used word 'poisoned miss covington though in fact come to that may not have be administered with intention of killing may have be intended only to bring on fit in due time might have be attended by others dose may have be stronger than administrator intended think dr leeds think that be administered by miss covington accuse one have shadow of proof against anyone taking illness with abduction of child can not be denied that one suspicion must in first case fall upon man who have profited by crime if crime be on may will be drawn up bequeathing property to certain person circumstance of will be curious from what learned from of explanation given by lawyer who drew up seems fair above board enough general be certainly greatly under influence of man who have rendered greatest service one man can render at risk of own life therefore consider that will be so to speak sprung upon be in important link in chain when find twelve fourteen day afterwards general be when at table seized with terrible fit of extraordinary mysterious nature that man who have interest in death be sitting next to coincidence be at least strange one when however general heir be abducted when general be at point of death matter for first time assumes position of most extreme gravity at first like thought that walter have be stolen by woman for sake of clothes that have be carried off by someone aware that be general heir with view to obtaining large sum of money a ransom such thing have be done before will doubt be done again first hypothesis appears to have failed altogether woman who have robbed child of clothes must desire to detain for hour longer than be necessary inquiry of police have failed altogether people have employed have ascertained that at workhouse of london in adjacent county have child at answering to walter description be left by tramp brought in by police by someone who have found wandering about can not be said that second hypothesis be also proved to be mistaken one men who took away must be obliged to exercise greatest caution when opening negotiation for release might be month more before heard from therefore must be unfair to man simcoe to assume that be author of plot until so long period have passed that be morally certain that boy be not stolen for purpose of blackmail however have following suspicious circumstance first that a believe general be drugged by poison of whose nature be ignorant beyond read of very similar case occurring among native race in africa elsewhere then have point that one must have have interest in general death with exception of man have named a heir in event of child death know by man statement that be for many year living among tribe where poison of kind be used by wizard fetich men to support authority to remove person against whom have grudge lastly have crowning fact of abduction of child who stood between man estate be at best mere circumstantial evidence know for certain what caused general fit have proof that simcoe have hand in abduction opinion may be be absolutely necessary that breathe hint to anyone hilda did not speak shock horror of matter be too much for sat with open lip blanched face looking at dr leeds netta however leaped to foot again must be so dr leeds doe not seem to that there can be shadow of doubt in matter anything can do to bring truth to light will do however long time take thank netta hilda said holding out hand to friend a for will devote life to clearing up mystery be afraid miss covington that engagement henceforth will prevent joining actively in search advice will always be at service may be that will be able to point out method have not occurred to oh dr leeds hilda exclaimed suddenly if villain poisoned uncle surely will not hesitate to put walter out of path have be thinking of dr leeds exclaimed have come to conclusion that be very unlikely that will do so in first place must have have accomplice man who spoke to nurse cabman who drove child away must have be employed by have doubt that child have be placed with person who be probably altogether ignorant of identity walter be lovable child a soon a got over first grief must no doubt become attached to people be with although might be willing to take child who be told have lost parent be homeless friendless without inquiring too closely into circumstance be unlikely in extreme that must connive at act of violence be by mean easy to murder then to dispose of body of child of seven must doubt whether man must attempt such thing must be perfectly content that boy must be out of way that trace of must be lost that must be beyond range of probability that must ever be identified lastly even most hardened villain like putting neck in noose moreover if in last extremity confederate believing that have made away with child tried to blackmail unforeseen circumstance brought home to guilt of abduction must be in position to produce child even to make good term for for doing so feeling might be a to man whom believe to be murderer of uncle must still be willing to pay considerable sum allow to leave country on condition of restoring walter therefore think that may make mind easy on score believe that have happened to wherever may be there be risk of actual harm befalling thank very much doctor be indeed relief now have thought of plan upon have best set to work not at present beyond fact that see that power posse of reading what men say when a believe out of earshot ought to be of material advantage to a miss purcell have promised to associate with in search must say that must be of more use in direction than must have told that must be perfectly aware of dislike for must certainly be most careful be in presence although might not dream of power that posse have never seen friend must not be on guard with have at present not thought over plan by must watch must be for after consideration seems to that offer chance of obtaining clew be ready to do anything dr leeds netta said firmly only have to find out way will follow out instruction to letter first must find out whether hilda theory about man scoffed at when first spoke of to be correct mean theory that man be not john simcoe at someone who knowing fact of rescue from tiger being also well acquainted with people thing in benares have personated will not discus that now have appointment to meet colleague for consultation in difficult case have already run time very close will see again shortly when have have time to think whole matter over quietly chapter xiii visit stowmarket well netta hilda said after dr leeds have left suppose will not in future laugh at instinct only wish that have be stronger wish have told dear uncle disliked man so thoroughly be sure there be something wrong with implored not to become very intimate with if have told how strongly felt on subject although of course must have left given sum that chose do think must have have influence with doubt must have laughed at what must have called suspicious nature think must not have become so friendly with man of course never thought of oh netta heart seems broken at thought that dear uncle kindest of men must have be murdered by man towards whom thought be so kindly that appointed heir in event of walter death if have left double sum did have directed that in case of walter death property must go to hospital child might now have be safe in house be heartbreaking to think of well dear netta said have work before say 'we ' because although be relation to loved from first when came over with news of father death have be niece a well a must not have treated more kindly than did when be staying with last year during last four month have be with one must see even in state be in how kind nature be very helplessness added to one affection for quite meant what said for until matter be cleared up until crime if crime really be be brought to light will stay here be helper however long time may be there be two of think that of be fool ought to be match for one man there be one thing have be man on whom can rely mean dr leeds regard a director mean tom robert must have given life be sure for master feel confident that will carry out instruction may give to letter be sure will netta do think ought to tell suspicion must do so unhesitatingly hilda be sure will be ready to go through fire water to avenge master death a aunt be out think will be a well to take into confidence at once hilda said nothing got up rang bell when footman entered said tell robert want to speak to when man came up went on be quite sure tom that be most thoroughly devoted to master that must do anything in power to get to bottom of event have brought about death carrying off of grandson must miss there be not anything must not do if must only set about well robert be about to take into confidence relying implicitly upon silence on aid can do miss safely enough there be nothing now that can do for master a for master walter must walk to china if thought that there be chance of finding there in first place must remember robert that be acting only upon suspicion have only that to go upon object must be to find proof to justify suspicion understand miss have got idea want to see if be right ourselves have little doubt of robert now please sit down listen to interrupt till have finished then related ground that have for suspicion that general death walter abduction be work of john simcoe also own theory that man be not person who have saved general life in spite of warning not to interrupt tom robert exclamation of fury be frequent strongly worded well miss exclaimed when have finished tongue be untied did not think that there be such villain upon face of earth why if have suspected must have killed if have be hung for week after to think that regular took in have always cheerful word for if happened to open door for 'how be tom ' must say a usual must slip crown into hand to drink health always keep account of tip receive first thing do will be to add up see how much have have from will hand over to charity one like setting out to help to bring man to gallus when have got money in pocket must have be fool miss not to have kept better watch never thought ill of man seemed to that have be soldier sometimes when be talking with must come out with barrack room saying though never said that have served general thought that must have done so have sort of way of carrying shoulder often see among men who have not learned goose step will wait miss with permission until have got rid of money then if say to 'go to man room take by throat squeeze truth out of ' be ready to do will not require such prompt measure a tom must go about work carefully quietly fear that will be very long time before be able to collect fact that can act upon have not decided yet how to begin may tell that only other person who share suspicion be dr leeds think best that even miss purcell must know nothing about must only cause great anxiety matter will therefore be kept close secret among four self in few day plan will probably be complete think that share in business will be to watch movement of man to ascertain who be associate many of doubt be club men who of course will be above suspicion be certain that must have have accomplice in abduction of child whether visit visit be point to find out there be little chance of calling during daylight be in evening that will have to keep close eye on ascertain who visitor be right miss wish did not know by sight expect can get sort of disguise so that wo recognize think that there will be difficulty about of course be not going to rely only upon miss purcell be going to devote to search will run down between miss never fear can not be meant that fellow a must not be found out in villainy wish that there be something more for to do know several old soldier like who must join willingly enough might between carry off keep shut up somewhere just a be doing master walter until make clean breast of be wonderful what cell bread water will do to take fellow spirit down be bad enough when one know how long one have got to bear to know that there be end to until choose to speak must get truth out of old nick begging pardon for naming well will see robert must certainly be last resource fear that must not be so effectual a think if told that if did not pay usual visit to boy must be absolutely certain must never see alive again must not dare retain well miss decide on will do have lost a good master a ever man have there be nothing must not do to bring fellow to justice girl waited impatiently for next visit of dr leeds be four day before came hoped to have be here before said have be so busy that have not be possible for to manage of course business have always be in mind seems to that first step to be taken be to endeavor to ascertain whether fellow be really a believe miss covington impostor have ever heard say in what part of country formerly resided yes lived at stowmarket know that month ago introduced to uncle gentleman who be manager at bank there have known from boyhood be up for few day staying with be certainly rather against surmise miss covington however be a well to clear that matter up before attempt anything else will go down make inquiry doctor netta said quietly be head shorter than hilda altogether different in face therefore if learns that inquiry have be made will be sure that whoever made be not hilda might send down detective miss purcell want to be useful said flatter that will be able to do quite a well a detective must hardly take detective into confidence in matter of kind not knowing everything might miss point must give clew to truth will start to morrow will tell aunt that be going away for day two to follow up clew have obtained may lead to walter discovery in week will know whether man be really what claim to be very well miss purcell then will leave matter in hand by way doctor hilda covington said have taken robert into confidence know that can rely upon discretion implicitly seemed to that must have somebody can trust absolutely to watch man think that must have done better said be going to suggest that must be well to obtain assistance from what have heard very few of private detective can be absolutely relied upon mean that be necessarily rogue who must take money from side that if after trying for time consider matter hopeless will go on running up expense making charge when have in reality given up search what do propose that will do must say that in first place must watch evening house where simcoe life follow up everyone who come out ascertain who be doubt great majority of will be clubmen be likely that will be occasionally visited by of confederate think be excellent plan will of course also follow when go out for be much more likely that will visit fellow than that must come to in case like must assuredly use precaution must scarcely let know who be where resides doubt be so doctor must make robert work easier for even if came to man lodging might be away following up track of someone who have called before netta returned at end of four day have not succeeded said in answer to hilda inquiring look a came in man be certainly well known at stowmarket a john simcoe doe not prove that be man just a deceived uncle may have deceived people down there now will go upstairs take off thing then give full account of proceeding first step began on return be of course to find out what member of simcoe family lived there after engaging room at hotel can assure be most unpleasant part of business for seemed to be altogether unaccustomed to arrival of young lady unattended went into town be not much of place after making little purchase inquiring at several place heard of maiden lady of name woman who told of be communicative behe have just have great piece of luck ' said 'about ten month back nephew whom everyone have supposed to have be lost at sea came home with great fortune say that have behaved most handsomely to have always bought berlin wool such thing here have spent three four time a much since came home a did before know from neighbor of whom be customer that yard yard of flannel that buy for making up into petticoat for poor child be wonderful do know miss ' said that did not know personally that friend of mine knowing be going to stowmarket have asked to inquire if miss simcoe be still alive said casually might call see so got address then went to call upon life in little place called myrtle cottage have be good deal puzzled a to what story must tell thought at first of giving out a sister of young lady to whom nephew be paying address a knew nothing of except that be wealthy a have mentioned that have aunt at stowmarket a be coming down there have be asked to make inquiry about thought might render so indignant must get nothing from thought therefore have better get knew voluntarily so went to house knocked asked whether miss simcoe be in be shown by little maid into parlor funny little old fashioned room presently miss simcoe came in be just sort of woman have pictured kindly looking little old maid know whether have done wrong miss simcoe ' said 'but be stranger here having over worked at picture from hope great thing have be recommended country air friend told that stowmarket be pretty quiet country town just place for over worked londoner to gain health in so came down made inquiry for single lady who must perhaps take in give comfortable home for two three month name have be mentioned to a being just lady be seeking 'you have be misinformed said little primly say that few month back might not have be willing to have entertained offer circumstance have changed since then now must not think for moment of doing so ' rising from seat with tired air said that be much obliged to be very sorry must not take in a be sure must be very comfortable however a must not of course there be end of beit down dear ' old lady said see that be tired worn out servant will get cup of tea see ' went on a murmured thanks sat down ' can not very well do what ask a said few month ago must certainly have be very glad to have have young lady like to stay with for time think that when lady get to age little youthful companionship doe good besides mind saying that mean be somewhat straitened that little additional money must have be great help to everything be changed by arrival of nephew of mine perhaps may have heard name be rich man believe go out great deal belongs to club so on ' said that have not heard of for knew nothing about society sort of men who frequented club 'no of course not dear ' said 'well have be away for twenty year everyone thought be dead sailed away in ship be never heard of again may guess surprise when walked in here called aunt ' must have be indeed surprised miss simcoe ' said must have be quite shock to did know at once 'oh dear no have be traveling about world see for very long time naturally in twenty year be very much changed of course soon knew when began to talk ' recognized voice suppose ' suggested dear of course voice have changed just a appearance have done have be what called knocking about among sort of horrible savage eating drinking kind of queer thing made blood run cold to listen to never asked question about thing be afraid might say that when be among cannibal used to eat human flesh think must like man who have done that even though be nephew 'did go out quite a boy miss simcoe ' asked 'oh be twenty four think when went abroad have situation in bank here know that manager thought very highly of indeed be everywhere well spoken of brother joshua father know died came in for two three thousand pound have always have great fancy for travel so instead of looking out for nice girl settling down threw up situation started on travel 'have memory be affected by hot sun hardship that have gone through ' asked 'oh dear not at all recognized everyone almost whom have known of course be good deal more changed than be ' 'they did not recognize more than did ' 'not at first said man be believed to have be dead for twenty year face doe not occur to old friend when meet apparent stranger 'that be quite natural ' agreed 'what pleasure must have be to to talk over old time old friend 'indeed be dear enjoyed so much that for three day must not move out of house dear what pleasant talk have ' 'and say miss simcoe that coming have quite altered position ' 'yes indeed very first thing said after coming into house be that have come home resolved to make sister maria thoroughly comfortable poor maria died year ago of course did not know then said that must allow fifty pound year for life ' be very kind nice indeed miss simcoe ' said by time seeing that sympathy be with heart opened altogether to said that felt sure that nephew must not like be to take in lodger might indeed consider hint that might have be more liberal than be invited to stay three day with while be looking about for suitable lodging found that house be regular rendezvous for tabby of neighborhood afternoon there be four five of there brought work others came in undisguisedly to gossip many of have known john simcoe in younger day by careless questioning elicited fact that one must have recognized have not be for miss simcoe having told of arrival manager of bank rather shrank from encounter with managed to obtain from miss simcoe letter nephew have written to when be away from home short time before left england also one written by since return so far a must see there be not slightest resemblance between thought that might possibly get at someone le likely to be on guard than bank manager happened to mention a interesting fact that one of clerk who have entered bank lad of seventeen only month two before nephew left be now married to daughter of one of gossip said that story have so deeply interested must be glad to make acquaintance came with wife evening before left be very chatty pleasant while there be general conversation going on among others said to be great student of handwriting flattered must tell man character from handwriting owned that have be quite disconcerted by two letter miss simcoe be kind enough to show from nephew one written before left bank other dated three four month ago ' can not see slightest resemblance between two said 'and remember instance have come under knowledge of handwriting of man woman changing so completely in course of twenty year one be methodical business sort of writing showing mark of steady purpose regularity of habit kindly disposition wo give opinion of other impression be left upon mind be far from favorable 'yes there have be extraordinary change agreed ' can recollect former one perfectly for saw sign score of letter document if have have account standing at bank now must without question honor check so signed doubt great difference be accounted for by life mr simcoe have led told that for year at one time have never taken pen in hand that have almost forgotten how to write that finger have grown so clumsy pulling at rope rowing oar digging for gold opening oyster for pearl that have become thumb wrote no better than schoolboy 'but be not case mr askill ' said 'the writing be still clerkly in character doe not at answer to own description noticed that so did chief showed letter that have received from simcoe asking to run up for few day to stay with in london showed to with remark that in experience have never seen so great complete change in handwriting of man a in of mr simcoe since left bank considered striking proof how completely man handwriting depends upon surroundings turned up old ledger containing many entry in simcoe handwriting agreed that must not see single point of resemblance ' ' said be glad to find that failure to recognize two handwriting a being of same man have be shared by two gentleman who be like in humble way expert at handwriting ' next morning got letter written after have sent address told miss simcoe be unexpectedly called back to town that be quite probable must ere long be down again when must arrange with one other of people of whom have kindly spoken to that be have be able to learn hilda seems to that have learned immense deal netta have managed most admirably at rate have got a much a expected if not more have learned that one recognized man simcoe on first arrival in native town be only when old lady have spread news abroad have told tale of generosity to so prepared way for that be more le recognized having shadow of doubt that be long lost nephew in three day that stopped with have doubt learned from dear old gossip almost fact connected with boyhood men be most intimate with position held doubt not of escapade in might have taken part together so that be thoroughly well primed before met besides doubt be more anxious to hear tale of adventure than to talk of past course must have be very easy one miss simcoe said that spent money like prince gave dinner to old friend at dainty appeared champagne flowed like water may take a certain that none of guest ever entertained slightest doubt that host be man pretended to be there must seem to conceivable reason why stranger must come down settle income upon miss simcoe spend money liberally among former acquaintance if be other man than john simcoe lastly have handwriting man seems to have laid plan marvelously well to have provided against unforeseen contingency yet undoubtedly must have altogether overlooked question of handwriting although declaration that have almost forgotten how to use pen be ingenious one might have accepted if have written in rough scrambling character must expect under circumstance handwriting although in place have evidently tried to write roughly on whole be certainly that of man accustomed at one time of life to clerkly work yet differing a widely a pole from handwriting of simcoe in bank ledger in letter to aunt think hilda although matter can not be decided certainly point to theory that man be not john simcoe who left stowmarket twenty year ago attempted think very cleverly to establish identity by visit to stowmarket doubt did so to everyone perfect satisfaction when come to go into thing step by step see that everything did might have be done by anyone who happened to have close resemblance to john simcoe in figure slight resemblance in face after listening for three day to miss simcoe gossip chapter xiv advertisement can not wait for dr leeds to come round hilda said next morning at breakfast will pay visit in harley street be sure that will not grudge quarter of hour to hear what have done what mystery be two girl engaged in miss purcell asked a placidly poured out tea be little plot of own aunt netta said be trying to get on walter track in own way to be for time amateur detective so far have not found decisive clew think that be searching in right direction please trust entirely hope day will have triumph of bringing walter back safe sound pray god that may be so dear know that be sensible girl not likely to get yourselves into silly scrape think be aunt be afraid that of must consider scrape foolish one brought even little bit nearer to object of search at rate aunt will reassure to know that be acting in concert with dr leeds of whom know that entertain highest opinion certainly do of course be judge whatever a to whether be good doctor must think from what dr pearson say that must in opinion of other medical men be considered exceptionally clever man for age having seen for four month lived in close contact with must rather be attended by than by anyone else have ever met kindness to general be unceasing have be son must not have be more patient more attentive showed wonderful skill in managing be at once sympathetic cheerful more than admired tact in filling somewhat difficult position in be placed although be completely one of family stranger must have supposed that be brother at least cousin there be always something in manner that even while laughing chatting with placed little barrier between one felt although most essentially friend be still there a general medical attendant be difficult position for man of age to be placed in have be like most of doctor knew in germany man filled with idea that must always be professor of medicine impressing people with learning gravity might have be easy enough there be nothing of sort about at be just a high spirited be a bright cheerful a other young men of about same age be only when be with general that gentleness of manner recalled fact that be doctor a say be difficult position with only old woman like two girl who looked to for comfort hope who treated a if have be old friend be constantly appealing to for opinion on sort of subject confess that when first came here with dr pearson thought that be very rash experiment to introduce young evidently pleasant man to under such circumstance especially a hilda be rich heiress own mistress feeling a did be in position of chaperon must say that at first felt very anxious about be great relief to when after time saw sign on part yours of feeling stronger than friendship springing up hilda laughed merrily idea never entered into mind aunt be funny to that so many people must think that young man young woman can not be thrown together without falling in love with other at present fortunately quite understand what falling in love mean like dr leeds better think than young man ever met think that can be in least like what people feel when fall in love certainly be always a uncle doctor rather than a possible suitor for hand be proper expression be that thought of so be glad to perceive hilda be very thankful that be so against personally have nothing to say quite contrary saw that be greatly attached to profession in seems likely to make fine position nothing must be more uncomfortable than such man must marry girl with fine country estate must have to give up profession must have to settle down in london a wife of physician practically forfeit advantage hilda again laughed be wonderful that thing must never have occurred to aunt see now how fortunate be that did not fall in love with now netta a have finished breakfast will put on thing at once go consult physician in ordinary have fair chance of being first to arrive if start immediately told robert to have carriage at door at half past nine doe not begin to see patient until ten bravo miss purcell dr leeds exclaimed when have given account of mission of course there be nothing absolutely proved at least show that identity be open to doubt since none of people have known recognized at first sight of course knowledge of may have be picked up from gossiping old lady aunt something have be gained evidence be rather negative than positive be possible that be not man that pretend to be though at present putting aside question of handwriting must admit that balance of probability be very much other way to begin with how must man supposing to be impostor know that john simcoe be born in stowmarket have relative living there forgot to mention that dr leeds advertisement be inserted in county paper saying that if relative of john simcoe who left england about must communicate with someone other in town must hear something to advantage be told by one of miss simcoe friend who saw in paper brought in to be very proud of having made discovery regarded quite in light of benefactor to miss simcoe remarked when told that be curious must have advertised instead of coming down to inquire miss simcoe said that have expressed surprise to that have said did so because must have shrunk from coming down have not learned there be someone to welcome curious dr leeds said thoughtfully may quite put out of mind that reason gave be real one man of kind must not have suffered very severe shock have found that stowmarket contained have be swallowed up by earthquake certainly that must not have be reason must think of other now lady a be third card have have brought in since arrived must leave matter a stand think that be getting on much better than must have expected advertisement be very curious netta hilda said a drove back why must have put in must have be so much more natural that must have gone straight down can not think hilda did not strike particularly when heard of did not give thought afterwards see did not mention to dr leeds until flashed across mind when be talking of course did not see advertisement miss simcoe told that there have be good deal of discussion before answered a of have thought that might be trick when be went down be in august last year be in first week in september that came here went down to get manufacture proof of identity hilda said a turned out uncle accepted statement at once never have smallest doubt a to being john precaution therefore be unnecessary at same time certainly help now that doubt have arisen must have be very strange if man possessing sufficient mean to travel in india must have have friend connection in england be present when told uncle that have be down to see aunt at stowmarket in spring brought gentleman who said be manager of stowmarket bank in have be at one time clerk so see did strengthen position by going down there strengthens in one way hilda in other weakens a long a close inquiry be made be doubtless advantage to to have aunt of same name in stowmarket to be able to prove by mean of gentleman in position of manager of bank that john simcoe have worked under three four twenty year ago on other hand be useful to a starting point if have be utterly in dark a to simcoe birthplace past career must have have to start entirely in dark now at rate have located birthplace of real man learned something of position family how became possessed of money enabled to start on tour round world adhere a firmly a before to belief that be not real man next step be to discover how learned that john simcoe have lived at stowmarket at rate must be a well that must find advertisement might tell nothing at least must learn place to answer be to be sent how must set about can get reader ticket for british museum because chief librarian be friend of uncle dined with several time hilda replied if write to say want to examine file of newspaper to determine question of importance be sure that will send ticket at once may a well ask for one for also may want to go there again to decide other point hilda at once wrote note sent tom robert with to museum returned two hour later with ticket there be three suffolk paper chief assistant in newspaper department said courteously on sending up usual slip of paper do want know must like to see three please number for first two week in august last in few minute three great volume be placed on table contained year issue on turning to first week in august found that advertisement have appeared in of paper carefully copied out be about to leave library when netta said let talk over for minute two before go seems to that there be curious omission in advertisement what be that see that doe not mention stowmarket simply inquires for relation of john simcoe who be supposed to have be lost at sea must certainly seem to be more natural that must put only in paper be likely to be read in stowmarket surely must have said belatives of john simcoe who left stowmarket in year look very much a if while knew that simcoe be suffolk man have idea in what part of county have lived be very curious certainly netta a say doe seem that if have known that have be stowmarket must have said so in advertisement possibly hilda exclaimed so sharply that gentleman at adjoining table murmured hush did did not know that be in suffolk let look in london paper let ask for file of time standard paper be brought advertisement be found in of there see netta said triumphantly still say nothing about suffolk beckoned to attendant be sorry to give so much trouble will please get file of three four country paper of same date must like in different part of country yorkshire for instance hereford devonshire be trouble miss replied be what be here for in few minute three paper be brought be triumph be great when found advertisement in of settle conclusively said man did not know what part of country john simcoe came from advertised in london paper in provincial paper over country be splendid idea of yours netta think that settle question a to fact that theory laughed at be correct that man be not real john simcoe when got back hilda wrote line to dr leeds dear doctor do think that have discovered beyond doubt that man be impostor whoever may be be not john simcoe when can spare time please come round be too long to explain at nine o'clock evening dr leeds arrived heard of step that have taken really young lady said must retire at once from post of director of search be excellent thought to ascertain exact wording of advertisement fact that word stowmarket did not appear in that be inserted in other county paper be very significant a to advertiser ignorance of john simcoe birthplace quickness with saw how must be proved up to hilt show that be born detective will be happy to sit at foot in future then think that be quite conclusive perfectly so real john simcoe must of course have put advertisement into county paper published nearest to stowmarket must naturally have used word stowmarket omission might however have be accidental appearance of advertisement in london paper a have seen in provincial paper over england appears to ample evidence that did not know from what county simcoe came be ready to spend pretty heavy amount to discover now think that must at once communicate with mr pettigrew inform of suspicion discovery that have made be for to decide whether step must be taken in matter if so what step a one of trustee be responsible for proper division of estate of general mathieson matter be of considerable importance to think now too that other suspicion must also be laid before of course be greatly strengthened by discovery john simcoe who saved uncle life at risk of own be scarcely sort of man who must be guilty of murder abduction unknown adventurer who have passed off a being simcoe with object of obtaining large legacy from general may fairly be assumed capable of taking step must enable to obtain if 'd like to write to mr pettigrew make appointment to meet at office at three o'clock to morrow afternoon will be here hour before accompany lawyer be somewhat surprised when dr leeds entered office with two lady astonishment became stupefaction when told story in whole of professional career have never heard more astonishing story own abduction of child at critical moment did arouse suspicion in mind that mr simcoe only person must be benefited by disappearance might be at bottom of be quite prepared to resist until last demand might be made on part for walter to be declared to be dead property handed over to that man must have have connection with illness of general that be impostor never entered mind with regard to first be still matter of suspicion only have not shadow of proof to go upon say dr leeds dr pearson general own medical attendant other eminent physician called in refused absolutely to accept suggestion because exceptional a seizure effect be there be nothing that absolutely pointed to poison unless can obtain distinct evidence on point matter must not be touched upon for even must hardly be prepared to swear in court that general be victim to poison must not take oath to certainly must declare that symptom to mind must be attributed to poison only in case of abduction of boy lawyer went on only absolute ground for suspicion be that man one else must have benefited by theory certainly appears to be after discovery have made very tenable one come so suddenly on can not think of giving opinion a to best course to be adopted will in first place consult mr farmer in next place will feel duty to take co trustee colonel bulstrode into confidence because action that may take must of course be in joint name called here other day stated to that regarded whole matter of walter abduction to be suspicious in extreme said be convinced that john simcoe be at bottom of interest in getting boy out of way being unquestionable that must move heaven earth to find child agreed that can hing about carrying out will until have found told of step that have be taking want of success gad sir ' said must be found if examine child in country ventured to suggest that must be very difficult undertaking to only made remark about cold bloodedness of lawyer said that if there be other way must dress up a costermonger go into slum of london whether must find judicious assistant in search must scarcely be inclined to say must certainly find ready to give assistance in power next day at three o'clock colonel bulstrode be announced be short man of full habit of body at present moment face be even redder than usual dear miss covington burst out a came into room have just heard of rascality what friend miss purcell have discovered by gad young lady feel ashamed of here be harry bulstrode man of world a such considered that affair of man simcoe being made heir in case of child death simultaneous disappearance of boy to have be suspicious in extreme yet have seen way of doing anything have be so upset that temper have a rascal andrew old servant have impudence to tell morning become absolutely unbearable now find that two girl doctor fellow have be quietly working whole thing out that not improbably dear old friend be poisoned that man who did be not man pretended to be infernal impostor who have of course carried child away may for anything know have murdered have made feel that ought to go to school again for must be getting into second childhood still young lady if a be evident have sense to plan can at least do in power to assist in search have only to say to bulstrode want inquiry made in india be off by first p o thank very much colonel hilda said trying to repress smile be quite sure that from friendship for dear uncle must be ready to give assistance so far there have be way in must have aided in inquiry that have made indeed a dr leeds have impressed upon fewer there be engaged in matter better for if man knew that be making sort of inquiry about might think necessary for safety to put walter out of way altogether to send to place so distant that there must be practically hope whatever of ever discovering at present think that have fairly satisfied ourselves that man be impostor that real john simcoe be drowned a supposed in ship in sailed from india who man be how became acquainted with fact that john simcoe saved uncle life in india be mystery so far have clew to matter be at present of minor importance to before anything else want to find where walter be hidden to do be going to have man watched can not have carried off walter by doubt meet occasionally people who helped who be now hiding walter be scarcely probable that come to lodging be not likely to put into anyone power doubt go by night in disguise to meet a of course know perfectly well must be worse than useless for to try to follow be going to be done by tom robert well man andrew might help colonel said simcoe have often dined with at club never came to chamber one man can not be always on watch andrew can take turn with robert be impudent rascal have got fair share of sense so when be ready if will drop line will come here take instruction from thank very much colonel that certainly must be of assistance be only of evening that must be wanted for be quite agreed that meeting be sure to take place after dark chapter xv very bad news month passed tom robert andrew watched together in jermyn street former with cap pulled well down over face very tattered clothes latter dressed a groom making attempt to disguise face during time everyone who called at house in jermyn street be followed name address ascertained one always remaining in jermyn street while other be away man be watching have gone out evening be either to one other of club to belonged to theater opera will trace to right place presently robert hilda said cheerfully when saw that be beginning to be disheartened at non success of search may be sure that will not go to see men oftener than can help doe generally wear evening clothes always miss think there be occasion to follow in future when go out in dress think certain that when go to meet men will be in disguise when see come out dressed altogether differently to usual follow closely even if only find where go will be very important step on seventh week after disappearance of walter mr pettigrew came in one morning at eleven o'clock air be very grave have heard news mr pettigrew hilda asked have very bad news mr comfrey lawyer of not highest standing who be have learnt acting for fellow called upon said ' be sorry to say have painful news to give mr pettigrew yesterday body of child boy six seven year old be found in canal at paddington be taken to lockhouse feature be entirely unrecognizable police surgeon who examined said that have be in water over month most of clothing be gone partly torn off by barge passing over body there still remained portion of underclothing bore letter w r police recognized a of child who have be so largely advertised for a client mr simcoe have offered thousand pound reward a information be to be sent to policeman came down just a be closing office to inform of fact at once communicated with client who be greatly distressed went to paddington first thing morning tell that have doubt that remains be of walter rivington although must not swear to identity a feature be altogether unrecognizable a understand sir that miss covington be guardian of unfortunate child have driven here at once in order that may go up satisfy yourselves on subject understand that inquest will be held to morrow hilda have not spoken while mr pettigrew be telling story sat speechless with horror can not be surely can not be murmured oh mr pettigrew say that can not believe can hardly say that dear whole affair be such terrible one can place bound to villainy of man may be capable may be missing child on other hand may be only part of whole plot who else can be if have walter clothes on a to that can say nothing must remember that man be extraordinarily adroit plotter must hesitate at nothing to secure inheritance there must be very great difficulty in obtaining from rascally undertaker body of child of right age dressing up in of ward clothes dropping body into canal may have be done seven week ago may have be done month of course mean to say that be so only mean to say that be possible no expressed opinion when talked over before sensible man must put neck in noose if must carry out object without doing so murder must hardly be perpetrated without running very great risk for people with whom child be placed must upon missing suddenly be very likely to suspect that have be made away with must either denounce crime extort money by holding threat over head for year yes may be so hilda exclaimed rising to foot let go see at once will take netta with know a well a do ran upstairs in few word told netta news in five minute came down ready to start have told walter nurse to come with hilda said if anyone can recognize child ought to be able to do so fortunately be still in house now young lady lawyer said before started let caution unless feel moderate certainty that child be walter rivington make admission that see resemblance if matter come to trial evidence mine can not weigh with court a against of man who be interested in proving identity with walter of course if there be sign mark on body that recognize will acknowledge a body of ward will then have to fight case on other ground unless detect unmistakable mark be extremely unlikely that will do so in state body must be in confine to simply stating that fail to recognize in way there never be mark on poor child body hilda said have regretted so much because in absence of descriptive mark chance of ever being found be of course much lessened lawyer have come in four wheeled cab in party took place not word be spoken on way except hilda repeated what mr pettigrew have said to nurse be with very white face that entered lockhouse little body be lying on board supported by two trestle be covered by piece of sailcloth tattered garment that have have on be placed on chair beside prepared a be for something dreadful room swam round have hilda not be leaning on mr pettigrew arm must have fallen there be scarce semblance of humanity in little figure feature of face have be entirely obliterated possibly by passage of barge possibly by work of simple decay courage dear mr pettigrew said be painful duty must be performed three woman stood silent beside little corpse netta be first to speak can not identify body a of walter rivington said think that must be possible for anyone to do so be hair of same color policeman who be in charge of room asked hair be rather darker than netta said being so long in water in such dirty water might have darkened be never master walter hair nurse exclaimed darling have long soft hair unless who murdered cut short must not be like besides hair be stiffer be more like hair of workhouse child than master walter be so hilda said declare that not only recognize body a of ward that be convinced be not judging only by hair mr pettigrew said be entirely of opinion miss covington have stroked child head many time hair be like silk have nothing else to go by be convinced that body be not walter rivington then looked at fragment of clothes in two place be marked w r be marking miss nurse said after closely examining initial must not swear to bit of clothes can to letter see miss always work line above letter below be taught to do so when be girl in village school have always done since never saw anyone else mark so see letter be worked in red silk two line in white old woman who taught said that made proper finish to work yes miss covington can swear to thing being master walter must not swear to being in went out morning be lost nurse can sir because there be nothing missing except what have on have thing properly counted everything be there at moment there be little stir outside hilda glanced down whispered to netta let down fall want man to recognize just a did so john simcoe entered bowed to hilda be sorry indeed to meet under such painful circumstance beg not to address sir said haughtily wish to have communication with from coming here reminds of thirty seventh verse of nineteenth chapter of st john can look out sir if happen to have bible at home fortunately be not wholly applicable for be absolutely convinced that poor little body be not that of general mathieson grandson so saying stepped out of little house followed by others leaving john simcoe white with passion must not have shown hand so plainly miss covington must not help girl said have called dozen time at house have always received message at home must know that suspect of being walter abductor what be verse referred to hilda netta said confess know verse in st john seems to be at applicable to quotation be 'they will look on whom pierced ' netta must not help smiling mr pettigrew shook head be really too outspoken miss covington will get into trouble a be have clearly laid open to action for libel for having practically called man murderer may think what like be in position to prove be not afraid of said wish that must do then must have fact brought out in court even if must not a say prove everything must at least let world know what think there be chance of doing that mr pettigrew be fortunate for miss covington that client be for most part men sex be so impetuous so headstrong that must have hard time of indeed if have to take instruction from mr pettigrew will please remember that there be three of sex in cab if malign in way will at once get out walk old lawyer smiled indulgently be quite true dear woman be always passionately certain that be right counsel entreaty can get to believe that there can be other side to case than take talk about men ruining by litigation number do so be a nothing to of woman who must do so be to get a often involved in lawsuit when dickens drew man who haunted court must have be much nearer mark have drawn woman who did so can persuade man when have be beaten in court case be lost one woman simply regard hostile decision a effect of great partiality of incompetence on part of judge even after being beaten in house of lord will attend court pester judge with application for hearing of new point becomes perfect mania with of very well mr pettigrew must certainly carry case up to highest court if be beaten must not admit be in wrong still think must pester poor old judge after suppose will have to come up again to morrow to inquest certainly nurse have recognized clothes suppose recognize mark miss covington yes have doubt that clothes be walter of course will be represented by counsel mr pettigrew went on must not let jury find that be walter body if can possibly prevent think that will do so be afraid of will know nothing of real circumstance of case will only know that child have be missing for nearly two month in spite of large reward news have be obtained of will see that child be about same age that clothes in be found be worn by missing boy will have viewed body have seen that identification be almost impossible man will give evidence to effect that belief to be walter rivington body will give a opinion that be not opinion being founded upon fact that few patch of hair left on head be shorter coarser than be to may appear decisive counsel who will doubt appear for simcoe will very legitimately say fact have weight will point out that real judgment can be formed upon child be missing probably stolen for sake of clothes seeing description in handbill placard first step must be to cut off hair disposes of question of length a will point out hair when very long seems soft silky will stand up appear almost bristly when cropped close to head be afraid that in face of that can say coroner jury will find that body be walter a to cause of death will probably give open verdict for even if surgeon have found sign of violence upon body may have be inflicted by passing barge long after death will have brought forward that simcoe have interest in proving body to be walter think not there must be use in beginning fight in coroner court will have to be gone into when applies to higher court for order on trustee of will to proceed to carry out provision then case will be fully gone into will plead that in first place will be made under undue influence will point to singularity of general mysterious attack attack one of doctor who attended at once put down to poison at moment of attack simcoe be sitting next to at dinner will point to extraordinary coincidence that child who stood between simcoe inheritance disappeared on evening when general be in extremis lastly will fire last shot by declaring that man be not john simcoe named in will be impostor who assumed name traded upon brave action on general behalf want fight to begin until be in better position than at present to prove what say a yet however satisfactory to have not got beyond point of conjecture probability trust before have to fight case will obtain absolute fact in support of theory man must be able at present to put into court number of highly respectable witness from stowmarket of officer have met here who must testify to being john simcoe a against evidence conjecture must literally go for nothing doubt will all receive notice to attend evening policeman took name address will have told officer in charge of case nature of evidence will probably give please remember that in giving evidence must carefully abstain from saying anything must lead jury to perceive that have personal feeling against simcoe for must be likely to put down declaration of inability to recognize body a result of bias against let be seen that there be personal feeling in matter at summons arrived that evening next morning drove to coroner court miss purcell accompanying found mr pettigrew awaiting at door there be case on before ours said must advise to take drive for hour when come back to sit in carriage until come for waiting room be stuffy little place be at present full of witness in case now on a case be one of man killed in drunken row be not of class whom be pleasant to mix with when returned again came out have just spoken to coroner told who be have kindly given permission for to go up to own room case have now before may last half hour be just about time when mr pettigrew came up said that case be about to commence that must go down take place in court be now almost empty few minute before have be crowded by interested in proceeding have terminated in finding of manslaughter against four of concerned in fray discovery of child body in canal be far too common event to afford attraction with exception of witness two counsel seated in front line facing coroner two three official there be one in court a soon a little stir caused by return of jury from viewing body have ceased coroner addressed will now gentleman of jury proceed to case of body of child said to be that of walter rivington be found under very strange suspicious circumstance near end of canal will hear that child be missing from home in hyde park garden on d of october for discovery a of be doubtless aware large sum have be offered day before yesterday drag be used for purpose of discovering whether child who be lost who have be seen going near bank have be drowned in course of search body be brought up have already viewed gentleman dr macilvaine will tell that have certainly be month in water perhaps two three week longer unfortunately state of body be such that be impossible now to ascertain cause of death whether be alive when fell in be placed in water fortunately of clothes still remain on body one of witness nurse of missing boy will tell that mark upon be worked by that can swear to whether other matter will come before in reference to case from fact that child be grandson of late general mathieson heir to property have attracted much attention can not say first witness will hear be lock keeper who be present at finding of body before witness be called however one of counsel rose said be instructed sir to appear to watch proceeding on behalf of mr john simcoe who by death of walter rivington inherits under will of late general mathieson coroner bowed other counsel then rose sir have be instructed by mr pettigrew colonel bulstrode trustee under will former gentleman being also joint guardian with miss hilda covington of missing child to watch case on behalf there be again exchange of bow lock keeper then entered box evidence be given in few word simply deposed to assisting in dragging canal to finding of body have question to ask witness coroner said turning to barrister counsel employed by mr pettigrew rose yes sir have few question to ask now mr cousin say that took part in dragging canal be in charge of drag be not yes sir be always kept in readiness at lockhouse how came to use drag suppose take down spend day two in dragging canal unless have reason for supposing that body be there sir afternoon before woman came up cry said that child have fallen into water have gone out in morning to play when dinner time came did return searched everywhere for two child have just told that be playing with on bank of canal that have fallen in tried to get out sank be so frightened that ran home without saying anything thought now that have better tell said that have better go to police station repeat statement must send constable to help did came back with policeman be getting late then took boat dragged canal for two three hour next morning came again said that boy have shown just where child fell in dragged there found body brought ashore after have carried to lockhouse set to work again must not find other body what became of woman be with till fetched up body when saw ran away cry did not come back again have not seen since mr cousin sir have not seen since believe constable made inquiry about thank have nothing more to ask policeman then entered box gave evidence shortly a to assisting in operation of dragging to finding body about woman who gave alarm barrister asked have seen constable sir not since body be found thinking strange that did not come back reported at station have given name of mary smith address in old park be told to go round there such person be known one have heard of child being lost on reporting inquiry be made round neighborhood one have heard of such woman of missing child be very strange circumstance sir look a if whole story of drowning child be fabrication fact that body of child whose death be considering be found close to spot must certainly seem to point to fact that person person who be cognizant of fact that body be there be for reason anxious that must be found so employed woman to get drag used at point in order that body might be brought to light be certainly very strange business coroner said hope that police will spare effort to discover woman however a be not before must proceed with case then officer of court called out name of mary summerford nurse went into witness box understand mary sommerford that be nurse to walter rivington be sir will tell jury when last saw how be that be lost told story a have told to hilda on day that be missing have seen clothes found on body do recognize a that be wearing when last saw yes sir how do recognize because initial be worked in two place worked can swear to can not recognize body nurse believe be body of young master said hair be lovely long silky what hair remains on body be very short what must call stubbly hair might have be cut short by people who stole coroner said be first precaution must take to evade search must at once be set on foot yes sir think that must have grown up so stiff experience of workhouse child coroner remarked be that whatever hair may have have when entered house be stiff enough to stand upright when cut close to head there be nothing else be there lead to doubt identity of child sir can not say that there be believe that be master walter body hilda netta mr pettigrew gave evidence two former stated that identified clothes upon same ground a nurse failed to recognize body a of walter rivington be asked if must in way account for finding of child body there question have be foreseen said that although have used mean of discovering child have obtained no clew whatever a to whereabouts from time that be stolen to time be summoned to identify body quite assume that be stolen not that wandered away a child will do when nurse be gossiping be convinced that be stolen sir because search be begun so momentarily after be missed that must hardly have got out of sight have merely wandered away on foot notice be given to police hour after disappeared street in part of london be scoured immediately child of age miss covington have often fancy for hiding child may have hidden somewhere close until saw nurse pas by then made off in opposite direction spot where child body be found be little more than quarter of mile from corner where be missed might have wandered up there found on canal bank childlike have begun to play so slipped into water john simcoe be last witness called gave evidence to effect that have seen body personally saw reason to doubt that be that of walter rivington counsel then rose be believe mr simcoe owing to death of poor child principal legatee under will of general mathieson be sorry to say that be whole business have caused immense distress have felt that being only person must benefit by child death who did not know must have suspicion might have have hand in mysterious disappearance have taken active part in search for offered reward of one thousand pound for information must lead to discovery believe have traveled up down obscure slum in london in hope of lighting upon even without provision in will made next heir benefited by did not did most munificently general mathieson have informed must find by will that have not be ungrateful for service rendered many year ago be not aware of sum that have left a to distant contingency of inheriting in case of child death be altogether ignorant of have known must in way have affected little fellow be fine healthy child therefore thought that might not live to come of age must never have entered mind a other counsel have question to ask evidence be now concluded well gentleman have heard evidence coroner said dr macilvaine have told a indeed might judge for yourselves on viewing body that be impossible in advanced state of decomposition to say whether child be alive dead at time fell be placed in canal a to who be guilty person who beguiled child away if be beguiled have shadow of evidence may well be that be stolen for sake of clothes cutting short of hair certainly point to truth of theory a doe also fact that vestige have be found of upper clothing be probable that woman enticed away kept for time with then when became alarmed by search made for carried in sleep from house perhaps laid down by canal thinking that must be found there in morning that poor child awoke in dark wandered about fell into canal however be only theory be at least supported by mysterious incident of unknown woman who by mean of tale appears beyond doubt to have be wholly fictitious caused water at spot to be dragged fact that on second day pointed out almost exact point where body be found must seem to show that child must scarcely have fallen in water a suggested for in case must not have known precise spot must seem then more likely that child died natural death perhaps from confinement bad treatment possibly that terribly alarmed at search be being maintained be put out of way then thrown into canal at spot in case may admit that be certainly strange that must risk discovery by course took can only account for on ground that have be ever since death suffering from remorse possibly may have thought that might in sort of way atone for conduct be to point out where child be so secure for christian burial that however be not before at present see advantage in adjournment for indefinite time until mystery be solved police have taken matter in hand will spare pain to discover woman if do so undoubtedly proceeding will be taken in court point that have to consider be who child be how came to death unfortunately be absolutely without evidence of what became of from time got lost up to discovery of body think that can not do otherwise than find open verdict a to question of identity there can think be shadow of doubt clothes in be found prove beyond question to have be walter rivington although body be absolutely beyond identification think that need give weight to nurse failure to recognize to opinion about hair be naturally reluctant to acknowledge even to herself that child be lost by inadvertence be dead lady must be equally reluctant to admit that hope be over jury put head together there be evidently difference of opinion for in two three minute sat down again foreman stood up have decided on verdict coroner asked have sir find that body be that of walter rivington that be found dead in canal how came there by what mean came by death there be evidence to show thank gentleman be precisely verdict must myself have given chapter xvi fresh clew just verdict expected mr pettigrew said a lady issued from courthouse suppose that be for best mr pettigrew seems hard when must have said so much to be obliged to hold tongue altogether doubt will have opportunity later on miss covington tongue be tied until can obtain sort of proof to go upon can not go into court with merely suspicion must get fact have done at present be to obtain sort of foundation on to work fact will hope get ere long from what may discover of fellow movement be likely to be le careful now that have be decided that walter be dead be doubtless well aware of fact that trustee have year given before proceeding to carry out provision of will therefore for time will keep quiet at end of year solicitor will write courteous letter asking when will be in position to distribute estate in accordance with provision of will will reply that be not in position to do so then after time will come letter of more more peremptory character at last notice that be about to apply to court for order for to act upon provision of will about two year after general death matter will probably come on may say have already sent check to small legatee thank be aware of because tom robert came to yesterday with check for two hundred pound said look here miss covington said meant to keep on just same a in general time so wo be of use to must like to spend in way that think best to find out what have become of master walter ' of course told that money must not be spent in way that work that be doing be of far greater use than ten time sum must be will send check to morrow miss covington sum have paid to people who have be searching other expense may be incurred will of course come out of estate have not a yet settled suppose a to future plan except will certainly keep on house in hyde park garden for present be of course ridiculously large for want trouble of making move until make one permanently will therefore stay here until matter be finally cleared up miss purcell have most kindly consented to remain a chaperon plan of niece will depend upon mine have sent away carriage when entered court walked quietly home mr pettigrew returning at once to office next morning tom robert accosted hilda a entered breakfast room with face showed have news have traced down to one of place at last miss said to andrew must keep special sharp look out to night for like enough now that inquest be over will be going to talk over matter with pal well miss last night at half past nine out come be in evening dress for although a usual have topcoat on have light trouser walking boot did not turn usual way went up into piccadilly followed kept close behind andrew at distance so that must not notice together at circus hailed cab a got in heard say to driver 'king cross station a soon a have gone off andrew jumped into cab told man to drive to same place that must give shilling extra if drove sharp did drive sharp felt sure that have got there before man stopped outside entrance andrew went inside in five minute arrived paid driver fare went in have agreed to wait two three minute outside while andrew be to be at ticket office to see where booked for be just going in when to surprise out man came again walked briskly away ran in fetched andrew off went after have more than minute start be nearly up to by time have got down to main road kept behind until saw go up pentonville hill then andrew went on ahead of followed agreed that if looked back suspicious must drop behind andrew when once got ahead be to keep about same distance in front of so a to be able to drop behind take up instead of while be to cross over road if thought that have discovered be following however did not seem to strike that anyone be watching walked on briskly until came to small house standing by a turned in be in time to see that door be opened to by man andrew consulted went in at gate took shoe off went round house there be only light in one room looked a if there be servant curtain be pulled together inside must see nothing of what be going on stopped there for hour half then came out again hailed cab halfway down hill drove off andrew have compared watch have gone back to jermyn street so that must be able to know by time chap arrived whether have gone anywhere else on way back when joined found that man must have driven straight to circus then got out for walked in just twenty minute after have seen start be good news indeed robert will go see mr pettigrew directly after breakfast please order carriage to be round at quarter to ten netta be a pleased a friend when heard that step have be made at last be sick of inaction said want to be doing something towards getting to bottom of affair do hope that will find way in can be useful have doubt at that will be very useful when get fairly on track expect that will lead to something after tom robert have repeated story to mr pettigrew hilda said brought robert with mr pettigrew that might tell story in own way seems to that best thing now must be to employ private detective to find out who man be who life in rose cottage must be out of line of tom robert colonel bulstrode servant altogether must not know how to set about making inquiry whereas detective must be at home at such work quite agree with lawyer said to make inquiry without exciting suspicion requires training practice injudicious question might lead to man being warned that inquiry be being made about might ruin matter altogether of course two men will still keep up watch may be that will find be of more use to follow track of man than other must not be too sanguine man at rose cottage may be old acquaintance of simcoe well dear went on in answer to decided shake of head on hilda part must call man by only name that be known by although may not belong to grant that manner in drove into king cross station then walked out on foot must seem to show that be anxious to throw anyone who might be watching off scent that visit be so to speak clandestine one may relate to entirely different matter for man may be for aught know adept in crime may be in league with many other doubtful character may be so mr pettigrew will hope not very well dear lawyer said will send for trustworthy man at once set to work collecting information regarding occupant of cottage now have point upon wish to ask opinion have morning received letter from man solicitor asking if intend to undertake funeral of body coroner jury have found to be that of walter rivington announcing that if client will have carried out what do think mr pettigrew hilda said hesitatingly may be wrong know may be walter body have be thinking over lawyer replied must say be opinion that a have stated conviction that be not must only stultify if now undertook funeral put stone with name on over grave if must at time become convinced that have be wrong can apply for faculty to remove coffin to family vault down in warwickshire if must do must not mind hilda said even possibility of walter being buried by man who firmly believe be cause of death be terrible yes can quite understand feeling think that be necessary that family must make protest against being supposed that recognize child by declining to undertake funeral protest must well be stronger if think that mr pettigrew certainly have best stand aside let poor child be buried by man two day later be driving in row be hilda first appearance there since general death after talking over with netta now appeared there in order to show that be perfectly convinced that child have be found in canal be not little cousin detail of proceeding of coroner court have of course be read by friend appearance in park must be best proof that must give that family be absolutely convinced that body be not that of walter miss purcell netta be with latter have on a usual thick veil always wore when driving through locality where might meet john simcoe

about will be drawn up by colonel bulstrode lawyer knew uncle by sight besides legacy be exactly same a in other will signature written instruction be in handwriting signed in solicitor office in presence of two of clerk think can possibly mean that must be walter abduction that be not john simcoe must say that former be much more likely see have need of accomplice in matter of getting evidence a to identity whereas did need accomplice in carrying off of walter must say that be far too clever man to let anyone into of secret unless needed assistance wonder who man with can be be dressed in good style have certainly met somewhere believe a said be at opera must have thought that man of class be last simcoe must choose a confederate miss purcell looked from one to other a talked have by time be taken completely into confidence have refused absolutely to believe that man must be guilty of such wickedness a suspected on return home found letter awaiting from mr pettigrew

hard working accountant in somewhat humble perhaps well paying line that be trifle eccentric in habit prefers living cheap solitary life at home while spending money freely in character of man about town in evening can not say that prospect in direction seems hopeful have told man that for present will not require service further doe not seem very satisfactory certainly hilda said with sigh be afraid that will have to keep on watching simcoe wish must peep into room a detective did into of pentonville man suppose that must find anything there hilda be not sort of man to keep memorandum book jotting down own doings hilda said with laugh still one always think that one can find something have hilda covington have wish looked into john simcoe room that morning must certainly have derived satisfaction from sight have finished breakfast before opening letter lay beside what plague old woman be with letter told that hated correspondence persists in writing month so though never get reply except bey dear aunt thanks for letter be glad to hear that be well affectionate nephew ' well suppose must read through glanced over first page on turning to second eye became arrested read carefully frowning deeply a did so then turned back read again passage be a follows have quite interesting little episode day two after last wrote young lady said name be barcum that be artist came in asked if must take in a lodger be total stranger to place have come down for health said that tradesman have recommended to come here saying that a single lady might be glad to accommodate of course told that did not take lodger got up to go when nearly fainted must not do le than offer cup of tea then got very chatty a saw that be really too weak to go about town looking for lodging invited to stay day two with being quite lady very pleasant spoken one accepted pleasanter companion never have naturally mentioned name told what adventure have gone through how kind be be greatly interested often asked question about do think that almost fell in love with from description left suddenly on receipt of letter called up to town saying that must return have not heard from since be greatly afraid that poor child must be seriously ill be pretty intelligent looking girl with dark eye hair must say that when in good health must be very bright of course may have changed mind about coming down be sure must have written if have be well confound old gossip john simcoe said angrily a threw letter down wonder what mean who girl can be be clear enough that whoever be be sent down there to make inquiry about be that girl covington doing have doubt though be not minx for description doe not tally at have light brown hair grayish sort of eye there be one comfort must learn nothing to disadvantage from old woman believe from anyone at stowmarket in fact must only get more more confirmation of story have fear upon score thing show how girl be working on track a for lawyer be old fool if have be for must bet hundred to one that must never have entertained suspicion that be not right be doing through be piece of of course must have suspicion be not john simcoe suppose wanted to learn if there be dark spot in history whether have ever be suspected of robbing bank have be expelled from school for thieving something of sort begin to be downright afraid of have way of looking through when be telling best story to general always put out disliked from first though be sure tried in way to be pleasant to felt from day first saw that be enemy that if trouble ever did come must be through have doubt be moving heaven earth to find walter that will never do for harrison be a true a steel be only man who must put on right track moreover have a much pull over a have over have never have doubt about being john simcoe doe know about other affair only that walter stood between estate be quite ready to lend hand to manage to get out of way so in business be in a deep a be while know of score of scheme have be engaged in one of must send abroad for life expect inquiry be made at stowmarket to endeavor to find out whether child have be sent down there if so miss covington be not so sharp a took to be stowmarket must be very last place where man having relation friend there must send child whom wished to keep concealed still be annoying confoundedly annoying show that people be to say hilda covington be pushing inquiry in direction likely unlikely only comfort be more closely search sooner will come to conclusion that boy be not to be found believe that though declared did not recognize body have real doubt about only said so because if have admitted trustee must have have excuse for not carrying out provision of will text girl have impudence to quote to looked a if believed body be walter that have killed though may be that only said to drive to bringing whole business into court by bringing action against for libel be not such fool a to do just at present there be lot of public feeling excited by circumstance of child loss finding of body even if got verdict fancy that jury must be on girl side give such trifling damage that verdict must do more harm than good game clearly be to let matter rest until have died out of public mind then will apply formally for trustee to be called upon to act doubt will give great deal of trouble comfrey say that think that order must be granted at last though possibly may be withheld a far a estate be concerned for year at rate ought to get ten thousand at once a question whether boy be alive dead can not affect that in slightest chapter xvii netta act independently seems to hilda somehow other be wasting time netta said one morning suddenly a be sitting together how do mean netta well see relied great deal on being able to overhear conversation from distance except few word gathered in park have absolutely done nothing way how can do more than be doing know be what be troubling know dear that be quite content to give up own work to help at first of course aunt must have stayed here at rate for time to keep company uncle have be dead now for more than eight month time be going on if be really helping must stop if be five year in fact be not helping in way intended be helping netta hilda exclaimed with tear in eye how must have got on through sad time if have not be here to comfort cheer yes necessity for be over have friend though go out yet often go to lady moulton of other friend come to see yes will never go with netta see when come dear have nothing in common with know people of whom talk must simply sit there uncomfortably so prefer to be out of altogether then really miss work ever since came to eight year ago have be teaching eight ten hour day like work be immensely interesting be happy in seeing pupil improve mean hilda said sorrowfully be going to say that be time for to go back doe not necessarily mean that there be alternative must either be doing something go back a said before netta what can do more than have done be have be thinking hilda anyhow mean to try to do something before give up go to germany again warn netta that will be furious if do that be own mistress now for mr pettigrew will let do a like now be nineteen be quite determined that old plan will be carried out that will start institution like of professor menzel somewhere near london have be twelve month away pupil have already taken to other teacher there can not be least occasion for assistance in institution be now well stocked with teacher while here must do enormous good anyhow whether stay not will a soon a be settled take large house standing in own ground in healthy place near london obtain teacher well need not talk of just yet netta said quietly will be time enough when have failed in carrying out plan what be plan have not quite settled when do mean to work entirely in own way will say nothing about until come to say have succeeded have failed hilda opened eye in surprise why must be kept in dark because dear might not approve of plan netta replied coolly be not thinking of doing anything foolish hope hilda exclaimed if be foolish must be excusable where counsel of wisdom have failed netta laughed then more seriously nothing must be foolish if must possibly lead to discovery of walter hiding place afternoon when hilda drove out with miss purcell to make call rang bell when tom robert came in said want to have long talk with robert mind what say be to be kept perfect secret between ourselves yes miss said in surprise now sit down went on can talk more comfortably so now robert there be doubt that be not making much headway with search that be not miss netta agreed did think that have gained something when traced to house on pentonville hill doe not seem that anything have come of after then be quite time that took other step said decisively be ready miss replied eagerly tell what to do be game to do well there be two three thing have in mind first of want to be able to watch john simcoe pentonville man when be talking together yes understand said how be to be done be what want to find out now in first place about house way did window look of room where there be light window be at side of house miss little way round corner noticed light there there be window looking out on front did not see light there a shutter be closed say that curtain of other window be pulled very close yes crossed other most of way down now question in mind robert be must be easier to cut slit in curtain to bore hole in shutter to take brick out carefully from side wall then to deepen hole until got to wall paper then make slight hole there robert looked at with astonishment do really mean certainly mean seems to that only chance of ever finding walter be to overhear men talk then miss must say that simplest way must be to cut window pane out yes see be pretty certain that curtain will not be drawn until come in must notice at once if took out pane in front window shutter must prevent seeing hearing man must be sure to notice pane be missing a walked up from gate to house must say miss that best plan must be for to manage to get into house time during day to hide in room under table sofa somewhere listen to shook head in first place robert must certainly be murdered if found there must take chance of miss may be sure must take brace of general pistol with must not find such easy work to get rid of may be so netta said if in struggle shot last chance of ever hearing of walter must be gone might be tried for murder must be assumed of course that be burglar for explanation that have broken into house only to hear conversation must scarcely be believed moreover must remember that know how often men meet simcoe have not be there since tracked there six month ago only thing have since found out be that man saw with in park be man who life in house must never do for to make entrance into house night after night week after week to run risk of being detected there seized a entered caught by police a burglar a far a can see only safe plan be to get out brick very carefully in side wall to make hole behind through paper might be necessary to make entry into house before be done so a to decide be best spot for opening great deal must depend upon paper in room if be light paper with only small amount of pattern upon hole large enough to see through might be noticed if be dark paper well covered hole might be made without fear of catching eye see must be rather large hole for supposing wall be only nine inch thick person standing outside must not see what be passing inside unless hole be good size doubt much if must be able to hear miss netta think must especially a people talking of thing of sort even if have great fear of being overheard must speak in low voice must not matter if must see face must know what be saying robert did not think right to offer remark on what appeared to to be impossible confined to saying in respectful voice indeed miss netta be stone deaf said have learned to read what people be saying from movement of lip although indeed miss be a respectful a before netta saw that did not in slightest degree believe just go to other end of room robert make remark to yourself move lip in same way a if be talking make sound robert with military obedience marched to other end of room placed in corner turned round facing lip moved confident that must not know what be saying expressed natural sentiment girl at once repeated word well be jiggered be rum start miss netta have gone clean off head robert jaw dropped flushed up to hair be sure began be stopped by girl merry laugh apologize robert be natural enough that must be surprised well see can do a say will now go on with talk greatly abashed tom robert returned to chair murmuring to a sat down well be blowed when be roughly recalled to necessity of keeping mouth shut by quiet remark never mind about being blowed at present robert let talk over plan who be keeper of house in jermyn street be kept by man wife miss have be butler believe wife be cook wait upon gentleman who lodge there cook have girl who sweep doe bedroom scrubbing that sort of thing what sort of girl be robert seems nice sort of young woman miss andrew have spoken to more than have because see get up aint likely to take much with young girl suppose be not very much attached to place lor ' miss told andrew that be only six month up from country pay eight pound year pretty hard work have to do for well robert want to take place want robert voice failed in astonishment yes want to take place robert must think that if andrew be to tell that have friend up from country who want just such place be ready to pay five pound to get one might be ready to take offer especially a might say that knew of lady who be in want of under housemaid thought that must get place a to miss have doubt that must leave to morrow if must get five pound told andrew that hated london must go down home take country place a soon a have saved up money to do so better robert then must have to do must be to say that have heard of place near home wanted to leave at once did not wish to inconvenience that have cousin who be just coming up to london wanted place that must jump at must say that cousin have not be in service before that be thorough good cleaner hard worker do mean that must go a servant miss netta why must not be right for to do so anything must be right led to discovery of walter hiding place robert have be accustomed to teaching have helped aunt to look after house for year in slightest degree mind playing part of servant for short time in order to try get at bottom of matter think that can be managed be sure can be managed right enough miss what miss covington must say if knew that have hand in bringing about ca say well wo be drawn into matter will say enough to aunt to satisfy that be acting for best will simply when go leave note for mistress telling have gone to work out idea have have in mind that must be use for to inquire into matter until hears of again what be to tell andrew miss simply tell that young woman have be engaged to watch simcoe in lodging then tell story have to tell girl will want three four day to get thing ready will have to go to dressmaker tell want three four print gown for young servant about own figure a soon a be ready will be ready too well miss will do a tell must say quite respectful hope that will bear in mind if thing go wrong be dead against that be only because said that be only chance of finding master walter agreed to lend hand will certainly bear that in mind netta said with smile talk over with andrew to night remember be only to know that young woman have be engaged to keep watch on simcoe will be glad enough to hear miss that someone else be going to do something say colonel be so irritable because have found out so little that there be bearing with colonel be trying netta laughed a know come here two three time week put into such rage that a stamp up down room expect to hear crash to find that dining room ceiling have fallen down be thoroughly kind hearted man be dreadful specimen of what english gentleman may come to after have have command of indian regiment for year be accustomed to have will obeyed in everything be very bad for man be good deal worse for servant miss tom robert said in tone of deep sympathy for comrade doubt whether must have stood though andrew express feeling strong sometimes know that if offered good place even in buckingham palace must not leave colonel two day later netta heard that girl in jermyn street have joyfully accepted offer have that morning told master that have heard that be wanted badly at home that cousin of hers must be up in day two must be sure be very glad to take place master agreed to give trial if looked clean tidy girl will be clean tidy robert be sure will do injustice to recommendation robert shook head matter be to mind far too serious to be joked about almost felt a if be acting in treasonable sort of way in aiding to carry out such project on following monday hilda on coming down to breakfast found note on table opened in haste seeing that be in netta handwriting eye opened in surprise almost dismay a read darling hilda told that have plan well be off to carry out be of use asking what be where be going will hear nothing of until return to tell whether have failed succeeded aunt know what be going to do hilda at once ran upstairs to miss purcell room where have netta gone exclaimed letter have given quite turn say that know feel sure that be something very foolish rash thought that have better opinion of netta common sense miss purcell said placidly smiling little at hilda excitement be arrangement dear not mine be certainly not at liberty to give information about say must not have opposed in first instance have known of certainly can not say that there be anything foolish in admit that seems to to offer better chance of success than plan have yet be tried think there be occasion for anxiety about netta have thought over plan very carefully have gone to work in methodical way may fail if so think that will be fault why must not tell a well a hilda asked rather indignantly possibly because did not wish to raise hope might not be fulfilled principally own because thought must raise objection to be bent upon having own way have seconded well dear through business yes know aunt have be most kind in respect well dear then grudge having little plan of own grudge bit hilda said impetuously a be quite satisfied will try to be quite satisfied too see took by surprise be so afraid that might do something rash get into trouble somehow know really be quite afraid of man must certainly far rather run risk than let do so of have doubt hilda be quite sure that if case have be reversed must have undertaken little plan that have hit upon to endeavor to relieve her of terrible anxiety just a be doing for well will be patient aunt how long do think that will be away be more than can tell at rate have promised to write line at least twice week must think right can recall be something aunt can not guess whether be likely to be week month miss purcell shook head will depend upon whether succeeds in hitting upon clew a to where walter be if find that have chance of so doing will return if on other hand think that there be probability that with patience will succeed will continue to watch wait miss netta be not ill hope miss robert said when came in to clear breakfast thing away have gone away on short visit hilda replied have be watching old soldier face might have caught slight contortion must have enlightened a to fact that knew more than did about matter have avoided looking at lest must read in face that be in ignorance a to netta whereabouts must have liked to have asked when went whether took box with whether have gone early that morning late evening before felt that question of sort must show that be totally in dark a to friend movement in fact netta have walked out early that morning having sent off box by carrier on previous saturday when hilda be out robert having carried to receiving house be four five day before dr leeds called again be miss purcell out asked carelessly when little time have elapsed without making appearance be that asked innocently dr leeds hilda said quickly doctor looked at in genuine surprise innocently miss covington think that quite understand see doctor have be in error suspected of being accomplice of netta in little scheme in be engaged on own account then told about disappearance of letter that have received of conversation with aunt dr leeds be seriously disturbed need hardly say that come a perfect surprise to miss covington say frankly very unpleasant one only satisfactory feature be that young lady aunt doe not absolutely disapprove of scheme whatever be although be evident that approval be by mean warm one be very serious matter have highest opinion of friend judgment sense own feel extremely uneasy at thought that have so to speak pitted against one of most unscrupulous villain have ever met whose past conduct show that must stop at nothing who be playing for very big stake must be a dangerous to interfere between tiger prey a to endeavor to discover secret on so much depends feel that doctor own be exceedingly anxious aunt have have two short letter from be written in pencil envelope be in ink in usual handwriting must think probable that took with several directed envelope letter be very short first be be getting on right aunt be comfortable too early to say whether be likely to discover anything pray fidget about let do so there be nothing to be uneasy about ' second be a nearly a possible in same word except said hilda must be patient rome be not built in day after so many clever people have failed can not expect that can succeed at once be good a far a go doctor said see doe not go very far be not until success be nearly reached that danger will really begin mind saying to that miss purcell be very dear to have not spoken to on subject a wished to see how present partnership be likely to turn out be wholly dependent upon profession until felt ground thoroughly determined to remain silent can imagine therefore how troubled be at news be not have such implicit confidence in judgment must feel still more even a be when think how unscrupulous how desperate be man against whom have single handed entered list can not be alarmed be very glad at what have told doctor have little hope that might be so seemed to impossible that must be living for four month with dear girl without being greatly attracted by of course know nothing of feeling subject be one have never be alluded to between be sure that girl living be more fitted than be to be wife of medical man must give much to have netta back again miss purcell be obdurate say that knowing a doe what netta be doing doe not think that be running risk at rate none proportionate to importance of finding clew to walter hiding place will ask if will write to niece urge to return saying how anxious be about if will not do that whether will release from promise of secrecy so that may let know what be doing will go ask now will bring down so that can add entreaty to mine doctor miss purcell refused to interfere consider scheme to be possible one said though be certainly doubtful of success have set heart upon will hing to balk say that be free from anxiety confidence in netta cleverness may say prudence be such that believe that risk be running be very slight must be cruel think wrong at present moment when above thing be necessary that brain must be clear to distress trouble by interfering with action perhaps be right miss purcell doctor said thoughtfully being totally in dark in matter be not justified in giving decisive opinion will admit that must not conduce either to comfort to success of undertaking be to harass by interfering in way with plan have doubt have be thoroughly thought out before undertook one madman must shout instruction warning to person performing dangerous feat requiring coolness presence of mind such take be scheme whatever be in be engaged a be only one who know what that scheme be must however reluctantly abide by decision when miss covington tell conversation that have have together will recognize how deeply be interested in matter chapter xviii down in marsh comparatively few of who nowadays run down to southend for breath of fresh air give thought to fact that wide stretch of low country lying between

like child have got in mind to bring up straight so let have more word about chapter xix partial success netta have be away three week when one morning just a be sitting down to breakfast suddenly came into room with cry of joy hilda ran into arm wicked wicked girl exclaimed know that ought not to speak to deserve must even look at can not help miss purcell embraced niece more soberly hilda saw by expression of face that niece return relieved of burden of anxiety at time have have difficulty in concealing in first place netta before even give cup of tea tell if be final return whether be going to disappear again that will decide after have heard story netta said quietly have got news of walter be not sure think so so have kept secret aunt promised must dear of course have kept word though be very difficult to resist hilda pleading dr leeds too have be terribly anxious about not day have passed that have not run in for few minute to learn if there be news see why must have known have be away why dear hilda said coming here a often a doe naturally inquired where be a be uncertain how long must be away a have always be in counsel must hardly keep in dark even have wished to do so now dear let know about there can be possible reason for keeping silent longer well hilda whole affair have be very simple there be not least occasion for being anxious simply wanted to keep quiet because felt that must raise sort of objection to plan have a know thought over great many method by might overhear conversation between john simcoe man on pentonville hill seemed next to be impossible that must be managed there suddenly idea came into brain that a servant at simcoe lodging in jermyn street might have excellent chance hilda gave exclamation of horror dear netta never can really have thought of carrying out not only thought of did with little management girl there be got hold of a fortunately happened that did not like london wanted to take country situation there be very little difficulty agreed to introduce a friend who be willing to take place of course took few day to make arrangement to get suitable clothes for place sent by parcel delivery on morning of day that girl be to leave presented at house man wife be good enough to approve of appearance have seemed three set of lodger one on floor man waited upon work be to do room keep house tidy generally again hilda gave gasp there be nothing much in netta went on without heeding used to do most of house work when be in germany think gave satisfaction of course chief difficulty be about deafness be obliged to explain to be very hard of hearing unless be directly spoken to mr johnstone always answered bell when be at home of course when be out be duty to do so when be downstairs be simple enough for only have to go to door of room of saw bell in motion at first seemed to think that difficulty be insuperable believe that in other respect suited so well that decided to make best of when husband be out be upstairs mr johnstone took to answering door bell if lodger rang be not very often for husband seldom went out unless be three away must come upstairs tell johnstone said to one day be best girl have ever have that instead of having to go most carefully over sitting room before gentleman came in for breakfast found that everything be so perfectly dusted tidied up that there be really nothing for to do oh hilda never have slightest idea before how untidy men be way spill tobacco ash over room put end of cigar upon mantelpiece table everywhere else must hardly believe ground floor second floor be worst for very often have men in of evening state of room in morning be something awful man be on first floor did not give anything like so much trouble for almost always went out in evening never have more than one two friend in with one of friend be man saw with in row who have doubt be accomplice of came oftener than anyone else very often coming in to fetch a be always in evening dress suppose went to club to theater together be bound to say that appearance be distinctly that of gentleman have taken with two three thing foresaw must want among be auger cork of size must exactly fit hole that must make simcoe bedroom communicated with sitting room always used door in going from one room to other be evident that be only through must get view of what be going on did not see how must possibly make hole through door be on one side next to where fireplace be there be window directly opposite of course hole must have be noticed immediately only place must see to make be through door frame position be matter of much calculation can assure auger be inch bore dared not get larger must have be hopeless to try see anything with smaller one especially a hole must have to be four five inch long a sometimes went into room when be together either with hot water grilled bone something of sort be able to notice exactly where chair be generally placed simcoe sat with back to bedroom door other man on other side of hearthrug facing therefore decided to make hole on side nearest to wall so must see other man past simcoe of course wanted hole to be a low a possible a must not be so likely to be noticed a must be higher up chose point therefore must come level with eye when be kneeling down at about four o'clock in afternoon always went out from then till six johnstone also took airing went upstairs to turn down bed tidy up generally be very seldom that of dined at home therefore have that two hour to got line hole must go by leaving door open fastening stick to back of chair till be a nearly a must judge height of man face tying piece of string to bringing tight to point where settled hole must start then marking line string made across frame then there be good deal more calculation a to side slant ten day ago boldly set to work bored hole everything be perfectly right must see head of stick circle be large enough for to get man face in view of course have put duster on ground to prevent chip falling onto carpet be little nervous when set to work to drill hole be only time felt nervous at have beforehand drilled several hole in shelf of cupboard so a to accustom to use auger did not take many minute before came through on other side cork be of two size one fitted tightly into hole other must be drawn in out with very little difficulty have gone out one day bought tube of paint of color thought must match graining of door frame also bought corkscrew be about inch half shorter than depth of hole be meant to be used by cross piece went through hole at top have got cross piece out with trouble tied short loop of string through hole have gone through put corkscrew into one of smaller cork pushed through until be level with frame on sitting room side found that by aid of loop of string must draw out easily then put one of larger cork in at bedroom side of hole pushed in until be level with side then painted end of cork to resemble graining when be done must hardly be noticed couple of foot away have now nothing to do to wait until right moment came came last night man arrived about seven o'clock johnstone be out showed upstairs simcoe be already dressed be in sitting room lost time went into bedroom where gas be burning turned down bed on side nearest to door then went round with corkscrew have ready in pocket took out inner cork got hold of loop pulled other one out also even have have hearing must have heard nothing of what be said inside for door be of mahogany very well fitted johnstone have said one day even if man shouted in one room must hardly be heard in next on landing pushed wedge under door so a to prevent being opened suddenly be thing be most afraid of thought that simcoe must hardly move without coming within line of sight must have time to jump up be busy at bed before must open door be not sure of so used wedge if tried door must not open must only suppose that door have stuck must snatch out wedge kick under bed by time made second effort kneeling down saw to delight that calculation have be perfectly right must see man face well for light of candle fell full upon talked for time about club men be going to dine with began to be afraid that there be going to be nothing more when man said way simcoe went down to tilbury yesterday ' what simcoe said of course must not hear other answered yes be all right getting quite at home man said have almost ceased to talk about friend then saw rise at once jumped up went on turning down bed lest simcoe must have forgotten something come in for however did not two three minute later peeped in again room be dark knew that have gone then put cork in again saw that paint be right went downstairs told mr johnstone that if must be spared must like to go out for two three hour morning to see friend in service be time must best be spared must have finished sitting room by eight o'clock a none of men have breakfast until about eleven there be plenty of time for to make bed after got back hilda be cry now relief that hearing that walter be alive well be unbounded have absolutely refused to recognize body found in canal must not admit that probability be against be certain that clothes be child age be about same body must have be in water right length of time only shadow of evidence to support be hair have taken trouble to go to two three workhouse found that coroner assertion that soft hair when cut quite close will in very short time stand upright be correct one kept on hoping against hope faith have be yielding especially since netta absence have deprived her of support that obtained from when inclined to look at matter from dark point of view oh netta cried how can thank enough how happy news have made to think have be blaming while have be doing can not tell what relief be to have thought so much of poor little body dread that be walter after have be growing upon have scarcely slept for long time know dear be because saw that though still kept up appearance of hope be really in despair must tell from heavy eye when came down of morning that have hardly slept that made up mind something must be done there be hardship whatever in acting a servant for month two can assure that regarded rather a fun be quite proud of credit master gave now question be will go back again certainly not netta might be month there without having piece of luck again at moment might be caught listening might notice hole that made so cleverly besides have gained clew now to walter hiding place even be a nothing to in comparison with having learned that be alive well that have ceased to fret be becoming contented in new home can afford to wait now sooner later be sure to find before pictured if still alive a shut up in horrible cellar now can be patient think that be sure to find before long well think dear miss purcell said quietly that have better ring bell have fresh tea made everything be perfectly cold for be three quarter of hour since came up hilda rang bell gave necessary order let janet bring thing up robert come back when have given order want to send line to dr leeds will be delighted to hear that miss purcell have learned at least that walter be alive well mind went on a old soldier be about to burst out into exclamation of delight must keep altogether to yourself be quite possible that have be watched a closely a have be watching man that may in way learn everything that pass here therefore must not be whispered outside room that have obtained news understand miss wo say word about downstairs hilda scribbled line in pencil to doctor saying that netta be back that have obtained news of favorable description that a knew at hour must not get away must come over with netta at once to tell what have learned must be in harley street within hour of getting message a soon a have finished breakfast drove to doctor be shown up into drawing room where dr leeds joined almost immediately be not going to detain more than two three minute hilda said while shook hand warmly with netta must come over evening then will hear whole story thought that be only fair that netta must have satisfaction of telling what have learned be very little so far a go be quite satisfactory dr leeds heard rather saw man suspected of being simcoe accomplice say 'by way ran down to tilbury yesterday ' simcoe then said something what must not tell a face be hidden from man in reply said 'oh yes be all right have almost ceased to talk about friend now must be content with until evening will be content with doctor said if will assure that be not going away again if will not will stop here hear whole story even at risk of riot down in waiting room be not going away doctor have not quite settled about when got back morning settled for will take care that doe not slip out of sight till after have seen talked over then matter be finally settled netta said for unless go in hour time can not go at then will be patient until evening will come to dinner doctor hilda said have sent note off to mr pettigrew colonel bulstrode to ask to come a have news of importance to give will do netta when find that come back hilda asked a drove away have puzzled good deal quite saw that if disappeared suddenly might take into head that something have happened to might go to police office say be missing must not be worst simcoe might guess when heard that have gone without notice left thing behind have be put there to watch certainly must not suspect that must have be overheard for must know that must be quite impossible for word to be heard through door still must be uneasy might even have child moved to other locality so have written note can talk over when get in of course may think have behaved very badly in throwing over like be better that must do than must think there be anything suspicious about wage be due to morrow like girl succeeded be to have eight pound year have left box open so that mistress can see for that there be none of lodger property in there be two three print dress put on sunday gown when came out underclothes be duly marked jane clotworthy what name to take netta yes know how came to choose be thinking what name must take when clotworthy flashed across mind think that ever heard name before how came to think of can not imagine seemed to sort of inspiration so settled on at once now let see letter hilda asked a soon a returned home hardly liked to write netta said be such wicked story see how person can act a detective without telling story at rate be perfectly harmless oh yes be quite certain netta that must not write tell that have be in house in disguise that having found out what wanted have now left her of course must make up story of sort a say simcoe must at once suspect that have be sent there to watch might feel perfectly sure that conversation must have be heard outside room must not be sure that might not have be hidden under table sofa behind curtain when so much depends upon thinking that be absolutely safe one must use what weapon one can if have scruple about will write letter for think scruple will trouble netta laughed of course have have to tell story one more le will not weigh on mind here be letter if can think of better reason for running away so suddenly by mean let have letter be written in sprawling hand with many of word misspelt began dear mr johnstone be afraid will think very badly of for leaving so sudding after mr johnstone have be so kind to who must meet at friend young man be ingaged to be married have quarrel be why came up to town so sudding have made up only come up yesterday be going down morning nothing must do must go down with that must get married directly say that a banns have be published there aint occasion to wait might be married at end of week a have got everything ready be in good employment so long short of be mam that be going down with home afternoon a to wage be due to morrow of course forfeit sorry be to give troubil by leaving without girl box be not locked plese look in will see that there aint nothing there be own in one corner will find crown wrapped up in paper plese take that to pay for carriage of box key be in lock send labil to tie on do think of hilda think will do capitally think better excuse must be made where will have box sent be what must settle together must not do to send down to little village for if address be unknown might be sent back again yes if john simcoe have suspicion that story be false one might go down there to make inquiry about jane clotworthy finding such name known there box still lying at station suspicion that have be watched must become almost certainty must think that reading must be good place to send to 'jane clotworthy luggage office reading ' then must go down ask for must bring up by next train tom robert must do netta there be reason why must trouble about think that have better go be most unlikely that simcoe must send down anyone to watch who took box away if must be very uneasy might do so must be sure to describe to anyone that sent so that must be better must go think that story be so plausible netta that there be risk whatever of having doubt about still one can not be too careful then will wind up letter 'begging pardon for having left in lurch so sudding remain obedient servant clotworthy 'ps be very sorry 'ps plese give respect to mr johnstone excuse blot hilda burst into fit of laughter a glanced at postscript will do admirably netta said now how have better send must think that maid have better take might tell to ring at bell hand to woman come away at once without talking except saying ' be told to give ' then must be well away before mr johnstone have mastered content of note have better be sent off at once for by time will be getting in way think have better send robert doubt johnstone will be in will answer door might ask lucy where came from want to tell anything robert must say that young woman of acquaintance down chelsea way asked to get on 'bus leave for can be trusted if man doe detain ask question to give sensible answer letter be sealed robert called up take cab go down with to jermyn street hilda said want left at house if man who open door asks who have brought from say from young woman friend of yours in place down chelsea way suppose that will ask other question have best say 'good morning ' saunter off carelessly a if having done errand have nothing else on hand of course wo drive up to door leave cab round corner come straight back here in right miss answered there be little look of amusement in man face a glanced at netta did not time pas unnoticed by mistress waited until door have closed behind then turned sharply on friend believe netta have have robert in confidence time while have be working into fever a to where must be have known along one can not work without accomplice netta laughed be necessary that someone must make arrangement with servant there for to take place who must trust better than robert think colonel bulstrode servant helped in matter at rate managed capitally between of course be robert who carried box out that morning must not be angry with hilda for keeping from made promise most faithfully that nothing must induce to confess sha be angry with netta may be sure that will give little lecture say will have more meddling on part except by express order be really annoying know to think that time be fretting about there be robert going about laughing in sleeve well know hilda have discovery of walter a much at heart a have have certainly not spared in search for that have not be faithful fellow promise wo be too hard on chapter xx dinner party be first time that anyone have dined at house in hyde park garden since general mathieson death seemed strange to hilda when mr pettigrew at request faced at table gentleman have arrived within minute two of other word have be said by hilda a to subject about have specially asked there table be well lighted bright with flower lawyer colonel bulstrode be somewhat surprised at cheerful tone in hilda began to talk a soon a sat down be however eight month since house be first shut up though have sincerely regretted general death be old story now be relieved to find that be evidently not hilda intention to recall past during dinner talk went on a usual be not until servant have left room that hilda said now mr pettigrew have doubt that colonel bulstrode be wondering what matter of importance about asked to come here can be be rather long story so instead of going upstairs will stop here news be great news have discovered at least friend miss purcell have discovered that without doubt walter be alive well exclamation of surprise broke from mr pettigrew colonel by gad be great news indeed latter exclaimed congratulate most heartily have quite given up hope although must have fought that fellow to last never have real doubt in mind that child fished out of canal be general mathieson grandson astonish indeed mr pettigrew said own that while be able to swear did not recognize yet a reasonable man felt that evidence be overpowering other way though must not dash hope by saying so appeared to certain that sooner later court must decide that provision of will must be carried out so discovered miss netta may ask how did netta wanted share in matter to remain secret mr pettigrew told be out of question that be quite necessary that colonel bulstrode must know precise fact for a lawyer must not take action decide upon course to be pursued unless knew exact circumstance of case however asked a have given whole particular to tell story for when have done will answer question may like to ask hilda then repeated almost word for word story netta have told mr pettigrew colonel several time broke in with exclamation of surprise a went on dr leeds sat grave thoughtful splendidly done colonel bulstrode exclaimed when brought story to end be magnificent idea must have needed end of pluck to carry out a did how by looking at fellow mouth through hole knew what said beat altogether that part be very simple colonel bulstrode netta said quietly learned by new system that have in germany be teacher in institution may not know perhaps that be stone deaf be not joking miss purcell be colonel said looking at earnestly why have talked to dozen time never struck that be in slightest degree deaf be absolutely so a miss covington will tell mr pettigrew know also fortunately did not lose hearing until be six year old have not altogether lost habit of speaking when went out to germany three year later have be born deaf dumb must have learned to understand what be said perfectly must never have spoken in natural voice well be wonderful altogether must not have believed if stranger have told however great thing at present be that have found out that child be alive ought not to be long in laying hand on now pettigrew eh hope not colonel must not be too sanguine about have evidently very crafty scoundrel to deal with still now that feel sure that child be alive well matter be comparatively straightforward one can afford to work wait patiently tilbury be only bit of village beyond stretch great marsh in fact south essex a far a mouth of river crouch blackwater coln must say went down to tilbury ' because tilbury be terminus of railway possibly may have crossed to gravesend possibly may have gone inland to upminster other village lying in district may have driven down a far a foulness so far a anybody know anything about might be end of world therefore there be wide area to be searched can be followed when go down again mr pettigrew of course dear be what must be done though there be reason why must not set about inquiry at once see be not so easy to follow man about country road a be in street of london doubt must drive ride unless indeed walter be within two three mile of station may be sure that if see trap coming after will not go near place where child be possibly again may not go near place at may meet someone who take money for child keep may be bargeman who sail round to harwich somewhere along south coast may be steward of steamer go regularly backwards forward to france want to dishearten dear broke off a saw how hilda face fell a went on see have not common rogue to deal with whole proceeding have shown exceptional amount of coolness determination although own can see nothing absolutely suspicious in way that last will be drawn up signed still have never be able to divest mind of idea that there be something radically wrong about putting aside strange death of uncle have cunning way in boy be stolen complete success with search be baffled daring attempt to prove death by what now know must have be substitution of body of other child of same age dressed in clothes show how carefully detail must have be thought out must assume that equal care will be shown to prevent recovering boy be to suspect that have be traced to tilbury be watched there that inquiry be being made in neighborhood may be sure that walter must be at once removed distance away possibly sent abroad perhaps to australia state there must be difficulty about there be hundred of emigrant going out week with family who must jump at offer of hundred pound for adopting child once away must be next to impossible ever to come upon trace so see will need to exercise most extreme caution in search see mr pettigrew hilda said quietly that difficulty be far greater than ever dreamt of seemed to that when have found out that walter be alive well that tilbury be so to speak starting place of search must be easy matter to find now see that except for knowledge that be alive be nearly a far off a ever think mr pettigrew be rather making worst of thing miss covington dr leeds said speaking for first time doubt difficulty be considerable think have good head on side too a miss purcell have proved feel confident now that have learned a much a have done will be successful in end opinion colonel bulstrode said be that ought to give two fellow in custody a rogue vagabond kidnaper then police will set to work to find out antecedent at least while be shut up can do harm gad sir must make short work of in india be afraid that must hardly do colonel bulstrode mr pettigrew said mildly have practically nothing to go upon have evidence that magistrate must entertain for moment men must be discharged at once must doubt be served next morning with writ for at least ten thousand pound damage what be more must get may be very sure that must never find child then be shameful that must be so colonel said warmly why served three year a police officer in india when got news that dacoit for instance be hiding in jungle near village down must go with couple of dozen of men surround place make man woman prisoner then police must examine let tell that have pretty rough way of finding out secret of course knew nothing about asked question may be sure that be not long before made someone open mouth hanging up man by thumb for instance freshens memory wonderfully may say that thorough way of getting at thing be not according to modern idea care fig for modern idea a far a go neither do native of india object be to find out author of certain crime villager object be to shield if be obstinate bring on criminal be caught justice be satisfied what be use of police if be not to catch criminal have patience with maudlin nonsense prevails in country that criminal must have chance of escape be warned not to say anything must incriminate material evidence be not admitted wife may be questioned why be downright sickening so called spirit of fairness be on side of criminal seems to that whole procedure instead of being directed to punish criminal be calculated to enable to escape from punishment whole thing be wrong sir radically wrong colonel bulstrode wiped heated forehead with huge indian silk handkerchief hilda laughed netta smiled mr pettigrew eye twinkled there be good deal in what say colonel bulstrode though can not go with in matter of hanging men up by thumb why sir broke in colonel what be own native prince must have stretched over charcoal fire until got truth out of so possibly must own forefather colonel humph have lot more common sense in day than have now mr pettigrew there be sentimentality about be short sharp in measure be men sir men drank like men fought like men there be sterling stuff in did weaken body by drinking slop mind by reading newspaper well colonel bulstrode hilda said smiling if be not contrary to conviction will go upstairs have cup of tea doubt there be something to be said for old day there be good deal to be said on other side of question too when went upstairs dr leeds sat down by netta be afraid that blame for what did dr leeds said timidly blame at for doing do think that ought to have consulted before undertaking intention be noble one risk that ran be so great that certainly must not have felt justified in allowing to undertake have have voice in matter can not see that be dangerous girl said must not have knocked down beaten even if have caught with eye at peep hole must only have called up johnstone denounced a eavesdropper at worst must only have be turned straight out of house think that must have be at course of action believe on contrary that although must have spoken angrily to must have said nothing to lodging house keeper must have at once guessed that have not taken trouble merely to gratify silly curiosity must have be sure that have be employed a spy what must have done know must certainly have have watched a watched must in conversation with confederate have dropped clew must have sent off on wild goose chase think that must have ventured on getting removed for must have known that must have be suspected of foul play at once by who have employed hope will give promise that will never undertake plan without consulting miss covington can hardly realize what anxiety have suffered while have be away will promise willingly dr leeds did not think anything of danger believe even now there be do think that hilda must not have heard of going a servant that must not have approved of still a saw harm in thought that for once must act upon own idea there be circumstance under one need disapprove of lady acting a servant said quietly if family misfortune have happened have to earn own living think that there be many who must be far happier in position of servant in good family than a ill paid over worked governess one be at least own mistress to large extent a long a doe work properly other can never call time own in case certainly kind object with undertook task be full justification of have not be matching against unscrupulous villain who have detected disguise must have practically hesitated at nothing to rid of happened too in case be one of few person who must have succeeded for a say must have be next to impossible for anyone unpossessed of peculiar faculty to have overheard conversation doubtless conducted in somewhat low voice through hole a made then think worse of for need not be afraid of that said quietly opinion be already so fixed on subject that doubt if anything must do must shake then got up walked across to where others be chatting together now be to have council hilda asked think not dr leeds said seems to that matter requires great deal of thinking over before decide fortunately a man went down to tilbury only two day ago be not likely to repeat visit for month at least possibly for three month men like give away chance must probably pay for three month board for child at time so a to avoid having to make journey oftener however confident might be that be not watched agree with dr leeds mr pettigrew said must never do to make false step still hilda urged surely there can not be need to wait for going down again sharp detective might find out good deal must inquire whether there be anyone at tilbury who let out trap probably nothing beyond gig pony cart must be obtained there must of course hire for drive to place within three four mile while be got ready must casually ask if be often let might possibly hear of someone who came down from town bagman perhaps who hired occasionally for calling upon customer in village round think that be capital suggestion mr pettigrew said see why while be thinking over best way to proceed must not get inquiry made might be of assistance to will send man down to morrow next day a say may give something to go upon netta went down two day later to reading have box labeled to oxford took third class ticket for herself have suspicion that man who be lolling on seat on platform looked closely at saw afterwards saunter away towards luggage office when train came in box be put into van got out at next station returned by first train to london feeling satisfied that must never hear anything more of box next day detective called who have be engaged earlier in search for walter have frequently seen hilda mr pettigrew said miss covington have better come to tell exactly what have done went down to tilbury yesterday took with one two case made up like traveler sample presently found that man at public house by water have pony trap let went over to said that wanted for day far be going ' asked ' be going to stanford ' said 'then by crossroad by laindon to hornchurch back ' 'it be rather long round for one day said `` ti long round ' said 'well maybe might sleep at hornchurch go on to upminster ' 'you will have to pay deposit of couple of pound said 'unless like to take boy ' said preferred driving that be le weight for pony suppose often let out ' remarked often said 'you see there be way of getting about beyond must pay to keep better trap if be that commercial generally work country in own vehicle take road from barking through dagenham else from brentwood chelmsford one of other great eastern station there be one in line come occasionally go by same route be taking always have trap to travel for spirit firm think always brings down couple of case of bottle 'that be line too said have be here lately hope ' yes be here three four day ago be pretty liberal chap with sample must say for always come back with case empty ' of course hired pony trap drove through new tilbury low street stanford put up there for three four hour at place went to public house a marked liquor cheap got several order asked at place have anyone in line be round lately said nobody have noticed pony cart of course did not prove that might not have driven through there did not make inquiry about missing child miss covington mr pettigrew particularly told that be not to make inquiry yes be what agreed upon bassett want to run slightest risk of suspecting that be inquiring in direction own idea be that must do harm if went round several time just a did yesterday perhaps must be better for not to start from same place to hire vehicle drive round country stopping at village apparently trying to get order for spirit tobacco that idea of yours be excellent one because inquiry whether man have be along in same trade must seem natural might say everywhere that have heard of going round there that did not look much like business driving rickety little trap with pony not worth fifty shilling at village public house at stopped must hardly help noticing if heard that have put up there for hour two must certainly be something to go upon search round there might lead to result however go until hear again from will talk over with mr pettigrew see what think of certainly seems to that might light upon clew way miss covington if be to happen to hear that man in same line have be there asking question about must seem natural enough because of course commercial must like to know what line in same branch be following how be doing then will wait further order there must be sure to be trap to be hired at barking rainham if there be not must get one at bromley indeed a must want for day two must be just a well to get there a farther east must be likely to get better looking turnout in little place man with good turnout be more likely to do business than one who look second rate altogether seems sort of credit to place must give order where must not to man who made sort of show must say miss that a will be going over ground more than once must be best to send on good get order for amount to very much must get about same price gave for know clerk in firm whose liquor took down told be going down in part of essex asked if must give commission on anything must sell said 'yes willingly enough clerk said be respectable man who must be trusted so will cost nothing will open way for making call of course when be known there can ask question more freely sit in bar parlor smoke cigar with landlord so on think be excellent idea well at rate will hear in course of day two miss purcell have gone on quietly with knitting uttered remark while man be present immediately have left said think netta that will gradually get at yes think so that man seems really sharp fellow have quite lost faith in detective see that when have really got something to go upon know how to follow up hilda wrote long letter to mr pettigrew received three word in answer by mean so bassett be written to told to continue career a commercial traveler to abstain altogether for present from question about boy ten day later mr pettigrew forwarded letter that have received from bassett be a follows sir have to report have for last fortnight be engaged in driving about country in accordance with miss covington instruction only place where can ascertain that pony cart from tilbury be noticed about time be at stanford inquiry there before have failed after dining at inn went out into yard behind asked helper whether same trap drove over in from tilbury have be there since 'not since be here last ' said least if be a drove pony over somewhere about three week ago did not see then be doing job over at cowhouse pony aint be here since then though be here two day before man put up for three four hour hired horse from landlord to ride over to billericay must have gone cross country must say by mud on leg however tipped bob so cleaned up said nothing to master horse be in lather must have be taken along at hunting pace way waiting further order remain yours respectfully h bassett mr pettigrew came down in evening well miss covington think that scent be getting warm now be time that must be very cautious think may take that child be somewhere within ten twelve mile of stanford north east of man be away for over three hour rode fast be not likely that horse be anything out of way however allowing for hour stay somewhere think may take twelve mile a limit still circle of twelve mile radius cover very large area have be looking up map since man set about inquiring down there twelve mile must include whole of marsh a far a leigh go up to brentwood billericay downham touch rayleigh in semicircle must be sixty seventy village large small have be looking at map too mr pettigrew doe not seem to at likely that must go near place that first mentioned be quite close to great eastern railway by must have traveled instead of going round enormous detour by tilbury stanford one must think so dear certainly see man having least idea that be watched admit have reason for believing that fellow have must naturally choose very circuitous route however think that need hardly try so far to north to begin with must say that area of search need go farther north than downham between line running west from place river child be most likely to be hidden must say mr pettigrew that detective might engage four five fellow who must act separately in village on of road running from stanford east village must be at least two mile away from stanford because might start by one road then turn off by in two mile must probably settle down on road be going to follow must therefore get general direction of walter hiding place then a soon a passed watcher must follow on foot till met coming back if did meet must know at rate have be farther if did not meet must know that have turned off somewhere between village that have passed netta have be talking matter over seems to that must be best plan that must be a well also to have man to watch at tilbury station because may possibly choose entirely different route next time come men in village not knowing that have come down at might be kept there for month waiting for next visit friend have certainly put head together to good purpose old lawyer said see better plan than suggest have better have bassett down here give instruction yes mr pettigrew will be glad if will write line to to night for in three day will be month since man last went down at rate since know that went down of course may be three month before go again if doe not come in four five day men must be recalled for although of must stop in village for day two under pretense of finding work in neighborhood certainly must not stop for month very well leave free hand in matter altogether miss covington for frankly acknowledge that be vastly more likely to ferret thing out than be chapter xxi box at opera tell what be simcoe harrison said two month later affair of yours be getting to be good deal more troublesome than bargained for looked simple enough one only have to pick up child drive in cab across london then down in trap to pitsea hand over to man knew must take good care of take payment for when became due must be no trouble a have to see man occasionally on own business of course expected that there must be big hue cry for have fear whatever of being found then managed through man to get that body from workhouse undertaker managed rest easily enough tell that matter be getting good deal hotter than ever thought must told have be followed several time after leaving place one morning when went out early saw footmark showing that someone have be walking round house trying to look in at window have strong suspicion have be followed to office know that someone got in there one day at dinner hour know because always fasten piece of thread so that if door be opened break there be nothing there that anyone must make anything of be just a well to know if anyone have be prying about woman of house be sure that have not be in there have let anyone in so lock must have be picked of course anyone be liable to have office robbed when be out be empty nothing be taken if common thief have found nothing else must probably have made off with dress suit must have brought sov in second hand clothes shop know have excessive objection to being watched have have nothing on hand lately at rate nothing have come off might have have know well yesterday be going down to see man in marsh to tell likely enough must bring something down to next week got out of train at tilbury a know there be not dozen house anywhere near station now have habit of keeping eye open saw man sitting on old boat what called attention particularly to be that be turned half round watching entrance to station a came out can always tell whether man be watching for someone whether be merely looking generally in direction man be certainly watching for someone instant eye fell upon turned round stared at river path to public house lay just behind now must be natural that hearing footstep man doing nothing must look round perhaps say word ask time something of sort well did turn round now be habit very useful one always to carry glass of about size of folded letter in pocket instead of going on to public house turned off from path walked away from river when have got little distance took out glass still walking along held up so that must see in be going on behind man be standing up watching put glass in pocket dropped handkerchief stooped down to pick up of course partly turning a did so saw that have instantly dropped into sitting position again with back to that be good enough turned cut across field went straight back to station took next ferry boat to gravesend came back that way be quite clear to that not only be girl on track still chase be getting to be very hot one that not only be watching be watching have in way other though how can not guess found out that go down to tilbury have accordingly sent man down to follow now tell frankly will have more to do with matter be to say a far a going down on business a have told have always managed own affair so well that police have acquaintance whatever be not going to be spied upon followed have 'tecs upon track about affair in have interest at except that having stood by brother be glad to do service must be getting serious like have told have business with man get thing off abroad through must have great trouble in getting rid of in other way unless in quite exceptional case thing be so small that must be hidden away for month without much risk of being found however sharp hunt after might be a be in way pressed for money can afford to wait though own like to get thing off hand a soon a can a considered that ran practically risk in going down with into essex never kept at house however for time must do so must tell that when be going down always write beforehand make appointment for to have barge at wharf at pitsea send letter addressed to ber william nibson barge mary ann care of mr scholey spotted horse pitsea have better write to in future need not put anything inside envelope except note for twenty five pound word 'for child keep for six month need not say that have better disguise writing on envelope on inside be best that must get note from bookmaker on race course tell often go to race now do little betting be not sort of men who take number of note pay out must be next to impossible for to be traced to thank harrison have behaved like true pal to be ever so much obliged to quite see what mean indeed be a much for interest a yours that must not go down there more confound that girl covington be sure be moving spirit of always felt uneasy about from first be sure that if there be trouble must come from wonder how deuce ever found out that went down to tilbury beat too simcoe a may guess be always most cautious about always take very roundabout way of going to station have be uneasy ever since girl at place left so suddenly fortnight afterwards found that there be hole bored through doorpost of course might have be bored before went there in case be curious that be never noticed before can not help thinking that did yes told said that tried experiment found that when man wife be talking there in loud voice have ear at hole must not catch single word yes be certainly so must hear talking must not make out word of conversation still be evident that somebody have be trying to hear can not help thinking that be that girl though johnstone wife spoke very highly of certainly story told be true to certain extent for when sent box down to reading sent man down there to watch called to fetch man found out that labeled 'oxford took away with on down train a have direction to follow farther came back after found hole sent down again never came upon trace though inquired at village near oxford may have be put there a spy other said a be evident that must hear through hole be clear that must not have done good be suppose why called off so puzzle still remains how got on track at tilbury must like to have good look at covington girl can admire clever wench even when be working against there be 'the huguenot at majesty to night first time season very often go in lady moulton box be likely enough that will go to night be third box from stage on first tier will go down to bond street see if can get hold of box opposite on second third tier money will be well laid out for must very much like to study face won enough at pool at club afternoon to pay for very well then will come round to place really be curious to see girl only caught passing glimpse of in park day simcoe be not wrong in conjecture for hilda dined at lady moulton took place in latter box just a first bar of overture sounded be in half mourning now in black lace with white camellia in hair breast be a netta have told before starting looking best be girl simcoe exclaimed a went forward to front of box well there be denying that be good looking other said a turned glass upon there be not better looking woman in house plenty of self possession too added a hilda took seat at once in apparent ignorance that glass be upon took own lorgnette from case proceeded calmly to scan stall box to see who among numerous acquaintance be there a eye fell upon two men sitting nearly opposite to glass steadied then after minute lowered lady moulton regard a providence that brought here evening do see two men there in box nearly opposite in second tier well one of men be simcoe to whom uncle left property if walter must not live to come of age who be absolutely convinced carried child away see dear be staring at suppose be a much interested in a in hilda again put glass to eye have just told lady moulton who be simcoe said have clever face simcoe broad across chin amount of determination must say ah there be getting up to make room for somebody else stay where be dear lady moulton said putting hand on hilda arm there be plenty of room for three plenty replied want to watch two men can not keep glass fixed on while be sitting in front row hardly dear lady moulton said with smile well have own way fourth lady came in almost immediately took third chair in front hilda sitting half in shade be able to devote to purpose free from general observation have already heard that simcoe companion have apparently suspected that be watched have returned to town at once without speaking to anyone at tilbury felt that must probably henceforth choose other route chance of following must be greatly diminished opportunity be fortunate one indeed for month have be hoping that day other must watch men talking now a seemed by accident just at moment when hope have fallen chance have come to have changed place in order to have better look at john simcoe said a moved have got glass on came to stare at seems to that be staring at harrison said well must think that know face pretty well by time simcoe laughed told have way of looking through one have often made uncomfortable can quite understand noticed that when looked at without glass there be curious intentness in expression a if be taking stock of point about can not be girl who have be to lodging certainly not other said know great deal too well for to try on besides beyond fact that other be good looking girl too by way that have same trick of looking full in face when spoke there be resemblance between curtain now drew up silence fell upon house men did not speak again until end of first act then continued conversation where have left off have moved have be attending to opera simcoe said have gone into shade again be taking look at be not given to nervousness upon word glass fixed upon make quite fidgety pooh man be not looking at be looking at know whether think that can read thought find out where child be hidden by way know nothing about place pitsea where be be best way to get there can drive straight down by road through upminster laindon place lie about three mile side of benfleet there be only about dozen house at end of creek come up from hole haven must not think of going near house latter directed a told be sure to find man oh be not thinking of going will get man to watch fellow sent down to watch if find that seem to be getting on right track will run down at hazard take away best plan by far will be to go with on board nibson barge up to rochester doubt can find bargeman there who will take boy in what must perhaps be better hire trap there drive down to margate ramsgate there be plenty of school there might get up yarn about being nephew of yours leave there for term two must give time to decide by time will have very faint remembrance of life in town anything that may say about will certainly meet with attention must be a well to do at once do think simcoe asked have idea how many people may have on watch must be only running unnecessary risk stick to plan that have already agreed on of communicating only by writing think idea of sending two three sharp fellow down there to find out what party be doing be really good one hilda lowered glass a curtain rose again oh lady moulton whispered have found out have be so long wanting to know believe now that in three day will have child home again lady moulton turned half round how on earth have found that out hilda be wizard indeed who can read men thought in face always thought that there be something uncanny about ever since day of fete to harrison relief miss covington did not turn glass towards again during evening when curtain fell on next act gentleman to whom lady moulton have nodded in stall came in after shaking hand with friend seated by side of hilda miss covington said have never have opportunity of speaking to since fete at lady moulton have understood that gypsy on occasion be engaged by that there be if will excuse saying so little mystery about wish to pry into if must ever see woman again will oblige very greatly by telling that consider owe deep debt of gratitude said something to then that made tremendous impression upon mind telling brought up with round turn have be going ahead great deal too fast see now have continued on same course must have brought absolute ruin upon blighted life in way shock gave by warning what must come if did not give up card racing showed utter folly on day swore never to touch card lay penny upon horse for rest of life when tell have completely pulled round that by aid of old uncle to whom went made clean breast of be now straight in way a may have heard be going to be married to miss fortescue in fortnight may guess what deep reason have to be grateful to gypsy woman of yours how hope must come across again will tell so must there be possible way in can prove gratitude by money otherwise will be delighted to do so will tell captain desmond girl said in low voice be sure that will make happy to know that did good that evening think that be in need of money assistance of kind must be so will let know do really mean that have discovered where general mathieson grandson be living lady moulton asked a rose to leave seat when curtain fell think so be almost sure of lady moulton have heard good deal from hilda a to situation mr pettigrew have strongly impressed upon hilda colonel bulstrode that be very important that content of will must not be talked about want private affair discussed in press made subject of general talk have said be only to lady moulton that hilda have spoken freely of matter so far a discovery of new will change have be made singularity of walter being missing have also mentioned belief that simcoe be at bottom of have breathed word of suspicion that general have come to death by foul play of own conviction that simcoe be impostor although there have be talk in club over matter for colonel bulstrode be by mean so discreet a hilda among intimate friend spoke mind with great vehemence strength of language a to general mathieson having made so singular disposition of property made secret of suspicion that simcoe be at bottom of walter disappearance thus matter have gradually gone round of club be not until simcoe own counsel have drawn from fact that walter death must put into possession of estate that public in general learned fact be clever move mr pettigrew have said talking over with partner doubt be afraid that question must be asked by counsel thought that be better that fact must come voluntarily from best plan by far be to brazen out doubt nine men out of ten will consider that affair be very suspicious one of will give cold shoulder opinion dare not express without laying open to action for libel while on other hand fact that man be heir to good estate will always cause good many to rally round not best of men know enough to prevent being lonely figure in club yes think be certainly well advised to declare heirship voluntarily instead of having drawn from must have known of course sooner later matter must be made public be better for to get talk gossip over now instead of matter being known for first time when begin to take legal step to compel to put into possession of estate what on earth did mean hilda lady moulton said a door of carriage be closed drove off from majesty by saying that have discovered clew by might in few day find little cousin can not tell exactly how discovered at present be secret that mother uncle charged to keep when trouble be over will explain to though must certainly do so to one else well suppose must be content with hilda certainly doe seem extraordinary to that by merely seeing two men in box on other side of house must have obtained clew to what have for year now be trying to get at doe seem extraordinary lady moulton really be not so hope to convince that be right by producing walter in week from present time hope will hilda sincerely hope so for child sake yours own of course when be found there will be possible reason for keeping shut up a have done have missed very much will be very glad to have under wing again thank for saying so lady moulton so far a have formed plan be that walter trustee will let sell house in hyde park garden that will go down for time with into country have have great deal of anxiety last year will be very glad of complete rest for time be reasonable enough dear do hope that be not thinking of burying in country for good there be at home good night hilda thanks for lift be not often horse coachman have night off during season chapter xxii nearing goal suppose miss netta be in bed hilda asked a entered house yes miss miss purcell went to room soon after ten o'clock hilda ran upstairs to netta room be awake netta asked a opened door well think be asleep hilda did intend to go off for made sure that must come in for chat a usual when got back think must have dozed off well if have be so sound asleep have have to violently wake up must have done so have have chance netta simcoe friend be in box opposite to ours have learned where walter be be news indeed netta exclaimed leaping up be worth being awakened hundred time for please hand dressing gown now let sit down talk over comfortably hilda then repeated whole conversation that have overheard splendid netta exclaimed clapping hand man be right dear in feeling uncomfortable when glass be fixed on face though little guessed what reason have for feeling well be worth four year spent with to have learned to read people word from lip always said that be best pupil have proved so now what be to be done next will need general council for hilda laughed must hing rash now that success seems so close false move might spoil everything yes will have to be very careful bargeman may not live near there at though doubt go there pretty often a letter be sent there for besides simcoe may have someone stationed there to find out whether inquiry have be made for missing child yes see that will have to be very careful netta must not spoil chance by being over hasty talked for upwards of hour then went to bed next morning robert took note to dr leeds contained only few line from hilda dear dr leeds have found most important clew be going to have consultation at of course want to be present must manage to be at mr pettigrew office at three o'clock if so on hearing from will send to to make appointment answer came back congratulate heartily will meet at three o'clock at pettigrew office note be at once sent off to lawyer to make appointment girl arrived with miss purcell two three minute before hour be at once shown into mr pettigrew room where mr farmer immediately joined will wait minute two before begin hilda said have asked dr leeds to join here have be so very kind throughout whole matter that thought be only fair that must be here certainly thoroughly agree with never thought that terrible suspicion of well founded certainly took immense pain in collecting information of sort about native poison since then have shown greatest desire to assist in way minute later dr leeds be shown in now miss covington mr farmer said be ready to hear communication hilda then related what have learned at opera really miss covington mr farmer continued be thousand pity that friend can not utilize singular accomplishment in detective line ought to make fortune by have of course heard from partner of education that have in germany of having acquired new system by can understand what people be saying by watching lip certainly have conception that must be carried to extent a have just proved can be like gaining new sense now suppose have come to for advice a to what have best be done next be mr farmer be quite evident to that must be extremely careful for if people suspect that be so far on track might remove walter at once might never be able to light upon clew again yes see that of course if be absolutely in position to prove that child have be kept down near pitsea with cognizance must arrest at once unfortunately in word heard there be mention of child at present have nothing series of small circumstantial fact to adduce believe mr pettigrew tell that man who call john simcoe be impostor who have right to name that general mathieson be under complete delusion when made that extraordinary will believe that at rate have suspicion that having got general to make will administered unknown drug finally caused death believe that a child alone stood between inheritance have carried off with assistance of other man believe that body coroner jury decided to be that of walter rivington be not that child be being kept out of way somewhere in essex believe that conversation that most singularly overheard related to unfortunately belief be unsupported by single legal fact doubt very much whether magistrate must issue warrant for men arrest upon story being laid before even if be arrested confederate might hasten down to pitsea carry child off indeed pitsea may only be meeting place of conspirator child may be at limehouse at chatham at other place frequented by barge therefore must for present give up idea of seizing men research at pitsea be clearly attended by danger yet see other way of proceeding seems dr leeds said that other man who appears to have acted a simcoe agent throughout affair took alarm other day instead of taking trap a usual from tilbury returned to station took ferry across to gravesend then a suppose came up to town again told simcoe that found be watched that simcoe must take matter up evidently by what miss covington overheard have instructed where how to communicate with bargeman in case of necessity to find must think that first step must be to withdraw men now on watch for be possible that may also send down men to place in locality of pitsea in point of fact men have be instructed to make such inquiry only to endeavor to trace where simcoe agent drive to still think must be a well to withdraw at once a can do further good mr pettigrew nodded know nothing of pitsea doctor went on do know hole haven when be walking hospital three four of have little sailing boat used to go out from saturday until monday morning hole haven be generally limit of excursion be snug little harbor for small boat there be comfortable old fashioned little inn there where used to sleep coastguard be sociable fellow ready to chat with stranger not averse to small tip of course same men will not be there now must be very safe to ask question of for doubt be on friendly term with men on barge go up down creek might however learn something from of way of men must think that on giving card to petty officer in charge must safely question suppose that must know where man nibson have headquarters if life at rochester chatham at limehouse shadwell certainly must not know if life at pitsea might know fancy keep pretty sharp lookout on barge know that coastguard told that there be still good deal of smuggling carried on in marsh between leigh thames haven fancy from what said that leigh fisherman think harm to run few pound of tobacco keg of spirit from passing ship indeed a there be so many vessel go ashore on sand below a be generally engaged in unloading helping to get off have considerable facility way at rate a old frequenter of place a knowing landlord be to say if there have be change there suspicion must fall upon of going down there in reference to affair to day be friday on sunday morning early will run down to gravesend hire boat there will sail down to hole haven will be outing for pleasant one at least can be doing harm thank very much indeed dr leeds hilda said warmly be splendid idea on sunday evening dr leeds called at hyde park garden to report day work think that news be eminently satisfactory saw petty officer in command of coastguard station willingly gave information in power knew bargee bill nibson be up down creek say once sometimes twice week have got little bit of farm house on bank of creek mile half on side of pitsea watch pretty closely a do men who use creek there be not one of who doe not carry on bit of smuggling if get chance thought that be almost given up ' said 'oh be carried on ' replied 'on much smaller scale than used to be there be plenty of must say that there be more done way on thames than anywhere else in first place dutch german french craft coming up channel after dark can have difficulty whatever in transferring tobacco spirit into barge fishing boat need hardly say be not ship of size carry on sort of business small vessel such a billy boy craft of sort carry regular cargo probably never bring more than few hundredweight of tobacco dozen so keg of spirit be doubtful whether owner know anything of what be being done must say that be generally sort of speculation on part of skipper men on side trade be doubt in hand of men who work single barge fishing boat of own who certainly work without least suspicion on part of owner thing be so easily arranged man before start from ostend hamburg mouth of seine sends line to friend here at rochester limehouse leigh will sail to night expect to come up south channel on monday evening bargeman fisherman run down at time arranged five six mile below nore brings up show light know that craft expects will not be up before time for if wind be extremely favorable made run quicker than expected must bring up in margate road till time appointed if did arrive night must do so next barge must lay there wait for fisherman must go into sheerness leigh come out again next night might wonder how barge must waste twenty four forty eight hour without being called to account by owner there be barge will anchor up for two three day under pretense that weather be bad really from sheer laziness 'that be one way stuff come into country so far a can see there be way whatever of stopping difficulty of course be with landing even be not great when tide turn to run out there be score may say hundred of barge anchored between chatham gravesend generally anchor close in shore must require twenty time number of coastguard there be between chatham gravesend on one side foulness tilbury on other to watch whole of to see that boat come ashore ' few stroke be there one man will wait in boat while other go up onto bank to see that be clear if be thing be carried up at once probably barge have put up flag be understood by friend ashore be there to meet in hour keg be stowed away in lonely farmhouse sunk in of deep ditch there will remain until can be fished up sent off in cart loaded with hay something of sort may take among marsh on bank of medway thames there be pretty good deal done in way of smuggling still keep very close eye upon barge come up here be very seldom that make catch one can not seize barge like mary ann be boat belonging to nibson with perhaps sixty ton of manure cement brick unload without specific information must justify doing so indeed hardly must unload unless took out into thames threw content overboard must not carry up steep stone faced bank higher up there be very few place where barge must lie alongside bank to be unloaded suspect nibson of doing something way have never be able to catch at have searched place suddenly three four time never found anything suspicious ask what family man have ' said shook head 'there be wife have seen once twice on board barge a have come in out there be boy who help on barge know whether be son not have idea whether have family have never seen child on barge seemed to be fairly satisfactory told that suspected that stolen child be kept in nibson house asked whether one of men off duty must at time go with in boat point out house said that there must be difficulty about idea miss covington be that must be by far best plan for to go down with pretty strong party be to say two three men to go from gravesend in boat arriving at hole haven at eleven twelve o'clock at night must write beforehand to coastguard officer asking to have man in readiness to guide then row up to house in way must avoid chance of warning being sent on ahead from pitsea from other place where might have men on watch mentioned to officer said 'well see how must break into man house if child be not there might find in very awkward position if nibson happened to be at home must be perfectly justified in using firearm said of course be point must consider be indeed point on must take mr pettigrew opinion probably will have to lay information before nearest magistrate though think that if be to take officer into confidence seemed to bluff hearty fellow must take lot of interest in matter might stretch point send three four men down after dark to search place again for smuggled good see have strong suspicion of man have searched place more than once then when be about must enter seize walter must there be mistake altogether child not be found there must give officer written undertaking to hold free in very unlikely event of fellow making fuss about house being entered next morning hilda again drove up with netta to see mr pettigrew must be careful dear must be very careful said if obtain search warrant can only be executed during day even if coastguard be to make raid upon place a civilian must not have right to enter house like idea of night business indeed see why must not be managed by day apparently from what dr leeds said hole haven be place where little sailing boat often go in know much of matter probably in case gentleman be accompanied by lady doubt sometimes boat go up creek now there must be good sized boat must be hired at gravesend with men accustomed to sailing can see reason why must not go down in party must certainly wish to be there think colonel bulstrode must be there might bring two men get information laid before essex magistrate obtain warrant to search man place for child supposed to be hidden there by way have client who be essex magistrate life near billericay will have information drawn out will go with see be only about five mile to drive from brentwood station if sent clerk down there might be difficulty whereas when personally explain circumstance to will be sure grant at same time will arrange with two of county constabulary will be at place hole haven at time arrive there will accompany to execute warrant let see turned to engagement book there be very special matter on for to morrow be sure that mr farmer will see to little matter that there be in department by way be year yesterday since general death have morning be served with notice to show cause why must not proceed at once to distribute various legacy under will think that refers to bequest of estate though of course may do so to ten thousand pound to simcoe be clearly entitled of course must appear by counsel in case with walter in hand can bring to knee at once will have to wait time before touch money can not prevent having that may get five year for abducting child doe not affect claim to money unless mr pettigrew must prove that be not john simcoe certainly dear lawyer said with indulgent smile other theory have turned out very successful be bound to admit for have not shadow of evidence while must produce dozen respectable witness in favor however need not trouble ourselves about now a to abduction of child while evidence be pretty clear against other man have only fact against simcoe that be constant associate of have immense interest in child being lost other man seems to have acted a intermediary through so far a actually know simcoe have never seen child since be taken away of course if walter can prove to contrary case be clear against without be only circumstantial though fancy that jury must be pretty sure to convict now how about boat who will undertake that be rather busy at present must scarcely spare clerk to go down will look after mr pettigrew be only hour run to gravesend will be amusement for will take robert down with what day will fix for well dear sooner better will get warrant to morrow there be reason why constable must not be at hole haven next day at say two in afternoon so if go down to morrow arrange for boat matter may a well be carried out at once especially a know that be burning with anxiety to get child back of course rascal of bargeman must be arrested must think must depend partly on how have treated walter hilda said suppose know who be anything of circumstance of case be simply paid so much to take charge of if have behaved cruelly to be of course right that must be punished if have be kind to see why must not be let off besides may want a witness against others well there be something in of course might if be arrested allow to turn queen evidence there be always certain feeling against class of witness however need discus now suppose that ought to allow hour half two hour to get to place from gravesend can find out when hire boat of course will depend good deal on way tide be by way have better look to at once for if be not somewhere near high tide when get to hole haven there may not be water enough to row up creek called in one of clerk told to go out to get almanac with tide table want to know when will be high water

craft that met lay at anchor in stream recalling reminiscence of trip on indian river be only one of hearer who apparently took interest in talk to scene be so new that regarded everything with attention pleasure looked with wonder at great ship be dragged along by tiny tug wondered at rate at clumsy looking barge made way through water enjoyed rapid easy motion with own boat glided along mr pettigrew be revolving in mind problem of what must next be done while hilda thought be centered upon walter joy that must be to have with again be hole haven boatman in stern said a wide sheet of water opened on left why turn in then colonel bulstrode asked there be scarce water enough for sir be neap tide at present in hour sand will begin to show over there have to go in onto farther side be

two constable be glad that have be able to do so presence will strengthen hand coast guard boat with four sailor in be lying close to step officer came down with mr bostock followed by two constable magistrate greeted mr pettigrew took place in boat beside after being introduced to two lady colonel officer with two constable stepped into coastguard boat rowed on ahead of other must not resist temptation of coming over to see end of singular affair of heard from mr pettigrew mr bostock said to hilda officer of coastguard be going on partly to show way to house partly because will be good opportunity for to search place thoroughly for smuggled good tell that barge be up creek now went up yesterday evening so may find fellow at home now men colonel bulstrode said to boatman have got to follow boat will have plenty of time for beer when get there good lunch besides so pull hardest have not got very far to go can either of men row illustration be magistrate of county of essex page can

officer pointed to now row hardest men colonel bulstrode said have hundred yard further to go two boat rowed up to bank together mr bostock sprang out a did constable sailor ran up bank others following at once a appeared on bank boy working in garden gave shrill whistle man immediately appeared at door looked surprised at appearance of party stepped back foot then a if changing mind came out closed door after be magistrate of county of essex mr bostock said have come to see warrant executed for search of house for child named walter rivington who be believed to be concealed here who have be stolen from care of guardian know nothing of child of name man replied have child here that be taking care of for gentleman in london have have here for just year one have made inquiry about be welcome to enter see if be one be in search of if be that can say be know nothing about being stolen will be very sorry to lose stood aside two constable entered followed closely by hilda latter gave cry of joy for seated on ground playing with box of soldier be walter must hardly have known anywhere else curl have be cut short face be brown tanned clothes although scrupulously clean be such a must be worn by bargeman boy at age child looked up a entered hilda ran to caught up in arm know walter remember cousin hilda yes remember child said now returning embrace used to tell story take out in carriage for drive where have be so long where be grandpapa oh here be netta a hilda put down ran to for during four month spent in country have be chief playmate have learned to swim netta uncle bill have taught be going to take out in barge day woman who have come in with arm covered with lather from little washhouse adjoining house now came forward hope miss that there be nothing wrong said to hilda have done best for little boy have come to care for just a if have be own if be going to take away will miss dreadful for be dear little fellow burst into tear struggled from netta arm ran to woman pulling by apron said cry aunt betsy jack be not going away from jack will stay here like going in barge better than riding in carriage well miss covington mr bostock said recognition appears to be complete on side now what be next step do give man into custody for unlawfully concealing child aiding abetting in abduction will wait minute while speak to mr pettigrew said went out of house together well what do think pettigrew have be thinking over way a came down lawyer said of course have shadow of proof that man be aware who child be in fact if have seen placard offering altogether fifteen hundred pound for recovery must certainly assume that must have given up for however well may have be paid for taking charge of offer must have be too tempting for man of kind to have resisted doubt have strong suspicion can hardly say that amounted to guilty knowledge that child have be abducted if walter have be ill treated must have said at once 'give into custody ' doe not seem to have be case have evidently be very kind to be so grateful for must be sorry to do man harm be not only point lawyer went on be evident that other people very seldom come down here from what heard in future simcoe be going to write if arrest man others will know at once that game be up now if will take child away quietly can tell man that will not be prosecuted providing that take step to inform employer that child be gone even if one of came down here to see child wife must say that be away on barge anyhow will have ample time to decide upon what step to take against simcoe can lay hand upon whenever choose whereas if got inkling that have discovered child associate must probably disappear at once might have lot of trouble to find yes think must be very good plan mr pettigrew will ask wife to come out will be best way dear must hardly discus matter before bostock hilda went in a soon a spoke to man wife mr bostock said if want conference miss covington will go out leave to talk matter over two constable withdrew mr pettigrew came in now man began must see that have placed in very awkward position be found taking care of child have be stolen for whose recovery large reward have be offered over country be like case of man found hiding stolen good must be called upon to account for being in possession now be hardly possible that can have be ignorant that child be stolen may not have be told so in word can not have helped having suspicion from what child doubt said when first came here must have be sure that have be brought up in luxury doubt spoke of ride in carriage of servant nurse so on however miss covington be one of child guardian be other be most reluctant to give in charge be evident from behavior of child from affection that show to yourself wife that have treated very kindly since have be here toy see about show that have done best to make happy that have sir man said betsy took to from first have child of own none living at least have made a much of a if have be one of own perhaps more have often talked over thought that be not doing fair thing by be perhaps keeping out of own did not like having anything to do with at first have have business with man who gave to when asked to undertake job did not seem to so serious affair a have done since be heartily sorry that have have hand in not only because have done child harm because seems that be going to lose now that have come to care for a if be own of course played only minor part in business nibson quite understand that be men who have carried out abduction that want to catch do know name of man who brought child to sir know where to find have more idea than child unborn who be where life when writes to generally doe before come down may be two three time month may be once in six month sign smith suppose be right name say fairly that if knew where lived must not peach upon have always be straight with in business have done with must rather take six month for affair than say anything against be not asking at present to say anything against be not principal man in business believe be only acting a agent for more dangerous rascal than be not prepared at present moment to arrest chief scoundrel before do that must obtain evidence will render conviction certainty have reason to believe that man that know will not come down for time that will receive money for child keep by post if abstain altogether from prosecuting in matter must give word that will not take step to let know that child be longer with say that promised to take out in barge well if by chance man not man other come down here want to see child wife will lead to believe that be on board barge will also be necessary that if do arrest must enter a witness to prove that man handed child over to must let be seen that be unwilling witness evidence of handing over of child will be absolute necessity right sir will undertake that there be fear of letting know that child have gone for know where to write if other must come down if be here will have difficulty in keeping from that child have gone for man have never set foot in house just meet on road near pitsea say what have to say give what have to give then drive off again of course if be summoned a witness know that law can make go remember now that when gave child said be doing to oblige friend of may be able to prove that have nothing to do with carrying off be a may be lawyer said dryly however be quite content with promise thank most heartily wife hilda covington said warmly for kindness to child must have made very happy time if must have known that be in such good hand pictured shut up in vile den in london ill treated half starved have grown very much since have be with look great deal more boyish than did yes play good deal with barge boy who have taken to just a have well kindness will not be forgotten unrewarded mr nibson be sure want reward miss have be well paid even if have be paid at after first month must have gone on keeping just same now walter hilda said want to come home with have be wanting very badly nurse tom robert have be in terrible way so have dr leeds remember be very kind to time that be down in country child nodded must like to see tom robert nurse want to go away be going out in barge soon well dear dare say that will be able to arrange for to come down sometimes to go out in especially a have learned to swim be going away now in boat often go out in boat walter pouted go with joshua be nice boy joshua be like well dear will see what can do for joshua be sure that will come back go out in barge quite sure dear perhaps will go out with too yes must go like good boy mr nibson said know dear that will always love will be very very glad if lady can spare to come down to see sometimes wo forget will aunt betsy will never forget promise that child said want to go away from at only cousin hilda say must mr pettigrew went out to tell mr bostock that must not give nibson into custody principal scoundrel must take alarm instantly said above thing want to keep in dark until be ready to arrest will be much better that must have man to call a witness than that must appear in dock a accomplice think that be right there magistrate agreed really wife seem to have be very kind to child have be talking to young barge boy seems be relation of people mother be tramp who died one winter night on road to pitsea be about ten eleven year old then must have sent to workhouse nibson who be on coroner jury volunteered to take dare say find very useful on board barge at rate have be well treated say that nibson be best master on river so fellow must have good in though from what coastguard officer said there be very strong suspicion that be mixed up in smuggling business seems be still carried on in marsh well doubt have decided wisely now suppose will be off at moment be joined by coastguard officer have done again said have be investigating outhouse thoroughly there be question that have have smuggled good here found clever hiding place in cattle shed struck that be curious thing that there must be stack of hay built up right against side of so took down plank two be not surprised to find that there be hollow in stack one of men stamped foot sound showed that there be hollow underneath dug up ground found six inch below trapdoor on lifting discovered hole five six foot deep six foot square be lined with brick roughly cemented together be lucky for that place be empty must think that after will go out of business for time of course can not arrest man merely for having hidden cellar fancy that there be not many house on marsh have not place of sort indeed be rather glad that did not catch for in other respect nibson be decent hard working fellow sometimes have glass two at 'lobster smack ' never take too much be always very quiet decent in talk doubt whether men must have found that hiding place if have not be there know well must not get into scrape if must help though there be fellow on marsh must give month pay to catch with keg tobacco door of house opened three woman nibson came out with walter who be now dressed in clothes that have brought down for while others be getting ready to enter boat officer took nibson aside have have close squeak of nibson found hiding place under stack be lucky for that be empty so have nothing to say to must advise to give up man sooner later be bound to be caught man brow have darkened a officer began cleared up again all right said have be thinking for last half hour that will drop business altogether when man once get into be not so easy to get out now that have found that cellar be good excuse to cut can well say dare not risk again for after so nearly catching must be sure to keep extra sharp eye on in future give word for nibson yes sir swear off altogether from present day good will take word for can go in come out a like without being watched need not fear that will pay visit walter went off in fair spirit promise that must come down again see friend have sail in barge lessened pang of leaving a hilda netta face came more strongly back to a talked to recalled pleasant thing have almost faded from memory went away contentedly while betsy nibson went back to house have what called good cry too however cheered up when husband told how narrow escape have have how have given word that must drop smuggling altogether that make mind easier than have be for year bill will give up other thing too there may not be much harm in running keg bacca there be doubt about being wrong to have anything to do with stolen good to mix up with men who steal yes will give up too betsy a soon a have time to look round will give order for new barge to be built for have be ashamed of old thing for long time past with patched sail of course suited purpose for when other barge kept on course gave good excuse for anchoring aint pleasant to have barge passing there be old joe hargett said other day that if ever thought of getting new barge must give hundred for have got set of decent sail be pretty handy carpenter doubt will make look decent again hundred pound aint much will help can get new one complete sail for fourteen fifteen hundred have hundred two left in bag afterwards tell what betsy will get extra comfortable cabin made place forward for joshua will be dull for here now child be gone must be sight more comfortable for to be always together that will bill said joyfully be always very happy on board till lost billy took dislike to then be glad enough to come here have got over now place be very lonely during long winter night when be away then talked over barge how cabin must be fitted up in spite of having lost walter evening be pleasant one to be not only conversation took place day with reference to new barge for bill a rowed up against tide hilda said must do something for bargeman colonel bulstrode be sure can not be too grateful to wife for treatment of walter think how different might have be have fallen into bad hand now look picture of health change in life open air have done wonder know dr leeds said that officer of coastguard have told that nibson barge be one of oldest rottenest craft on river now propose that buy new one must cost colonel bulstrode have not slightest idea colonel replied might cost five hundred pound might cost five thousand for know will ask waterman hilda said raising voice said how much do barge cost when be new from ten eleven hundred up to fifteen man said doe that include sail yes miss down to boat who be considered best barge builder well there be good many of miss must say that gill of rochester be considered a good a what do think mr pettigrew hilda said must a walter guardian be justified in spending money mind care bit whether be not because must buy if must not be right for to use money be afraid that must not be right mr pettigrew said a trustee of property must certainly not feel justified in sanctioning sum being drawn though quite admit that good couple must be rewarded can not regard barge a necessary anything in reason that child must require must be justified in agreeing to of course may be expense at public school must pay without hesitation for child of age to give present of fifteen hundred pound must be altogether beyond power to sanction very well hilda said decidedly then will take matter into own hand will go down to rochester to morrow see if people have barge ready built know whether be sort of thing people keep in stock ca say dear must think probable that in slack time may build barge two on speculation for purpose of keeping hand employed whether be case now not know if people at rochester have not got one

john simcoe for order for trustee of will of late general mathieson to carry provision into effect be on list of case for day tom robert be walking up down in westminster hall waiting for to come on when saw face knew hullo sergeant nichol what brings here just curiosity robert happened to see in list of case one of simcoe against trustee of general mathieson ' said to beimcoe be name of chap who saved general mathieson life ' remember being brought into cantonment a well a if be yesterday be with paymaster sergeant sanderson fellow who bolted short time afterwards with three hundred pound from pay chest never be heard of afterwards heard that simcoe be drowned at sea sorry be for braver fellow never stepped in shoe leather there be not man there who did not feel that owed debt of gratitude for saving brigadier life so when saw paper said to myself man be not drowned at must be relation of will go into court have look at be same man be sorry to say that though may be a brave a lion be rogue can see without going into court be talking with man in wig gown little man in black who be suppose lawyer know so wo go near can walk a close a like to take good look at not content with looking once sergeant nichol passed backwards forward three time when rejoined robert latter saw that looked flushed excited what be sergeant believe be simcoe at sergeant said be that man sanderson be speaking about just now several of noticed how like be to simcoe expression of face be different simcoe be five six year younger have pleasant expression sanderson have hard face none of liked be man one must never get friendly with might be in same mess for year not know more about at end than did at beginning of course must be changed good deal by time believe that simcoe must have grown so a to be like man be sure that sanderson must have mark on must know by one day when be recruit musket went off ball went through left forearm be only flesh wound left blackened scar will bet be worth if turned up that fellow sleeve must find there be very important sergeant will go tell young lady be talking with lawyer colonel bulstrode at other end of hall hilda clapped hand what do say now mr pettigrew be right after bring friend up robert let hear story sergeant nichol be fetched repeated story that have told to robert thank very much sergeant barrister said please remain here while talk over what do think of mr pettigrew must seem to explain whole matter have puzzled so did not tell because be not in opinion at necessary to case miss covington have always maintained that man be not simcoe so positive be that friend miss purcell went down to stowmarket to make inquiry be certainly believed by friend there that be simcoe to mind be quite conclusive be bound to say that did not satisfy miss covington may ask miss covington why took up opinion in first place because be convinced that be not sort of man who must have risked life for after miss purcell came back from stowmarket found out that just before called on uncle advertised for relative of late john simcoe that advertisement appeared not in suffolk paper only in london provincial paper over country be evident if man be john simcoe must not advertise over england instead of going down to stowmarket where family lived where have lived for year received reply from old lady aunt of john simcoe living there went down saluted a aunt at once offered to settle pension of fifty pound year on after remaining for three day in house doubt listening to gossip about john simcoe friend went introduced to there be probably resemblance in height figure absence of twenty year must have effected change in face so that when be found that aunt unhesitatingly accepted people there have doubt that be old acquaintance therefore in way shook belief that be not man turn out now see that there be man at benares at time who be remarkably like that man be scoundrel thief when deserted doubt must take name having doubtless heard john simcoe be dead remembering remark made a to likeness to be a likely to take name a other though probably not with idea of making special use of when in england may have heard general mathieson name mentioned remembering that simcoe have saved life of general may have thought that name likeness might enable to personate man first set about establishing identity by going down to stowmarket after that be easy have thought over so many time although never struck that there might have be at benares man bearing striking resemblance to john simcoe rest be exactly a have figured out to mind now will leave gentleman to decide what use will make of discovery while go tell friend of seat allotted to general public be empty a case of sort offered slight attraction even to lounger in hall large number of barrister be present have be whispered about there be likely to be unexpected development in case counsel engaged on side be leader of profession who must hardly have be expected to be retained in mere case of formal application for order for trustee to act upon will fact of case lord counsel who led for john simcoe commenced be simple be at loss to understand how trustee of late general mathieson can offer opposition to obtaining order asked for nothing can be more straightforward than fact late general mathieson early in march made will be duly signed witnessed bequeathing among other legacy amount of ten thousand pound to mr john simcoe a mark of gratitude for having saved from tiger twenty year before in india act be one of heroic bravery mr simcoe nearly lost own life in saving that of general then related with dramatic power incident of struggle there be then matter of surprise that large legacy must have be left to mr simcoe by general who be man of considerable wealth bulk of property be left to grandson in event of dying before coming of age be to go to niece miss covington to whom only small legacy be left being mistress of estate well provided for two month afterwards general upon reflection decided to enlarge gift to mr simcoe therefore in will named in place of miss covington who be amply provided for heir in event of grandson death may say that second will be not drawn up by solicitor who have framed first will probably a often happens general preferred that change have effected must not be known until after death even to family solicitor therefore went to firm of equal respectability standing messrs halstead james who have made affidavit that interviewed personally on matter gave written instruction for drawing up will signed in presence may say that in other respect including legacy of ten thousand pound will be absolutely identical trustee after waiting until last day permitted by law have to client surprise proved first of two will ignoring second on what ground be at loss to understand a client be entitled to ten thousand pound under will might be thought that change must make little difference to unhappily circumstance have entirely changed by fact that general grandson be lost stolen on day before death in spite of most active effort of police offer of large reward client who be deeply affected by loss of child offering thousand pound for news of whereabouts nothing be heard of until two month after disappearance when body be found in canal at paddington after hearing evidence of identification examining clothes party agreed to be of missing child jury returned verdict that body be that of walter rivington that there be proof of how came by end a residence of general mathieson be in hyde park garden doubt poor child strolled away from care of careless nurse came to canal walking near bank fell in be drowned one must have be more grieved than client at although practically put into possession of large property must be sure gladly forfeit large portion of rather than come into possession of in so melancholy manner have not heard of slightest reason why last will of general mathieson must be put aside believe that question must arise a to state of mind at time that be made may be that plea of undue influence may be raised to who knew general must appear absurd be man of active habit vigorous in mind body here be case of man living in house influencing old gentleman approaching dotage met only at club at dinner although general be rightly naturally attached to simcoe be certainly not man to be influenced against will beg therefore to ask lord that will pronounce in favor of second will issue order to trustee to carry out provision forthwith upon face of appeal to court sir henry there be question a to validity of will propound set up by trustee none lord in fact at time case be put down be ignorant that there must be attempt on part of trustee to dispute second will that must do so came upon a surprise however at consultation between learned friend just before came into court be agreed that if lordship must permit must take two matter at once one of trustee be member of firm who be have be family lawyer of general mathieson of father before for long period of year be gentleman of well known honor who be be sure a anxious a be to obtain from lordship judicial decision on can act be irregular judge said a party seemed agreed upon will doubtless save much expense to estate if whole matter can be settled at once will permit whole matter to be taken now brother herbert will hear on other side be sorry to say lord that will be impossible for to imitate learned brother in brevity with opened case so far from fact being extremely simple be may say of very complicated nature own that have explanation to offer with regard to second will be strange very strange that general mathieson man of methodical habit having just drawn up will must go to firm of solicitor draw up fresh one fact that whole of minor bequest be same in two will be certainly very strong proof a also be fact that instruction for drafting will be written by general at rate by someone intimately acquainted with content of will admit be difficult to believe must be case a will from time be signed by general have not be out of messrs farmer pettigrew hand until be taken for probate other day now lord trust that will allow certain amount of license while go into somewhat singular story twenty three year ago general mathieson life be saved in india by mr john simcoe mr simcoe be seriously wounded when recovered somewhat be recommended by surgeon who attended to go down to calcutta at once take sea voyage did so embarked upon ship nepaul be lost in terrible gale in bay of bengal few day later with a be supposed hand twenty year passed then to surprise may say to delight of general who have much grieved over loss of preserver mr simcoe presented for moment general did not recognize be not long before became convinced of identity for knew officer who have be at station at time be well up in gossip of place general at once hailed a man who have saved life introduced to many friend got put up at good club became may say very fond of mr simcoe brought up friend two who have known at stowmarket where have aunt still living result of be that general requested messrs farmer pettigrew to draw up new will bequeathing to john sum of ten thousand pound then came singular episode of second will fortnight later when at dinner at club general be smitten with strange kind of fit from recovered only lived for few month half paralyzed invalid be attended during time by dr leeds gentleman with very high reputation now practicing in harley street a consulting physician general be brought up to town broke down during journey died two day later now come to second strange fact in strange case day before death grandson walter rivington be missing effort of police aided by number of private detective failed to obtain clew to child until body be found in canal at paddington that body be dressed in of clothes worn by child when carried off be unquestionable three person who knew walter rivington best namely miss covington friend of hers named miss purcell who have be summer assisting to nurse general mathieson child own nurse declared that body be not that of general grandson be unable to adduce anything in support of belief beyond fact that hair of child found be short to extent bristly whereas that of walter rivington be long silky jury however adopted view of coroner that hair however soft when cut close to skull will appear more le bristly gave verdict to effect that body be that of walter rivington miss covington friend refused to accept verdict continued search for child without occupying attention by going into detail lord may briefly say that close watch be set on mr simcoe be found that be exceedingly intimate with man of whom one seemed to know anything before go further will ask lord that will give order mr simcoe will not leave court until have finished be not asking without strong reason trust brother herbert certainly not lord order be therefore given simcoe grew very white in face otherwise maintained air of stolid indifference will now go back for moment lord general mathieson be attended by three of leading physician in london at time of seizure symptom be so peculiar that in experience have not met similar case dr leeds however differed from being junior must not press opinion told that opinion be that fit be due to administration of drug unknown to british pharmacopoeia a effect be precisely similar to in case that have read of in africa among other savage people where poison of kind be used by native fetich men wizard that opinion be confirmed rather than diminished by subsequent progress of malady final death of patient one man who must benefit by general death be sitting next to at dinner at time of seizure that man according to own statement have be for many year knocking about among savage of south sea island island of malay archipelago accuse john simcoe of crime need hardly say that mere possibility of such thing heightened strong feeling entertained by miss covington that simcoe be author of abduction of walter rivington devoted friend miss purcell pursued investigation with unflagging energy suspected that man who be very intimate with simcoe have acted a agent in matter casual remark be overheard in singular manner will be explained when case go into court that man be going to tilbury gave clew then in manner many person might find very hard to believe miss covington learned from conversation between two men when together in box at majesty theater that lad be in charge of bargeman living near little village of pitsea in essex from place lord be brought last week miss covington will produce in court if lordship wish to see thus then be immaterial to whether lordship pronounces for first second will lord have not finished story under of will doe that man take farthing money be left to john simcoe john simcoe be drowned over twenty year ago man standing over there be one william sanderson sergeant on paymaster staff at benares when real john simcoe be there there happened to be resemblance between man so strong that be generally remarked upon by comrade man sanderson deserted soon after simcoe be drowned taking with three hundred pound of paymaster money there be sharp hue cry after managed to make escape be certainty may assume without much difficulty that man changed name a soon a got to calcutta nothing be more likely than that must take name of john simcoe whom have be told that so strongly resembled for twenty year hear nothing further of william sanderson do hear when returned to london probably in way other came across name of general mathieson remembering what john simcoe have done for general on strength of personal likeness fact that have for twenty year gone by name determined to introduce to with result know be clever enough to know that must answer question a to history before left england be desirable to obtain witness who must if necessary certify to knew nothing of simcoe birthplace history so inserted advertisement in great number of london provincial newspaper saying that relation of john simcoe who be supposed to have be drowned in bay of bengal in year must hear of something to advantage at address given maiden aunt living at stowmarket did reply went down there at once rushed into arm called aunt told that be intention to make comfortable for life by allowing fifty pound per annum stayed with for three day during time obtained from gossip full detail of boyhood youth friend occupation then went out called upon john simcoe old companion of whom took on own word knowledge of past recognition by aunt so thing might have remained man after undergoing what punishment might be awarded to for abduction of walter rivington must have claimed ten thousand pound left by general mathieson have not be that by what can not consider dispensation of providence old comrade of staff sergeant nichol be attracted to hall morning by seeing name of simcoe that of general mathieson coupled in cause list man be in hall talking to professional adviser nichol walking close to to see if must recognize man whom have last seen carried wounded into benares at once recognized in supposed john simcoe deserter thief sergeant sanderson passed two three time to assure that be not mistaken happily deserter have mark be ineffaceable have a recruit let off rifle ball have passed through fleshy part of forearm leaving there a sergeant nichol have informed ineffaceable scar blackened by powder if man be not sergeant sanderson be long lost john simcoe have to pull up sleeve of left arm show that be without scar man did not move be half stunned by sudden terrible exposure of whole of plan a did not rise counsel said lord must ask that give order for arrest of man william sanderson a deserter thief also upon charge of conspiring with others abduction of walter rivington certainly brother herbert judge said a saw that accused made motion to answer challenge of counsel tipstaff take man into custody on charge of aiding in abduction of walter rivington a to other charge will communicate with authority of india office leave to to prosecute if choose to do so after lapse of year may not think while to do so especially a man be in custody on still graver charge tipstaff moved toward man who roused with great effort snatched small glass ball from pocket inside waistcoat thrust between teeth bit into fragment a officer laid hand upon fell down in fit dr leeds who have come in just a trial began rose to foot be doctor lord name be leeds opinion held of cause of general mathieson death be now proved to be correct symptom of fit be precisely similar to of general mathieson seizure man have taken of very poison with murdered general for minute sanderson struggled in violent convulsion then a dr leeds bent over head fell back suddenly dr leeds felt pulse then rose to foot lord said case be finally closed have gone to higher judgment seat chapter xxvi letter from abroad three day later when hilda returned from drive found that dr leeds be in drawing room with miss purcell netta whose face at once told what have happened have asked question at last miss covington dr leeds said coming forward to shake hand netta have consented to be wife be heartily glad that must ask knew from what told although knew nothing of thought in matter felt sure that must hardly say netta darling be glad long ago thought hoped that must come about seemed to that must be such happy thing auntie said just same thing netta said smiling through tear a hilda embraced a knew ought to have given little hint then must not have be taken quite by surprise might have pretended that did not quite know own mind ask for time to think over instead of surrendering at once did make condition netta dr leeds laughed not condition request if like certainly not condition netta said that heart be greatly set on work have always looked forward to hoped must let do something in way still of course have heard talk over institute score of time be a much impressed a yourselves with enormous boon that must be must be sorry indeed that plan must be given up need hardly say that in half hour have have together did not go deeply into will have general council about a soon a can get down to plain matter of fact netta can talk over with can talk over with then can hold meeting with miss purcell a president of committee matter be not finally settled until lady be established at holmwood with walter dr leeds came down for short holiday of two three day then arrangement be made to satisfaction of party large house standing in ground of

be going to assist in institution be about to be established for teaching system by have benefited to deaf child matter excited considerable interest in medical circle by time that institution be

anxious that a many a possible must participate in benefit of system door of institute be at once opened to outdoor pupil who be boarded in neighborhood six of netta pupil in hanover be brought over a teacher few week from being opened institution be in full swing a dr leeds wished that profit be made by undertaking in desire be cordially joined by wife hilda charge be extremely low except in case of child of wealthy parent surplus in case being devoted to taking in free of payment child of poor before netta marriage interest in mathieson case be revived by appearance of letter in principal

write letter suppose even habitual criminal doe not care to remain under unjust suspicion acknowledge that come under category that life have be spent in crime although never once have suspicion attached to until became mixed up in simcoe mathieson affair wish to state solemnly be absolutely ignorant that name john simcoe be assumed one be name gave when first knew believed that be a represented man who have saved general mathieson life from tiger that have subsequently lived rough life in south sea be aware for came to with message sent by brother of mine when at point of death man have be chum of out there have gallantly carried off when have received wound from subsequently died in fight with large body of native have absolute assurance that be true for brother must never

mathieson that general have taken to put down in will for ten thousand pound said that general mathieson be worth hundred thousand that have planned to get whole not being in way squeamish agreed at

copy of general will have note in general handwriting there be two thing to be done first that must get instruction for draft of will drawn up in precise imitation of general handwriting containing
