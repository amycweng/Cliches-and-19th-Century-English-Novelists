again in native garb ornament interpreter pointed out to two midshipman who have rescued at once went up to slipping hand into theirs began to prattle freely be unable to understand what said took round ship showing gun introduced to ponto captain great newfoundland who submitted gravely to be patted by to jacko monkey who be by mean disposed to be friendly chattered showed teeth to julius caesar negro cook who grinned from ear to ear presented with cake from batch have just made for captain table rest of malay have already left ship two native boat have be hailed in two party of malay have taken place with boat towing behind have be rowed away captain giving strict instruction that be to be landed on opposite side of river little maid speedily became general pet on board serpent be soon proud possessor of several model of ship two patchwork quilt several carved tobacco box other specimen of sailor handiwork small a be have evidently strong idea of own importance received present attention with pretty air of dignity at once earned for title of princess on second day after accident chief boat came off from shore damage having be speedily neatly repaired little bahi stood on top of accommodation ladder a approached addressed with great asperity using much gesticulation with arm what be saying soh hay dick balderson asked be telling that be bad men to let boat be run down be very angry with will be punished 'the men looked very crestfallen under little mistress reproach held up hand in deprecating manner while helmsman stood up after salaaming deeply entered upon long explanation ended in asking if might come on board to see chief permission be at once granted by captain upon request being interpreted to when mounted step bahi led to side of father cot doctor however interposed tell must not talk said to interpreter chief be ill must not be allowed to excite can say few word if want to cot have be lowered to within few inch of deck in order that chief might watch daughter a trotted about romped with ponto who have now quite taken into friendship chief face expressed alarm when first saw great dog when saw how gentle animal be how when one of sailor placed child on back walked gravely up down deck wagging tail a if pleased with novel burden be satisfied that harm must come to from formidable looking animal have first spoken few word sharply to man in answer to excuse indeed have helmsman be minding business instead of looking at ship collision might have be prevented hassan jebash be at present moment so well contented with recovery of child that accepted man excuse latter went back to boat evidently greatly relieved in few day chief began to show sign of impatience through interpreter constantly demanded of doctor when must be well enough to leave ask soh hay whether wish to be able to lead tribe in battle again to go through life unable to use kris hurl spear in ten day if remains quiet will be able to go in couple of month will be a strong active a ever if will keep quiet until bone have knit surely chief be not like impatient child ready to risk everything for sake of avoiding little trouble chief on being translated to scowled angrily tell be of use scowling at soh hay be not doctoring for own amusement for good because be father of little child chief when be translated to lay without speaking for two three minute then said quietly tell doctor be sorry be right have be foolish will stay till say may go chapter ii four five day later chief be allowed to get up to walk quietly up down deck week afterwards doctor said can go now chief if desire must be content to keep quiet for couple of month not make great exertion move quickly how long will take to go up river to home six day easy paddling well be in favor travel fast take quietly be a long a can on voyage lying in canoe be a good rest a can take thank doctor will obey instruction have be very kind to malay chief never forgets benefit have be hostile to white men now see have be mistaken that be good kind be true that boat be going up river soh hay tell that be so yes one of chief sehi pandash wish to place under protection have sent to ask that ship might go up fire big gun that tribe round may see that have strong friend who can help be two day rowing up river to place from when be there will come down to see sehi be not good chief quarrel with neighbor shelter slave who run away to be not good man well will be glad to see chief hope that will bring daughter with have won heart will miss sadly will bring if can do so safely chief said gravely be friend with sehi stop trade a come down river take payment for good pas down be because know that many of be angered that wish to put under protection think that do well to aid so bad fellow did not know that be bad fellow chief best plan will be for other chief who be aggrieved to send down complaint against to come down yourselves when be up there talk over with captain who will doubtless impress upon necessity for abstaining from such practice that can not expect aid from if embroils with neighbor by interfering with trade be strong have many war prahus sometimes come down to sea return with plunder collected from cultivator near coast from trading ship captured burnt will mention what tell to captain will prepare to listen to complaint may be made to must remember that be only acting under order of governor of strait settlement must refer important matter to will come when be there hassan said gravely if nothing be done there will be war there be general regret on board serpent when little princess said goodby to friend went down accommodation ladder to boat with father chief have said little to two young midshipman for saw that preferred that matter must not be alluded to held hand at parting said will see again before long if at time must want will come even if summons reach in middle of battle be such nonsense doctor harry said a boat pushed off to have so much made of such thing a jumping into water if one have be alone have tried to save man woman in such state of funk that there be good chance of throwing arm round neck pulling down with there might be something in though everyone take chance of when jump in to save anyone from drowning with little child two of to do ship close at hand be not worth thinking of for moment parkhurst from point of view thing be not a say worth giving thought to see be not point of view of chief to be nothing whether exploit be gallant one not whether ran danger point simply be child must have be drowned have not seen fished out that be to that owes life think have reason to congratulate yourselves on having made friend who may be very useful to may be that there will be trouble up river if so might possibly be of real service to in case may be able to give good hunting fishing show thing that must never have have opportunity of seeing without friendship assistance did not think of doctor yes must certainly be great thing can assure look at in light parkhurst be looking forward to paying visit a under protection must get opportunity of collecting must never have in ordinary way for unless be greatly maligned one must not trust one self among malay without special protection be not savage doctor hassan be perfect gentleman in manner in silk jacket of handsome sarong really look like prince must not help thinking that of looked poor creature by side certainly can not be called savage though from point of view many of custom be of very savage nature piracy be very general among living on seacoast on great river must be remembered that be not so very many century ago that toll be demanded of passersby by baron having castle on rhine other navigable river crew of wrecked ship be plundered on coast of europe own included not so very long ago in day of elizabeth drake hawkins be regarded by spaniard a pirate of worst class fear that there be good deal of justice in accusation malay be people with history believe that be original inhabitant of island of sumatra however be certain that in twelfth century have extended rule over whole of island many of neighbor in thirteenth have established on peninsula have founded empire extending over greater part of island down to coast of australia have by time acquired civilization of india sultan be powerful monarch carried on great trade with china hindoostan siam maritime code be regulated confirmed a early a by mohammed shah how be that have come to such grief doctor principally by fact that have feudal may call tribal system petty chief follower made war on neighbor if be strong enough a tribe conquered others empire became split up into indefinite number of clan whose chief paid very nominal allegiance to sultan so island broke off from empire until have practically ceased to exist malay be people united only by similar custom language in other respect be therefore able to offer slight resistance on arrival of dutch portuguese in region still upper class preserve memory of former greatness people be intelligent most of trade in part of world be carried on by be enterprising ready to emigrate if see chance of improving fortune know saw many of at cape when touched there nominally be mohammedan in religion strictly observe ordinance of koran mohammedanism be mixed up with trace of original religion ah explains why chief name be hassan wondered that malay must have mohammedan name be not much like arab in figure of course hassan be very fine looking man of other chief saw at penang be so most of be shorter than be very ugly yes in figure other point much resemble burmese who be probably blood relation of chief be finer men a will always find in case in savage semi savage people for of course have pick of woman naturally choose best looking food too be better work le rough than of people at large son daughter of chief naturally intermarry result be that in most case will find upper class taller better formed lighter in color of greater intelligence than rest of people must be specially case in trading people like malay ship must bring over girl purchased in india just a ruling class in turkey used to obtain wife from circassia doubt have helped to modify original malay type thank doctor think will like malay now know something about be true that be so treacherous know parkhurst doubtless be treacherous in war be to say that consider mean fair to deceive enemy think that be so beyond that dutch have never have very great difficulty with have in portion of peninsula where have established rule of course know little about a have only be out here few month be told that a trader can be trusted that word of malay chief can be taken with absolute confidence of course among majority of people of peninsula be regarded with jealousy hostility dread that must extend dominion over be not surprising that must by mean in power strive to prevent coming far inland chief on river be a rule specially hostile in first place because town village be more accessible to know more of power than dwelling in hill country secondly because depend largely upon revenue that derive from taxing good passing up down not unreasonably think might lose if be to become paramount doubt there be much that hassan said of sehi be true be applicable to other chief who have placed under protection namely that have so injured trade by exaction a to incur hostility of neighbor of course be not speaking of such men a rajah of johore perac who be enlightened men have seen benefit to be derived from intercourse with people be agriculturist be really on par with protected state in india there be great future before country gold be found in many of river tin be probably more abundant than in other part of world export be now very large there be immense quantity of valuable timber such a teak sandalwood ebony climate be except on low land near river very healthy nutmeg clove other spice can be grown there indigo chocolate pepper opium sugarcane coffee cotton be successfully cultivated day probably whole peninsula will fall under protection when constant tribal feud be put stop to forest cleared ground cultivated a be case in own settlement of malacca will be found one of most valuable of possession amount of labor can be obtained from china be probable that race who inhabit mountainous district who be said to be industrious peaceable will also readily adapt to changed condition be not malay like people of lowland be black race with curly wool like native of africa probably inhabited whole peninsula before arrival of malay how funny that there must be nigger here harry said be not exactly negro one of race known a negritos having of course many negro characteristic differing from african negro in important particular to supremacy must be unmixed blessing product must reach coast untaxed must obtain european good at vastly cheaper rate minor benefit to be obtained by supremacy be that sportsman must certainly speedily diminish number of wild beast at present be scourge to cultivator tiger must be killed down elephant captured utilized poor people must not see plantation ravaged must be able to travel through forest without constant danger of being carried off by tiger panther possibly be able to cross river without risk of being snapped up by alligator though doubtless must take time before must be brought about when do think that will be going up river doctor can not say captain have be expecting order ever since came here six week ago possibly something may have be learned of sehi characteristic there may be doubt a to expediency of taking under protection chief whose conduct appears to be anything satisfactory on other hand may be considered that by so doing may establish sort of influence over surrounding tribe so make step towards promoting trade putting stop to tribal war be curse of country must be awful sell if be to change mind harry exclaimed must be sorry parkhurst for know be collector can tell that wo find sport pleasure will have cool sea breeze there will be occasion for continual watchfulness perhaps long boat expedition up sluggish stream in atmosphere laden with moisture miasma one expects drawback doctor will find good many can tell youngster still hope will go up think that will do so for will be captain report will help authority to decide whether to appoint resident there not fortnight later small dispatch boat steamed in news soon spread through ship that serpent be to ascend river on following day be at once bustle animation sailor like anything for change be impatient at long delay have occurred chapter iii gunboat be large one carried two midshipman besides parkhurst balderson who be however senior mess consisted of four lad master mate doctor assistant paymaster clerk in gun room be three lieutenant doctor lieutenant of marine chief engineer crew consisted of hundred fifty seaman forty marine serpent having somewhat strong complement have be sent out specially for service in river being of lighter draught than usual with unusually airy spacious deck so be well fitted for work conversation in junior mess of serpent be very lively that evening vessel since arrival on station have made two run between singapore penang on board have seen little of country be delighted at thought of possibility of active service talk be of boat expedition attack from piratical prahus of merit of bayonet rifle opposed to kris spear of sporting expedition in elephant tiger other wild beast be to fall victim of prowess will find that wo get much of that mate who be president of mess said after listening to anticipation of sport have be on west coast of africa know what be poking about in muddy creek in boat tramping through jungle knee deep in mud crew down with fever rest worn out with work heat can tell be not fun a youngster seem to think downright hard work ah well amount of work be better than standing here doing nothing dick said cheerfully for mate be known a proverbial grumbler have be unfortunate a be usually case misfortune be in degree due to for be fond of liquor although when on board took more than share be often somewhat unsteady in speech when returned from run ashore although matter be not grave enough for captain to report altogether unfavorably of be sufficiently so for to shrink from recommending for promotion in consequence have seen score of younger men raised over head have be for time unemployed before have joined serpent have be appointed to only because captain forest who be friend of family have used interest on behalf have however when joined spoken frankly to have asked for morrison said simply for sake of father tell frankly that unless report be thoroughly favorable one be not likely to be again employed be told that there be nothing special against that in case since passed have be warmly spoken of have be said that know duty well have privately learned that be fond of liquor although charge of absolute drunkenness have be brought against be considered that must not make desirable officer in higher rank now future depends upon if have resolution to give up habit may yet retrieve if find that do so will certainly take opportunity of giving chance to distinguish will strongly urge claim to promotion if be not able to do must make up mind to be permanently put upon shelf admonition have not be in vain since joining serpent morrison have made successful effort to break of habit have very seldom gone ashore when did so never went alone always returned at early hour without having taken more than must have done in ordinary way on board have not however given up habit of grumbling messmate be so accustomed to taking somber view of everything that prognostication a to nature of work up river have little effect upon what do think sandy harry parkhurst asked scotch assistant surgeon know nothing about except what have read say that country be healthy stand to reason that can not be so while have got river with swamp jungle such heat a however have good supply of quinine on board with allowance of spirit hope that sha a morrison say have ship company down with fever be in favor that have only just come out for say that newcomer can resist effect of tropical river much better than whose constitution have be weakened by residence in country a to sport have desire to kill animal doe not meddle with business be other way if of get mauled will do best to help doctor to pull through be very well on board ship have desire to go tramping about among swamp whether be to hunt animal fight malay think that everyone must stick to last sandy dick said with laugh well only wish there be more on board of opinion for must give more chance to who like to stretch leg ashore for change can stretch leg here if want to scotchman said quietly be not anxious to do more suppose if there be expedition against malay will have to go with fewer of there be better will be pleased talk be more serious aft where doctor first lieutenant be dining with captain ended by latter saying well doctor if what friend hassan said be true be likely enough to have hand pretty full will have to watch fellow sehi a sharply a do neighbor be not under protection yet if sends prahus down river to plunder on coast a hassan say be not sort of character likely to do credit position of british resident with must be reverse of pleasant one however must hope that be not a black a be painted have evidently put other chief back up must receive report of with doubt however have doubt that if turn out badly will be able to give lesson will be of benefit to first day voyage up river by mean came up to anticipation of midshipman a to country through be to pas width of river varied from quarter of mile to three hundred yard bank on side be lined with mangrove presenting dreary monotonous aspect progress be slow steam launch going ahead sounding depth of water captain having little faith in assertion of native pilot that be perfectly acquainted with bank willow being now dry season top of many of shoal be dry number of alligator be lying half in half out of water basking in sun several of officer who possessed rifle amused by shooting at creature be very rarely that attention be paid to firing ball glancing off scaly armor without alligator appearing to be conscious of anything unusual there be more amusement in watching how when swell of steamer rushed through willow water broke on shoal reptile turned scrambled back into river evidently alarmed at to strange phenomenon must not care about bathing here davis harry parkhurst remarked to old sailor be right sir must rather have stand up fight with malay than trust for two minute in muddy water why be worse than shark sir shark doe hoist fin a signal that be cruising about chap come sneaking along underneath water first know about be that have got by leg be worse davis bite from alligator shark well a far a bite go mr parkhurst shark be worst will take leg off big 'un will bite man in two half alligator go to work way get hold of leg doubt mangle bit bite right through bone just take hold of drag down to bottom of river keep there until be drowned then polish off at leisure brute harry exclaimed with deep emphasis see first lieutenant have hit that big fellow there in eye soft skin behind leg anyhow have got hard look how be roaring lashing tail what be best way of killing dick asked have heard sir that in africa native bait big hook with lump of pork something of sort then when alligator have swallowed haul up holus bolus must say good plan to kill must be with 'tricity last ship be in have officer of marine artillery who knew about such thing put big cartridge into lump of pork with two wire a soon a shark have swallowed must touch spring something there must be explosion there be not a much fun in a having hook be quicker did not do for sport because hated shark heard say that have have young brother killed by one of must sit there on taffrail for hour on lookout for with three four loaded lump of pork why have known kill a many a dozen in day expect best part of pay must have gone in dynamite have narrow escape one day somehow thing went wrong in trying to set right fell over taffrail shark have bolted bait be not enough for appetite went straight at officer have have young ensign sitting beside who have often watched work knew how thing went be standing near at time began twisting screw thing a cool a cucumber though must see a hand shook bit well got right just in time for shark be not length away from captain be turning over for bite when thing went off there be end of shark captain be bit shaken up made grab at rope held on to till lowered boat picked up have to be got up on deck in chair be two three day before be again when got round set to work again more earnestly than ever believe that if have stopped in west indie long enough there must not have be shark left in water be capital plan davis if ever take possession of river will have to do something of sort to get rid of brute be malay afraid of know mr parkhurst think be have chat with mate met in myrtle went home day after relieved here have be up of river told that village have bathing place palisaded off so that alligator must not get at bather well there be one thing will have to be very careful when be out in boat for if be to run upon sunken log knock hole in boat bottom there must not be much chance of ever reaching shore be about right there sir aint afraid of malay give creep down back when think of one of chap getting hold of by leg bob pearson told that only chance have be to send knife if ca get at thumb into creature eye must require mighty cool hand to find eye with brute teeth in one leg water so thick with mud that must not see inch beyond nose well will make note of anyhow davis will take good look at next alligator see dead so a to know exactly where to feel for eye on second day scenery changed in place of mangrove dense forest lined river bird of lovely plumage occasionally flew across after have anchored in evening air became full of strange noise great beast rose snorted near bank sound of roaring growling be heard in wood lad who have be so eager before to take part in hunt on shore listened with something like awe to various strange often mysterious noise what in world doe mean doctor dick balderson asked a surgeon came up to spot where four midshipman be leaning on rail mean that there be good deal of life in wood that splashing sound hear with deep grunt snort be probably made by hippopotamus wallowing in willow water may be rhinoceros even buffalo that roar be tiger panther that snarling sound on other bank be doubt made by smaller animal of same family indulging in domestic quarrel of other sound be made by night bird of kind other perhaps by monkey fancy distant vibrating sound go on without intermission be concert of party of frog what be a shrill cry a from child followed by confused outburst of cry chattering a seemed to barking sound followed fancy be death cry of monkey probably python other snake have seized in sleep other noise be outcry of companion heaping abuse upon snake unable to do anything to rescue friend think doctor harry parkhurst said in tone be half in earnest that feel so anxious a did for sport in forest certainly must decline to take part in after nightfall can quite understand lad at night sound of tropical forest seem mysterious weird in broad daylight bush will be comparatively still nocturnal animal will slink away to lair there will seem nothing strange to in song call of bird must recommend to take sound dose of quinine tonight have two half gallon keg of stuff mixed officer man can go take glass whenever feel want must be good for nerve a well a neutralize effect of damp rising from river must advise who be not on watch to turn in early be of use exposing yourselves more than be necessary to miasma next day progress be more rapid for captain found that assurance of pilot that there be amply sufficient water for serpent have be verified therefore steamed forward at half speed without sending launch on ahead to take sounding several village be passed by way though inhabitant assembled on bank watched steamer boat be put out be attempt made to barter product with stranger doe not look a if be popular mr ferguson captain said to first lieutenant may be that object to presence altogether may be because believe that be going to assistance of rajah sehi certainly doe not look well for future not at sir however will be at rajah place tomorrow morning will then have better opportunity of seeing how thing be likely to go at rate be sure to be civil for time will be likely to procure fruit vegetable a doctor say be absolute necessity if men be to be kept in good health next morning anchored about ten o'clock opposite campong of rajah be good deal larger than that have passed on way up house be mere hut with exception of large wooden structure at once concluded be residence of rajah a soon a serpent turned last bend of river before reaching place sound of drum gong be heard large boat manned by eighteen rower shot out from bank a anchor be dropped two official on board at once mounted accommodation ladder on reaching deck be received by first lieutenant behind whom stood guard of honor of marine upon stating that came to express on behalf of rajah pleasure felt at arrival be conducted to captain cabin compliment be exchanged through medium of interpreter bottle of champagne be opened content appeared to gratify visitor announced that rajah must receive captain afternoon at palace chapter iv of midshipman be present at interview between captain rajah second lieutenant captain of marine doctor alone accompanied with escort of twenty bluejacket a many marine large crowd of people have collected to see pas along to palace be bare barn like structure looked on sullenly silently a party passed through on way be kept waiting little time outside building then entered through doorway led into large unfurnished room at end of rajah be seated rose when officer entered received with appearance of great cordiality chief standing behind conversation be wholly of complimentary character subject of business on british ship have come be not even touched upon refreshment consisting of native sweet palm wine be then passed round captain seeing that business talk be to be deferred took leave doctor who be fond of two midshipman be always ready to chat freely with what did think of ally dr horsley dick asked when having changed full uniform for suit of undress came up on deck between balderson have seldom seen more unmitigated looking ruffian in life even for malay be ugly soh hay tell that in young day be great fighter face shoulder be seamed with scar asked how came to be rajah for doe not look at type of better class of people soh told that in first place took to jungle owing to having krised in quarrel son of chief here be joined by other fugitive set up a pirate captured by surprise one of chief prahus force grew rapidly made night attack on chief campong killed member of family caused to be elected chief of tribe be then small one gradually swallowed up one after of weaker neighbor sometimes by force sometimes by treachery believe be now confronted by more powerful chief that be only because be possessed of six eight piratical prahus that have be able to maintain position doubt have become alarmed by prospect of combination against have so invited to support step will of course greatly add to unpopularity doubtless think that with help must defy enemy can not suppose doctor harry said indignantly that be going to fight for such rascal a be against men have be plundering expect doe think that be going to fight for unless can show that be to interest to do so must imagine that hope that effect of appearance here will be to induce neighbor to come to arrangement with that will endeavor to make peace with by offering to throw over to join with against then must say doctor that best thing must be to hang ruffian up at once well yes might be good plan parkhurst doctor said with smile might save good deal of trouble see have come up here at invitation have just be eating food drinking liquor must scarcely place in favorable position in eye of native in general be to commence alliance with by hanging harry laughed suppose not doctor still what be to do must wait lad be here to ascertain precise situation will be time before will be cleared up certainly for present there will be nothing for to do to keep quiet see how matter turn out to get through time a best may will have fine opportunity for shooting botanizing for chief design may be be certain that at present will do in power to please captain today at suggestion said that in order to keep men in good health must be desirable that must have opportunity of going ashore that officer must make expedition in search of game into interior promised at once to afford facility to provide with guide beater next day permission be granted to several of officer to twenty sailor dozen marine to go on shore before starting whole ship company be drawn up captain addressed upon absolute necessity for good behavior malay said be fierce race very proud independent quick to resent smallest insult man carry kris be ready to use on slightest provocation man who go ashore must remember that not only own life of many others success of mission on have come hither may be forfeited by careless act of aggression many of have served on coast of africa must remember that malay be not to be treated in same free easy manner may go down with negro must comport yourselves with same decency of behavior that must be in port of friendly european power breach of order will be most severely punished appeal to officer man to use utmost effort to keep on good term with people to behave a if honor credit of ship depended upon personally man who come on board in slightest degree worse for liquor will not be allowed to land again even if be stationed here for six month if there be misbehavior on shore leave will be stopped two day later captain with second lieutenant doctor again paid visit to rajah time business matter be entered upon chief began by stating that rejoiced at thought of being under protection of great english queen captain replied that majesty be anxious to be on good term with malay chief that rajah sultan who have accepted protection have greatly benefited by so doing by listening to advice of officer whom sent to reside at seat of government that of course before receiving state under protection be necessary that representative governor of strait settlement must be thoroughly satisfied that rajah intended to be guided by advice so given said that be thoroughly necessary must be understood for that allegiance offered to queen must not be lightly thrown off if chief once owned a sovereign must not change mind afterwards must disobey advice order of resident must be liable to be dethroned government bestowed upon one better fitted for must not for instance be allowed to engage in hostility against neighbor without consent of resident for be clear that english must not assist in war in considered that be in wrong in matter there must be benefit on side chief must obtain protection against warlike neighbor must benefit by presence advice of british officer by trade must spring up while in return for benefit must acknowledge queen a sovereign must obey order of officer just a native born subject must do chief looked very serious at can not asked at last chief obtain protection of british afterwards remain a ally of theirs not so captain said can not come to when be in danger ask to send ship men to aid afterwards when danger have passed wish good morning give nothing in return for benefit have received what order must resident give rajah asked after pause must give such order a must be necessary for good of state without interfering in matter of home government must not allow act of tyranny cruelty must imperil peace of state perhaps bring about rising must not suffer trade passing through dominion to be hampered injured by heavy unjust exaction although doubtless must allow legitimate toll to be taken must not permit expedition to be fitted out for attack upon harmless neighbor interference must always be for good of state consequently for good of prince income of various ruler who have placed under british protection have always be largely augmented by prosperity well doing of state increase in population extension of trade agriculture of enabled people to pay larger amount of taxation see rajah force one to place under protection war with one unless by attack upon upon prince under protection compels to punish in extreme case to take possession of dominion be explaining to because wish thoroughly to understand what position will be if queen take under protection certainly will not do unless be found that be likely on part to carry out faithfully obligation have assumed in return for protection when have be translated to rajah by interpreter chief sat for time silent be evident that be ill pleased that have reckoned upon obtaining british aid without undertaking responsibility officer who will come up said at last must reside on shore certainly must portion of ground must be allotted for residency on fort must be erected must be manned by small force for protection might either reside in fort in residence erected for close to under shelter of gun fort must of course be used for protection of town against enemy a well a for protection of officer against rising on part of people in case a well a must find refuge in then must no longer be ruler rajah said angrily must not be able to order who offended to be punished not at captain replied quietly power a ruler must not be interfered with in way a long a be properly exercised must have power of executing ill doer in accordance with custom of country murder of person who have committed crime be not to be permitted anything like wholesale cruelty tyranny must be sternly repressed for time rajah sat without speaking then said with evident effort of self control must think over be new to by mean do so captain replied matter be important one will do well to consider in light before take step once taken can not be undone like fellow look doctor captain said intended to use a cat paw against neighbor think that be thoroughly bad lot sir if accepted term must be very sorry to be appointed resident for must not feel that life be worth day purchase well there be nothing to do to wait until get definite answer from instruction be that if find that be not desirable man to have to deal with be to enter into negotiation with other rajah to endeavor to do something to open trade of river to render safe for merchant who come up to trade if hassan account of man doings be correct be main cause of falling off in trade moreover author of piracy of have have so many complaint indeed be possible that when governor learns true state of thing may get order to present ultimatum to fellow to sink piratical craft at rate may make up mind to be here for time on following day message be received from rajah saying that if of officer wished to go on excursion for sport guide must be placed at disposal that who wished to do so must at time travel through country without slightest fear of molestation for time affair remained in same condition doctor went daily on shore with butterfly beetle net tin box other paraphernalia be generally accompanied by couple of bluejacket always took native guide to prevent risk of being lost in jungle also because man be able to take to place where village have stood be in clearing insect life especially among lepidoptera be most abundant malay first engaged be young fellow who proved so intelligent willing that be permanently retained for service a long a serpent remained on station officer obtained sport with big game for although at night forest be full of sound showing number of wild animal abounded never be met with during daytime must have be hopeless endeavoring to penetrate thick jungle in search of there be however abundance of bird for most part of brilliant plumage doctor be delighted with spoil brought in while mess be kept well supplied with jungle fowl other edible bird native learning from guide of doctor passion for insect brought in large number for sale be able to purchase great many specimen altogether new to science two midshipman made excursion with gun whenever must get leave davis two other sailor always accompanied a captain order be strict that officer man must go outside limit of campong unless accompanied by two armed seaman sometimes took native canoe went up river fishing a abundance of fish must be caught by line from ship side only did a change often in cool of evening lay lazily in canoe while fisherman be employed rowing up one other of numerous stream flowed into river doctor prognostication a to health of crew be only partially verified for precaution taken if did not secure perfect immunity against fever at least greatly diminished number of who suffered from abundance of fish caught from ship purchased from native formed wholesome diet aided by fruit of native brought off very large quantity be very varied much of delicious mangosteen be specially appreciated who must overcome repugnance to disgusting odor of durian found delicious eating besides be custard apple banana many other kind of fruit be very cheap upon doctor suggestion supply be purchased daily for use of ship company sailor who have other use for money laid out small portion of pay on luxury captain have taken opportunity when boat passed up river to send message present to chief of tribe higher up with assurance that have not come up a enemy that desired to be on good term with must gladly see of who must come down to pay visit must guarantee safe return without molestation on part of sehi answer have however be received to overture proposal made to rajah to send of ship boat up river to endeavor to bring about understanding between neighbor be received with extreme disfavor chapter v so far nothing have be seen of rajah prahus when questioned on subject replied that be down on coast trading with native be so improbable that must have be sent away while rajah be in fear of attack by neighbor that credence be given to assertion ship boat often went out for long row on river ostensibly a captain told rajah who inquired suspiciously a to meaning of excursion for sake of giving crew active exercise principally in order to take sounding of river to investigate size position of creek running into one day gig cutter have proceeded farther than usual have started at daybreak have turned off into what seemed very small creek have hitherto be unexplored a from width of mouth be supposed to extend short distance into forest master mate be in command of one boat second lieutenant of other harry parkhurst accompanied latter after pushing through screen of foliage almost closed entrance to creek boat rowed on for distance for mile width be fifteen yard tree met in arch overhead then widened considerably be just sort of place lieutenant said to harry where rajah prahus may be hidden away have best go along a noiselessly a possible if be to come upon suddenly might fire upon must bring on general row if must catch sight of must be best to take news to captain let act a think fit ordered men to cease rowing until gig came alongside mr morrison said seems to that be likely place for prahus to be hidden have better try discover if be case without being seen therefore have oar except four laid in let men muffle with stocking be most careful to dip into water without making splash let absolute silence be preserved in boat will lead way a before if hold up hand stop rowing instantly aye aye mate replied same precaution be taken by cutter boat proceeded noiselessly presently stream narrowed again until seemed that be approaching termination boat stopped rowing fancy have come to end of mr morrison lieutenant said in low voice be afraid so too sir there be room for oar will either have to punt boat to drag by bush lieutenant be about to give order to turn when harry said suddenly there be current sir have have eye upon root have drifted backwards couple of foot since lost way so there must be stretch of water above lieutenant watched root of tree to harry have pointed for minute in silence then said be right lad there be current a say there must be stretch of water above lay in oar lad stand up pull along by bough bush make slightest sound twenty yard farther creek widened oar be again got out take place in bow mr parkhurst hold up hand instant see anything unusual do men be ready to hold up instant give order proceeded for quarter of mile gig following close behind suddenly at bend in stream glare of light be seen ahead harry held up hand passed word down in whisper just ahead creek widened into broad sheet of water lieutenant stopped gig by holding up hand passed order for men to lay in oar noiselessly told coxswain to keep in well under bush on left hand side then made way forward joined harry telling men to pull boat forward by mean of branch overhead be well within reach to avoid breaking even twig in minute two bow of boat arrived at end of screen of bush low exclamation broke from lieutenant harry simultaneously be looking out on to almost circular pool two hundred yard in diameter in center be moored six prahus two of lay broadside on to creek other four be in line behind seemed that broadside be directed to opposite side of pool for other two boat be in way of firing at creek be long low vessel rowing twenty oar on side carried number of small brass gun be evidently full of men for number must be seen on deck boat be passing to fro between small village at edge of pool having taken in detail of scene lieutenant passed word for mate to leave own boat join when did so whispered to thought be a well that must have view of fellow position too morrison a must be of use to if have to take boat in to attack two minute later boat be drawn back again to open water in rear rowed a noiselessly a before down creek word being spoken until be mile away from pool be snug hiding place mr morrison lieutenant said be indeed sir who must have thought scoundrel be so close to that lay up narrow creek have passed dozen time never thought worth examining must not have dreamt that one of craft must have passed through doubt whether did pas through hardly must have done so without breaking down good many of branch must have seen sign of think must have got into pool by creek coming in on opposite side see four out of six boat be anchored in line so a to bring broadside to bear on point opposite to while other two guarded against attack from side naturally thought unlikely that boat must come up here so directed main attention to other opening next thing to find out will be where other stream join river otherwise a soon a make appearance will escape way there be not least doubt that must row away from fastest boat however be great thing that have discovered whereabouts without having least notion that have done so be sure captain will be very pleased when hears that have found will give whip hand over lying rascal sehi captain forest smiled grimly when lieutenant made report of discovery that have made thank mr hopkins be very valuable discovery just at present matter have not come to point when can turn to account next thing will be to find out where other passage come out will be serious business to attack in boat alone prahus carry tremendous lot of men malay will fight desperately say that might not succeed must lose lot of men in attempt must be hot work even with ship attacked by six of fellow at once if be in night might fail to see of before be upon must have hard work to beat back four five hundred of if came swarming on deck together however can wait first time rajah show sign of treachery can pounce upon fleet will not dream that have discovered hiding place will therefore let hide there without movement however must try to find ether end of entrance to creek please impress upon mr morrison young parkhurst that be of highest importance word will be spoken about might be advisable also to give notice to men who be in boat to keep mouth shut have reason to believe that interpreter be not faithful to interest be just a well not to trust anyone moreover may be that of malay who come on board with fruit may have be for time at singapore penang picked up little english chance word might let know that have discovered prahus wonder why friend hassan have not turned up dick balderson said to chum one day after have be lying for month opposite town expect something have occurred to keep harry said be quite convinced that must have come if must may be in trouble with of neighbor may have tried to exert too soon done damage be quite convinced that meant what said at rate till business here come to head be not likely to be able to go up pay visit to be quite sure that captain must not let go now indeed must not ask even if be sure must for may get to blow with rajah day can not put off giving final answer much longer wonder captain stood shilly willying so long a have be two evening after a two midshipman be leaning against bulwark watching reflection of star in sluggish stream native sampan stole silently out from shadow of shore dropped down alongside serpent so noiseless be movement that two men on lookout in bow did not notice midshipman thought be shadow of dark object floating down stream when came alongside man stood up hello harry said must not come alongside like what do want dick harry doctor come from hassan oh be all right come on board leaning over stretched out hand to native who seized in moment stood by side on deck holding head rope of sampan in mouth davis harry said to sailor who be standing two pace away just go down to wardroom tell doctor with compliment that will be obliged if will come on deck at once say that be something particular minute later doctor appeared be just in middle of rubber dick if have not uncommonly good reason for calling up will make smart for first time get under hand whom have got here be messenger from hassan mentioned name yours ah be glad of that doctor said rubbing hand together have be chaffing in wardroom about prophesying must never hear of again well what doe say have not said anything except name doctor that come from hassan suppose know more english thought have better consult whether must be best to send for soh hay may have brought message of importance right lad think most prudent thing will be to tell captain first may only be message to say why have not come may be matter of importance will go to at once two three minute later returned be to bring to captain cabin here davis pas word forward that captain want to see soh hay in cabin harry touched native who have be standing quietly by side signed to accompany with dr horsley dick went direct to cabin so friend have sent message at last lad captain forest said be glad of for own have doubt whether must hear more of come from chief hassan captain who have be working at malay language with interpreter since have arrived at mouth of river asked in tongue man face brightened yes lord said be well chief be quite well wish knew enough to question without soh hay interference will only make mess of perhaps get wrong idea altogether of message now soh hay broke off a interpreter entered will ask man question exactly a put tell answer word for word may be of importance now ask first what message brings from chief to officer question be put native speaking slowly quietly evidently repeating lesson that have learned by heart said chief sends greeting to three friend harry dick doctor also to captain be well in body be cured can throw spear lead men to battle have sent four messenger one after none have returned with answer have doubt be krised now sends tell that messenger have arrived until now captain said when be interpreted to man nodded krised travel at night hide in tree day float down at night in shadow of bush have got through safe chief hassan say not be able to come down other chief very angry because english warship come send message to hassan to join when say threaten to kill destroy tribe when warship go away two of rajah sehi prahus go up down river stop boat sehi send message to chief say that english war boat here english come take country after done take country of others make king of river ask to join in killing english man then must have more quarrel with trouble trade more be good friend with neighbor chief say one thing more afraid of rajah than of english think better have english here than rajah hassan say must take great care sehi very treacherous attack when expect think prahus can easily take english ship hassan say sehi want other chief to aid so that if english send up more ship then can join in fighting hassan say will do what can have eight war canoe good against prahus run at canoe cut in half will come to help if english attack doe not know where prahus be begs captain to attack first be make sehi master of river if destroyed other chief not afraid of sehi might get of to join against hassan said tell harry dick doctor doe not forget kindness will do what can to watch over such be hassan message ask when be going back to chief captain said go now interpreter said after asking question get a far a can before morning sure many eye watch ship night day to see that message come word of what rajah be doing float down stream in distance then paddle to opposite bank then keep in shadow of bush up river hide away till night come again very well then tell that be to thank master for sending warning that have already found out that what told before went away be true sehi be very bad man say that be not afraid of prahus will make short work of when get chance tell will take great care not let be surprised that when have finished with fellow here ship will come a far up river a can go show chief that english have evil intention against will send three friend with strong boat party to pay visit by way ask man if know part of country yes captain say that have be since boyhood boatman have worked for year with trader who used to go up creek trade with villager ask if know creek turn off from river four five mile above be very small one lead into pool on be large village man nodded at once when question be put then spoke for minute two say captain that know pool village have never be up small creek that speak of did not know that boat must get through have be there by large creek run into other branch of river one turn off twelve mile below from river be hour paddle in sampan to pool how must know entrance captain asked entrance difficult to find native replied strip of land run out from side covered with tree one go little beyond other so that anyone who did not know must pas entrance without noticing be just wide enough for large craft to go in out there be village stand hundred yard below entrance must be known by big tree grows before large house close to bank water be deep on side have only after passing village to keep close in shore will then see entrance to creek be called alligator creek because more than place swarm with creature thank captain said will tell chief say have rendered valuable service opened case in kept present intended for chief took out brace of handsome pistol powder flask bullet mold take said in token of service have rendered when see chief will be well recompensed for risk that have run in bearing message malay looked longingly at pistol then said came by order of chief not for reward quite so understand that be not offering reward for service for information that have given may be of value if have trouble with rajah here man bowed took pistol offered will use against enemy said warmly of know creek for be that render so difficult for to fight against sehi be master of water can not attack without first crossing creek must have to carry canoe with to do for creek be too full of alligator for anyone to swim across small canoe must have chance of passing creek when war boat be there captain nodded when be translated to sehi place in fact stand upon island formed by two branch of river creek a soon a became master of river must hardly be assailed while at time must sally out fall upon enemy ask man if will take refreshment before go man declined have said sufficient fruit dried fish for journey back few minute later took place in little canoe drifted away into darkness be soon lost to sight chapter vi thing be coming to crisis harry dick balderson said in tone of delight a left captain cabin now know what along suspected rajah be rascal have not only found out where prahus be hidden have corked up in bottle nothing must be better dick expect will have pretty hot work of course serpent can not get up creek though can place at entrance prevent getting away there still remains work of capturing driving down creek be likely to be very tough job next morning second lieutenant mate harry parkhurst be sent for to captain cabin first lieutenant be there be asked opinion a to whether prahus must force way through creek by have ascended be most important point captain said indeed everything might depend upon be sure sir mr hopkins said that must not go straight down might cut way through must be work of considerable time for with mast must have to clear away branch to considerable height down near water branch by pushed along be of undergrowth with many rattan other creeper varying from thickness of one thumb to of one wrist must take great deal of chopping before one of war boat must be pushed through higher up must probably have much thicker branch to contend with may be that can lower mast even if must do so must think that must take over hour work even with number of hand carry to get passage through bit of thick undergrowth fifty sixty yard up mouth of creek there be two three other place where chopping must have to be done must be comparatively easy work mate harry agreed with lieutenant practically then captain said malay have one mode of escape while have two of attack at rate if send up boat beforehand fasten two three iron chain from side to side among branch passage must be securely sealed thank gentleman be have to ask at present be very difficult nut have to crack mr ferguson went on when first lieutenant be alone to attack six strongly armed prahus with boat of ship must be serious enterprise indeed success must be very doubtful while loss must certainly be very heavy especially a if of boat be crew must have little chance in place swarming with alligator think must be justified in risking such enterprise there be doubt sir loss must be very heavy indeed by account malay fight like demon on deck of own boat for aught know may after trice up rattan to prevent boarder getting on board have heard that be custom when expect attack that be far more formidable obstacle than boarding net of course must be quite ready to lead attack must decide upon making one can not conceal from that must be well nigh desperate undertaking be glad that be of opinion captain said there seems to one course that difficult one namely to carry couple of heavy gun through forest to edge of pool must be serious undertaking must have to send strong force to defend if must succeed in planting in position must soon drive malay out of pool must be capital plan captain if must be managed suppose before attempt will take possession of place capture rajah that of course suppose will capture have doubt that be closely watched night day that instant boat be lowered men get on board rajah must prepare for flight though might possibly make resistance however must be trifling gun must cover landing knock place about ear to penetrate jungle must be vastly more difficult affair if a be probable have succeeded in inducing of neighbor to join may have already sent strong contingent forest may be full of in case must be quite beyond power to rout out certainly must not be justified in attempting destruction of town burning of palace must be serious blow to destruction of piratical fleet must be very much heavier one if can achieve that will have done good service first thing to do be to find out whether there be path either from river other branch to pool if so at dark after destroying town will recall men on shore buoy anchor drop noiselessly drift down river till be far enough away to use engine then steam down to junction of two stream up again to entrance to creek on side then will at once land very strong party land also two twenty four pounder drag to pool might hope to do so without opposition for malay must doubt be gathered at edge of forest near town to repel attack might make from there before morning might have gun in position must take hundred empty sack must fill with earth when get near pool form battery with behind screen of bush then when be ready will cut down bush open fire see why must not succeed sir of course most difficult part of operation be dragging gun native path be only broad enough for men in single file yes be difficulty must not employ ax to cut down tree to saw down must be interminable work think mr ferguson must have to carry doubt if must carry twenty four pounder sir might carry eighteen have bamboo of almost length here if be to lash eighteen pounder between two of must say that ten men side ought to able to carry while a many more might take gun carriage will get bamboo today mr ferguson try experiment of how many men will be required to carry gun now think of fancy that will be still easier to lay gun down on sledge shaped piece of timber path be smooth enough where native tread men must haul gun along with rope must be better easier sir difficulty with carriage will be greatest might be taken to piece a far a possible slung on bamboo think that will be able to manage that captain said cheerfully first thing be to find path there be almost sure to be one from village malay spoke of a close to mouth of creek pool if send boat up a soon a arrive at creek to row with muffled oar until get near pool then land find path must diminish very much distance must have to go work to be done must be great thing to find out beforehand sir if like will drop down river afternoon in gig will attract attention for will be thought that be merely going fishing shooting a soon a be dark will muffle oar row up other branch find mouth of creek row up first find how far be to pool then drop down quarter of mile land strike into jungle look for path must of course choose point where creek bend way for a path doubt go straight from village to pool must be nearer creek at bend than must be at other point if be sharp bend might go quite close to must be very good plan mr ferguson a have proposed will take command of boat otherwise must have sent third lieutenant morrison need not say that will be necessary to use greatest caution to avoid risk a much a possible though fancy that gig must run away from of ordinary native craft of course great point be to avoid being noticed for be one of boat seen up other river near creek alarm must be given prahus might at once shift position make up river where must have little chance of finding again quite understand that sir will be a careful a possible will take one of midshipman with mr parkhurst mr balderson if worst came to worst one of men be hit must man oar if be badly wounded must take command think be balderson turn for boat duty of will do captain said be strong active lad a steady a can expect lad to be accordingly at four in afternoon captain gig be lowered a rule be that men on boat duty must go armed surprise have be excited when order be given for men to take musket cutlass though when extra supply of ammunition brace of pistol be served out to thought that something unusual be in wind there be grin on men face when hamper of provision be placed in bow of boat dick be in state of high suppressed delight when informed by first lieutenant that be to accompany on boat expedition that have better take cloak with a might be out night can take pistol with mr balderson be not likely that will be wanted be a well to carry dick borrowed cutlas from armorer ground down to razor edge for dirk be altogether useless weapon if came to fighting be more convinced that something more than usual be intended when saw assistant surgeon place parcel in stern sheet bandage expect said where do think can be going harry perhaps be going up creek again dick who be going in command have not heard morrison say have not be told off so suppose be hopkins in fact if be going up creek be sure to be a one of who went up there before must certainly be in command be rum be taking captain gig be very particular about be very seldom indeed that even first luff us suppose think possible that may be chased there be doubt be far away fastest boat on board be not dockyard boat a know be one captain have specially built for for racing if be at station where there be other warship when four o'clock came first lieutenant with cloak over arm came out took place in boat there be general look of surprise among sailor leaning on rail to see put off for be very unusual thing for first officer to take command when only single boat crew be going out on expedition row easy men mr ferguson said a sat down on one side of coxswain while dick took place on other drop quietly down river there be fishing rod by side mr balderson may a well begin to put together at once so that native on shore may see that be going on fishing expedition rowed ten mile down at leisurely pace then boat grapnel be dropped at bend of stream where water be unusually deep several basket of fish have be taken at various time spare rod be brought out from under seat mr ferguson dick began to fish one on side of boat while men lay on oar look of satisfaction came over face a lieutenant told that must smoke hitherto dick have be in ignorance a to object of expedition have be much surprised when order have be given for boat to row down river be therefore evident that be not intention of first officer to again explore creek several fish be caught a soon a became dark lieutenant said can throw overboard again mr balderson want extra weight in boat fish must weigh thirty pound at least now what do suppose be going to do have idea sir thought that might be going up creek lieutenant hopkins explored other day to have look at prahus a came down river instead of going up of course be not that be going to explore creek from other end will be first rate sir be afraid that sha find water enough for serpent fear that there be little chance of still may obtain information will be valuable night be dark one hour after sunset grapnel be got up boat continued way down river oar being now muffled strictest silence ordered keep eye open mr balderson lieutenant said think that must be three mile to point where river fork other branch come in on right so will keep on left bank think there be much fear of missing junction of stream if do will row on to mile below point where think be then cross keep up on other side in way can not miss for next half hour word be spoken in boat dick kept eye fixed on opposite bank suddenly touched lieutenant there sir must be line of tree have suddenly stopped think can make out lower line behind yes doubt be junction will go two hundred yard farther down before cross be unlikely in extreme that anyone be watching still want to run slightest risk in five minute crossed river whose increased width showed that have assuredly passed junction of stream then turned followed right hand bank stretch out bit now lad have fifteen mile straight rowing before sooner get to other end better may have long night work before want to be able to get to place where fished before morning men bent to oar boat sped swiftly along current be very slight after two hour rowing lieutenant judged that must be short distance from village hassan messenger spoke of accordingly told coxswain to steer across to other bank warned men that slightest splash of oar might attract attention that be to row easier for present in quarter of hour wall of forest ceased hundred yard farther saw house two three dim light be visible sound of voice must be heard boat head be now turned out somewhat farther into stream so a to be out of sight of anyone who might by chance come down late to draw water after rowing hundred yard must dimly make out outline of white house there be break just in center outline of tree must be seen above roof dick leant forward again touched lieutenant must be house sir whispered mr ferguson nodded without speaking after boat have gone hundred yard line of forest must again be seen boat be rowed into bank two minute later shot through narrow channel entered creek forty yard wide now can give way again lad hour paddling in sampan must mean about three mile after twenty minute sharp rowing men be ordered to row easy again lieutenant dick kept anxious lookout ahead creek be here little more than fifty yard across accustomed a eye be to darkness presently saw that widened out suddenly word be passed down for men to paddle easily in two minute pool opened before must not make out prahus lying a did against shadow of tree on farther side must see number of light apparently from swinging lantern hear loud murmur of voice easy lieutenant ordered now back very quietly now pull bow noiselessly boat be brought round head directed to right hand bank have passed sharp bend nearly mile back lieutenant said look out for landing place at deepest point of curve harris aye aye sir coxswain said standing up minute later brought boat alongside at point be free from bush where bank be two foot above water edge chapter vii now mr balderson take harper winthorpe make way through jungle a noiselessly a possible be probable that path run within fifty yard of point possibly be only dozen when have found send winthorpe back to with news take that long coil of thin rope be in bow pay out a go along might get lost even within two yard of stream must be dangerous to call whistle will enable to join leave musket behind lad must only be in way in jungle have pistol cutlass take lantern winthorpe harper do take rope fasten one end to thwart before start without knowing might drag after dick led way others following close behind a soon a be among tree be obliged to take lantern for darkness be so intense that must not see inch before must have be torn to piece by thorny creeper have tried to penetrate without light a be received several nasty scratch must hear muttered exclamation from men behind creeping under of rattan making detour to avoid others cutting of smaller one in two with cutlas made way forward be delighted indeed when after proceeding twenty yard came upon edge of what looked like ditch be knew native path here be lad exclaimed in low tone thank goodness have not have to go farther so say sir one of men grumbled if have not be for lantern must have be torn to piece a be aint sure whether eye aint gone nose cheek be scratched a if have be fighting with mad cat here winthorpe take lantern make way back darken a soon a get through to edge of creek can not go wrong with cord to guide two three minute later dick saw light approaching again lieutenant coxswain two bluejacket joined winthorpe having be left a boat keeper now harris do one of others go on ahead will follow fifty yard behind if hear anyone coming give low whistle will then turn off light can walk on confidently for there be chance of of prickly creeper running across path when see tree be getting thinner that there be opening before stop send back word to so that can shut up lantern before joining lieutenant headed party now followed by dick held lantern close to ground bottom be like jungle path worn perfectly smooth by passage of barefooted native nothing must be better said in low voice to dick ought to be able to haul gun along here at trot opening be wide enough on side for gun carriage to be carried along without difficulty in ten minute one of men ahead came back have got to end of path sir end on bank of pool saw ahead lantern be now extinguished party hurried forward on reaching bank found that path ended a have expected just opposite village prahus lay somewhat to right must not be better lieutenant whispered now let see whether can find suitable place for gun be much easier than have expected for tree be cleared probably to furnish firewood for distance of fifteen yard from bank between cleared place water be fringe of thick bush will do capitally lad now will be off at once have found out that wanted nothing must be more satisfactory retraced step rapidly till came to coil of cord looped on low bough coxswain took down be soon on board boat again now lad row a noiselessly a can to mouth of pool again then turn lay on oar except bow two who be to paddle very slowly hand mr balderson that twenty foot bamboo want to sound river a come back a soon a boat be again turned dick took pole standing up thrust down into water only about seven foot sir whispered be bad be evident that ship can not get up here still may a well go on sounding water be gradually deepening dick said thrusting pole down again there be nearly ten foot be not long before announced fifteen at continued until reached entrance to creek where be only fourteen foot must be touch go there lieutenant said dare say must be pushed through be very unfortunate that there be that willow bar side of pool now lad can lay out for ten minute then can fasten up to bough see what be in hamper have done work earlier than have expected can take easy steward have provided with ample store of food men ate hunk of cold meat bread passed round pannikin of grog with great contentment while officer divided cold chicken bottle of claret now men lieutenant said when have finished can have quarter of hour smoke must open lantern in bottom of boat hold jacket over to prevent light falling on of when men have lit pipe lantern be passed aft while coxswain put jacket over lieutenant lit cigar smoke balderson yes sir began when came up river doctor said be good thing to keep off miasma very well then light up think that be good thing have done very satisfactory night work think see way now to getting rid of most of piratical craft will not only be benefit to trader on coast of river will greatly please other chief will enable to hold own against sehi five minute be added to promised quarter then pipe be laid down boat proceeded at steady stroke until reached spot where have fished somewhere about here lad yes sir think that be just place noticed that tall tree rising above general line just opposite where be anchored then lower grapnel in oar bottle be produced from hamper lieutenant filled wine glass full drank off then passed glass over to dick what be sir be grog with large dose of quinine doctor begged to give hour two before daylight now lad be to take glass of will protect against effect of

into pool fought out with there still may be that will be best in end for must hardly have counted upon sinking whole of once past must have be off like wind though might have followed of others must have made off one way whereas by laying vessel across mouth of creek have good chance of catching a come down there be doubt lot more fellow have arrived to help rajah can see that there be great many more about on shore than there have be before think thing will come to crisis before many hour have passed have made out that men keep coming going behind row of six hut facing river must not be surprised if be not hard at work establishing battery there presently two malay whom recognized a belonging to rajah council advanced to edge of shore be fifty yard away one of held pole to white cloth be attached have message from rajah shouted out captain sent for interpreter went to side of quarterdeck rajah say that doe not want to have more to say to want to take country will not let have if go away in hour will sink ship tell captain said that will be worse for if try came up here at invitation will stay just a long a please two malay retired walking in quiet dignified way news soon ran through ship of defiance have be given excited liveliest satisfaction men be shaking hand cutting caper indulging in much joking laughter hour later there be sudden uproar in town drum be beaten horn sounded malay by river bank speedily retired behind hut have better get magazine opened mr ferguson everything in readiness wo beat to quarter till begin tumult on shore increased soon few shot be fired from behind house wall ball whistling overhead there wo be much of that captain said a walked up down quarterdeck with first lieutenant have seen very few gun among must doubt if there be hundred in town what there be be doubt captured from trading vessel scoundrel have plundered burned few minute later bamboo forming wall of six house where bustle have be observed fell outward lashing having be cut by swarm of malay who a soon a last fell ran back showing eight brass cannon beat to quarter mr ferguson captain said quietly at first tap of drum sailor who have be expecting order ran to station a gained little battery on shore opened fire although distance be hundred yard only three of ball hit hull others passing through mast load with grape captain ordered captain hugeson said to marine officer will place men on poop tell to open fire a soon a gun send malay flying from battery can see that there be large number gathered round mr ferguson will see that gun be laid on battery when be ready fire broadside will clear place out at once two minute later there be crash a whole of gun on starboard side be discharged at same moment effect be tremendous storm of grape swept away whole of building beneath gun be standing three of be dismounted not one of men who have be crowded round remained on foot number be seen running away in direction volley from marine brought several of down there be end to attack captain said quietly order men to load with shell to direct aim in first place at rajah palace there be occasion for rapid firing gun after gun sent messenger into palace in three four minute flame be seen rising from order be then given to fire with grape at house facing water in meantime men be called from gun on port side boat lowered marine sailor save serving starboard gun took place in first lieutenant taking command on word being given dashed with cheer towards shore leaping out formed up led by officer ran forward not shot being fired by malay a did so fire of ship gun be now directed towards portion of town facing forest a be here that malay must probably be gathered port fire have be distributed among landing party a be lost to sight a entered town on board ship watched eagerly for sound of combat nothing however be heard for minute two then came single shot then rattle of musketry be making stand now captain said mr hopkins will please go round tell gunner to be very careful in aim let watch smoke rising among house aim short distance beyond impress upon that be better to fire too far than to risk hurting own men order be obeyed soon flame be seen to rise beyond spot where fighting be going on resistance to advance speedily ceased dropping fire took place of sustained roll of musketry five minute later broke out again at edge of town facing wood fire of gun be now directed against edge of forest to malay have evidently fled in few minute smoke began to rise round place showing that men with port fire be at work in quarter of hour bluejacket marine be seen issuing from house coming down to shore place be by time sheet of fire lightly built hut dried in heat of sun catching like tinder blazing up in fierce flame that in few minute left vestige behind ship fire have by time ceased sailor a looked out of porthole cheered a boat came up appearance be far le orderly than have be when put off from ship man having carted off sort of loot sarong spear kris other article obtained from hut others thrown away by malay in flight there be too article of european manufacture have be carried off from palace before flame have obtained entire possession be in strong proof that rajah prahus have be engaged in piratical attack upon european craft for consisted of bale of silk chronometer watch double barreled gun mirror other article have evidently formed portion of ship fitting casualty mr ferguson captain asked a lieutenant stepped on board dozen spear wound sir only one of serious nature fire be too hot for to face what do suppose loss have be a far a can judge sir eighty ninety be killed by fire at least a many must have fallen in battery place be choked up with dead have brought eight gun off be only four pounder may be useful for boat see men have brought off good deal of rubbish have better give order whatever there be be to be fairly divided among hand article more valuable than rest have better be put up to auction fetch also divided among men be malay in force place swarmed with sir be evidently demoralized by fire of gun attack be really feeble only trouble have be that must shut up in house looked at first a if really meant to fight directly shell began to fall behind fire broke out lost heart altogether made bolt for forest well work have be thoroughly done mr ferguson sehi have have lesson that wo forget now have to tackle fleet everything be ready sir have got sledge made for two gun store of long bamboo for carriage anything else may want to take with will be more serious business by long way captain said men have better take hundred round of ammunition with must be a well to take few box of spare cartridge men not occupied in dragging cannon carrying carriage must take up a many round of shell a possible eight ten round of grape for gun have got sack ready for forming battery will be absolutely necessary for protection of men firing of prahus have probably got at least dozen small gun must be hardly possible to work piece unless men be protected from concentrated fire tell chief engineer steam must be got up by six o'clock in meantime let slow fire be kept up towards edge of forest just shot five minute will be enough to show be still here have not done with yet when place cool down bit will send party on shore to keep up dropping fire against forest so induce to believe that mean to attack there chapter viii during rest of day preparation be actively carried on for night work fifty marine hundred bluejacket be to take part in landing expedition ammunition to be carried be ranged along deck men told off for various work there be to be done being allotted to carry stretcher surgical requirement for wounded first lieutenant be to command party having with third lieutenant master mate two senior midshipman besides of course marine officer dr horsley be also to accompany cartridge be made up with powder musket bullet for two of brass gun captured in order that if malay succeeded in landing might meet with hot reception be decided that carriage must be taken for that must be simply laid on sandbag party on shore have kept up fire day at forest yell of defiance at time rose showed that malay be in great force round edge towards evening on shore returned to ship a soon a became absolutely dark anchor chain be unshackled buoy being attached to end be noiselessly lowered into water then screw began to revolve vessel gradually backed down river light have be extinguished sound from forest showed that movement have be observed mile lower down ship be turned screw began to revolve more rapidly at half speed ran down to junction of two branch of river steamed up other arm until within mile so of village at mouth of creek then light anchor be let go boat be lowered landing party took place in oar be muffled keeping close to right bank of river rowed up until past village then crossing entered mouth of creek rowed up until reached spot where landing have be effected on previous night dozen men provided with well greased saw first landed under dick balderson command cleared passage six foot wide to path then landing began in earnest gun be first put on shore carried bodily to path rest of marine bluejacket then landed carrying in addition to arm ammunition gun cartridge box of rifle ammunition couple of empty sack a fast a landed proceeded up path dick balderson led way men be directed to step a closely a must to other a arrived near pool deposited burden then went back to assist to drag up gun carriage scarcely sound be heard during operation foot fell noiselessly on soft earth of track one few yard away must have guessed that hundred fifty men be engaged in laborious toil there be far more noise than there have be night before on board prahus incessant jabber being maintained voice rang high in excitement a men discussed destruction of town order have be received for portion of to land on following morning take part in annihilation of white if entered into forest a soon a two heavy gun be placed upon carriage just behind screen of bush greater portion of men be sent back a far a point where have landed there to fill sack with earth from bank of river number of shovel having be brought for purpose several large bundle of bamboo cut into length six foot long sharpened at end have be among article taken up to battery while most of men be engaged filling carrying sack of earth be employed in constructing chevaux de frise ten pace on side of spot where battery be being constructed bamboo be set diagonally foot half into soft earth bound together by being lashed to strong pole running along fence extended from edge of bush by water to tree forest behind be so thick entangled with creeper that there be little fear of attack being made from quarter accustomed to work in darkness sailor have difficulty in carrying out operation before morning broke battery be complete be six foot high on side facing water with two embrasure for gun four foot high on side covered by chevaux de frise front face be twenty five foot in length side forty morning be breaking a work be finished bread cold meat be served out with full ration of grog by time be consumed be broad daylight for there be little twilight so near equator now for dick harry parkhurst said a lieutenant gave signal for to rise take place filing out of battery marine lined bank on one side sailor other than who be to work gun on other of sailor climbed over front wall with jackknife cut away bough in front of gun there be silence on board prahus where malay have dropped off to sleep couple of hour before daylight mr ferguson superintended laying of gun seeing that be most carefully trained upon waterline of prahu a distance be seventy eighty yard have little doubt that two vessel aimed at must be sunk at once when be thoroughly satisfied drew back gave order to fire two report sounded a if one be mingled with explosion of shell a struck prahus exactly on waterline there be momentary silence then wild hubbub of yell of surprise fury while loud cheer broke from british a saw success of shot almost instantly two craft struck began to settle down in minute disappeared water being covered with head of crew who be swimming to other prahus gun of have evidently be kept loaded for before two eighteen pounder be again ready fire be opened by four craft one two ball striking sandbag while rest went crashing into forest behind shot from british gun struck prahus none effected such damage a first two fired be taking to boat ferguson doctor who be standing beside said yes fancy have thought of giving up at present be going to make dash at can still work gun spare amount of men to attack next minute indeed dozen boat crammed with men shot round from behind prahus grape now lieutenant ordered while at same moment marine seaman who have hitherto be silent opened fire from under bush beneath be enabled to obtain view of what be going on two of boat be sunk by discharge of grape others without checking course pushed on quick lad give round before be too late gun be loaded with incredible quickness two more of boat be shattered swarthy occupant striking out for shore making for most part towards battery a did boat twenty of sailor a many marine be at once called in from bank to aid in defense of battery desperate conflict be presently raging here along bank malay swarming up striving to force way up through embrasure to climb sandbag a fast a did so be cut down bayoneted by defender trying to land at other point be impeded by bush number be killed pressed on so furiously that at last mr ferguson who have be moving backwards forward along line thought best to call men in in minute two whole party be collected in little fort ranged along side with furious yell malay came on although swept by volley of musketry reached bamboo strove in vain to pluck up climb in meantime eighteen pounder have never ceased fire sailor working steadily regardless of fight be going on on flank here little brass gun did good service time be fired recoil sent tumbling from top of sandbag only however to be seized sponged loaded by four sailor in charge of then lifted to place again crammed with bullet to muzzle in readiness to check next charge of malay suddenly yell redoubled be answered by similar shout from forest rajah troop have come up first lieutenant said to marine officer position be getting serious do think that must make way back to boat without great loss have sunk two of craft have badly damaged others inflicted very heavy loss on must be very risky operation might be done ferguson listen there be fresh outburst of shout time on path by have come evidently number of newly arrived malay have struck into by other track from town settle lieutenant said shortly must fight out here be lucky have fair stock of ammunition can keep up for hour yet see sailor have not have to use pistol yet will astonish fellow if do manage to scale sandbag for half hour fighting continued again again malay fell back only to return to attack with fresh fury defender have be obliged to betake more than once to pistol two heavy gun be now removed from position to side for attack by boat have ceased entirely destruction of prahus be of le importance than defense of little fort from attack on flank operation began just a malay made one of retreat by time returned gun be placed in new position muzzle peeping out from among sandbag while embrasure on water face have be closed by bag taken from upper line effect of fire at such close quarter be to drive malay flying into forest shortly afterwards sound of chopping be heard beggar be trying to cut path through jungle to rear dick harry parkhurst said obstinate brute think much of harry will get on well enough until arrive within twenty thirty yard of when can pepper so hotly that will soon get sick of at moment there be report of heavy gun shell crashed through forest fifty yard in rear of fort loud yell of rage alarm rose from malay while hearty cheer broke from defender of fort closely following came sound of gun then rain of grape of whistled over fort keep yourselves well down behind sandbag men lieutenant ferguson shouted captain know that have shelter will sweep malay out of forest round that shot must have done great execution among malay on path between boat gun of ship kept up heavy fire searching wood for distance round with shell pouring volley of grape into tree near battery presently fire ceased fancy have bolted dick comrade said after first five minute have not heard sound wonder what prahus be doing minute later lieutenant said mr morrison take dozen men make way along path until get to boat hope have escaped if be within hail go on board report to captain that have sunk two of prahus that for present malay who have be attacking have made off say that large number of have gone on board four prahus that be about to open fire upon again a soon a mate have left party of men be set to work to shift gun to old position fire be again opened upon piratical prahus who replied a before with little gun very few minute later shell flew overhead fell in water near where craft be anchored followed quickly intense excitement be manifest on board prahus almost immediately cable be cut oar got out at great rate started down creek place have got too hot for altogether harry think better to run gauntlet of ship gun than to be sunk at mooring scarcely have prahus issued from pool than gun of ship be heard be afraid that of will get away beggar row so fast that there wo be time to give more than one broadside a pas if ship be aground be likely enough for captain pushed up farther than thought possible will be pretty safe when have once got past presently gun be heard to fire in rapid succession loud yell cry followed then came shout of triumph defiance then be still save that few cannon shot be discharged at regular interval have got one of gun round to fire over stern dick there have stopped now evidently prahus have got round next corner be pity that of must have escaped must not have done so if serpent have remained at mouth of creek suppose captain became anxious at continuation of heavy firing here so came up to help be lucky did so for though might have beaten off be in such tremendous force fancy must have gone hard with in long run be beginning to think so harry dr horsley have be busy enough from time that fighting began in earnest ten men have be killed by ball have passed through embrasure by kris lance wound twenty eight others have be more le severely wounded quarter of hour after firing ceased captain forrest with mate rowed into pool in one of cutter landed at end of path close to battery congratulate on success mr ferguson said shaking hand with first lieutenant have be very hot affair by mr morrison report be just a well that decided to change plan come up to aid though have resulted in two of prahus getting away then sank two of sir indeed only sank one third went down just after saw come out from pool certainly have not hit so that honor of accounting for three out of six of craft fall to party well doctor what be report be afraid be bad one serious indeed went on after have received figure still be much le than might have be expected from attacking host of pirate be glad to hear that none of officer be dangerously wounded parkhurst have forearm laid open with cut from kris balderson have one of spear through ear dr horsley said if have be inch more to left must probably have killed lieutenant somers of marine be more badly hurt spear having gone through thigh cut artery luckily doctor be close to at moment clapped on tourniquet then cut down to artery tied a say ' delay of two minute must have be up with young fellow ' be boat safe sir boat keeper pushed off little way when firing began in forest when heard shout of large party of enemy coming along path went out almost into middle of creek be well did for many of malay came down through path cut must have riddled with spear have be within reach boat keeper acted very wisely of got into gig towed other boat astern so that if malay came along either in prahus in boat must have cut adrift made race of down to ship well think that there be nothing more to be done here men may a well have tot of grog served out then sailor can march down to landing place bring up boat take gun what ammunition have left on board mr morrison will go back with to ship have one of arm broken by ball from prahus did not know that be wounded sir did not report must not have sent if have known be just a well a be ferguson will give opportunity of specially recommending for promotion in report assistant surgeon temporarily bandaged arm when reached ship be afloat sir want back a soon a possible will have to get out anchor heave on put on full head of steam drove two three hundred yard through mud before finally brought up wanted to get a near to a possible in order to clear wood round by two o'clock whole ship company be on board again set to work to get off be not until after hour exertion that serpent be again afloat be at once turned round steamed down to mouth of creek cast anchor opposite village chapter ix party landed at village next morning found entirely deserted be most important that must take prisoner ferguson captain said a first lieutenant paced up down quarterdeck must catch two prahus if can at present know whether have gone up down river must be absolutely useless for to wait until get clew to whereabouts after have finished with will go up other branch try to find two know to be up there must not like to leave work unfinished certainly not sir be afraid though be of use landing to try to get hold of prisoner doubt wood be full of there be townspeople who came to help though many of who tried to swim ashore from sunken boat may have be taken by alligator still greater portion must have landed right must think mr ferguson that must be good plan to send party of twenty men on shore after to distribute two men to hut possibly two three of malay may come down to village before morning either to fetch valuable may have left behind to see whether be still here may come tonight may come time tomorrow crawling through plantation behind house at rate will wait here day two on chance whom will send with men sir have better send parkhurst balderson will have more authority among men than younger midshipman men better take three day cooked provision on shore ten small keg of water one for hut will give parkhurst instruction before land now mr parkhurst said when boat be lowered soon after dark must bear in mind that greatest vigilance will be necessary choose ten hut close together one man in hut must be always awake there must be talking above whisper during daytime one must leave hut on account after nightfall mr balderson will move from hut to hut to see that vigilant watch be kept must of course take watch watch night day must remember that not only be most important that native must be captured must be on guard against attack on yourselves be quite conceivable that party may come down to see if there be of in village in case of attack must gather in one hut fire three shot a signal to musket shot will be fired in return when hear man must throw down for gun will be already loaded with grape will fire broadside towards spot where have heard signal a soon a broadside be fired make down to shore occupy house close to water keep malay off till boat come ashore to fetch off crew have be very carefully picked have consulted warrant officer have selected most taciturn men in ship there be to be smoking of course men can chew a much a like smell of tobacco smoke must at once deter native from entering hut if malay must come in try to escape must be fired on a run away men be to aim at leg instruction be carried out small hole be bored in back of of hut so that constant watch must be kept up unseen by closest observer in forest hundred yard behind night passed off quietly a did next day men slept watched by turn on afternoon of second day native be seen moving cautiously from tree to tree along edge of forest a soon a be dark dick whose watch be crawled cautiously from hut to hut that fellow saw today may come at moment said if one of see coming other must place close to door if enters throw upon hold arm tightly till others come up to help keep rope handy to twist round remember fellow be a slippery a eel having made round returned to hut in center of others that harry occupied hour later heard sudden outcry from hut next to rushing in found two men there struggling with malay with aid be speedily bound then men be called from other hut whole party ran down to water edge where harry hailed ship boat put off at once be taken on board prisoner be led to captain cabin there examined through medium of interpreter refused to answer question until by captain order be taken on deck again noose placed round neck interpreter told that unless spoke be to be hauled up to yard arm man be still silent tighten strain very gradually captain said to sailor holding other end of rope raise two three foot above deck then when doctor hold up hand lower at once again be done man though half strangled be still conscious on noose being loosened soh hay saying that unless spoke must be again run up said a soon a got breath that must answer question on being taken to cabin said that prahus have gone down river have ascended other arm have only gone few mile above town for one have be so injured that there have be difficulty in keeping afloat be necessary to run into creek in order to repair before going up farther hour later steam be up before morning serpent lay off mouth of creek malay pointed out a one that prahu have entered second officer be time placed in command of boat going in launch third officer took first cutter two midshipman second time be lost in making preparation for be desirable to capture prahu before be aware that serpent have left position in other river for mile boat rowed up creek narrowed until be obliged to go in single file widened suddenly a launch dashed through shower of ball tore up water round while at same moment great tree fell across creek completely barring retreat narrowly shaving stern of midshipman boat be last in line fortunately launch have escaped serious injury with shout of treachery lieutenant hopkins drew pistol to put ball through head of guide a did so man sprang overboard dived towards shore row men have work cut out for there be three prahus ahead steer for center one coxswain with cheer men bent to oar dashed at prahu a be evident by patch of plank freshly fastened to side be one of have before escaped follow lieutenant shouted to boat behind must take one by one three boat dashed at pirate craft be crowded with men regardless of fire from other two vessel launch steered for stem first cutter for bow while midshipman swept round boarded on opposite side furious contest took place on deck malay being so confused by being assailed at three point simultaneously that midshipman party be enabled to gain footing with very slight resistance shout of malay near brought many running from other point party there gained footing with comparatively little loss then desperate struggle began malay be unable to withstand furious attack of british ere long began to leap overboard swim to other craft be coming to aid launch gun have not be fired calling to dick harry leaped down into boat two midshipman trained gun upon nearest prahu aiming at waterline fired when craft be within twenty foot of moment later impetus brought against side of launch be crushed like eggshell between captured prahu two midshipman springing on board just in time be malay turn to board now that of british to prevent musketry of sailor marine for time kept enemy off strove desperately to gain footing on board until loud cry be heard craft into midshipman have fired sank suddenly loud cheer broke from british two midshipman be engaged with other pirate from whom cry of dismay arose at seeing disappearance of friend now lad follow harry shouted a malay strove to push craft away followed by dozen sailor leaped on to deck effort of malay succeeded in thrusting vessel apart in vain midshipman follower fought desperately harry be felled by blow with war club dick cut down with kris seaman be killed others jumped overboard swam back to vessel lieutenant hopkins shouted to men to take to boat two cutter be speedily manned one however be in sinking condition lieutenant hopkins with other started in pursuit of prahu whose crew have already got oar out in spite of effort of sailor soon left behind pursuit be evidently hopeless reluctantly lieutenant ordered men to row back on returning to scene of combat saw sunk near bank fourth of prahus spy be so far right second lieutenant muttered fellow did sink now must see that doe more mischief brought captured prahu alongside others whose deck be foot two below water fired several shot through bottom then set captured craft on fire took to boat with great difficulty forced way under fallen tree rowed back to ship third lieutenant have be shot dead twelve men have be killed ten of midshipman party be missing of rest few have escaped without wound more le serious harry be first to recover sens being roughly brought to by bucket of water being dashed over looked round deck of who have sprung on board with none be visible save dick balderson who be lying near with cloth tightly bound round shoulder a rose into sitting position murmur of satisfaction broke from malay standing near be time before must rally sens suppose thought at last be keeping for torture a hostage rajah may have given order that officer captured be to be spared brought to know what expectation be muttered to if expects to be reinstated a rajah perhaps compensated for loss of palace be likely to be mistaken in case will go mighty hard with for there be shadow of doubt that be savage cruel brute have now shaken off numbness caused by blow that have received managed to stagger to where dick be lying knelt beside begged malay to bring water have evidently received order to do must to revive two young officer one at once brought gourd full harry have already assured that friend heart still beat began by pouring water between lip be not necessary to pour over head for have already received same treatment a dick old chap said sharply earnestly sound be evidently heard understood for dick started slightly opened eye murmured be not time to turn out yet be not in hammock dick have be wounded be prisoner in hand of malay try pull together move have put sort of bandage round shoulder be going to try improve be matter with shoulder dick murmured chopped with kris old man now be going to turn on side then cut sleeve off jacket take drink of water then will set about dick did a be ordered be evidently coming back to consciousness for looked round then said where be other fellow know what have become of think went down before did however here be alone now be going to begin cut off sleeve of jacket shirt at shoulder ripped open seam to neck first taking off rough bandage be nasty cut old man said nothing dangerous must say fancy have gone clean through shoulder bone there be doubt that will knit again a hassan did if do give time rolled shirt sleeve into pad saturated with water laid on wound see know about dick said cheerily from having watched doctor at work on hassan now will tear cloth into strip first placed strip of cloth over shoulder crossed under arm then took end of bandage across chest back tied under other arm repeated process with dozen other strip then placed dick hand upon chest tied of other strip together bound tightly round arm body so that movement of limb be possible one of malay knelt down gave assistance nodded approvingly when have finished then helped harry raise into sitting position against bulwark be better dick said a far a go how be fellow did not kill at once expect rajah have ordered that officer who may fall into hand be to be kept a hostage so that can open negotiation with skipper if get what want hand back if not there be manner of doubt that will put out of way without compunction men be still working at oar for four hour rowed without intermission through labyrinth of creek at last stopped before small village tied prahu up to tree then man who seemed to be captain went ashore with two three others lad heard loud outburst of anger voice recognized a of rajah storming raging for time then hubbub ceased hour later rajah came on board with two three attendant man whom recognized a speaking certain amount of english rajah scowled at from manner in kept fingering kris saw that needed great effort on part to abstain from killing at once spoke for time in own language interpreter translated be dog countryman rajah be sending message to captain to tell that must build up palace again pay for warship that have destroyed provide with guard against enemy until fresh fleet have be built if refuse to do will be killed tell harry said that if be dog anyhow have shown that can bite a to what say be for captain to answer think that will grant term though possibly may consent to spare rajah life to go away with ship if be sent back to without injury rajah uttered scornful exclamation have six thousand men said need to beg life for be there twenty ship instead of one must never find not man who landed tried to come through country must return alive have given captain chance if at end of three day answer doe not come granting command will be krised keep strict watch upon captain kill at once if try to escape will guard safely rajah captain who from rich material of sarong jacket be evidently chief said quietly a to escape where must go must wander in jungle until died by night lad felt more have be well supplied with food though harry head ached until a said be splitting dick wound smarted severely be able to discus position at once agreed that escape be impossible must be even be well strong must manage to obtain possession of sampan for must lose in labyrinth of creek must moreover be certain to be overtaken by native boat must be sent off in direction after there be nothing to do to wait for captain answer dick said at last know what will be harry said will tell chief that must be impossible for to grant command that be ready to pay certain sum for release that if harm come to will make peace with chief who have assisted sehi against on condition of hunting down sending alive dead to ship rascal know that must hide in swamp for month will proceed to chop off head without moment delay must keep eye open tomorrow endeavor to get hold of couple of weapon be deal better to die fighting than be to have throat cut like sheep chapter x next two day passed quietly lad be great deal better agreed that if must almost certainly not be case mean of escape must present must seize chance however hopeless might be for at worst must be cut down in attempting chance however presented two malay always squatted near eye followed movement time tomorrow messenger will return harry said be clear to that only chance be to escape before morning fellow will be watchful till night be nearly over now propose just before first gleam of daylight throw upon suddenly seize kris cut down then leap on shore dash into jungle night will be a dark a pitch what with there being moon with mist from swamp at rate might get out of sight before malay knew what have happened must either go straight into jungle crawl into thick bush lie there until morning then make start what must think be even better take to water wade along under bank till reach one of sampan fifty yard away get in manage to paddle noiselessly across to opposite side lift craft out of water hide among bush then be off worst of be alligator harry yes must risk that will have kris if seize of other must go down try jab kris into beast eye know be frightfully dangerous business chance be one hundred to one against succeeding there be just chance there be chance at if leave until tomorrow of course if succeed in getting over to other side must wait close to water until daylight must tear to piece if tried to make through jungle in dark tell must give better chance might take off two three yard of bandage of yours cut strip in half twist into rope then when fellow doze off little might throw thing round neck must be up with see have only one arm harry bother never thought of well might do securing one fellow first then other must get close to if move catch up kris cut down yes must do well anyhow harry can try anything be better than waiting here hour after hour for messenger to come back with what will be death warrant agreed to keep awake by turn accordingly lay down a soon a became dark malay a usual squatting at distance of couple of pace side of be about two o'clock in morning when dick who be awake saw a supposed one of crew standing up few yard away be not sure for just at moment figure disappeared what on earth must fellow want to stand up for lie down again for can swear be not there minute ago there be farther on pinched to make sure that be awake figure after figure seemed to flit along deck disappear one of guard rose stretched arm put fresh bit of herb that be chewing into mouth moved close to prisoner to see if be asleep then resumed former position during time that be on foot dick noticed that phenomenon have so puzzled ceased quarter of hour later began again touched harry keeping hand on lip a warning to be silent suddenly wild yell broke on still air in instant deck be alive with men a two malay watcher rose to foot be cut down there be sound of heavy blow scream yell short confused struggle fall of heavy body while from little village there be also sound of conflict midshipman have started to foot half bewildered at sudden desperate struggle when hand be laid on of shoulder voice said english friend have come revulsion of feeling be so great that for minute neither must speak then dick said chief thank with heart tomorrow must have be killed chief shook hand with warmly having seen that mode of salutation on board ship hassan glad said hassan watch time let sehi kill friend friend save hassan child save torch be now lighted deck be thickly encumbered with dead for one of crew of prahu have be killed sehi killed too chief said come see swung on boy followed example two of malay helping dick down went to village where number of malay be moving about torch have be brought from ship score of soon lit up scene two of rajah men have be killed outside hut majority have fallen inside chief asked question of one of follower who pointed to hut entered by light of torch saw rajah lying dead upon ground hassan said something to one of men who with single blow chopped off rajah head send to chief hassan said if not see not think dead much afraid of when know dead not fight more make peace quick one of men asked question lad limited knowledge of language be sufficient to tell that be asking whether must fire village hassan shook head many men said waving arm to forest see fire come fight plenty of fight be need for more for time stood with in front of pool series of splash in water told what be going on prahu be being cleared of load of dead body then several men filled bucket with water handed up to deck boy knew that attempt be being made to wash away blood process be repeated dozen time while be

not to go beyond sound of bugle of course knew that if intended to get sport must go further afoot than merely used to say right sir will keep ear to camp on part never considered necessary to ask where game appeared on table came from in point of fact never went very far servant always have instruction way to send for if be wanted while a to dacoit did not believe in having impudence to come in broad daylight within mile two of camp did not often go down face of ghauts shooting be good there be plenty of bear in day needed long day for expedition in view of dacoit who might be scattered about be not sort of thing to be undertaken except with strong party norworthy have not given precise order about must admit that said one day course wo be fool enough to think of going down ghauts hastings did not look at a equivalent to direct order must do now colonel put in on seeing furtive smile on face of male listener however never meant to go down though used to stand on edge look longingly down into bush fancy saw bear moving about in score think must have gone into country if have not come into mine one day fellow who always carried spare gun flask who be sort of shikaree in small way told have heard that farmer whose house stood near edge of ghauts two mile away have be seriously annoyed by fruit corn being stolen by bear `` ll go have look at place tomorrow said 'there

gave shout of triumph be about to climb up when from behind rock on bear have stood appeared growling fiercely on seeing at once prepared to come down stupidly being taken by surprise being new at fired at once at head bear gave spring then seemed instantaneous down came at whether rolled down slipped down ran down know came almost a if have jumped straight at bey gun rahman shouted holding out

who have carried down of party appeared angry at last thing quieted down be carried into tent have fever be suppose delirious for day afterwards found that for fully fortnight have lost consciousness good constitution nursing of woman pulled round when once fever have gone began to mend rapidly tried to explain to woman that if must go up to camp tell where be must be well rewarded although be sure understood shook head by fact that a became stronger two three armed men always hung about tent came to conclusion be sort of prisoner be annoying did not seem serious if people be dacoit a be more likely ally of dacoit must be kept only for ransom exchange moreover felt sure of ability to escape when got strong especially a believed that in young woman who have saved life by bringing down by careful nursing must find friend be pretty uncle mary hastings broke in never mind whether be pretty mary be better than pretty must like to know uncle well except for soft dark eye common to race

of beauty at time know thought charming chapter ii just a be getting strong enough to walk be beginning to think of making escape band of five six fellow armed to teeth came in made sign be to go with be evidently arranged thing girl only be surprised be at once turned out a started must see two crouching figure in shade with cloth over head have native garment thrown over shoulder in five minute after arrival of fellow found on way took six hour before reached destination be one of natural rock citadel have be in usual health must have done distance in hour half have to rest constantly be finally carried rather than helped up have gone not unwillingly for men be clearly by dress dacoit of deccan have doubt that be intended either to ransom exchange at foot of natural castle be twenty

hastings said 'and yours beivajee punt ' said be bad have fallen into hand of most troublesome most ruthless most famous of dacoit leader over over again have be hotly chased have always managed to get away when last heard anything of what be going on four five troop of native police be scouring country after gave order did not understand wretched bombay writer suppose clerk of moneylender be dragged forward sivajee punt spoke to for time fellow then told in english be to write at once to officer commanding troop telling be in hand must be put to death directly be attacked 'ask ' said 'if will take sum of money to let go ' sivajee shook head very decidedly piece of paper be put before pen ink wrote a have be ordered adding however in french have brought into present position by own folly must take chance for well knew importance government attached to sivajee capture read out loud have written in english interpreter translated then paper be folded addressed 'the officer commanding ' be given chupattis drink of water allowed to sleep dacoit have apparently fear of immediate attack be still dark although morning be just breaking when be awakened be got up to citadel be hoisted rather than climbed two men standing above with rope tied round body so be half hauled half pushed up difficult place must have taxed climbing power have be in health height of mass of rock be about hundred foot top be fairly flat with depression rising about eighty foot long by fifty wide have evidently be used a fortress in age past along side facing hill be remains of rough wall in center of depression be cistern four foot square lined with stone work in depression gallery have be cut leading to subterranean storeroom chamber natural fortress rose from face of hill at distance of thousand yard so from edge of plateau be fully two hundred foot higher than top of rock in old day must have be impregnable even at time be awkward place to take for troop be armed only with brown be rifled cannon be not thought of looking round must see be four mile from point where have descended camp be gone running eye along edge of plateau must see top of tent mile to right again two mile to left turning round looking down into wide valley saw regimental camp be evident that vigorous effort be being made to surround capture dacoit since troop have be brought up from bombay in addition to troop above below there must probably be strong police force acting on face of hill did not see thing at time for be a soon a got to top ordered to sit down behind parapet fellow armed to teeth squatting down by signifying that if showed head above stone must cut throat without hesitation there be however sufficient gap between stone to allow to have view of crest of ghaut while below view extended down to hill behind bombay be evident to now why dacoit did not climb up into fortress there be dozen of similar crag on face of ghauts troop did not a yet know whereabouts be sort of blockade of whole face of hill be being kept up there be probably enough several other band of dacoit lurking in jungle there be only two guard on rock plateau discussed with chance of overpowering holding top of rock till help came be greatly weakened be not match for boy much le for two stalwart mahratta besides be by mean sure that way have be brought up be only possible path to top day passed off quietly heat on bare rock be frightful one of men seeing how weak ill really be fetched thick rug from storehouse with aid of stick made sort of lean to against wall under lay sheltered from sun once twice during day heard few distant musket shot once sharp heavy outburst of firing must have be three four mile away be on side of ghaut showed that troop police be at work guard looked anxiously in direction uttered sundry curse when be dusk sivajee eight of dacoit came up from what said gathered that rest of band have dispersed trusting to get through line of pursuer if caught to escape with slight punishment men who remained being too deeply concerned in murderous outrage to hope for mercy sivajee handed letter man who have taken note have brought back in reply major knapp writer who be second in command said that must not engage government that if lieutenant hastings be given up act must certainly dispose government to take most merciful view possible that if on contrary harm be suffered by lieutenant hastings man taken must be at once hung sivajee did not appear put out about think expected other answer imagine that real object in writing be simply to let know be prisoner so enable better to paralyze attack upon position doubt considered impregnable be given food be then allowed to walk a chose upon little plateau two of dacoit taking post a sentry at steepest part of path while rest gathered chatting smoking in depression in front of storehouse be still light enough for to see for distance down face of rock strained eye to see if must discern other spot at ascent descent be possible prospect be not encouraging at place face fell sheer away from edge so evident be impracticability of escape that only place glanced at twice be western side be one away from hill here sloped gradually for few foot took off shoe went down to edge below ten foot be ledge on to with care must get down below be sheer fall of fifty foot a mean of escape be hopeless struck that if attack be made might slip away get on to ledge once there must not be seen except by person standing where now be just on edge of slope spot to be very unlikely that anyone must come thought gave shadow of hope returning to upper end of platform lay down in spite of hardness of rock be soon asleep pain of aching bone woke up several time once just a first tinge of dawn be coming thought must hear movement in jungle raised somewhat saw that sound have be heard by dacoit for be standing listening of be bringing spare firearm from storehouse in evident preparation for attack a afterwards learned police have caught one of dacoit trying to effect escape by mean of little of ingenious torture to indian police then frequently resorted when white officer be absent obtained from exact position of sivajee band learned side from ascent must be made that dacoit band be still upon slope of ghauts knew be gradually narrowing circle there be so many rock hiding place that process of searching be slow one intelligence be so important that news be off at once to colonel who gave order for police to surround rock at daylight to storm if possible garrison be so small that police be alone ample for work supposing that natural difficulty be not altogether insuperable just at daybreak there be distant noise of men moving in jungle dacoit halfway down path fired gun be answered by shout volley dacoit hurried out from chamber lay down on edge where sheltered by parapet commanded path paid attention to kept a far away a possible fire began quiet steady fire shot at time in strong contrast to rattle kept up from surrounding jungle shot must have told a man after man who strove to climb steep path fell lasted only ten minute then be quiet again attack have failed

doing immense damage then have talk with shikaree sent man off to bring provision for people out with then set to work cutting dry stick grass to make circle of fire felt much uneasiness respecting fakir who might be seized at moment by enraged tiger native must not allow that there be cause for fear a tiger must not dare to touch so holy man belief in respect of tiger for sanctity be by mean strong determined to go in warn of presence of brute in wood be mission must not intrust to anyone else for native must have entered jungle for untold gold so mounted begaum again started path leading towards temple be pretty wide a went along almost noiselessly for elephant be too well trained to tread upon fallen stick be just possible might come upon tiger suddenly so kept rifle in readiness in hand presently came in sight of ruin one be at first visible at very moment fakir came out from temple must not see hear for be rather behind still among tree at once proceeded in high voice to break

abode in jungle however have made up mind to see especially a have agreed that must endeavor to persuade to do prediction for so turned horse head towards jungle found fakir sitting on rock in front of temple just where have be seized by tiger rose a rode up ' knew that must come today sahib be joyful in thought of seeing who have preserved life ' 'we be glad to see looking pretty strong again though arm be still in sling ' said for simmonds be not strong in hindustani 'how did know that be coming ' asked when have tied up horse have given to servant to know many thing said quietly 'did know beforehand that tiger be going to seize ' asked knew that great danger threatened that siva must not let die before time have come ' 'must see into future ' asked fakir hesitated looked at for moment earnestly to see if be speaking in mockery then said 'the sahib believe in power of siva of servant call messenger imposter scoff at when speak of event of future 'no indeed ' said friend have idea of scoffing have heard of so many of prediction coming true that be really anxious that must tell something of future ' fakir nodded head went into temple returned in minute two with two small pipe used by native for opium smoking brazier of burning charcoal pipe be already charged made sign to to sit down took place in front of then began singing in low voice rocking to fro waving staff held in hand gradually voice rose gesticulation action became more violent so far a must make out be prayer to siva that must give glimpse of future might benefit sahib who have saved life of servant presently darted forward gave pipe took two piece of red hot charcoal from brazier in finger without seeming to know that be warm placed in pipe then recommenced singing gesticulation glance at

felt drowsiness creeping over saw a through mist fakir swaying backwards forward arm waving face distorted minute pipe slipped from finger fell back insensible how long lay there know woke with strange not unpleasant sensation presently became conscious that fakir be gently pressing with sort of shampooing action temple head when saw that opened eye left performed same process upon charley in few minute rose from stooping position waved hand in token of adieu walked slowly back into temple a disappeared sat up charley did same stared at other for minute without speaking then charley said 'this be rum go mistake old man be right charley opinion be have made fool of ourselves let be off out of staggered to foot for felt like drunken men made way to horse poured mussuk of water over head took drink of brandy from flask then feeling more like mounted rode out of jungle harley if glimpse of futurity have be true can say be that be extremely unpleasant ' be just case charley ' bey dream like to call be about mutiny of men 'you say so charley so be mine be monstrously strange to say least of however tell story first then will tell mine ' be very short ' charley said be at mess not in present mess room be dining with fellow of other regiment suddenly without warning window be filled with crowd of sepoys who opened fire right left into fellow be shot down at once rest of made

inside body of idol made doubt for priest to go up give response through mouth hurried girl through crept in after closed stone just a pursuer came clattering into courtyard be remember ' be monstrously rum ' charley said after pause understand what old fellow be singing about before gave pipe 'yes caught general drift be entreaty to siva to give glimpse of futurity might benefit ' lit cheroot rode for mile at brisk canter without remark when be within short distance of home reined up ' feel ever so much better charley said have got that opium out of head now how do account for harley account for in way charley opium naturally have effect of making dream a took similar dos of same mixture under similar circumstance be scarcely extraordinary that must have effected same portion of brain caused certain similarity in dream in nightmare something terrible happens be on point of happening so be here not unnaturally in case thought turned to soldier if remember there be talk at mess little time since a to what must happen in extremely unlikely event of sepoys mutinying in body have doubt be foundation of dream be natural enough when come to think over calmly think by way have better agree to say nothing at about in regiment must think not charley said must never hear end of must chaff out of life kept secret came at last to laugh over heartily when be together then subject dropped by end of year have a much escaped mind a other dream must have done three month after affair regiment be ordered down to allahabad change of place doubt helped to erase memory of

gave start over other fellow at station half of whom fell straightway in love with month went on when mutiny broke out be engaged to be married be proof of how completely opium dream have passed out of mind of simmonds even when rumor of general disaffection among sepoys began to be current never once recurred to even when news of actual mutiny reached be just a confident a be others of fidelity of own regiment be old story foolish confidence black treachery a at very many other station mutiny broke out when be at mess regiment be dining with th bengalees suddenly just a dinner be over window

really took up pursuit turned off from parade ground dashed down between hedge of two compound in minute be in open country fortunately cavalry be down looting own line must have be overtaken at once

hour till felt quite safe from immediate pursuit then halted in shelter of clump of tree by time have heard may story have felt uneasy at being alone have laughed at for being so until upon speaking to one of servant have answered in tone of gross insolence have astonished at once guessed that there be danger moment that be alone caught up large dark carriage rug wrapped round so a to conceal

have rushed through narrow gorge until in wild freak brought down million of ton of gravel resumed course seventy foot above former level quarter of mile higher up ledge of rock ran across valley over in old time yuba have poured in cascade seventy foot deep into ravine rock now be level with gravel only showing jagged point here there above ledge have be invaluable to digger without must only have sunk shaft with greatest difficulty for gravel must have be full of water even with greatest pain in puddling timber work pump must scarcely have sufficed to keep down a rose in bottom of shaft miner have made common cause together giving so many ounce of gold so many day work have erected dam thirty foot high along ledge of rock have cut channel for yuba along lower slope of valley of course when rain set in a everybody knew dam must go river digging must be abandoned till water subsided fresh dam be made there be two month before yet everyone hoped to be down to bedrock before water interrupted work hillside in yuba valley for distance along pine tree gulch be dotted by shanty tent former constructed for most part of log roughly squared wall being three foot in height on sharp

where bullet have cut furrow in cheek stranger fell back with bullet hole in center of forehead body be carried outside play continued a if interruption have taken place be accustomed to such occurrence in pine tree gulch piece of ground at top of hill have be set aside a burial place be already dotted thickly with graf filled in almost instance by men who have died in local phraseology with boot on then afterwards did red george allude to subject to dick whose life after signal instance of championship be easier than have hitherto be for there be few in pine tree gulch who cared to excite red george anger stranger going to place be sure to receive friendly warning that be best for health to keep temper over shortcoming on part of white faced dick grateful a be for red george

widening out started to run down hill to give alarm before be halfway paused for there be loud shout scene of bustle confusion instantly arose cradle be deserted men working on surface loaded with tool made for high ground while at windlass worked hardest to draw up comrade below man coming down from above stopped close to dick with low cry stood gazing with white scared face dick have worked with be one of company to red george belonged what be saunders god be lost man replied be at windlass when shouted up to to go up fetch bottle of rum have just struck rich wanted drink on strength of dick understood at once red george mate be still in bottom of shaft ignorant of danger be threatening come on cried will be in time yet at top of speed dashed down hill followed by saunders what be what be asked party of men mounting hill red george gang be still below dick eye be fixed on water there be broad band now of yellow with white edge down center of stony flat be widening with terrible rapidity be scarce ten yard from windlass at top of red george shaft when dick followed closely by saunders reached come up mate quick for life river be rising will be flooded out directly everyone else have gone a spoke pulled at rope by bucket be hanging handle of windlass flew round rapidly a descended when have run out dick grasped handle right below answering call came up two began work throwing whole strength into quickly a windlass revolved seemed endless time to dick before bucket came up first man stepped out be not red george dick have hardly expected must be red george must be

without word miner placed facing dick moment bucket be again down three grasped handle quickly a worked edge of water be within few inch of shaft when next man reached surface again bucket descended before rope tightened however water have begun to run over lip at first in mere trickle then almost instantaneously in cascade grew larger larger bucket be halfway up when sound like thunder be heard ground seemed to tremble under foot then at turn of valley above great wave of yellow water crested with foam be seen tearing along at speed of race horse dam have burst saunders shouted run for life be lost three men dropped handle ran at full speed towards shore while loud shout to dick to follow came from crowd of men standing on slope boy grasped handle with lip tightly closed still toiled on slowly bucket ascended for red george be heavy man then suddenly weight slackened handle went round faster shaft be filling water have reached bucket have risen to red george neck so that weight be no longer on rope so fast did water pour in be not minute before bucket reached surface red george sprang out there be time for one exclamation then great wave struck red george be whirled like straw in current be strong swimmer at point where valley widened out mile lower struggled to shore two day later news reached pine tree gulch that boy body have be washed ashore twenty mile down ten men headed by red george went brought solemnly back to pine tree gulch there among stump of pine tree grave be dug there in presence of whole camp white faced dick be laid to rest pine tree gulch be solitude now
