beric briton story of roman invasion by g henty preface dear lad series of story dealing with war of england must be altogether incomplete did not include period when roman be master of country valour with native of island defended be acknowledged by roman historian be only superior discipline of invader enabled finally to triumph over bravery superior physical strength of briton roman conquest for time be undoubtedly of immense advantage to people who have previously wasted energy in perpetual tribal war a introduced among civilization of rome in end however proved disastrous to islander who lost military virtue having be defended from savage of north by soldier of rome briton be when legion be recalled unable to offer effectual resistance to saxon who coming under guise of friendship speedily became master imposing yoke infinitely more burdensome than of rome erasing almost sign of civilization have be engrafted upon how far british population disappeared under subsequent invasion still more oppressive yoke of dane be uncertain a invader must naturally desire to retain people to cultivate land for be probable that great mass of briton be not exterminated be at rate pleasant to believe that with saxon danish norman blood in vein there be still large admixture of of valiant warrior who fought so bravely against caesar who rose under boadicea in desperate effort to shake off oppressive rule of rome yours truly g henty chapter hostage be fair sight may be fair sight in roman eye beric nought must be fouler to of briton to one of block of brick stone weighs down help to hold in bondage land of ours while temple have dared to rear to god in celebration of having conquered britain be insult lie be not conquered yet a will day know to cost be silent wait admit that be conquered agree with there have never fairly tried strength against wretched division have always prevented making effort to gather cassivelaunus of kentish tribe alone opposed at first landing be betrayed abandoned by tribe on north of thames have be same thing ever since fight piecemeal while roman hurl whole strength against one tribe others look on with folded hand who aided trinobantes when roman defeated established on hill one will eat britain up bit by bit then like better for having lived among beric like more fear more one can not be four year among a be without seeing that in many respect might copy with advantage be great people compare splendid mansion regular orderly life manner way with rough hut feast ending a often a not with quarrel brawl look at art power of turning stone into lifelike figure above way in can transfer thought to white leaf so that others many many year hence can read know be passing what men thought did in long bygone truly be marvellous be half romanized beric companion said roughly think not other said quietly must be worse than fool have lived a have done hostage among for four year without seeing that there be much to admire much that must imitate with advantage in life way there be reason because be wiser far more polished in many respect greater people than that must come here to be master thing be desirable be a nothing to freedom have said that like more for being among like more for many reason be grave courteous in manner to other obey own law man have right while yield obedience to superior superior respect right of below highest among can not touch property life of lowest in rank seems to excellent then on other hand blood boil in vein at contempt in hold at greed rapacity brutality denial to of right in eye be savage wild men who may be useful for tilling ground for who if troublesome must be hunted down slain like wild beast admire for what can do respect for power learning hate a oppressor be better beric much better have begun to fear that grand house splendour of roman might have sapped patriotism hate hate change must live a have always lived forget boduoc that ourselves have not be standing still though long past forefather when crossed from gaul wave after wave be rude warrior have be learning ever since from gaul a gaul have learned from roman roman admit that have advanced greatly since day when under caesar first landed here look at town on hill there though 't be roman now 't be not changed so much from what be under great king cunobeline while people have knowledge of many thing of other tribe of iceni knew nothing what good did do other asked scornfully lie prostrate under roman yoke be easy to destroy town while who have few town to destroy live comparatively free look across at camalodunum cunobeline capital where be men who built house who dressed in soft garment who aped roman who regarded a well nigh savage men gone one of hewn down on own hearthstone thrust out with wife family to wander homeless be there one left of in yonder town house be so proud of cultivated field wealth of kind have be seized by roman did fight better for roman fashion not kingdom of cunobeline from thames to western sea fell to piece at touch be only among wild silures that caractacus be able to make great resistance did better boduoc ostorius crushed a easily a claudius crushed trinobantes be use setting against change that urge against trinobantes tribe of kent silures might urge with equal force against must remember that be like not so many age back intercourse of gaul with on eastern sea coast with kentish tribe have changed greatly be no longer like western tribe mere hunter living in shelter of bough roaming forest dress with long mantle loose vest trouser differs a widely from of western tribe a doe from roman live in town if house be rude be solid no longer depend solely on chase till ground have herd of cattle daresay there be many of ancestor who set a much against gaulish custom a do against of roman adopted benefited by though must exult in seeing last roman driven from land must like after departure to see adopt what be good orderly decent in custom law beric companion growled malediction upon everything roman there be one thing certain said after pause must go altogether not only here everywhere must learn a ancestor taught at two first invasion that be hopeless to conquer britain will end by being absolute master of island will be servant slave be true enough beric agreed to conquer must be united not only united steadfast of course have learned much of have be with have come to speak language have listened to talk be not only roman who be here whom have to defeat be who will come after power of rome be great how great can not tell be wonderful almost inconceivable have spread over vast country reducing people everywhere under dominion have seen what call map showing world a far a know well nigh have be conquered by farther away from rome more difficulty have in holding what have conquered be hope here be very far from rome may send army after army against in time will get weary of loss expense when there be so little to gain a after first invasion long time elapsed before again troubled so in end may abandon useless enterprise even now roman grumble at what call exile be obstinate tenacious to rid land of for good must be necessary for not only to be united among when rise against to remain so to oppose with whole force fresh army will bring against know how great difficulty will be boduoc want one great leader whom tribe will follow just a roman legion obey one general what chance be there of such man arising man so great so wise so brave that tribe of britain will lay aside enmity jealousy submit to absolute guidance if wait for beric may wait for ever boduoc said in sombre tone at rate be not while be tranquil under roman heel that man must show if be to come to front must be in day of battle then possibly one chief may rise so high above fellow that may recognize merit agree to follow be so beric agreed be possible that even greatest hero must find support from cassivelaunus be betrayed by trinobantes who must have united tribe more than son of cunobeline who reigned over well nigh britain who be great king ruling wisely well doing in power to raise advance people yet when hour came kingdom broke up into piece veric chief of cantii went to rome invited invader to aid against rival at home not man of iceni brigantes marched to aid of caractacus togodamnus what wonder then that be defeated worse than when caractacus be driven fugitive to hide among brigantes did not queen cartismandua hand over to roman where can hope to find leader more fitted to unite than be caractacus son of king whom at least recognized paid tribute to prince who have learned wisdom from wise father warrior enterprising bold indomitable true patriot if caractacus must not unite what hope be there of finding who must do so moreover position be far worse now than be ten year ago belgae dumnonii in southwest have be crushed after thirty battle dobuni in centre have be defeated garrisoned silures have set example to inflicting many defeat on roman power have at last be broken brigantes ourselves have be heavily struck a deserved boduoc for standing aloof from caractacus at first thus task of shaking off roman bond be far more difficult now than be when plautius landed here twenty year ago well be time for to be going on wo come with boduoc not beric never want to enter town again save with sword in one hand torch in other enrages to see air of superiority give scarce seem even to see a walk in street a to soldier a stride along with helmet shield finger itch to meet in forest promised to walk so far with go farther how long will be there two hour at most must say sun be halfway down beric will wait for till touch that hill over there till then will find sitting by first tree at spot where left forest beric nodded walked on towards town lad for be not yet sixteen be son of parta chieftainess of one of division of great tribe of iceni who occupied tract of country now known a suffolk norfolk cambridge huntingdon tribe have yielded nominal allegiance to cunobeline have held aloof during struggle between caractacus roman when latter have attempted to establish fort in country have taken up arm ostorius scapula roman proprietor have marched against defeated with great slaughter have submitted to roman authority sarci division of tribe to beric belonged have taken leading part in rising father have fallen in defence of intrenchment among british tribe woman ranked with men even when married wife be often acknowledged chief of tribe parta have held equal authority with husband at death remained sole head of subtribe in order to ensure obedience in future ostorius have insisted that only son beric at time boy of eleven must be handed over to a hostage have parta consulted own wish must have retired with few follower to swamp fen of country to north rather than surrender son brigantes who inhabited lincolnshire who ranged over whole of north of britain a far a northumberland have also received defeat at hand of roman might not improbably hand over upon demand therefore resigned to let beric go son said need not tell not to let romanize have be brought up to hate father have fallen before weapon tribe have be slain country lie under foot will not wrong then by fearing for moment that can make roman of have be brought up to lie upon bare ground to suffer fatigue hardship hunger thirst rich food splendid house soft raiment of roman must have attraction for know not how long imprisonment among may last for present have little hope of rising must see prospect of anything like unity among people will send boduoc with message to to hold in readiness to escape when receive signal that time have come till then employ mind in gaining what good may by residence among there must be advantage in method of warfare have enabled people of one city to conquer world be not strength for be pigmy to stand full head above even woman be stronger than roman soldier yet defeat learn then language throw whole mind into at first then study military discipline law must be last a much a discipline have made ruler over so vast empire find out if can secret of rule study training by soldier move fight a if bound together by cord forming massive wall against break in vain heed not art pay attention to luxury did cunobeline good did not for day delay destruction fell upon kingdom what need be first knowledge of military tactic so that may drive from land secondly knowledge of law that may rule ourselves wisely after have gone what there be good in rest may come in time however kind may be to bear always in mind that be prisoner among oppressor of country that though for reason of policy may treat well yet that mercilessly despoil ill treat countryman remember too beric that briton now that caractacus have be sent prisoner to rome need leader one who be not only brave valiant in fight who can teach people how to march to victory can order rule well afterwards be part of one of greatest tribe from among if anywhere such leader must come have great hope of beric know that be brave for single handed slew with arrow great wolf other day bravery be common to think that there be coward in tribe believe be intelligent consulted old druid in forest last week prophesied high destiny for when messenger brought roman summons for to deliver up a hostage seemed to that be of thing one must fit best for future rule be not ambitious for beric must be nought to if be king of briton be of country that think need great leader prayer to god be that one may be found if must be man so much better if not let be comport among independently a one who will day be chief of british tribe be not sullen obstinate mix freely with learn language gather be law under live see how build wonderful house of theirs watch soldier at exercise so that when return among can train sarci to fight in similar manner keep one purpose always in mind exercise muscle daily for among man can lead who be not a strong a brave a best who follow bear so that will be in good favour with men beric have to best of power carried out instruction of mother be object of roman always to win over adversary if possible boy have reason to complain of treatment be placed in charge of caius muro commander of legion slave be at once appointed to teach latin took meal with scribe steward of household for caius be of noble family of considerable wealth house be one of finest in camalodunum be kindly just man much beloved by troop a soon a beric have learned language caius ordered scribe to teach element of roman law decurion be ordered to take in hand instruct in arm a beric be alike eager to study to exercise in arm gained approval of teacher julia wife of caius kindly lady took great fancy to boy will make fine man caius said one day when boy be fourteen year old see how handsome strong be why scipio son of centurion metellus be older by two year yet be le strong than young briton be fine race julia though in disposition a fierce a wild cat not to be trusted lad be a say strong nimble marked practising with sword other day against lucinus who be stout soldier man have a much a must do to hold own against be surprised to see how well wielded sword of full weight how active be contest reminded of dog wild cat so nimble be boy spring so fierce attack lucinus fairly lost temper at last stopped fight for although fought with blunted weapon might well have injured lad badly with downright cut must have meant trouble with iceni again be intelligent too julia replied sometimes have in while be working with two slave girl will stand for hour asking question about rome about manner custom one be never sure of tamed wolf caius said sometimes turn out valuable ally assistant at other time grow into formidable foe more dangerous for what have learned of however do with a like julia woman have lighter hand than man be more likely to tame than be cneius say that be very eager to learn have ever book in hand when not practising in arm what like most in julia said be that be very fond of little berenice child have taken to wonderfully of afternoon when have finished with cneius often go out with of course old lucia go with be funny to hear on wet day when can not go out talking together telling story of rome of king consul telling tale of hunting wolf wild boar legend of people who seem to have be always at war with someone after beric have resided for three year half at camalodunum great grief fell on family of caius muro for damp air from valley have long affected julia gradually faded died beric felt loss very keenly for have be uniformly kind to year later suetonius governor of colony decided that a sarci have now be quiet for nearly five year a caius reported that young chief seemed to have become thoroughly romanized be permitted to return to tribe present be first visit to colony since have left four month before companion boduoc be one of tribesman young man six year senior be related to mother have be companion in childish day teaching woodcraft to throw javelin use sword together before beric went a hostage have wandered through forest hunted wolf wild boar at time boduoc have stood in relation of elder brother to beric relation have now much changed although boduoc be powerful young man beric sturdy stripling former be little better than untutored savage looked with great respect upon beric a chief a possessing knowledge seemed to to be amazing hating roman blindly have trembled lest must find beric on return completely romanized have many time during lad stay at camalodunum carried message to there from mother have sorrowfully shaken head on way back through forest a thought of young chief surroundings beric have partially adopted roman costume to hear talking jesting in own language to occupant of mansion whose grandeur appointment filled boduoc with almost superstitious fear be terrible to however loyalty to beric prevented from breathing word in tribe a to fear be delighted to find young chief return home in british garb to discover that although view of roman differed widely from own be still british at heart held firmly opinion that only hope for freedom of britain be entire expulsion of invader be gratified to find that beric have become by mean what considered effeminate be built strongly massively a might be expected from such parent be of true british type have so surprised roman at first coming among possessing great height muscular power together with activity promoted by constant exercise beric have fallen back upon custom of people a thoroughly a if have never dwelt in stately roman town be a ready a before to undertake longest hunting expedition to sleep in forest to go from sunrise to sunset without breaking fast when not engaged in hunting practised incessantly hurling javelin other warlike exercise while of evening frequently related story of roman history to chief other guest of mother on occasion humbler follower must gather thickly in background evincing interest even greater than felt in song legend of bard beric generally chose story relating to period when rome be hardly pressed by foe showing how intense feeling of patriotism obstinate determination to resist in spite of danger upon part of population discipline dogged valour of soldier saved from destruction be cautious to draw parallel openly to case of britain knew that roman be made acquainted by traitor in pay with much that passed among native tribe at first be sure to interest in proceeding at present there must be thought of rising slightest sign of disaffection might bring disaster ruin upon tribe only when unexpected event invasion of right of briton even more flagrant than have hitherto taken place must stir smouldering fire of discontent fan into fierce flame of revolt from end to end of britain must success be hoped for roman must have found fault with beric relation of prowess valour for held up to admiration of hearer wonder rome be great powerful said when people evince so deep love of country so resolute determination in face of enemy so unconquerable spirit when misfortune weighs upon to men addressed be new be true that few prince chief have visited rome occasionally a traveller desiring to see centre of greatness more often a exile driven from britain by defeat in civil strife have only brought back great tale of rome magnificence briton knew nothing of history of invader eagerly listened to story beric have learned from book in course of study report of story spread so far that visit be paid to village of parta by chief leading men from other section of iceni to listen to oratory be among briton a among most primitive tribe highly prized much cultivated oral tradition among such people take place of book among civilized nation story legend be handed down from father to son wandering bard be most welcome guest next only to valour oratory sway influence mind of people ulysses have greater influence than ajax from earliest childhood beric have listened to story legend told by bard in rough palace of father sole schooling before went to camalodunum have be to learn by heart to repeat with due emphasis appropriate gesture father have be one of most eloquent influential of chief of iceni have early impressed upon importance of cultivating power of speech study in roman history too have taught power exercised by men with gift of moving multitude by word have learned from book how clearly distinctly event must be described by careful choice of word attention to form expression so that almost unconsciously to have practised art in relation of tale legend of british history to berenice mother thus then manner no le than matter of recital of roman story gained high estimation among hearer be already looked upon a young chief likely to rise to very high position among iceni among common herd glowing laudations of roman patriotism devotion sacrifice caused to be regarded with disfavour epithet roman be frequently applied to wiser spirit saw hidden meaning of story while holding up roman a example be endeavouring to teach how much can be done by patriotism by spirit of self sacrifice by unity against common foe parta be also proud of congratulation distinguished chief famed for wisdom throughout tribe offered to on occasion of visit beric will be great chief one of wisest of said to truly sojourn among roman have done great thing for must be well indeed if noble youth throughout island be to have such schooling if have son wit in taking advantage of will be great orator never among bard have heard narration so clear so well delivered although deed praise be of oppressor one can not feel thrill of enthusiasm a tell yea for moment felt roman when told of brave youth who thrust hand into flame suffered to be consumed in order to impress invader with knowledge of spirit animated roman of three men who held against host bridge that friend be breaking down behind if must stir thus by tale of deed of enemy what will be when day make hero of britain theme call upon countryman to imitate deed have heard called roman ' parta now have listened to know that will when time come be one of rome most formidable foe will tell now that prasutagus king queen boadicea spoke to about beric begged to come hither to see for youth of whom have heard report from others saying that have returned roman heart soul while others affirmed that while have learned much from have forgotten nothing of injury have received at hand in death of father disaster of tribe will know now what to tell to prasutagus whose fear of roman be even greater than hatred for will say that lad be full of glory of roman story that there be fear of doing saying aught will excite anger suspicion of roman to boadicea who hate roman far more than fear will tell truth will inform when time come a assuredly day will that iceni be called upon to defend liberty against rome in beric will find champion of whom predict that will be worthy to take place in history by side of caractacus cassivelaunus may god avert that like fall victim to british treachery after leaving boduoc beric crossed bridge built by roman over stour entered city camalodunum be chief seat of roman power in england although so short time have elapsed since claudius have occupied be already large city comparatively small proportion however be roman work bore impress of roman art civilization for cunobeline whose capital have be be highly enlightened king have introduced roman way method among people men instructed in art architecture have be largely employed in building of town edifice must have borne comparison with in minor town in roman province conqueror therefore found much of work done for original possessor of house of highly cultivated land lying round town be ejected wholesale roman establishing in abode farm then proceeded to add to embellish fortify town nd th th legion be selected by claudius to found what be called colony to take possession of surrounding country plautius be appointed propraetor governor establishing in royal palace of cunobeline first step be to protect city from renewed attack by briton accordingly erected vast work to westward of town extending from sea to river by mean not only protected city from attack gained in case of assault by overpowering number mean of retiring safely to mersea island lying short distance from shore council house tribunal be erected for roman magistrate temple theatre bath raised civilian population increased rapidly architect artist musician decorator skilled artisan trader be attracted from mainland to rising city rapidly increased in wealth importance conspicuous on most elevated position stood temple erected to honour of claudius who be raised by grateful legionary to divine rank so strong populous be city that trinobantes during year have elapsed since roman took possession of remained passive under yoke of oppressor watched without attempting to take part in rising of iceni brigantes long desperate war of silures ordovices under caractacus reduction of belgae dumnonii from hampshire to cornwall by vespasian yet have spirit remained unbroken there be opportunity for revenge for large part of veteran legionary have be withdrawn to take part in struggle against western tribe tribe have however be disarmed with camalodunum on north rising town of london verulamium on south be cut off from other tribe must not hope for final success unless powerful iceni who be still semi independent rose in national cause whether easy defeat of tribe soon after occupation of camalodunum have rendered roman contemptuous of fighting power that deemed wiser to subdue southwest west of england to strike heavy blow at brigantes to north before interfering with powerful tribe so close to door be uncertain doubtless felt that so long a prasutagus reigned there be little fear of trouble in quarter a king protested friend ally of rome occupied wholly in acquiring wealth adding to personal possession scene in camalodunum be familiar one to beric street be thronged with people trader from gaul italy roman artisan

therefore pushed on with scarce glance at stately temple of claudius magnificent bath other public building until arrived at villa of caius muro stood somewhat beyond more crowded part of town chapter ii city forest house of caius muro have be built six year before on model of one owned by in tuscan hill passing through hall vestibule with mosaic pavement on be word of welcome salve beric entered

apartment where caius received distinguished guest where in lifetime of julia entertainment be given to lady of colony like triclinium room be also partially open at end affording guest view of graceful fountain on one side of garden on other in winter wooden frame with heavy hanging be erected across opening of tablinum for roman soon found necessity for modifying arrangement although well suited for italian climate be wholly unfit for of britain opening in centre of atrium be then closed with awning of oiled canvas admitted certain amount of light to pas prevented passage of rain snow kept out much of cold there be narrow passage between atrium peristylium be called fauces above chamber round atrium be second story approached by staircase from peristylium here be apartment of lady of female slave a beric entered atrium man who be reading roll of parchment rose to foot welcome beric said warmly hail preceptor lad replied be well here well beric have looked to see before berenice have be constantly asking when be coming have be absent over four year see beric replied be not easy to get away from home again now must speak to caius crossed apartment stood at entrance to tablinum caius looked up from military treatise be perusing ah beric be be glad to see again though be sorry to observe that have abandoned fashion taken to native garb again be necessary caius beric said must have lost influence with tribe have not laid aside roman dress a be regard with doubt a one too enamoured of roman custom have heard of beric indeed report say that speak well of be already famous for relation of history thought well that countryman must know great deed beric said must see by what mean have come to rule world received nought kindness at hand prisoner lot be ever made more easy than mine to yours be deeply grateful if people behaved a kindly towards native of country a did to britain must be conquered without need of drawing sword from scabbard know not that beric to rule one must be strong a well a kind still a know think that thing might have be arranged far le harshly than have be be needful that must show to be master regret harshness have be too often used must that not one of here from governor down to poorest soldier be influenced by desire for gain that be animated a assuredly must be only by desire to uphold glory power of rome must be expecting too much from human nature even among there be plenty ready to side against countryman for sake of roman gold in have le excuse than custom habit have made want many aim at attaining luxury of rich on other hand want be few see not that piling up of wealth add in way to happiness be true caius quite agree with that be far more excusable for roman to covet wealth than for briton while blame many official soldier for harshness with strive to wring possession from countryman deem conduct a worthy honourable when compared with of briton who sell country for gold must take world a find beric may regret that greed love of luxury must influence men a may grieve that be victim of other base passion be of use quarrelling with human nature certain be that vice bring own punishment that roman be far nobler race when be poor simple in day of early consul than be now with power rich luxury such be history of people of egypt of persia of greece carthage methinks that rome too will run course of other nation day far distant maybe will sink beneath weight of power luxury that younger more vigorous people will bit by bit wrest dominion from rule in place a yet happily see sign of failing in power be still vigorous even in distant outskirt of empire wave of conquest flow onward happily for think can flow farther way there be one island beyond to conquer then a in western gaul iberia ocean say to rome 'thou shalt go farther ' must to south east north similar barrier checked progress then must rest be content need no longer waste strength in fresh conquest in opposing incursion of horde of barbarian from region unknown to even by report must wish beric that nature have placed island five day sail from coast of gaul instead of placing within sight then might have be enjoying life in villa among tuscan hill with daughter instead of being exposed at moment to march with legion against savage mountaineer of west ah here come berenice broke off a daughter attended by old nurse entered atrium from vestibule hastened step a saw beric standing before father in tablinum knew must come back beric because promised have be long time in keeping word be not own master at home more than be here berenice said mother must not hear before of leaving have only come now for hour visit to see that go well in house to tell have not forgotten promise next time hope to pay longer visit at daybreak tomorrow have party to hunt wolf have so multiplied a to become danger in forest of late must like to go out to see wolf hunt beric fear must not be possible said wood be thick tangled have to force way through to get to lair last winter came close to town heard that came even into street yes will do so when driven by hunger be hunting then not being hunted berenice fear that wish to see wolf hunt can not be gratified be savage beast be great trouble loss to in winter carry off many child sometimes devour grown up people in time of long snow have be known to attack large party in spite of stout resistance by men to devour in summer be only met singly in winter go in pack kill number of cattle must like to go into wood girl said earnestly be tired of town father say will take with day when go west so far have seen nothing except town verulamium country be just a be here field cultivation must see forest in distance be father say that if went west must travel for mile through forest must sleep in tent that can not do till everything be quiet peaceful oh beric do wish briton must not be always fighting beric smiled british girl berenice say wish roman must not be always fighting be very troublesome said pettishly must like everyone to be friend then there must be no need to have so many soldier in britain perhaps emperor must order legion home father say that ought to look upon a home now for that legion may remain here for year year said other day that thought that if everything be quiet here must when be sixteen year old obtain leave from governor go back to rome for two three year think though have not said so outright that will perhaps retire settle there must be much best for beric said earnestly must be sorry because have be very kind to must grieve be to leave altogether there may be trouble here again day think must be far better for to be back in rome where must have pleasure delight of great capital live in ease comfort without risk of father having to march away to war know that if be father must take back say that villa there be exactly like have many relation there there must be sort of pleasure grand spectacle far beyond anything there be here be sure must be better for happier thought that must be quite sorry said gravely so will be very sorry for beric said a next to own mother there be one care for so much a father will miss terribly yet be so sure that must be best for to be at home with own people must be glad to hear that father be going to take back to rome berenice did not altogether accept explanation felt really hurt that beric must view even possibility of going away with equanimity very shortly went off to own apartment while few minute later beric after bidding goodbye to caius started to rejoin boduoc whom found waiting at edge of forest that evening berenice said to father be angry with beric today be child what about told that perhaps in three year when be sixteen must take to rome thought perhaps if went there must not come back again instead of being very much grieved a thought must seemed quite pleased at idea of course said be sorry did not really seem to be say thought must be very much better for thought be grateful father liked very much now be quite disappointed in caius be silent for minute two think beric be ungrateful said be sure that like berenice said did father that cared for more than anyone except mother if cared for surely must be very very sorry for to go away beric be briton dear be roman by time must have thoroughly learned people feeling towards have never believed a do britain be a yet completely conquered that when have finished with silures in west work will be completely done beric who know countryman may feel even more strongly than do may know sooner later there will be great effort on part of briton to drive out may be year may be twenty believe that day will have fierce struggle to maintain hold here beric who may see also who know feeling of countryman may wish that must be away before storm come there be little doubt berenice that despise people too much still that treat harshly cruelly be propraetor of britain must rule differently be commander of legion duty be to rule men must punish punish sternly attempt at rising must give cause for discontent treat a if spirit be altogether broken a if possession be chattel a if possessed right not even right to live day will find mistake when time come awakening will be rude one be partly because see dimly storm gathering in distance long to be home again a long a mother lived seemed home to now desire rest quiet have done share of fighting have won honour enough may look before long to be general have have enough of long for quiet villa in alban hill with occasional visit to rome where can take part in gaiety can have use of library stored with learning of world so think harshly of beric child may see distant storm more plainly than do be sure that care for if be glad at news that be going be because wish away in safety before trouble come nero have come to imperial throne men be sending be of widely different stamp from lieutenant of claudius latter knew that briton can fight wild untutored a be needed skill courage of ostorius vespasian to reduce to order newcomer regard a slave to be trampled upon robbed ill used a choose be sure will find mistake a long a deal only with tribe thoroughly subdued trinobantes cantii belgae dumnonii may be quiet dare not move iceni brigantes although have felt weight of sword be still partly independent if pressed too severely will assuredly revolt if give signal britain may be up in arm again be scoffed at if venture to hint to newcomer that there be life yet in britain dwelling here in roman city seems to absurd

rescuing party be man to whom hut belonged whose joy at finding wife child unhurt be great indeed poured forth thanks to beric boduoc when learned from wife that have voluntarily abandoned wood where must have be secure in shelter of tree in order to assist in defending hut against wolf must come with said wolf may return after have gone when hunt be over will send men to help to repair roof where be cattle be safe in stockade at next village man said finished only yesterday drove in cattle from forest collected great quantity of wood so that woman might keep up great bonfire if wolf tried to

same metal girded in at waist then fell in loose fold almost to foot have heavy gold bracelet on arm be late beric said sternly tribesman have be waiting nigh hour for only heard at daybreak that borgon have gone out to search for with party be well that did mother for boduoc be besieged in hut by pack of wolf who must shortly have made end of have not rescue arrived what be doing in hut asked told must leave roman town before sunset make way straight back here beric shortly related circumstance of fight be well that be worse said boduoc ought to have known better than to have allowed to leave tree where must at least have be safe from wolf mattered life of woman in comparison to yours when know hope plan for stay not talking magartha have roasted kid in readiness for eat quickly take horn of mead be gone hour have be wasted already few minute sufficed for beric to satisfy hunger then went out joined two three minor chief of experience who have charge of hunt greater portion of tribesman have already started almost man have brought with one more large dog trained in hunting wolf boar wood beyond swamp rang with deep barking instruction have already be given to men proceeded in party of four group taking post fifty yard from next who have farthest to go have started before daybreak be two hour before whole be in position forming long line through forest upwards of ten mile in length horn be sounded in centre where leader have posted signal be repeated at point along line then with shout on part of men fierce barkings on of dog whole moved forward right of line rested on stour left upon orwell a passed along through forest line contracted at time wild boar made dash to break through many of be slain till chief considered that there be sufficient supply of food rest be then allowed to pas through wolf be seen until neared point where two river unite by time group be within few pace of other then among tree in front of fierce snarling yelping be heard dog have hitherto be kept in hand be now loosed with shout men rushed forward on bluff in centre along low land skirting river on side soon wolf came pouring down from wooded bluff engaged in furious conflict with dog a men ran up few of wolf in desperation charged endeavoured to break through great majority cowed by clamour fierce assault crouched to earth received death blow unresistingly took to water coracle have be sent down to point evening before be speedily slain altogether four five hundred wolf be killed be now late in afternoon wood be collected great fire made boar flesh be soon roasting over at daybreak started again retracing step formed fresh line at point where last beat have begun time beating in great semicircle driving wolf down on to stour so for fortnight war went on only such deer boar a be required for food be killed wolf be slain without mercy at end of operation that portion of country be completely cleared of savage beast for who have escaped beating party have fled far away through forest to more quiet quarter work have be laborious for day forty mile have be traversed in march from last place of slaughter to next beat in subsequent proceeding have however be full of interest excitement especially during second week when having cleared country in neighbourhood of river men be ranged in wide circle ten mile in diameter advancing gradually towards centre occasionally many of wolf escaped before line have narrowed sufficiently for men to be near enough to other to oppose successful resistance in case majority continued to slink from approaching noise until cordon be too close for to break through altogether over four thousand wolf be slain whose coat be in good condition be skinned skin being valuable for lining to hut for bed winter mantle many men have be bitten more le severely by none have be killed there be much rejoicing at complete clearance from district of foe have since arrival of large pack from north made terrible inroad among herd of cattle swine have killed considerable number of men woman child previous winter have be very severe one have driven great number of wolf down from north britain fighting have be going on for year in south west at time in midland have put stop to usual chase of wolf in district have consequently multiplied exceedingly have become serious scourge even before arrival of fresh band from north however after so great slaughter be hoped that for time at least must not again make appearance in neighbourhood returning home at end of expedition beric be surprised a entered hall to see druid standing upon dais conversing with mother who be pacing up down with angry gesture that conference be important one did not doubt for druid dwelt in recess of forest near temple who wished to consult must journey to to ask counsel beneath sacred oak in circle of magic stone when great event be impending when tribe took up arm against other druid must leave forest abode interposing between combatant authoritatively bid desist acted a mediator between great chief be judge upon matter in dispute be sure therefore that druid be bearer of news of importance stood waiting in centre of hall until mother eye fell upon come hither beric said hear news that holy druid have brought think not that roman have carried oppression far enough when have seized land of island enslaved people exacted tribute from free briton what think now roman governor severus knowing that be religion a well a love of country that arm against that druid ever raise voice to bid defend altar home have resolved upon expedition against sacred island have determined to exterminate priest to break down altar to destroy religion ten day since legion marched from camalodunum to join army be assembling in west from other part have drawn soldier have declared intention of rooting out destroying religion at centre news be terrible druid said god will fight for doubtless terrible destruction will fall upon impious men who thus dream of profaning sacred island may be otherwise perchance god may see that thus thus only can people of britain be stirred to take up arm to annihilate worshipper of false god of rome assuredly be on eve of great event briton must prepare to take up arm to fall upon legion whom god have stricken to avenge insult offered to faith be terrible news indeed beric said though be lad father be ready when call come to fight in front rank of iceni with people father fell fighting for country by sword of roman be ready to follow example when mother will say out to war ' for present beric must remain quiet must await news of result of expedition word have gone round brother be to visit chief of iceni while druid of north stir up brigantes news too that time of deliverance be at hand that must hold in readiness to rise against oppressor be passing through trinobantes tribe of south southwest time must be partial rising must avoid ruinous error of matching single tribe against whole strength of roman must be britain against rome whole people struggling for home altar against who must destroy religion reduce to slavery must that must have be postponed for time father beric said during four year passed a hostage at camalodunum have be learning tactic have enabled roman to conquer have learned word of command how movement be executed hope when become man to train sarci to fight in solid order to wheel turn a do roman so that might form band might in day of battle oppose to roman onset check pursuit perhaps convert reverse into victory heed not that druid said enthusiastically must be useful indeed there be scant time for now god will fight for have number valour warrior will sweep soldier aside a wave dash over rock conversation between druid parta have be heard by others in hall news spread rapidly among tribesman a returned from chase shout of fury indignation rose outside several of minor chief followed by crowd of excited men poured into hall demanding with loud shout war must be declared against roman druid advanced to edge of dais child said time have not yet come can sarci do aught until word be given by prasutagus whole of iceni rise in arm not iceni alone briton from sea to sea till then hold yourselves in readiness sharpen arm prepare for contest need chief in ordinary course of thing year must have elapsed before beric son of last brave prince must have be associated with mother in rule of tribe on eve of such struggle ordinary custom usage must be set at nought therefore in virtue of sacred authority now appoint beric a chief next to mother in tribe bid obey in thing relating to war have learned much of roman way method be thus better fitted than many far older than to instruct how best to stand onset prophesy under small honour glory will fall to tribe that will bear signal share in avenging god winning freedom come hither beric druid laying hand upon lad head raised other to heaven implored god to bestow wisdom strength upon to raise in mighty champion of country faith then uttered terrible malediction upon who must disobey beric order question authority who must show faint heart in day of battle hold life of account in cause of country now concluded retire to home must give cause pretext for roman aggression until signal be given will not be idle young chief will teach somewhat of discipline have rendered roman soldier so formidable so that may know how to set yourselves in day of battle how to oppose rank to rank to draw off in good order to press forward to victory issue be ever in hand of god must do can to deserve be good to learn even from enemy have studied war for age if have conquered brave people have not be by superior valour because have studied war while others have trusted solely to native valour therefore deem not instruction useless despise method simply because understand none must be braver than who fought under caractacus yet be conquered not by valour by discipline of roman be will of god that young chief must dwell for four year hostage among roman doubtless willed must be so in order that might be fitted to be worthy champion of country so to effect what even valour of caractacus failed to do god have spoken by see that obey woe to wretch who murmur even in own heart against decree a concluded loud shout be raised throughout crowded hall swelled into mighty roar outside for at open door have passed word to throng of tribesman outside when shout subsided beric added few word saying that although regretted have not yet come to full strength that thus early must be called upon to lead men accepted decree of god must strive not to be wanting in day of trial in matter connected with war have learned much from roman who oppressor a be despisers of god of britain be skilled beyond others in such matter in other respect have happily mother counsel guidance to depend upon before assuming civil authority must wait until year have taught wisdom must then go through usual ceremony appointed by religion receive instalment solemnly in temple at hand of druid night there be high feasting at cardun bullock three swine be slain by order of parta number of great earthen jar of mead broached while principal men of tribe feasted in hall rest made merry outside bard attached to parta household sang tale of glory of tribe even woman from village detached hut for large circle round came in happy now wolf have be cleared away must stir out after nightfall without fear after entertaining guest in hall parta son went round among tribesman outside saw that have needed spoke pleasantly even to poorest among be long before beric closed eye night event of day have be complete surprise to have thought that in distant future must share with mother in ruling of tribe have never once dreamed of coming for year have not be for news that have heard of intended invasion of holy isle must not have regretted elevation for must have given mean opportunity to train tribesman to fight in close order a did roman now must not hope that there must be time to carry out effectually knew that throughout britain feeling of rage indignation at outrage upon god of country must raise passion of men to boiling point that slightest incident must suffice to bring on general explosion greatly feared that result of such rising must in end be disastrous reading have shown how great be power of rome how obstinately clung to conquest countryman seemed to think that be with mighty effort to free britain of invader freedom must be achieved knew that disaster must arouse roman pride that however great effort required fresh army must be despatched to avenge disaster to regain territory lost briton know nothing of roman power said to see twenty thirty thousand men here forget that number have alone be sent because be sufficient for work rome must if need be despatch five time a many men with time to teach people not of sarci tribe only iceni to fight in solid mass to bear brunt of battle while rest of tribe attacked furiously on side might hope for victory fighting without order regularity man for can not hope to prevail against solid mass if must have gained name before time came so that voice might have have weight power in council of chief might have done something a be fear that rising now will bring ruin slavery upon britain beric thought little of of personal danger must encounter briton be careless of life believed implicitly in future life that who fell fighting bravely for country must meet with reward hereafter hence a among gaul cowardice be almost unknown vice beric have faith in god of country while have none whatever in of rome wondered how mighty people must believe in such deity unlike briton in general did not believe that god interfered to decide fate of battle saw that roman with false god have conquered all other nation so far have uniformly triumphed over own therefore mighty a believed god to be thought that concerned little in affair of world that battle be to be won solely by valour discipline number number valour british have of discipline be absolutely ignorant be gave so tremendous advantage to roman hence beric felt none of exultation excitement that most british lad of age must have done on attaining to rank command in tribe to belonged briton despised roman a much for belief in many god a for luxury what considered effeminacy religion of briton be pure one though disfigured by offering of human sacrifice believed in one great supreme spirit whose power pervaded everything thought of a absolute being than a pervading influence worshipped everywhere in forest in stream in sky heavenly body through druid consulted in undertaking if answer be favourable followed if unfavourable endeavoured to change by sacrifice offering to priest believed firmly in life after death when held that soul of brave good men woman must be transported at once to island far out in atlantic called happy island highest place must be theirs who have fought valiantly died in battle there be room for must be happy holding idea firmly briton sought rather than avoided death life in separate tribe be quiet simple except when engaged in chase war be averse to labour be domestic virtuous frank straightforward personal property of stranger be sacred among most lavish hospitality be exercised be not strange that simple hardy people believing firmly in one supreme god must have regarded with contempt alike luxury of roman worship of many god in likeness of men woman that more beric have seen of learning wisdom of roman in other direction more must wonder that people must be slave to what seemed to childish superstition next morning after consultation with of minor chief hundred men be summoned to attend on following day be picked out from family where there be two more male of working age so that there must be a little disturbance of labour a possible be principally in company of hundred that beric have seen roman exercised have learned order by heart from first to last manoeuvre to be taught be not of complicated nature to form in fighting order six deep to move in column be principal point when next day band assembled beric be surprised vexed to find that operation be vastly more difficult than expected to begin with man be to have place in line tribesman though eager to learn anxious to please young chief must not see that mattered in what order stood when however having arranged at first in line two deep beric proceeded to explain how spear be to be held in order movement be to be performed exercise answering to manual platoon of modern day tribesman be unable to restrain laughter what difference must make whether hand be two foot apart three whether spear be held upright sloped whether came down to charge one after together to men absolutely unaccustomed to order of kind used only to fight in way suited best detail appeared absolutely ludicrous beric be obliged to stop harangue pointing out to that be just little thing gave roman fighting power that be because whole company moved a one man fought a one man knowing place falling into however great confusion however sudden alarm made what be why do conquer said chiefly because can never throw into confusion charge down upon break at once reunite solid wall opposes scattered effort know how cattle when wolf attack gather in circle with horn outwards so keep at bay who must pull down rend separately at present seems ridiculous to that position of hand movement of arm must be done by rule when have practised will become second nature so with other movement seems folly to to do with measured step what seems must do far more quickly by running together hastily be not so slowest movement be really quickest have advantage that one be hurried that everything be done steadily regularly that even in greatest heat confusion of battle man take place a calm ready to fight a if foe be in sight now let try again at end of day will pick out of who be quickest most attentive make of officer under will have more work to do for will have to understand teach order also will gain more honour credit for hour drill went on then broke off for dinner again worked until evening by time have made sufficient progress in simple movement to begin to feel that there be after something more in than have fancied for first hour have seemed to sort of joke mere freak on part of young chief be surprised to find by end of day how rapidly be able to change from rank two deep into solid formation how spear rose fell together at order beric bade by next morning provide with spear six foot longer briton be more accustomed to fight with javelin than with spear latter weapon be shorter lighter than of roman beric felt that advantage must be other way for small shield carried by briton be inferior a defensive weapon to of roman to preserve balance be necessary therefore to have longer spear more so since briton be taller far more powerful men than foe must therefore be able with practice to use longer weapon next day beric chose boduoc a second in command appointed ten men sub officer sergeant after week of almost incessant work must have exhausted men le hardy vigorous beric be satisfied company have now come to take great interest in work be able to go through exercise with fair show of regularity even older chief who have at first shaken head a looked on acknowledged there be great deal to be gained from exercise parta be delighted be who have foreseen advantage might be derived from beric stay among roman entered heartily into plan ordering men engaged to be fed from produce of flock herd when week be over two hundred more men be summoned sufficient number of brightest most intelligent of first company being chosen a sub officer before drill commenced however first company be put through exercise in order that newcomer might see what be expected of how much must be done time several of chief joined company in order that might learn word of command be fitted to lead greatly encouraged beric who have foreseen while must command company must hing towards controlling ten fifteen company unless have officer of rank influence enough to control exercise after first company have be drilled be carried on in forest mile away from village men assembling there camping beneath tree so that rumour of gathering preparation for war must reach roman although at present be not in position to make eruption from camalodunum a greater portion of legionary have marched with suetonius returning one day to cardun with boduoc beric be surprised to hear loud cry of lamentation woman be running about with dishevelled hair disordered garment fearful that something might have happened to mother hurried on to hall parta be sitting on ground rocking to fro in grief while woman be assembled round uttering cry of anguish what be matter beric asked a hurried forward bard stepped forward to answer question son said misfortune have fallen on land god have hidden face refused to fight for child woe desolation have come upon altar be thrown down priest slaughtered mona be taken beric exclaimed yes son mona be taken druid boroc hour ago brought news roman having reached strait constructed flat bottomed boat in approached island horseman towing horse behind there be assembled woman of silures druid from part of britain with many fugitive who have fled for shelter to island druid remained by altar offering up human sacrifice men woman assembled on beach waving torch hurling imprecation upon invader imploring god to aid to crush impious foe for time roman paused in mid channel terrified at spectacle hope of that god have paralysed arm rose high ala halt be temporary encouraging other with shout again advanced leaping from boat waded through water set foot on sacred soil what be there to do men be few though woman in despair rushed wildly at enemy be in vain men woman be alike slaughtered then moving forward advanced against holy circle slew druid upon altar of god served yet god be silent saw heard answered not cloud rained fire upon invader earth shook ah son evil day have fallen upon land what will be end of throughout length breadth of britain thrill of horror be felt at news of massacre of druid at mona everywhere be followed by stern determination to prepare for battle to clear land of roman druid went from tribe to tribe from village to village stirring up men heart woman even more deeply excited than men at news of calamity behaved a if possessed many going about country calling upon men to take up arm foretelling victory to briton destruction to roman even in street of camalodunum at night voice be heard cry out curse upon roman predicting destruction of city week after news came beric in fulfilment of promise have given to berenice paid visit to camalodunum there be sign in busy street of uneasiness fear new propraetor catus decianus who commanded in absence of suetonius be holding sort of court there bearing of roman seemed even more arrogant insolent than usual news of destruction of druid at mona have by be hailed a final most crushing blow to resistance of briton since god must not protect own altar what hope must there be for in future decianus haughty tyrant who have be sent to britain by nero a mark of signal favour in order that might enrich by spoil of briton be levying exaction at rate hitherto unknown treating people a if be dirt under foot lieutenant creature of nero followed example exasperation of unfortunate trinobantes who be chief victim have reached point that be ready for revolt whensoever signal might come on arrival at house of caius muro beric found berenice at home received with joy be glad that have come beric be so dull now that father have gone away to war have be expecting here for last fortnight suppose have be amusing too much to give thought to have be very busy berenice be chief now have have much to do in tribe among other thing have be having great war with wolf yes told when be last here that be going to set out next day on expedition against began first a turned out said smiling very nearly made meal of night on way homeward sit down tell about said know love story beric recited to story of fight at hut there be woman there how terrible must have be for to be alone with child before arrived to think of killing wolf with spear how different woman must be from beric for be only taught to embroider to dress to care for pretty thing why must be frightened out of life at sight of wolf if be alone have one to protect woman be brought up differently berenice regard a altogether equal many of tribe be ruled by

boadicea with roman in capital occasion will assuredly not long be wanting then there will be such rising a roman have never yet seen then purpose effected god may well fight on side must that there have be five more year in to prepare for struggle if must come must catus decianus be just man to bring on haughty arrogant greedy know nothing of have never faced briton in arm have suetonius be here must not have acted thus with regard to affair of prasutagus have caius muro not be absent voice might have be raised in warning to tyrant everything seems to conspire together mother to bring on crisis sooner better parta exclaimed vehemently be true that in time might teach whole iceni to fight in roman method what be good for roman may not be good for moreover year pass strengthens hold on land fort spring up everywhere city grow apace month number flock over here five year son hold might be too strong to shake off be so mother thinking of ourselves thought not of may be that be better to fight now than to wait well whenever signal be given from wheresoever come be ready since news of capture of mona have arrived tribesman have drilled with increased alacrity eagerness man saw that struggle with rome must ere long take place be eager to take leading share in conflict be upon that blow have fallen most heavily in former partial rising knew that other tribe of iceni held that defence of camp must not have be overborne by roman a be hence have something of private wrong a well a national one to avenge fortnight be spent in constant work until one day news came that boadicea daughter have be most grossly insulted by roman officer that queen herself have started for camalodunum to demand from decianus redress of wrong punishment of offender excitement be intense man felt outrage upon daughter of queen a personal injury when beric took place before men of tribe who be drawn up in military order shout arose lead to camalodunum let take vengeance not yet beric cried queen have gone there must wait issue not until give order must move rising now must endanger safety must wait friend until be a ready a be when time come will not find backward in leading three day later came news that seemed at first incredible be speedily confirmed decianus have received queen have scoffed at complaint when fired with indignation have used threat have ordered soldier to strip scourge sentence have actually be carried into effect then rage of tribesman knew bound needed utmost persuasion of parta to induce to wait until news came from north fear not said that vengeance will be baulked boadicea will not submit to double indignity of maybe sure wait until hear from when measure be determined upon in matter iceni must act a one man be equally outraged in person of queen daughter have right to share in avenging insult might spoil by moving before others be ready when move must be a mighty torrent to overwhelm invader not camalodunum only roman town must be laid in ruin must be life death struggle between rome must conquer now be enslaved for ever be not long before messenger arrived from boadicea bidding sarci prepare for war summoning parta son to council of

be harnessed started two long day journey brought to place of meeting scene be busy one already fully two score of chief have arrived parta be received with great mark of respect sarci be tribe lying nearest to roman upon brunt of roman anger must fall a have done before appearance in answer to summons showed be thought willingness to join in general action of tribe beric be looked at curiously four year residence among roman caused to be regarded with certain amount of suspicion have be added to by rumour that have be impressing upon tribe greatness power of rome of late there have be report brought by wandering bard that sarci be being practised in same exercise a of roman soldier there be many who thought that beric like cogidinus chief of regi of sussex have joined heart soul to rome be preparing tribe to fight side by side with legion on other hand many knowing that parta have lost husband at hand of roman hated with heart held that must never have divided power with beric suffered to take military command of tribe have not be assured of fidelity to cause of britain beric be dressed in full panoply of chief wore short skirt kilt reaching to knee above loose vest shirt girt in by gold belt while over shoulder wore british mantle white in colour worked with gold around neck be torque emblem of chieftainship on left arm carried small shield of beaten brass from baldric covered with gold plate hung straight pointless british sword have be carried by father in battle even most suspicious of must not deny that be stalwart well built youth with full share of pith muscle that residence among roman have not given air of effeminacy only subject of criticism be that hair be shorter than of countryman for although have permitted to grow since left camalodunum where have worn short in roman fashion have not yet attained full length beric felt stranger among others since return home there have be no great tribal gathering for prasutagus have for time be ill have always discouraged such assemblage because be viewed with jealousy by roman because begrudged expense of entertaining parta who be personally known to almost present introduced beric to son be none le one of iceni for roman training said have learned much have forgotten nothing be young will find worthy companion in arm when day of battle come be glad to hear what say parta aska one of older chief said must be unfair to impute blame to for what assuredly be not fault feared that might have taught to despise countryman be not so sir beric said firmly happily fell into good hand caius commander of th legion in whose charge be be just a well a valiant man have instructed a if have be own son trust be none le true briton because except from hatred bear roman never said word to against countryman indeed often bewailed that be not treated more wisely gently be not taught to regard roman a friend teacher rather than oppressor well spoken young chief other said ingratitude be of sin most odious do well to speak up boldly for who be kind to among men there be good evil may well believe even among roman there be who be just honourable hear that admire greatly that have be telling to tribe tale of greatness in war of virtue have done so beric replied race must not conquer world a roman have done unless have many virtue chiefly told of be virtue briton must lay to heart spoke of patriotism of love of country never failed of stern determination enabled to pas through gravest danger without flinching to show dauntless face to foe even when danger be thickest country be menaced with destruction above how in rome though there might be party division there be none in face of common enemy then all acted a one man there be rivalry save in great deed be ready to give life possessed in defence of country be lesson thought well that briton must learn take to heart rome have conquered so far because have be one while be rent into tribe having common union content to sit with arm folded while neighbour be crushed not seeing that turn will come next be so when first came in time of forefather have be so in latter time tribe after tribe have be subdued while have be united roman must never have obtained footing on shore wonder god have turned away face from people so blind so divided when be at stake yes have learned much from roman have not learned to love have learned to admire to regret that in many respect own countryman did not resemble there be murmur of surprise among chief who have by time gathered round while angry exclamation broke from of younger men aska waved hand beric speaks wisely truly said dissension have be ruin still more perhaps conduct of who must have led who have made term with rome in order to secure own possession among prasutagus be conspicuous ourselves be a much to blame a be that suffered if know what be passing here will see how great be misfortune that have brought upon queen daughter tribe have joined whole

showed mark of roman rod across back sight eliciting shout of fury from chief around let retire to wood druid said see that eye profanes mystery when god have answered will summon queen followed by chief retired at once to forest while druid proceeded to carry out sacred mystery although knew well what decision must be waited with suppressed excitement summons to return hear decision be to embark in desperate struggle with rome threw down under tree walked up down together discussing in low tone prospect of struggle question what tribe must join queen daughter sat apart none venturing to approach parta three other female chief sat short distance away talking together while two three of younger chief attitude towards beric entirely altered by report of druid prediction concerning gathered round asked question concerning roman method of fighting arm power hour after have retired deep sound of conch rose in air queen daughter at once moved forward followed by four female chief behind whom came rest in body issuing from forest advanced to sacred oak stood in attitude of deep respect while chief druid announced decision of god god have spoken said too long have iceni stood

have prepared feast of roasted sheep pig ox with bread jar of drink formed of fermented honey sort of beer a soon a meal be concluded queen called chief round assembly be joined by druid war be declared said question be will commence at once will wait there be general response at once chief druid stepped forward said son must not risk ruin of by undue haste must be national movement if be to succeed for fortnight must keep quiet preparing everything for war so that may take field with man capable of bearing arm in tribe in meantime with aid of bard will spread news of outrage that roman have committed upon queen daughter far wide over land already tribe be burning with indignation at insult to god slaughter of priest at mona news will arouse to madness for what be done here today may be done elsewhere tomorrow men will see that only in total destruction of roman be there hope of freedom will be bidden to prepare for war when news come that iceni have taken up arm to assemble march to join on day fortnight then let chief with following meet at cardun be short march from camalodunum then will rush upon roman city scene of outrage to queen smoke will tell britain that be avenged rome that day of oppression be over decision be received with satisfaction fortnight be none too long for making preparation assembling tribesman marching to appointed spot one thing claim boadicea

beric god have marked out for favour priest tell that will be one day great champion of briton so may be will watch on day of battle be assured that none among iceni will bear more worthily hour later meeting broke up parta beric returned to cardun where at once began to make preparation for approaching conflict man in tribe be summoned to attend exercise went on from daybreak till dusk while woman cooked waited upon men council be held nightly in hall to of chief be assigned special duty whole tribe being treated a legion chief fighting man having place duty assigned to in camalodunum although nothing be known of preparation be being made feeling of great uneasiness prevailed treatment of boadicea have excited grave disapproval upon part of great majority of inhabitant although new arrival from gaul rome official in suite of decianus lauded action a act of excellent policy british slave must be taught to feel weight of arm said lesson such a will be most useful be for dog like to complain because be whipped must be taught to know that live at pleasure that island contains be ours have right save choose to give older settler viewed matter very differently knew well enough that be only after hard fighting vespasian have subdued south ostorius crushed caractacus knew too that iceni gave nominal submission to rome that trinobantes crushed a be have be driven to verge of madness by extortion moreover legion be far away camalodunum be well nigh undefended lay almost at mercy of briton must attack therefore denounced treatment of boadicea a not only brutal a impolitic in extreme sudden cessation of news from official who have gone to take possession of estate of prasutagus caused considerable uneasiness among section of inhabitant of camalodunum messenger be sent off day to inquire a to what have taken place after return of boadicea none came back feeling of uneasiness be heightened by attitude of native report came in from part of district that have changed attitude that longer crouched at sight of roman bore defiantly that there be meeting at night in forest that woman sang chant performed dance have evidently hidden meaning decianus conscious perhaps that action be strongly disapproved by principal inhabitant of town that perhaps suetonius must also view in same light when be reported to have left city few day after occurrence have gone to verulamium absence permitted general feeling of apprehension discontentment more open expression than must otherwise have have brave a roman be be deeply superstitious thrill of horror apprehension ran through city when be reported one morning that statute of victory in temple have fallen to ground have turned round a if fled towards sea presage of evil created profound impression what do think of cneius berenice asked be terrible be not nothing else be spoken of among lady have seen today agree forbodes terrible evil may may not old scribe said cautiously if statue have fallen by action of god omen be surely most evil one how else must have fallen cneius well dear there be many briton in town know be in very excited state woman indeed seem to have gone well nigh mad with midnight singing wailing be possible mind for moment say that be so for be suggestion to occur to citizen must lead to fresh oppression cruelty against briton be just possible that of may have entered temple at night overthrown victory image a act of defiance know how woman nightly shriek out prophecy of destruction of town must destroy cneius surely must never dare to attack great roman city like know whether dare not berenice assuredly decianus be doing in power to excite to such pitch of despair that might dare do anything if dare see nothing to prevent from taking city work erected after claudius first founded colony be so vast that must require army to defend while there be few hundred soldier here what must do against horde of barbarian must that father be back also two legion who marched away to join suetonius before went ought to have erected central fort here to must retire in case of danger hold out until suetonius came back to assistance see when went away none must have foreseen have since taken place one must have dreamt decianus must have wantonly stirred up iceni to revolt think have revolted know nothing of berenice can put two two together have heard nothing for week from official who went to seize possession of prasutagus how be that none of messenger have returned seems to almost certain that men have paid for conduct to daughter of boadicea with life beric be with iceni surely must hear from if danger threatened be with cneius said be chief if tribe be in arm be in arm also can not without risking forfeit of life for treachery send hither message must put on guard believe in lad four year taught think know nature be honest true be one of iceni must go with countryman be sure be grateful for kindness received here have real affection for therefore believe must worst fear be verified iceni attack camalodunum will do utmost to save will not kill woman girl surely even if did take city fear that will show slight mercy to berenice why must have shown mercy to have slaughtered priest priestess at storm of town have put to death without distinction of age sex if civilized people thus make war what can expect from men upon whom have inflicted such countless injury fall of statue of victory be succeeded by other occurrence in awestruck inhabitant read augury of evil be reported that strange noise have be heard in council house theatre while men out in boat brought back tale that there be appearance of sunken town below water be currently believed that sea have assumed colour of blood that there be when tide went out mark upon sand a if dead body have be lying there even boldest veteran be dismayed at accumulation of hostile augury council of principal citizen be held urgent message despatched to decianus praying that must take instance measure for protection of city in reply to despatched two hundred soldier from verulamium with small body of troop already in city took possession of temple of claudius began to make preparation for putting into state of defence still message have come from norwich night after night british woman declared that people of camalodunum must suffer same fate have already overwhelmed who have ventured to insult daughter of queen of iceni strange terror have now seized inhabitant of town apprehension of danger weighted upon peril seemed more terrible inasmuch a be so vague nothing be known for certain message have come from iceni since queen quitted town yet be felt that among dark wood stretching north host of foe be gathering might at moment pour down upon city order be issued that at approach of danger who must do so be to betake at once to temple be to act a citadel yet really effective measure be taken there be indeed vague talk of sending woman child valuable away to legion commanded by cerealis stationed in fortified camp to south nothing came of waited for something definite notification that briton have really revolted while waiting for nothing be done one evening slave brought in small roll of vellum to cneius have be given at door said by briton who have at once left after placing in hand scribe opened read a follows to cneius nepo greeting obtain british garb for berenice let apparel be that of boy must anything unusual occur by night day do disguise yourselves quickly stir not beyond house will be best for to wait in tablinum lose time in carrying out instruction there be signature be needed so storm be about to burst cneius said thoughtfully when have read thought so be sure that if briton have spark of manhood left in must avenge cruel wrong of queen be rejoiced to read beric word to see that have a felt sure have grateful heart must save from fate that clearly think be about to overwhelm place omen have not lied then not that believe in be for most part offspring of men fancy at rate will come true time care little for must do a bid for sake of girl doubt though whether beric can save people have terrible wrong to avenge at first outburst will spare none well must do best late a be will go out purchase garment be not likely that danger will come tonight for must have given longer notice still may have have opportunity may not have known until last moment when attack be to take place say 'lose time cneius at once went to one of trader who dealt with native who came into town procured garment for berenice trader who knew by sight remarked have be purchasing more slave have need for dress for two person who have done service must have thought trader said must have preferred lighter colour cloth be sombre native although own cloth be for most part dark prefer when buy of brighter colour will do very well cneius said just at present roman colour cloth be not likely to be in demand among time be bad trader said there have be scarce native in shop for last ten day even among townspeople there have be little buying selling cneius returned to house slave carrying purchase behind on reaching home took parcel from carried to own cubicule then ordered slave to beg berenice to come down from apartment a desired to speak with chapter v sack of camalodunum upon morning of day fixed for gathering of iceni preparation be begun early at cardun ox swine be slaughtered great fire made woman in village be employed in making baking oaten cake upon hearth for day many of have be employed in making great store of fermented honey water men began to flock in from early hour by midday male of sarci capable of bearing arm have come in brought with supply of cooked meat cake sufficient to last for three four day in afternoon tribe began to pour in tribe under chief there be attempt at order regularity came trooping in in mass chief sometimes in chariot sometimes on horseback riding at head parta welcomed food be served out to men while chief be entertained in hall beric looking at wild figure rough uncouth powerful massive in frame be filled with regret that men knew nothing of discipline that circumstance have forced on war so suddenly contrast between wild figure disciplined veteran of rome whom have so often watched a performed exercise be striking indeed far inferior in height muscular power to tribesman legionary bore with proud consciousness in fighting power that alone went long way towards giving victory man trusted not only in on fellow believed that legion to belonged be invincible regular arm broad shield helmet added to appearance while massive formation a stood shoulder to shoulder shield touching shield seemed a if must defy utmost effort of undisciplined valour however beric thought with pride that own tribe sixteen hundred men have for six week be training incessantly must be match even for roman veteran inferiority in discipline be carried to such perfection among roman must be atoned for by superior strength activity only fear be that in excitement of battle must forget teaching breaking rank fight man for have however spared pain in impressing upon to do must be to throw away that have learned have not taught to fight in roman fashion said merely that might march in regular order astonish other tribesman that must be cool collected must be able patiently to stand shock of roman legion to fight not a scattered unit a solid whole will do well to bear in mind for to who disobey order break line when engaged with foe will show mercy order will be given to sergeant of ten men to run spear through man who stir from post whether in advance in retreat whether to slay to plunder time may come when safety of whole army depends upon standing like wall between roman man who advance from place in rank will a much a man who retreat endanger safety of over over again have impressed lesson upon sometimes have divided in two part engaged in mimic fight larger half representing tribesman advanced in ordinary fashion with loud shout cry while smaller section maintained solid formation with levelled spear five deep waited attack even who be least impressed with advantage of exercise through have be going must not feel how immensely superior be solid order how impossible must have be for assailant to burst through hedge of pointed weapon by sunset well nigh thirty thousand men have arrived subtribe passing through village taking up post on slope around where be at once supplied with food by woman with fighting men be large number of woman for generally accompanied briton on warlike expedition just at sunset shout arose from tribesman on north side of village boadicea with daughter chief councillor drove into village mien be proud lofty carried spear in hand sword in girdle have resumed royal ornament fillet of gold surrounded head garment be belted in with broad girdle of same metal wore heavy gold armlet bracelet looked with pride upon tribesman who thronged shouting to greet exclaimed a leapt from chariot day of vengeance be at hand fire blazed high night round cardun number of bard have accompanied tribe a not only have who lived in household of principal chief come in many have be attracted from country lying near border at fire therefore song be sung tale told of valour glory of hero of old mingled with be lament over evil day have befallen britain exhortation to hearer to avenge past prove worthy of ancestor in similar manner night be passed in parta hall here chief bard be assembled with tribal leader vied with other in stirring chant beric moved about among guest seeing that want be supplied while parta looked after who be gathered on dais beric learned from old chief aska who have first spoken to on day of arrival at sacred oak that britain be ripe for rising that messenger have be received not only from brigantes from many of southern western tribe with assurance that must rise a soon a heard that iceni have struck first blow trinobantes will join at camalodunum go well suetonius with legion be still in far west will make end of here before can return by time will have be joined by most of tribe will have force will be sufficient to destroy utterly army be leading that done there will be isolated fort to capture destroy then britain will be free from invader think will be so beric hope trust so beric replied think that success in first undertaking be certainty trust may defeat suetonius with such number a will put in field ought surely to be able to do so be not of present think so much a of future rome never submits to defeat will send army here to of suetonius must be handful if remain united utilize month must elapse before roman can arrive in preparing for conflict ought to be victorious feel sure that roman will try to reconquer britain quite sure in history there be not instance where have submitted to defeat be one of main reason of success be certain that at sacrifice will equip send out army that will believe powerful enough for purpose be many year after first invasion before came again be true in first two invasion did not conquer in first be forced to retire therefore came again in second have success enough to be able to claim victory so to retire with honour besides rome be vastly stronger more powerful now than be then believe aska struggle will be begun when have driven last roman from island must talk of again aska said a be upon that brunt of struggle will fall will have chief voice influence after be over boadicea will stand in place cunobeline held of chief king of island then a say much will depend on step take to prepare to resist next invasion young a be knowledge of roman way will render counsel valuable give great weight to advice wish to put in way in foreground beric said be still boy have wish to raise voice in council of chief what have learned of roman history roman law must gladly explain to who like speak with voice of authority whose wisdom recognize in morning boadicea said that report have be brought to of manner in beric have be teaching sarci to fight in roman fashion that must be glad to see result accordingly tribesman proceeded to open field mile away where have be accustomed to drill be followed by whole of gathered round village queen parta drove out in chariot when reached spot chief of other tribe at beric request called upon men to draw off leave space sufficient for exercise left sarci standing in scattered group over open space at one end of boadicea chief be gathered be now in position queen beric said of men unsuspecting danger will now warn that be about to be attacked that be to gather instantly to repel enemy taking conch slung over shoulder beric applied to lip blew three short note tribesman ran together there be a seemed to looker on scene of wild confusion for minute then be drawn up in company hundred strong in regular order short blast long one moved up together into mass five deep single note spear fell array of glistening point shone in front of shout of surprise approval rose from tribesman looking on to perfect order regularity seemed well nigh miraculous beric now advanced to line at order two rear rank stepped backwards few foot struck spear in ground then discharged javelin of man carried six over head of rank in front against enemy supposed to be advancing to attack then seizing spear fell into line again at order whole advanced at quick pace with levelled spear to charge keeping on till within few pace of where queen be standing halted suddenly raised spear again roar of applause came from tribesman be wonderful queen said have not thought that men must be taught so to move together be how roman fight beric be queen beric said exercise be exactly similar to of roman learnt by heart when be among order be exactly same a given in legion only of course be performed by trained soldier more perfectly than can a yet do be two month since began roman have practised for year have time must have seen much more perfect than at present have performed marvel said wish that have have more time that iceni not sarci only must have thus learned to meet enemy do not think so chief be wonderful one of chief said think that be not so terrifying to foe a rush of own men be better for resistance not so good for attack still have great merit think more suited for men who fight deliberately like roman than for own tribesman who be wont to rely for victory upon own strength valour what say beric queen asked must be presumptuous for to give opinion against of great chief beric said quietly so far strength valour have not in succeeded men of caractacus have be unavailing against solid roman line have never yet won great victory over roman yet have fought against valiantly none can say that briton be not a brave a strong a roman in battle have always outnumbered if have be beaten therefore have be surely because roman method of fighting be superior to own there be murmur of assent from several of chief beric argument be strong one queen said to one who have spoken must that iceni have learnt to fight in fashion however will have opportunity of seeing be right before have finished with roman march men back again beric beric sounded horn line facing half round became column marched in regular order back to village morning meal be now taken at midday march began boadicea with daughter parta other woman of rank went first in chariot sarci who a lying next to enemy country be allowed post of honour followed in column behind while rest of tribesman made way in miscellaneous crowd through forest halted among tree at distance of four mile from camalodunum then rested for attack be not to take place until daybreak on next morning late that evening two three woman of trinobantes came out in accordance with preconcerted arrangement to tell that there be suspicion at camalodunum of impending danger that although there be great uneasiness among inhabitant measure for defence have be taken that even precaution of sending away woman child have not be adopted fire have be lighted men slept in open air simply wrapping in mantle lying down under tree beric have long talk with boduoc ten of tribesman of latter company understand beric said at last if a expect surprise will be complete regular

along will be supposed that be wounded messenger of importance farewell cneius girl have already mounted chariot driver now gave horse rein started at full speed beric turned re entered town slowly in day pity for vanquished be sentiment little comprehended have certainly not learned among roman who frequently massacred prisoner wholesale woe to vanquished be almost maxim with beric shrank from witnessing scene now that table be turned upon oppressor nationally hated roman individually have feeling against have have power must at once have arrested effusion of blood wished to drive from kingdom not to massacre knew well that have power whatever in such matter even own tribesman must not have stayed hand at command to slay roman be to far more meritorious action than to slay wolf one who urged mercy must have be regarded not only a weakling a traitor already work be well nigh done pouring in on side into city iceni have burst into house slain occupant whether resisted not few men here there sold life dearly great majority have be too panic stricken with sudden danger to attempt slightest resistance of inhabitant whose house be near temple have fled thither for refuge before assailant reached in hour from striking of first blow troop there be sole survivor of population of camalodunum for present temple be disregarded be known that garrison did not exceed four hundred men there be fear of so small body assuming offensive work of destruction have commenced there be little plundering for briton despised roman luxury of greater part of did not even comprehend use be roman therefore to be hated a well a despised save therefore weapon be highly prized gold ornament be taken a trinket for woman at home nothing be saved a defender of house be slain fire be applied to hanging curtain then assailant hurried away in search of fresh victim thus work of destruction proceeded concurrently with of massacre a sun rose vast column of smoke mounting upwards conveyed news to woman of iceni trinobantes for circle of many mile round that attack have be successful camalodunum seat of oppressor be in flame beric a made way towards centre of town sighed a passed shop where two month before have stopped moment to look at roll of vellum destruction of monument of roman luxury house with costly content even palace of cunobeline have be converted into residence of roman governor have not affected mourned over loss of precious manuscript have contained wealth of stored up learning already house be wrapped in flame be rushing from window prize have looked upon a own special share of plunder have escaped at edge of broad open space surrounded temple of claudius briton be gathering thickly beric applied horn to lip in few minute sarci gathered round bidding stand in order moved away to see what disposition be being made for attack on temple at present be too excited with success for to assume lead give order at first rush party of briton have made for temple have be received with shower of dart stone have be met on step by roman soldier roughly repulsed walking round came upon chariot of boadicea queen be flushed with excitement gratified vengeance be shaking spear menacingly towards temple eye presently fell upon beric work have begun well young chief have still to crush wolf in den be strong place with massive wall unpierced save by doorway at end will have out if to do so be forced to tear down stone by stone trust that will not be a long a must take queen beric said for have other work to do just at moment one of chief of trinobantes came up queen boadicea said crave that may be allowed to storm temple be built on ground a sign of subjection must fain capture be so queen replied do undertake task at once trinobantes who have joined iceni in attack on town presently gathered with loud shout under chief rushed at temple from roof dart stone be showered down upon though many be killed swarmed up broad step surrounded on side attacked door beric shook head returning to men led off down one of broad street to open space short distance away will be gathering place said wander far away return quickly at sound of horn may be wanted presently think that trinobantes will take temple in fashion have indeed advanced entirely unprovided with proper mean of assault massive gate against roman have piled stone cask of provision other heavy article be not to be broken down by such force a briton must bring against in vain chopped with sword upon woodwork gate be constructed of oak weapon scarce marked in vain threw twenty abreast against door hardly quivered at shock in meantime assailant be suffering heavily for from opening in roof extending from building to pillar surrounded roman dropped missile upon for time trinobantes persevered then chief seeing that attempt be hopeless called off follower fresh attempt be made for time boadicea established in one of few house have escaped flame there presently chief assembled various suggestion be made at last be decided to batter in door with heavy tree strong party of men be at once despatched to fell prepare two of suitable size operation be long one a tree when found have to be brought down by lighting fire against trunk be nightfall before fell branch be cut off be decided therefore to postpone attack until next day beric have not be present at council to only few of leading chief have be summoned doubted when heard what have be decided upon whether attack must be successful be settled that trinobantes be to attack door at one end of temple iceni at other late in evening chariot returned beric be greatly relieved to hear that fugitive have be placed in safety that journey have be made without interference be glad to recover torque for absence must have excited surprise when men mind be le occupied excited not until recovered must go to see parta who be lodged with queen a soon a recovered went in sign of roman habitation luxury have be a far a possible obliterated by order of boadicea before entered house hanging have be pulled down statue overthrown painting on plaster chipped from wall what have be doing day beric mother asked looked to see long before must have thought that accident have befallen have not known that news must have be speedily brought have be so have be looking after tribesman mother must have come in to see did not wish to intrude among chief in council with queen represented sarci here have be wanted must have sent for who be to attack temple tomorrow not sarci son unser begged that tribe might have honour queen council granted to be glad of mother duty be honourable one loss will be heavy others can do work a well a must want to keep men for shock of battle with legion moreover doubt whether door will be battered down in way propose do beric why be that speaker be aska who have just left group of chief gathered round queen at other end of apartment have come close without beric hearing lad coloured spoke only for mother hearing sir said to one else must have ventured to express opinion on course agreed upon by who be older wiser than be right beric young must be silent in presence of elder nevertheless must like to know why think assault be likely to fail be really not own opinion be giving sir be thinking of manner in roman who be accustomed to besiege place with high wall strong gate proceed have made matter study while to attack upon place be altogether new seeing that none such exist in britain save roman have erected how must proceed beric must treat attack upon place a serious matter not to be undertaken rashly hastily only after great preparation in order to batter down gate wall use heavy beam such a have be prepared for tomorrow affix to head shoe of iron brass swing upon men arm seeing that must be most difficult to get so many men to exercise strength together indeed must not give momentum required propose to have beam carried by fifty men for to rush forward together drive against door if door be weak must yield to first blow might avail beric said unless doe so shock will throw down tree men bearing many will be grievously hurt moreover if a will surely be case many of bearer fall under dart of roman a approach others will stumble over body speed of whole be greatly checked then can tell how roman act in case beric yes sir have frequently heard relation of siege from soldier who have taken part in build in first place movable tower shed running on wheel tower be made strong enough to resist stone missile besieged may hurl against under cover of shelter men push up tower to door wall to be battered beam be then slung on rope hanging from inside of tower other rope be attached number of men take hold of working together swing beam backwards forward so that time strike wall door heavy blow a beam be of great weight many men work blow be well nigh irresistible strongest wall crumble most massive gate splinter under shock of iron head roman truly be skilled warrior aska said be child in art of war beside methinks must be difficult indeed for to construct machine though mayhap must be done have with many men skilled in making of chariot sometimes beric must have occasion to attack place where such machine must not well be used in case sir sometimes make what call tortoise soldier link broad shield together so a to form complete covering resembling back of tortoise under shelter of advance to attack when reach foot of wall remain immovable save in front line who labour with iron bar to loosen stone at foot of wall protected from missile from above by shield of comrade from time to time be relieved by fresh worker until foundation of wall be deeply undermined a proceed erect massive prop to keep up wall finally fill up hole with combustible after lighting retire when prop be consumed wall of course fall then rush forward climb breach truly beric have profited by lesson aska said laying hand kindly on lad shoulder druid spoke wisely when prophesied great future for before have done may have many roman stronghold to capture when do will see that council order that advice be taken a to how will be attacked in matter tomorrow thing must remain a be unser be proud chief headstrong must not brook interference must be repulsed in assault will advise queen to call up sarci allow to proceed in own manner will do best sir time be needed for proceeding according to first roman method shield be too small for second place must be taken by tomorrow night for cerealis will assuredly move with legion to relieve a soon a hears news of attack be have be in mind aska said well what do say beric after what saw other day of movement have taught tribe must be sorry to have rank thinned in hopeless attack upon temple must rather that must leave for present march out to meet cerealis leaving guard here to keep roman hemmed in until have time to deal with beric stood for minute two without answering then said will undertake sir with sarci must unser attack fail chapter vi first success upon leaving mother beric returned to spot where sarci be lying of chief be sitting round fire made of beam woodwork dragged from ruin of roman house must be up hour before daybreak think that there will be work for tomorrow if unser tribe fail in capturing temple be to try there will be preparation to make explained plan upon have determined daylight be just breaking when sarci entered forest four mile from camalodunum here scattered in search of dry wood in two hour sufficient have be gathered for purpose be made up into two hundred great faggot nearly four foot across ten in length in weight a much a strong man must carry on head with returned to city needed question a to result of attack have just terminated with same fortune have befallen that on day previous unser have be killed large number of men have fallen in vain attempt to hew down gate battering ram have proved complete failure many of fifty men who carried beam have fallen a advanced others have rushed at gate door recoil have thrown down many have have limb broken from tree falling on attempt have be made to repeat assault roman having pierced under part of roof in many place let fall javelin poured down boiling oil at last having done be possible in vain tribesman have fallen back beric proceeded at once to queen council be being held have just be determined to march away to meet cerealis when beric entered aska left place in circle of chief a soon a saw enter door be ready to undertake beric do so unless have strong hope of success repulse of yesterday today have lowered spirit of men failure must still further harm will undertake aska think can answer for success will need three hour before begin must be spared chief said cerealis will not have learned news until last night at earliest may not know yet there be fear of arriving here until tomorrow then returned to place before finally decide queen said must tell that young chief beric be ready to attack place with sarci have learned much of roman method may be more fortunate than others have be must suggest that be allowed to try for will have very ill effect upon tribe if fail in taking temple be regarded a symbol of roman dominion will even go so far a to say that retreat now must go very far to mar hope of success in war for news must spread through country dispirit others now preparing to join why must beric succeed when unser have failed one of chief said can lad achieve success where one of best bravest chief have be repulsed think that might aska replied at rate a be ready to risk life tribe in doing so pray queen to give consent demand three hour to make preparation for attack will try boadicea said decidedly saw other day chief how well have learned roman method of war will have opportunity now of turning knowledge to account parta be willing that son must try certainly be willing parta said can die once can not die in nobler effort for country then be settled queen said sarci will attack in three hour a soon a beric heard decision hurried away at once ordered tribesman to scatter through country to kill two hundred of cattle roaming at present masterless to strip off hide bring in returned before three hour expired bringing in hide in meantime beric have procured from half consumed warehouse quantity of oil pitch other combustible have smeared faggot with on arrival of men with hide be bound with raw side upwards over faggot two hundred of strongest men of tribe be then chosen divided into two party rest being similarly divided took station at end of square facing gate when beric sounded horn faggot bearer raised burden on to head formed in close square ten abreast with faggot touching other beric commanded party facing principal entrance holding blazing torch in hand took place in centre of square there being ample room for between line of men rest of tribe be ordered to stand firmly in order until gave signal for advance then again sounded horn two party advanced from opposite end of square a soon a came within reach roman showered down dart javelin slipped altogether from surface of wet hide penetrating went short distance into faggot british tribesman raised shout of exultation a two solid body advanced unshaken to step of temple mounting advanced to gate in vain roman dropped javelin perpendicularly through hole in ceiling of colonnade in vain poured down stream of boiling oil have proved so fatal to last attack javelin failed to penetrate oil streamed harmless off hide men have before advancing received minute instruction ten men in front line piled faggot against door then keeping close to wall of temple slipped round to side colonnade operation be repeated by next line so on until two line remained then two men at end of line mounted pile of faggot placed burden there leaving six standing in centre beric have place now kneeling down under shelter applied torch to pile waited till saw flame beginning to mount up then gave word six men dropped faggot to ground with ran swiftly to side colonnade where be in shelter a roman knowing must not be attacked here have made opening in ceiling above briton be frantic with delight when saw column of smoke followed by tongue of flame mounting from end of temple higher higher flame mounted till licked ceiling above for hour fire continued by end of time there be glowing mass of ember through without must soon see right into temple door obstacle behind have be destroyed a soon a be aware by shout of countryman that faggot be well in blaze beric have sounded horn tribesman from colonnade have run across open unmolested by dart of roman who be too panic stricken at danger threatened to pay heed to movement beric be received with loud acclamation by iceni be escorted by shouting multitude to queen who have taken place at point where must watch operation held out hand to have succeeded beric said thanks of here nay of britain be due to in hour temple will be open to attack hardly in time queen replied faggot will doubtless have done work by then will be hour before ember stonework will be sufficiently cool to enable men to pas over to assault can wait queen said messenger who left camp of cerealis at daybreak have just arrived at hour nothing be known to roman of attack here will not now arrive until tomorrow not until afternoon be considered that entrance must be cool enough to pas through then sarci prepared for attack binding piece of raw hide under foot to protect from heated stonework be formed ten abreast beric took place before front line of one of column with levelled spear advanced at run towards door shower of missile saluted from roof fell rest pressing on in close order dashed through gateway flung upon roman soldier drawn up to oppose passage resistance be feeble roman have entirely lost heart must not for moment sustain weight of charge be swept away from entrance briton poured in standing in group roman defended in desperation effort be vain in five minute last defender of place be slain a soon a fight be over whole of iceni rushed tumultuously forward with exultant shout filled temple then horn sounded lane be made a boadicea followed by chief chieftainesses entered temple queen face be radiant with triumph must have spoken shouting be so loud that near must not obtain silence understood however when advancing to statue of god stood behind altar waved spear in instant tribesman swarmed round statue rope be attached to massive figure jupiter mar minerva fell to ground with crash a did statue of emperor claudius mighty shout hailed downfall god of briton insulted outraged be avenged upon of rome altar of mona have streamed with blood of druid of camalodunum be wet with gore of roman legionary statue be broken to piece altar torn down then chief ordered tribesman to fetch in faggot thousand went to forest while others pulled down detached house shed have escaped flame dragged beam woodwork to temple by enormous pile of faggot be raised round of eight interior column that in two line supported roof torch be applied by boadicea two daughter of principal druid in short time interior of temple be glowing furnace beam of ceiling roof soon ignited flame shot up high into air day trinobantes have be pouring in perfect frenzy of delight reigned among great crowd looking on at destruction of temple have be raised to signify celebrate subjugation of britain woman with flowing hair performed wild dance of triumph rushed about a if possessed with madness uttering prophecy of total destruction of roman others foamed at mouth fell in convulsion while men be scarcely le excited over success messenger have already brought in news that at midday cerealis have learned that camalodunum have be attacked that legion be to start on following morning to relieve town news have be taken to by one of trinobantes who have received instruction from aska be to say that town have suddenly be attacked that many have fallen greater portion of population have escaped to temple have be vainly attacked by iceni object of news be to induce cerealis to move out from fortified camp chief felt difficulty of assaulting position though have dreaded arrival of cerealis before temple be taken be anxious that must set out a soon a saw that beric plan of attack have succeeded that temple be now open to assault at midnight roof of temple fell in nothing remained bare wall column surrounding chief ordered follower to make way through still burning town to gather by tribe outside defensive work there lie down until morning when must march to meet legion of cerealis at daybreak be again afoot on march southward swollen by accession of trinobantes by arrival during last two day of tribe who have be too late to join rest at british force now numbered at least fifty thousand be great army beric boduoc said exultingly a moved forward be great host beric replied must that be army have all even a much training a men must feel confident in future surely be confident now beric have begun well have scarcely begun at beric said what have done destroyed sleeping town captured by mean of fire temple defended by four hundred men will win today doubt men be wrought up by success roman be little prepared to meet such force doubt not that will beat to crush legion be not to defeat rome hope boduoc feel confident look back at sarci then look round at disordered host well roman in discipline order exceed sarci a much a exceed rest of iceni will be led by general trained in war be led by chief whose only idea of war be to place at head of tribe rush against enemy whether courage great number can compensate for want of discipline remains to be seen history of rome tell that have never done so yet after five hour marching fleet footed scout sent on ahead brought in news that roman be approaching halt be called chief assembled round queen chariot in council beric be summoned by messenger from queen must always attend council said when came up have proved that young a be posse knowledge of war that more than compensates for lack of year have right after capturing temple for to take for sarci post of honour in today battle choose for know roman where do think have better fight think must not do better than await here said stand on rising ground one of trinobantes to whom have just spoken say that there be swamp away on left of front so that roman horseman can not advance in direction must attack in face on left flank closing in thickly so a to prevent horseman from breaking out on to plain at right then falling upon in rear since be good enough to say may choose post for sarci will hold where stand then must others fail to break roman front will move down upon check advance while rest attack flank answer pleased of chief who felt jealous of honour small tribe have gained on previous day be afraid that beric must have chosen to head attack doe plan please boadicea asked be a well a one of chief said let sarci look on time while destroy enemy must have thought beric must have chosen for tribe post of honour in attack roman always keep best troop in reserve beric said quietly in hard fight be reserve decides fate of battle then let be so boadicea said be swamp that speak of deep be not too deep for men to cross one of chief of trinobantes said assuredly horseman must not pas through very well then let trinobantes attack by falling upon roman on right iceni will attack in front sarci will remain where stand until beric see need for to advance in few minute roman legion be seen advancing with portion of cavalry in front rest in rear queen whose chariot be placed in front of line raised spear tremendous shout be raised by briton with wild cry tribe poured down to attack while woman clustered on slope have left added shrill cry of encouragement to din roman who believing that briton be still engaged in attack on camalodunum have expectation of meeting on march halted stood uncertain a mass of briton poured down to attack then trumpet sounded again advanced cavalry in rear moving forward to join in advance before accomplished briton be upon shower of dart be poured in horseman unable to stand onslaught rode into space between company of infantry who moving outwards forming solid column on flank protected from assault of foe briton after pouring in shower of javelin flung sword in hand upon roman infantry with levelled spear showed so solid front that be unable to break through while from behind spearmen light armed roman troop poured volley of missile among boadicea called beric to side be a said beric order in roman fight be wonderful see how steadily hold together be like wild boar attacked by dog will be overwhelmed see how dart fly how bravely iceni be fighting tribesman indeed be attacking with desperate bravery seizing head of spear attempted to wrest from holder to thrust aside push forward within striking distance sometimes partially succeeded though first might fall others rushing in behind reached roman pressed backwards reserve be brought up line restored then slowly steadily roman moved forward although partial success have at point attended who attacked in flank front of column with serried spear held way on in spite of effort of briton to arrest movement presently supply of javelin of assailant began to fail assault upon head of column to grow more feeble while shout of roman soldier rose above cry of assailant now be time for to move down beric said if can arrest advance flank will be broken in before long now men shouted a returned to place at head of sarci now be time to show that can meet roman in own fashion move slowly down to attack let man hasten pace let keep place in rank four company will attack roman in front others in column five deep will march down till face roman flank then will march at spear down break in beric sounded bugle ten deep four hundred men moved steadily down to attack of roman five front rank marched with levelled spear behind prepared to hurl dart over head when within fifty yard of enemy sarci raised battle cry iceni engaged with roman in front seeing hedge of spear advancing behind hurriedly ran off at flank sarci advanced to attack roman halted involuntarily astonished at spectacle never before have encountered barbarian advancing in formation similar to own sight of tall figure advancing almost naked to assault for briton always threw off garment before fighting filled with something like consternation at shout of officer however again got into motion met briton firmly additional length beric have given to spear of sarci now proved of vital advantage bearing steadily onward brought roman to standstill while javelin from british rear rank fell thick fast among gradually roman be pressed backwards quickly a gap be filled up by behind until charging shout of sarci on flank be heard beric blew horn men with answering shout pressed forward faster cry of victory rising a roman gave way still latter fought stubbornly until triumphant yell confused shout told that flank have given way under attack of briton then beric horn sounded again slow advance be converted into charge rank behind closed up before weight impetus of rush roman line be broken then impetuosity of sarci must no longer be restrained in vain beric blew horn flinging down spear drawing sword briton flung on broken mass other tribesman pouring in tumultuously behind for few minute desperate conflict raged man fighting for number prevailed roman shout became feebler war cry of briton louder more triumphant in ten minute fight be over more than two thousand roman soldier lay dead while cerealis cavalry bursting way through assailant alone escaped galloping off at full speed towards refuge of fortified camp exultation of briton knew bound have for first time since roman set foot on shore beaten in fair fight in open there be rush to collect arm shield helmet of fallen roman two of sarci presently brought standard of legion to beric follow with said extricating from throng ascended slope to where boadicea surrounded with woman who be dancing joining in triumphant chant of victory be still standing in chariot here be roman standard emblem of victory beric said a approached chariot boadicea sprang down advancing to embraced warmly victory be yours beric said keep two eagle fix in hall so that child child may point to with pride say 'it be beric chief of sarci who first overthrew roman in field there be time to be lost turned to charioteer who carried horn sound summons for chief to assemble there be several missing for briton have suffered heavily in first attack chief said let not lose instant press on after roman let strike before recover from confusion surprise catus decianus may be in camp while seek other spoil must have to wreak vengeance on see that party remain to look to wounded such a need be taken to home in wagon horn be at once sounded tribesman flocked back to position from have charged resumed garment then march be continued presented strange appearance now almost man have taken possession of portion other of roman arm have helmet others shield others breastplate sword spear helmet however be speedily taken off slung behind head of iceni being vastly larger than of roman tallest of whom overtopped by fully six inch arm of officer who commanded under cerealis be offered to beric refused fight to drive roman from land said not for spoil nothing of theirs will touch will return to forest when be over just a left by evening approached roman camp portion of legion have be left there when cerealis set out in light of setting sun helmet spearhead must be seen above massive palisade rose on top of outwork briton halted mile away fire be lighted men sat down to feast upon meat have be brought in wagon from camalodunum then council be held a rule british council be attended by able bodied men power of chief except in actual war be very small for briton like gaulish ancestor considered man to be equal have voice in management of affair thus chief have before taking up arm held council of tribesman be only after have given vote for war that possessed distinct power control when council began one of chief of trinobantes be asked first to give minute description of roman camp work be formidable surrounding be broad deep fosse into stream be turned beyond there be double vallum wall of earth so steep a to be climbed with great difficulty in hollow between two wall sharp stake be set thickly together second wall be higher than first completely commanded along top ran solid palisade of massive beam behind earth be banked up to within three half foot from top affording stand for archer slinger spearmen council be animated great majority of chief be in favour of leaving formidable position untouched falling upon place offered chance of easier capture british in tribal war fought largely for sake of plunder in first burst of fury at camalodunum have contrary to custom sought only to destroy thirst for blood be now appeased longed for rich spoil of roman city a trophy of victory to adorn woman chief represented that already many of bravest tribesman have fallen must be folly to risk heavy loss in attack upon position what matter argued if two three hundred roman be left there for present must do harm must be either captured by force obliged to surrender by hunger after suetonius roman army have be destroyed not day must be lost contended in marching upon verulamium after london must be sacked for although far inferior in size importance to camalodunum verulamium be rising town inhabited by large number of merchant trader who imported good from gaul distributed over country beric opinion be in favour of instant assault in be supported by aska two three of older chief majority be other way policy of leaving altogether fortified post garrisoned by roman to be dealt with after roman army have be met destroyed be decided upon one of argument employed be that while capture of place must be attended with considerable loss must add little to effect that news of destruction of chief roman town must have upon tribe throughout whole country must take so long that suetonius might return in time to succour most important place before work be done aska walked away from council with beric have decided wrongly said think much matter beric replied everything hang at present upon result of battle with suetonius if win detached fort must surrender if lose what matter think will lose beric say that beric said see how be today iceni made more impression upon roman column than if have be attacking wall hindered by very number by time meet roman number will be multiplied by five perhaps by ten will be stronger thereby will not rather confusion be greater today roman horse fled have charged among small a be number what confusion must have made in rank single briton be match for single roman more ten roman fighting in order might repel assault of hundred a number multiply so doe advantage of discipline increase hope for victory aska can not say that feel confident of marching next morning against verulamium arrived there in afternoon at once attacked resistance be feeble bursting through in several place iceni trinobantes spread over town slaughtering found not only roman gaul settled in city such briton a have adopted roman custom be put to sword city be then sacked set on fire be now decided that instead of turning towards london must march west in order that might be joined by other tribe on way meet suetonius returning from wale there be haste in movement advanced by easy stage number swelling day tribe after tribe joining a news spread of capture destruction of two chief roman town defeat annihilation of one of legion so marched until fortnight after capture of verulamium news arrived that suetonius marching with speed towards east have already passed gathering up on way garrison of fortified post then great host turned marched east again beric regretted deeply course have be taken have garrison be attacked destroyed separately army must have to encounter must have be little more than strength of suetonius must be able to put into field when collected garrison briton troubled in way regarded victory a certain expressed exultation that must crush roman at one blow in open field instead of being forced to undertake number of separate siege still marching easily came down upon valley of thames followed until arrived at london have expected that suetonius must give battle before arrived there have indeed passed through town few day previously have disregarded prayer of inhabitant to remain for protection allowed male who chose to do so to enlist in rank permitted others to accompany army wished before fighting to be joined by cerealis survivor of legion by garrison of other fortified post briton therefore fell upon london slaughtered inhabitant sacked burned town be calculated that here in two roman city le than person have be slain accomplished great host again set out in search of suetonius be accompanied now by vast train of wagon chariot carrying woman spoil beric be not present at sack of london a approached town became known that suetonius have marched away that there must be resistance struck off north since have left verulamium tribesman have given up marching in military order be very proud of credit have gained in battle with roman said that did not see use in marching tediously abreast when there be enemy near beric having power to compel told that of course must do a liked that must speedily forget have learned impatience of restraint of kind of doing anything unless perfectly disposed to do be british characteristic be too strong many be influenced by scoff of newcomer who not having seen in day of battle asked scornfully if sarci be slave that must obey order like roman soldier boduoc although have objected to drill at first have scoffed at idea of men fighting better because kept even distance from other marched with same foot forward have now become enthusiast in favour raged at falling away beric said be use being angry

if will be happy will be free from trouble await unfortunate land chapter vii defeat of briton london be heap of ash when beric arrived there have be trading place rather than town here be roman house temple with massive stone work consisted only of large collection of wooden structure inhabited by merchant trader lay upon knoll rising above low swampy ground covered by sea at high water for not till long afterwards did roman erect bank dammed back water confined within regular channel opposite shore be similarly covered with water at high tide forest extended a far a eye must reach london in fact occupied what be at high water peninsula connected with mainland only by shoulder extending back to hill beyond separated by deep channel on west from similar promontory be position that properly fortified by strong wall across isthmus must have be held against host roman have not a yet taken in hand later however recognized importance of position made one of chief seat of power even in three day that have be absent beric found that host have considerably increased tribe of sussex kent a heard of approach of army have flocked in to join to share in plunder of london day be spent in feasting rejoicing then army moved northward consisted now of well nigh two hundred thousand fighting men vast crowd of woman with huge train of wagon two day later news reached of spot where suetonius have taken up position be awaiting attack army at once pressed forward in direction at nightfall bivouacked two mile away from beric taking boduoc with went forward to examine be at point where valley opened into plain side of valley be steep thickly wooded be only in front that attack must well be delivered what think of beric boduoc asked suetonius relies upon folly beric said be sure that will advance upon a tumultous mob a small portion can act at once number will count little position must be bad one have skill forethought be commander tomorrow must before advancing to attack send great number round on side to make way through wood so to attack on flank to pour down valley in rear at same time that main body attacked in front then position must be fatal one attacked in front rear overwhelmed by dart from wood on flank position must be well nigh desperate not man must escape must overwhelm boduoc said what can ten thousand men do against host like ours may be so boduoc yet feel by mean sure of at rate must prepare for defeat a well a victory if be beaten cause of britain will be lost a advance without order will fly without order tribe will disperse to home even more quickly than have gathered of one thing may be sure roman vengeance will be terrible have brought disgrace defeat upon have destroyed chief city have massacred ten of thousand mercy will be shown chiefly will vengeance fall upon iceni when return to camp go among men ask whether mean to fight tomorrow a fought cerealis whether will fight in fashion of rest fear wild a be with enthusiasm assurance of victory will not consent to be kept in reserve will be eager to be in front of attack will go with will do best to persuade if insist on fighting in own way then will go to one by one will form if can body if only hundred strong to keep if need be retreat together in speed can outrun heavy armed roman soldier with ease cavalry will scour plain keeping together however can repel with lance make good escape will first make for home load with grain driving cattle before taking woman child make for swamp lie to northwest of limit there can defend against roman for length of time speak a if defeat be certain boduoc said reproachfully not at boduoc prudent man prepares for fortune be only fool look upon one side only hope for victory prepare for defeat who like to return to home remain there to be slaughtered by roman can do so intend to fight to last upon rejoining sarci beric called together asked whether wished on following day to rush into battle to remain in solid order in reserve reply be that wished for share of glory did hold aloof until battle be done enemy annihilated must be pointed out a men who have feared to take share in combat when meeting have dispersed beric boduoc went among said nothing about advantage holding together must be in case of defeat pointed out honour have gained by deciding issue of last battle begged to remain in solid body so possibly might again decide battle a to disgrace have already shown how well must fight that none must say that fear have influenced decision altogether two hundred agreed to retain rank with beric be satisfied then went off to find mother who be a usual with queen must not hear of possibility of defeat what said be briton so poor unmanly race even when twenty to one can not conquer foe must not believe of expect mother be best to be prepared for may happen then told of arrangement have made may be right beric in preparing for worst will take part in queen have sworn will not survive defeat will will not live to see country bound in roman chain free woman have lived free woman will die will gladly quit troubled life for shore of happy island beric be silent for minute seek to alter determination mother a for so long a can lift sword will continue to struggle against roman will not meet tomorrow when battle once begin will be confusion there must be no finding other in vast crowd if victory be ours will meet afterwards if defeat will make for cardun where if change mind will hope to meet then will march with who will for swamp of ely where doubtless large number of fugitive will gather for unless roman drive causeway into very heart can scarce penetrate in other way so sure be briton of victory that council be held that night there be enemy have only to rush upon destroy returning to men beric met aska have just be over to camp to see beric have talked with boduoc who told frankly that did not share general assurance of easy victory do after what saw other day how dashed vainly against roman line tell that men save small party have determined to fight tomorrow in front line with rest lament over must make difference in result beric said in so great mass a must be lost even if must make way to front fall upon roman in solid body number be too small to decide issue at least might have day gone against have drawn off in good order will take station with aska said have a iceni know be great fighter in time will leave to younger men tomorrow to win battle authority may aid yours methinks that if win tomorrow none can say that be wrong to stand aloof from first charge if aska stood beside thanking chief warmly for promise beric returned to sarci feasting be kept up night at daybreak briton be on foot forming in tribe advanced within mile of roman position then halted boadicea with daughter chief moved along front exhorting to great deed recalling to oppression tyranny of roman indignity that have inflicted upon daughter address be answered by loud shout from tribesman in meantime wagon have moved out drew up in vast semicircle behind troop so a to enable woman who crowded to get view of victory so great be following that wagon be ranged four five deep beric have drawn up men who have agreed to fight in order in solid mass in front of tribe be nearly on extreme left of british position aska have taken place by side mother a in chariot passed along behind boadicea waved hand to then pointed towards roman look aska said presently do see that deep line of wagon forming round in case of disaster will block up retreat madness have seized people one must think that be strife of gladiator at rome rather than battle between two nation there will be retreat way for if disaster come must make off between horn of crescent roman be there only can draw off in body be so beric chief said see queen have reached end of line wave spear a signal thundering shout arose mingled with shrill cry of encouragement from woman then like torrent briton rushed to attack in confused mass tribe striving to be first to attack roman sarci from behind company joined in rush there be confusion in rank many of men being carried away by enthusiasm shout exhortation of beric aska boduoc steadied again in regular order marched after host in five minute uproar of battle swelled high in front beric marched up valley until arrived at rear of great mass of men who be swarming in front of roman line man striving to get to front to hurl dart join in struggle roman have drawn up twelve deep across valley heavy armed spearmen in front lighter troop behind latter replying with missile to storm of dart that briton poured upon with desperate effort assailant strove to break through hedge of spear bravest flung upon roman weapon died there striving in vain to break line for hour fight continued roman wall remained unbroken immovable fresh combatant have taken place of in front until have exhausted store of javelin in vain chief attempted to induce follower to gather thickly together to make rush din be too great for voice to be heard tribesman be half mad with fury at failure of own effort to break roman line beric strove many time to bring up company in mass through crowd to front pressure be too great none must give way where sought to get near foe rather than break up remained in rear in spite of eager cry of men to be allowed to break up push way singly forward what can do alone shouted to more than others be doing together in order might succeed broken must be useless if huge army can not break line what must two hundred men do at last a storm of javelin began to dwindle mighty shout rose from roman shoulder to shoulder with levelled spear advanced while flank giving way cavalry burst out on side fell upon briton for in front pressed by mass behind there be falling back fell a stood under roman spear stubbornly for time tribesman fought with sword target a line pressed forward horseman cut way through struggling mass panic began to seize tribe longest conquered by roman first gave way movement rapidly spread many for time desperately opposed advance of roman whose triumphant shout rose loudly gradually melted away vast crowd of warrior became mob of fugitive roman pressing hotly with cry of victory vengeance upon rear beric little band be swept away like foam before wave of fugitive for time attempted to stem current when beric saw that be in vain shouted to tribesman to keep in close body to press towards left be comparatively free fortunately roman horse have plunged in more towards centre ground be open for retreat thousand of flying men be making towards rear with great effort succeeded in crossing tide of fugitive in passing through outside semicircle of wagon here halted for moment while beric climbing on end wagon surveyed scene there be longer resistance among briton great semicircle within line of wagon be crowded by throng of fugitive behind whom at run now roman legion be advancing maintaining order even at rapid pace outside sweep of wagon woman with cry of terror be flying in direction horse alarmed by din be plunging struggling while driver vainly endeavoured to extricate from close line of vehicle be lost for present said to aska let make for north be useless to delay men to try to fight must be to throw away life uselessly will do more good by preserving to fight upon day keep closely together will have roman cavalry upon before long only by holding to rank can hope to repel many of woman from nearest wagon rushed in among men placing in centre band went off at steady trot must maintain for hour din behind be terrible shout of roman mingled with cry of briton loud shriek of woman plain be already thick with fugitive consisting of woman from outside wagon men who have made way through mass of struggling animal here there chariot be dashing across plain at full gallop looking back from rise of ground mile from battlefield saw few party of roman horse scouring plain main body be scattered round confused mass by wagon there will be few escape aska said throwing up arm in despair wagon have proved death trap have not be for army must have scattered over country though roman horse might have cut down many greater number must have gained wood escaped wagon held just a thin line of men will hold wolf till hunter arrive hem in cart crowded with woman plunging horse in line three four deep have indeed checked first fugitive then came others crowding in upon then before gap wide enough to let through must be forced roman horse be round upon pause that beric made have be momentary band kept on at rapid pace until wood be reached be safe from pursuit then a halted gave way to sorrow anguish threw down lay motionless others walked up down with wild gesture broke into imprecation against god who have deserted called despairingly name of wife daughter who have be among spectator in fatal line of wagon woman sat in group weeping none of belonged to iceni kinsfolk friend have a believed perished in fight think that queen have fallen aska asked beric may have made way out beric said saw chariot driving across plain must be carried back by first fugitive may be that managed to clear way through wagon for with if be alive doubtless mother be by side if queen have escaped aska said will be to die by own hand instead of by of roman be sure that will not survive day there be nothing else left for tribe be destroyed country lost insulted humiliated boadicea must never demand life from roman mother will certainly die with beric said must say that party will willingly share fate for chief leader there will be mercy for time doubtless will be slaughtered who fall into roman hand after time sword will be stayed for land will be useless to without men to cultivate when roman hand be tired of slaying policy will prevail be best to speak to men aska for to be moving on will address old chief moved towards men raising hand called to at first few obeyed summons a proceeded roused gathered round for reputation in tribe be great assured tone in spoke revived spirit men of sarci said be time for wailing lamentation god of britain have deserted of terrible day defeat none of disgrace rest upon honour of victory won be yours though small subtribe name of sarci rang through britain a of bravest in land have of tribe obeyed young chief fought together today a have fought before may be that defeat must have be averted stood firmly by when others fell away stand here without loss of man safe in forest ready to meet roman again be fortunate in having such leader may tell have counsel prevailed must not now be mourning defeat old chief with long year of experience believed what said young though be saw that to fight in confused multitude on field be to court almost certain defeat thus then placed by side relying upon skill in arm bravery throwing fortune in with yours be not mistaken have not firmly kept together followed instruction too must have be inclosed in vast throng of fugitive hemmed in among wagon slaughtered by roman footman in rear cut down by horse if broke through line of wagon may ask what be there to live for may say that cause of britain be lost that tribe be well nigh destroyed that many of have lost wife family a well be true yet men be not lost great a may have be slaughter large number must have escaped many of have still wife family at home before aught else be thought of must be taken to place of safety until first outburst of roman vengeance have passed have beric be sole leader of briton from first there must be need of fearing vengeance for in case none of woman child must have be slain must be now in hand a hostage be past say only to show how wise far seeing a well a how brave leader in battle be young chief of yours while others be dreaming only of easy victory over roman have be preparing for what have best be done in case of defeat to return to home must be to court death if be to die at hand of roman be best that must die fighting to end have therefore arranged that will seek refuge in fen country form western boundary of land of iceni there can find stronghold into roman can never force way thence can sally out in turn take vengeance there will rally round hundred of other brave men till grow to force may again make head against roman there at least will live a free men die a free men shout of approval broke from men need not starve aska went on river abound with fish swamp with waterfowl there be island among swamp where land be dry can construct hut three day since when foresaw that might be that refuge must be needed beric despatched messenger home with order that herd of three hundred cattle of a many swine must be driven to spot near swamp for propose to make will there be found awaiting there be again chorus of approval one of men stepping forward said beric be young be great chief will follow wherever will take will swear to be faithful obedient to man raised right arm towards sky with loud shout swore to be faithful to beric be right aska said be of use to obey chief only when ranged in battle be that have ruined country there be nothing slavish in recognizing that one man must rule in obeying when obedience be necessary for sake of a one body led by one mind may do much a two hundred men swayed by two hundred mind will hing will be with beric experience may be of aid to if chief of high standing among iceni be well content to recognize in leader of party may well do same now beric step forward say what be next to be done thank beric said when shout of acclamation greeted when stepped forward have subsided for oath have sworn to be faithful to pretend not to more wisdom than others feel that in presence of one full of year experience a aska be presumption for one of age to give opinion in one respect know that be more fitted than others to lead have studied record of roman of war with gaul other people know that greatest trouble be not in defeating army in field of overcoming resistance of who took refuge in fastness harassed continually by sortie attack know where roman be strong where be weak be by aid of such knowledge that hope that may long retain freedom may even in time become so formidable that may be able to win term not only for ourselves for countryman first step be to gather at place of refuge belonging to therefore do choose among yourselves twenty swift runner send to village bidding wife family of here to leave home at once taking

escaped very number of fugitive who have preceded band showed that be exaggeration be not until long afterwards that truth be known of great multitude estimated at two hundred thirty thousand fully third have fallen among whom be almost woman child whose presence on battlefield have proved so fatal of whom scarce one have be able to escape for roman infuriated by massacre at camalodunum verulamium london have spared neither age sex on arrival at soto obtained for first time news of queen chief of one of northern subtribes of iceni have driven through on chariot have told headman of hamlet that have be one of few who have accompanied boadicea in flight at call of queen said men threw on line of wagon in such number force that breach be made through horse wagon being overthrown

for hour then to return when did so lady be dead lying in circle round boadicea be buried in willow hole have be dug turf replaced dead leaf scattered over spot so that roman must ever know where queen of iceni daughter slept although beric have given up hope of again seeing mother alive news of death be terrible blow to wept unrestrainedly until aska placed hand on shoulder must not give way to sorrow beric have people to look to have gone to green island where will dwell in happiness where father have be long expecting be not at death that briton weep knowing a do that have gone be to be envied arouse there be much to be done cattle will probably be here in morning have to question people here a to great swamp get to send to fen people for guide who will lead across marsh to spot where can dwell above level of highest water beric put aside private grief for time several of native of village who be accustomed to penetrate swamp in search of game be collected questioned a to country none however must give much useful information there be large river ran through with innumerable smaller stream wandered here there none have penetrated far beyond margin partly because be afraid of losing way partly because of enmity of fen people be of different race to be remnant of whom iceni have driven out of country who instead of going west have taken refuge in swamp whither invader have power inclination to follow be strange aska said just a fled before century ago so have now to fly before roman still a have maintained there so may will be necessary that must try secure goodwill of people assure that come among a foe there be quarrel between now headman of hamlet said there have not be for many generation know that seek to molest while be not strong enough to molest there be trade between hamlet near swamp people bring fish wildfowl basket weave out of rush sell to in exchange for woven for garment sometimes for swine keep upon of island be always who come to go not to be jealous of entering country men who go too far in search of game have often be shot at by invisible foe take care that arrow strike shoot only a warning that must go farther sometimes foolhardy men have declared that will go where like in spite of fenmen have gone have never returned when have asked men who come in to trade what have become of say 'they know most likely have lost way died miserably fallen into swamp perished there ' a men have certainly lost life through own obstinacy nothing can be done then of men speak tongue suppose aska said men who come be generally same mostly speak little of language from time to time of maiden have taken fancy to fenmen in spite of friend must do have gone off none of have ever returned though message have be brought saying be well think that men who do trading be child of woman who went to live among year ago then be through one of men that must open communication with aska said of be here almost daily one have be today

on pole over shoulder men be much shorter than iceni be swarthier in complexion hair be long matted only clothing be short kilt made of material for bartered game speak language well headman said will tell want men listened to statement that chief before desired to find with follower refuge in fen that be willing to make present to fenmen of cattle other thing so that there must be friendship between that must be allowed to occupy island in swamp where might live secure from pursuit men looked at other a headman began to speak shaking head a if thought proposal impossible will tell people said think that will agree have dwelt alone for long year without trouble with others coming of stranger will bring trouble why do seek to leave land people have be beaten in battle by roman aska said taking up conversation need refuge till trouble be over roman have won one of men exclaimed in tone showed be no stranger to what be going on beyond circle of fen have won aska repeated there will be many fugitive who will seek for shelter in fen must fain be friend with people shelter must have cause after be same for when roman have destroyed iceni conquered country round will hunt down also for let none remain free in land where be master fen country be wide there must be room for great number to shelter surely there must be place where must live without disturbance to people there be room man said briefly will take message to people chief will decide aska beric wore few other ornament than denoting position authority many of follower however have jewel bracelet spoil of roman town beric left group spoke to boduoc who in two three minute returned with several ring bracelet must have score for one of said be of value to men now indeed possession must bring certain death upon one wearing did fall into hand of roman beric returned to fenmen here said be present for chief tell that have many more like men took with air of indifference be of use said though may please woman if want to please men must give hatchet arm will do aska said have more than require for indeed after battle with cerealis sack of town men have taken roman sword carried in addition to own weapon regarding not only a trophy a infinitely superior to own more clumsy implement for cutting wood other purpose at word from beric four of be brought handed to men who took with lively satisfaction must take with to see chief beric asked shook head stranger can enter swamp chief will come to see be very urgent that time will be lost beric said roman may be here very shortly by time sun be at highest chief will be here will bring answer said come with now will show where to expect for will not leave edge of land after hour walking through swampy soil arrived at edge of sluggish stream of water here tied to bush be boat constructed of basket work covered with hide in lay two long pole men took place in coracle pushed out into stream using pole vigorously be soon lost to sight among thick grove of rush bush aska beric returned to hamlet have idea of number of people asked headman said one have idea swamp be of vast extent from here away to north know that long ago when iceni endeavoured to penetrate there be fiercely attacked by great number most of who entered perished miserably for age now there have be trouble land be large enough for why must fight to conquer swamp must be useless to believe that there be large number although have from nature of country little dealing with other live scattered in two three over country since living by fishing fowling must not care to dwell in large community never talk much about have heard that say that part of swamp be inhabited by strange monster huge serpent other creature into none dare penetrate better beric said be not afraid of monster of kind might therefore let settle in one of neighbourhood where must clear out enemy of theirs for strike that greatest difficulty will be to get cattle across morass to firm ground will have to contrive plan for doing so will be easy matter to feed so large number a will be on fish wildfowl at two chief returned to spot where men have left taking with boduoc of follower few minute after arrived there heard sound approaching in short time four boat similar to have seen carrying two men in addition to poling made way one after through bush nearly met across stream most of men be dressed like two who have visited village three of be in attire somewhat similar to of iceni be evidently chief several of men be much shorter darker than have first seen while chief be about same stature carried short bow quiver of light arrow spear with point hardened in fire for iceni living near swamp have be strictly forbidden to trade in arm metal implement with fenmen chief however carried sword of iceni make before chief stepped ashore follower landed at once to surprise of beric scattered among bush in two three minute returned said something in own language to chief who then stepped ashore be afraid of ambush aska muttered have satisfied that one be hidden near chief be able to speak language of iceni long conversation ensued between beric protested at first that be impossible for to grant request made that for long age no stranger have penetrated swamp that although intention of who addressed might be friendly such might not always be case that when secret of path way be once known must never be free from danger of attack by neighbour there be more room to north said fen country be far wider there there be room for while here dry land be occupied by there be room for so many stranger wish well have quarrel with age have passed now since drove forefather from land be forgotten a have lived so long so will continue have want have fish fowl in abundance what more require obtain in barter from sword like sent be useful aska said be made by roman be vastly better than have with one of might chop down a many sapling in day a must build hut must destroy wild beast may lurk in swamp people who be coming now be not like be content with land have taken dwelt among undisturbed for age roman be not like want to posse whole earth when have overrun country will never rest content till have hunted out also there be thousand of who will seek refuge in swamp may oppose may kill number of in end step by step will find way in till reach island of firm land where can establish be not that have ill will towards that covet land with roman behind slaying encounter will have choice to go forward will be for benefit a well a ours alone what must do against men who fight with metal over head body that arrow must not penetrate with sword dart must cut pierce through through with who have met fought in fair battle have once even defeated with great slaughter to help to guard swamp must be different even roman brave a be must hesitate before tried to penetrate land of mud water surely there must be spot in morass be still uninhabited have heard that there be place be avoided because great serpent other creature live there so long a land be dry enough for cattle to live for to dwell be ready to meet living thing may inhabit chief looked awestruck at offer on part of stranger then entered into animated conversation together matter be settled aska said in low voice to beric there be place be afraid to penetrate expect that much a object to entering country must rather have a neighbour than creature that be so much afraid of when chief consultation be finished one who have before spoken turned to said what will give if take to such place how far distant be aska asked be two day journey from here chief said distance be not great channel be winding difficult there be land many foot above water how large can not say three mile

much do require five boat load filled to brim to other term agree aska said will have a much grain a can obtain if fall short of quantity will give for boat load be wanting three sword six spearhead ten arrowhead bargain be closed fenmen have come resolved not to allow stranger to enter land offer to occupy spot even if tenanted by savage beast entirely changed position in recess of swamp to east of ouse lay tract of country avoided with superstitious fear in memory of man none have dared to approach region for there be tradition among that when have first fled from iceni large party have penetrated there of few returned with tale of destruction of companion by huge serpent monster of strange shape of be clothed in armour impenetrable to heaviest weapon from time spot have be avoided legend have multiplied concerning creature dwelt there now seemed to chief that must be gainer in case by bargain if monster conquered devoured iceni a doubt must do must be well rid of if iceni destroyed monster large tract of country now closed must be open for fishing fowling therefore accepted without further difficulty term stranger offered be moreover agreed that further party of iceni must be free to join first comer without hindrance that guide must be furnished to who might come to border of swamp to join countryman be to act in concert in case of attack by roman binding to

talk that over after have arrived evidently can hing now great thing be to get to place speak of to prepare to receive woman other fugitive when will have boat at place name three hour after daylight tomorrow will be there will receive payment have agreed upon before start rest will be paid when return with boat hand over for second detachment to go native nodded at once companion took place in coracle leaving native who be to act a guide behind be undersized little wretch boduoc said a started for village wonder that forefather swept out of land without difficulty be active sturdy knowing swamp a do must harass invader terribly think that at present like going into country will be glad enough of aid if roman come when reached village found that herd have just arrived headman be surprised when told that fenmen have agreed to allow shelter in swamp eight ten men who have straggled in since beric party arrived expressed desire to accompany party with family other woman in village must likewise have gone aska pointed out to that have better go north take shelter among brigantes a woman of tribe have done except whose men be with will be better off there than among swamp can not feed unnecessary mouth have mean of transporting there too must shelter in wood be not that mean to harass roman so need place where can not find a go spread news that aska have sought refuge in swamp with two hundred fighting sarci that capable of bearing arm who choose to join can do so must come to junction of two river there will hear of a villager be unable to take away with store of grain disposed of readily to beric in exchange for gold ornament with must purchase cattle such thing a required from brigantes also resigned property in swine cattle be to be left in wood to be fetched a required aska beric having made arrangement sat down to discus what have best be done a twenty boat must only carry sixty must be away for two day before returned for second party boduoc be called into council after discussion be agreed that best plan must be for whole party to go down together to junction of river taking a large burden of grain a must carry driving cattle before heard from headman that whole country near river be densely covered with bush that ground be swampy very difficult to cross agreed therefore that must form strong intrenchment at spot where be to embark be unlikely in extreme that roman must seek to penetrate country if did be to be opposed a soon a entered swamp desperate stand be to be made at intrenchment must be approachable at one two point only six men be to be left at village to receive woman child when arrived guide be to return a soon a have led main party to point where boat be to meet to lead second party to same point that evening indeed woman began to arrive said that believed must be in on following day among be boduoc mother who told beric that eldest daughter have started with berenice cneius to meet roman a soon a news of defeat reached when day broke beric command with woman who have arrived set off laden with a much grain in basket cloth a must carry driving cattle pig before country soon became swampy guide knew ground well by winding path led dry footed through bush though must see water among root grass on side of have however great difficulty with cattle pig after several attempt to break away being nearly lost in swamp from many of have to be dragged out by sheer force whole reached river men of rear guard in charge of main body of swine cattle did not arrive there until midday spot to guide led be on river flowing east west mile from junction with main stream a told that swamp be too deep near junction of river for to penetrate there of boat be already at spot when reached aska beric at once began to mark out semicircle with radius of fifty yard on river bank ten of cattle be killed skinned a others of party came up be set to work to cut down tree undergrowth within semicircle drag to edge casting down with head outwards so a to form formidable abbatis within hour of appointed time twenty boat have arrived together with a many more in grain hide other article agreed to be paid be to be carried off three of cattle be cut up flesh divided among twenty boat in quantity of grain be also placed seven remaining carcass be for use of camp ten hide grain sword spear arrowhead agreed upon be handed over to native beric a extra gift presented of three chief who have come with boat with one of roman shield picked up on field of battle chief be greatly pleased with present showed more goodwill than have exhibited at first interview aska have arranged with beric to remain behind in charge of encampment a soon therefore a present have be handed over beric with boduoc three men to boat took place pushed from shore boat of fenmen put off at same time native of whom there be one in of beric boat poled way down sluggish stream until reached wide river chief here shouted adieu directed course up river while beric party crossed proceeded down for two mile then turned up narrow stream running into day made way along winding other stream came in on side quitted indeed for hour appeared to be traversing network of water from rose tree bush native in beric boat led must speak language of iceni explained to beric that water be now high that when subsided land appeared above except in course of stream be always wet swampy said men can not traverse part on foot except by mean of flat board fastened to foot by loop of leather prevents from sinking deeply in late in afternoon country became drier land showed above level of water native now showed sign of much perturbation stopping frequently listening have come much farther now said than have ever be before dare not have ventured so far be not that flood must have driven everything back know from old man who once ventured to push farther that be beginning of rising ground that in short time will find dry enough to land advise to call other boat up so that in case of danger can support other stream be following be now very narrow branch of tree meeting overhead can of other fenmen in boat speak language beric asked man replied in negative be good said want men to be frightened with story about monster believe in though say that in old time monster may not have dwelt here if anything come will know how to fight be gloomy dark enough here to make men uncomfortable without anything else to shake courage at last reached spot where bank be two foot above water must see that rose further inland several of other fenmen have be shouting for time to beric boatman craft have be lagging behind beric therefore thought well to land at once boat be accordingly called up meat grain landed men leapt ashore boatman instantly poling craft down stream at utmost speed will go farther tonight beric said choose comfortable spot make fire will be time enough in morning to explore place fix on spot for permanent encampment place be soon chosen cleared of bush men in several of boat have at starting brought brand with from fire be carried across other so a to keep fire in eight ten of brand being laid together in heart of brushwood fanned vigorously bright flame soon shot up men spirit have sunk a passed through wild expanse of swamp water rose now a fire burned up meat be speedily frying in flame be eaten a soon a be cooked nothing being done with grain have mean of pounding have also brought with several jar of beer from village be passed round after have eaten fill of meat will place four sentry beric said there may well be wolf other wild beast in swamp after supper be over boduoc questioned beric privately a to monster of boatman have spoken be folly beric said know that have legend among learned from native who be here before came that at one time strange creature wandered over country if there be such creature died long ago fenmen have story among that such beast lived in heart of swamp here when first fled before be quite possible that be true for although died age ago on land may have existed long afterwards among swamp where there be none to disturb have read in of roman writer that there be creature protected by coat of scale in country named egypt that live hundred of year possibly creature legend say be sort of dragon may have lingered here a seem to have shown to fenmen since first arrival here be not at likely that there be of left if there be will have to do battle with do think will be very formidable beric suppose so might be formidable to one man not to sixty well armed a be have not belief that will meet with night passed quite quietly in morning band set out to explore country rose gradually until be a beric judged from forty to fifty foot above level of swamp large tree grew here soil be perfectly dry ground on summit be level for about quarter of mile then gradually sank again mile farther be again at edge of swamp nothing must have suited better beric said at top can form encampment will hold ten thousand men there be dry ground mile round for cattle swine presently there be shout from men who have wandered away beric bidding others follow ran to spot found men standing looking in wonder at great number of bone lying in what seemed confused mass here be monster beric said be snake bone be evident to exclamation of wonder broke from at enormous size one man got hold of pair of rib placing upright came up to chin men looked apprehensively round need not be afraid beric said creature have probably be dead hundred of year see skin be decayed away must have be thick tough indeed by way bone be piled together must have curled up here to die be probably last of race however will search island thoroughly keeping together in readiness to encounter anything that may alight upon great number of snake be found none of extraordinary size doubt fled here in rain beric said when water rose covered swamp will not be troubled with when morass dry anyhow be quite harmless save that may kill chicken two when get will give trouble swine will soon clear off be late in day before search be completed then returned to camping ground of night before quite assured that there be creature of size upon island just a evening be falling on following day heard shout be alive voice beric recognized a of boatman shouted yes exclaimed alive well there be nothing to be afraid of here few minute later twenty boat again came up fenmen time ventured to land beric boatman questioned anxiously about monster beric who thought a well to maintain evil reputation of place told that have searched island have found no living monster have come across dead serpent who must have be seventy eighty foot long there be more of here said of course there may be others have be alarmed at noise made have taken to swamp creature have be dead for long time may have be last of race however if one be to come must not be afraid of with hundred twenty fighting men here fenmen after consultation among agreed that must be safer to pas night with iceni than to start in darkness among swamp when left in morning beric sent message to aska describing place begging to send up of woman with next party with mean of grinding grain a soon a boat be started beric led party up to top of rise then work be begun in earnest in couple of day large number of hut be constructed of sapling brushwood cleared off from centre of encampment woman arrived with next boat load at once took preparation of food into hand aska sent message saying that number at camp be undiminished a most of fighting men belonging to village round who have survived battle have joined at once with wife fresh men be pouring in hour urged beric to leave boduoc in charge of island to return with empty boat in order that might have consultation beric did upon arrival found that there be over four hundred men in camp with proportionate number of woman child there be several subchiefs among aska invited to join in council be evident said that so large number a can not find food in one place in swamp at rate until have learned to catch fish snare wildfowl a fenmen do swine can take there light boat must not carry cattle in number though might be thrown carried there with leg tied together at present place be safe from attack there be only one path guide say by can be approached propose that cut wide gap through throw beam plank over can remove in case of attack when hear of roman approach can throw up high defence of tree bush behind gap will be excellent beric agreed must doubtless be able to make long defence against on causeway must not depend upon keeping upon will wade through swamp waist deep if be deeper still will cut down bush make faggot move forward on so though may check on causeway will certainly by one mean other make way up to intrenchment must therefore strengthen in way must build up great bank behind so that if break through fire defence can defend bank there be one thing must be done without delay must build more boat there must be here many men from eastern coast where have much larger stronger craft than coracle must put strong party to work upon then in case of attack must when see that longer resistance must be vain take to boat join when roman approach send off to fetch party from island besides will want to move body of men rapidly so a to attack harass enemy when be not expecting must say that ought to have at least twenty great flatboat able to carry fifty men speed must not be of much consequence a roman will have boat to follow besides except on ouse one two of larger stream there be room for rowing must be poled along let keep none fighting men here a villager fled north there must be number of cattle swine wandering untended in wood in many of hamlet much grain must have be left behind therefore must send out party from time to time to bring in when large boat be built can transport of cattle alive to island till then must be slaughtered here with party few swine might be sent to island where can range about a choose what be last news have of roman be pressing steadily north burning slaying hear that spare none that whole land of trinobantes from thames to stour have be turned into waste be only what have to expect aska have more of people come in since left only young girl arrived last night be brought news that be giving be sister of friend boduoc mother who have given up for lost almost lost sens with delight when returned family be fortunate for son also came in two three day ago beric at once went in search of boduoc mother whom found established with girl in little bower be glad indeed that daughter have returned safe said a old woman came out on hearing voice yes began to think must never see face again beric be fortunate indeed when so many be left friendless that four child must be spared tell chief how fulfilled mission said to girl be easy enough replied have be by must have returned here three day since little lady must not make long journey be three day after left before saw of roman at last came upon column of horse when saw little lady gave bracelet put gold chain into hand said 'beric so knew that be for then ran back hid in tree while went forward when got near soldier on horseback man lifted up arm cried something in loud voice then rode up to for time must see nothing then horseman rode on again two of who went on south man rode behind one of little lady before then turned made hither travelling without stopping except once for few hour sleep there be many fugitive in wood from heard that land of trinobantes be lit up by burning village that roman be slaughtering of met in wood have hid have made way at night saw number of dead body woman child a well a men in burned hamlet have done mission well beric said boduoc will be glad when tell how have carried out wish must find good husband for day will take care that go to with good store of cattle swine where be brother be there said leaning against tree waiting for be glad to see safe among beric said to young man how did escape battle be driving chariot with parta attendant a have from day started kept close behind chariot escaped with when line of wagon be broken to let queen pas when got far away from battle mother stopped chariot bade go north have more need of attendant said 'let save do find son if have escaped battle tell that will share fate of boadicea have lived free woman will die one tell to fight to end against roman that will expect to join before long in happy island bid not lament for rejoice a must have gone to land where there be sorrow then turned chariot drove to home to await coming there if must have escaped be few hour after that messenger brought news that be safe that survivor of band be to join at soto with such men a might have escaped a parta order be to take woman with to north drove two day farther taking with lad brother of one of then handed over chariot to to convey to land of brigantes started hither on foot to join will go on with tomorrow mother sister boduoc will be rejoiced to see have found place where even roman will hardly reach chapter ix struggle in swamp that evening beric have long talk with aska four five men from coast accustomed to building of large boat matter must be easy enough said a boat must not be required to withstand strain of sea needed only to be put together with flat bottom side with so large number of men must hew down tree of suitable size thin down until obtained plank from must then be fastened together by strong peg dried moss driven in between crevice pitch however must be required to stop up seam of have none then beric said must make pitch there be great difficulty about there be plenty of fir tree growing near edge of swamp from root of can get tar men be acquainted with process be simple one deep hole be dug in ground bottom of be lined with clay hollowed out into sort of bowl hole be then filled with root of fir closely packed together when be full fire be lit above a soon a have made way down earth be piled over beaten down hard small orifice being left in centre in way wood be slowly converted into charcoal resin tar a oosed out under heat trickled down into bowl of clay at bottom a little smoke escaped after fire be first lighted work must be carried on without fear of attracting attention of body of enemy who might be searching country two month passed by end of time intrenchment on river bank have be made so strong that must resist attack save by very large body of men on island have also be completed strong bank thrown up at only three point where landing must be effected from boat swamp have be thoroughly explored in neighbourhood island discovered on three hundred men have be established while four hundred remained on great island a many in camp on river there be over thousand woman child distributed among three station three hundred men have laboured incessantly at boat be now finished while work have be going on considerable number of fish wildfowl have be obtained by barter from fenmen with whom have before have dealing from other community living among swamp to north many of iceni who came from marshy district of eastern river be also accustomed to fishing fowling a soon a work on defence be finished tortuous channel through swamp became known to began to lay net woven by woman across stream to make decoy snare of sort for wildfowl framework for many coracle have be woven of withy by woman skin of cattle killed be utilized a covering so that by end of two month have quite fleet of little craft of kind a fast a larger boat be finished be used for carrying cattle to island large quantity of swine be also taken over during time roman have traversed whole country of iceni hamlet be fired person who fell into hand put to death number of be comparatively small a greater part of population have moved north taken to wood be so extensive that comparatively few of fugitive be killed by search party of roman from few prisoner that roman took heard report that many of iceni have taken refuge in swamp several strong body have moved along edge of marsh country without attempting to penetrate aska beric have agreed that so long a be undisturbed must remain quiet confining to border except when sent party to search for cattle in wood to gather up grain might have escaped destruction in hamlet that must avoid collision with roman until present vigilance abated attempted to plant settler in neighbourhood circumstance however defeated intention learned from fenmen numerous fugitive have taken refuge in southern swamp that sallying out have fallen upon party of roman near huntingdon have cut to piece roman have in consequence sent considerable force to avenge attack have penetrated distance into swamp have there be attacked driven back with much slaughter fortnight later legion have marched to huntingdon crossing river there have established camp opposite called godmancastra having collected number of native from west be engaged in building boat in intended to penetrate swamp country root out fugitive be sure to come sooner later aska said to beric must wish otherwise came here not to pas life a lurking fugitive to gather force avenge ourselves on roman if like will go up river see friend there ascertain strength mean of resistance must be well think to tell of strong place here offer to send boat to bring down so that may make great stand here think not beric said nothing must suit roman better than to catch together so a to destroy at one blow know that in west stormed intrenchment of cassivellaunus that native fort have ever withstood assault must say that ought to be war of small fight must attack constantly enticing into deepest part of morass falling upon at spot where activity will avail against heavily weighted men must pour volley of arrow into boat a pas along through narrow creek show ourselves at point where ground be firm enough for to land then falling back to deep morass tempt to pursue there then turn upon must give rest night day wear out with constant fighting watching fen be broad long stretching from huntingdon to sea if be contested foot by foot may tire out even power of rome be right beric at rate will be well to see how brother be prepared may have boat may urgently need help quite agree with think must be a well for to go must offer to bring woman child to island here then must send down strong force to help must begin to contest strongly roman advance from very first accordingly aska started up ouse in one of large boat with twelve men to pole along three day afterwards returned with news that there be two thousand men with twice that many woman child scattered among upper swamp have only few small boat said be in sore strait for provision drove at first good many cattle in with most of be lost in morass a there have be body of horse moving about near huntingdon have not be able to venture out a have done to drive in more have chief with beric asked none of importance men be fugitive from battle who be joined on way north by woman of village be broken up into group have leader to form general plan spoke to principal men among told that have strongly fortified several place here have built fleet of boat be prepared for warfare will gladly accept a leader urgently prayed that must send boat down for woman child promised that must do so must also send down provision for fighting men next morning twenty large boat carrying thirty men supply of meat grain started up river beric going with taking boduoc a lieutenant aska remained in command at river fort where force be maintained at full strength boat party being drawn entirely from two island four mile below huntingdon landed at spot where greater part of iceni there be gathered fire be at once lighted portion of meat cooked for fugitive be weak with hunger a soon a be satisfied order be issued for woman child to be brought in be crowded into boat in charge of four men in then dropped down stream beric having given order that boat be to return a soon a woman be landed on island spent next two day in traversing swamp in coracle ascertaining where there be firm ground where morass be impassable learned particular must gather about exact position of roman camp spot where boat be being constructed iceni be already familiar with several path leading out of morass in neighbourhood then drew out plan for attack upon roman have brought with sarci who have retired with from battle must command force of four hundred men led by boduoc be to travel by different path through swamp be then to unite to march round roman camp attack suddenly on three side at once camp be in form of horseshoe end resting on river be here that boat be being built beric with own hundred men fifty others be to embark in four boat a soon a be fairly beyond swamp be to land on huntingdon side to tow boat along until within two three hundred yard of roman camp when be to await sound of boduoc horn boduoc instruction be that be to attack camp fiercely on side roman sentry be known to be so vigilant that there be slight prospect of entering camp by surprise of being able to scale palisade at top of bank of earth attack however be to be made a if in earnest be to be maintained until beric horn gave signal for to draw off when be to break up into party a before to retire into heart of swamp by path by have left most absolute silence be to be observed until challenge of roman sentry showed that be discovered when be to raise war shout to utmost so a to alarm confuse enemy night be dark one strong wind be blowing so that beric party reached station unheard by sentry on wall of camp be hour before heard distant shout followed instantly by winding of horn loud war cry of iceni at same moment trumpet in roman intrenchment sounded immediately tumult of confused shouting arose around within camp beric remained quiet for five minute till roar of battle be at highest knew that attention of roman must be entirely occupied with attack then boat be again towed along until opposite centre of horseshoe men took place in again poled across river fifty men who accompanied sarci carried bundle of rush dipped in pitch in boat be burning brand have be covered with raw hide to prevent light being seen be nearly across river when sentry there whose attention have hitherto be directed entirely to wall suddenly shouted alarm a soon a boat touched shore beric men leapt out passed through half built boat pile of timber collected beside formed up to repel attack at same moment others lighted bundle of rush at brand jumping ashore set fire to boat wood pile astonished at outburst of flame within camp while engaged in defending wall from desperate attack of iceni roman hesitated then of came running down to meet unexpected attack sarci have already pressed quickly on followed by of torch bearer be in midst of roman tent before legionary gathered in sufficient force to meet torch be applied to tent fanned by breeze flame spread rapidly from one to beric blew signal for retreat men in solid body with spear outward fell back roman a arrived at spot rushed furiously upon discipline be time on side of sarci who beat off attack till reached river bank then in good order took place in boat beric with small body covering movement till last then made rush to boat men standing with pole ready instantly pushed craft into stream in two minute be safe on other side boat pile of timber be already blazing fiercely while roman camp in centre of intrenchment be in mass of flame lighting up helmet armour of soldier ranged along wall engaged in repelling attack of iceni a soon a sarci be across leapt ashore towed boat along by bank few arrow fell among a soon a have pushed off from shore most of roman have run back to aid in defence of wall beric horn now gave signal that work be done in short time shout of iceni began to subside din of battle grew fainter in few minute be quiet round roman camp there be great rejoicing when party of iceni met again in swamp have struck blow must greatly inconvenience roman for time must retard attack show that spirit of briton be still high loss of iceni have be very small only five six of beric party have fallen twenty thirty of assailant of wall believed that roman have suffered much more for must be seen above defence by light of flame behind while iceni be in darkness thus dart javelin of defender have be cast almost at random while have be conspicuous mark for missile of assailant in beric eye most important point of encounter be that have given confidence to fugitive have taught advantage of fighting with plan of acting methodically in order there be consultation next morning beric pointed out to leader although be necessary sometimes with important object in view to take offensive must a rule stand on defensive depend upon depth of morass knowledge of path across to baffle attempt of roman to penetrate must recommend said that break up into party of fifteen twenty scatter widely over fen country yet be near enough to other to hear sound of horn party must learn foot of ground water in neighbourhood round in way will be able to assemble when hear signal announcing coming of roman will know path by can attack retreat spot where can make way across where roman can not follow party must earn sustenance by fishing fowling in making up party there must be two three men in accustomed to work party must provide with coracle will send up boat load of hide beyond must search for cattle swine in wood when by sending spy on shore find there be party of roman about party nearest to huntingdon must be always vigilant day night keep men at edge of swamp to watch doings of roman must send notice to day two a to what enemy be doing when be likely to advance must come suddenly remember that be of use to try to oppose passage down river boat will be far stronger than ours must throw away life by fighting there may go right down to sea if please directly land attempt to thrust boat up channel through swamp then foot must be contested must be shot down from bush enticed into swamp overwhelmed with missile let man make powerful bow great sheath of arrow pointed with flint flake of stone must be fetched from dry land although even without will fly straight enough if shot from bush at few yard distance let men practice with remember that must aim at leg of roman be useless to shoot at shield armour besides let man make spear strong heavy fully eighteen foot long with point hardened in fire rely upon rather than upon sword to check progress whenever find broad path of firm ground across swamp cut down tree bush to form stout barrier make friend with fenmen be liberal to with gift attempt to plant party near for must disturb wildfowl lead to jealousy quarrel however well may learn swamp know better be hostile might lead roman into midst in part may not find dry land on to build hut in case choose spot where tree be stout lash sapling between build hut upon so a to be three four foot above wet soil of people who know swamp by eastern river tell that be best way to avoid fen fever having seen that everything be arranged beric party returned to camp for time report from upper river stated that roman be doing little beyond sending out strong party to cut timber then came news that whole legion have arrived that small fort containing two hundred men be being erected three four mile apart on side of fen show that resistance must have ceased elsewhere aska said must never be able to spare so great force a legion half against suppose that fort be being built to prevent obtaining cattle that hope to starve out will hardly succeed in for river channel swarm with fish now that winter be coming on will abound with wildfowl be afraid of winter beric said for then will be able to traverse swamp where now must sink over head unless frost be very severe beric ground will not harden much for foot be covered with tree bush a to grain can do without will be able to fetch at least down from north indeed must need ten legion to form line along side of fen country right down to sea to pen in completely by time iceni have become familiar with channel through swamp for long distance from fastness have even established trade with people lying to northwest of fen country learnt that roman boasted have well nigh annihilated trinobantes iceni that towards other tribe have taken part in great rising have shown more leniency though of principal town have be destroyed inhabitant put to sword month later fleet of boat laden with roman soldier started from huntingdon proceeded down ouse dead silence reigned round although proceeded nearly to sea saw sign of foe so turning rowed back to huntingdon in absence iceni have not be idle spy from swamp have discovered when expedition be preparing to start have found too that strong body of troop be to march along edge of swamp in order to cut off iceni must endeavour to make escape alarm have be sounded from post to post in accordance with order of beric whole of fighting men at once began to move south in boat in little coracle be able to thread way through network of channel night after roman started whole of fighting force of briton be gathered in southern swamp two hour before daybreak issued out five hundred led by aska followed western bank of river towards huntingdon have for time be converted into roman city inhabited by artisan who have constructed boat settler who supplied army have be garrisoned by five hundred legionary of whom three hundred have gone away in boat main body advanced against roman camp on opposite bank in a spy have learnt three hundred men have be left a garrison by beric order great number of ladder have be constructed a upon previous occasion camp be surrounded before advanced against when first shout of sentry showed that be discovered beric horn gave signal with mighty shout briton rushed on from side dashing down ditch climbing steep bank behind iceni planted ladder against palisade swarming over poured into camp before roman have time to gather to oppose beric have led own band of two hundred trained men against point where wall of camp touched river a soon a be over formed up led in compact body against roman in spite of suddenness of attack discipline of legionary be unshaken a soon a officer found that wall be already lost formed men in solid body to resist attack before beric with band reached spot roman be already engaged in fierce struggle with briton who poured volley of dart arrow among desperately strove sword in hand to break solid formation be unable to do until beric band six deep with hedge of spear before came up with loud shout threw upon roman weight impetus of charge be irresistible roman cohort be broken deadly hand to hand struggle commenced here number greatly superior height strength of briton be decisive before many minute have passed last roman have be cut down scene of battle being lighted up by flame of huntingdon shout of triumph from briton announced that resistance have ceased beric at once blew horn a have be previously arranged four hundred of island men immediately started under boduoc to oppose garrison at nearest fort must meet hastening to assistance of comrade then systematic search for plunder commenced one of storehouse be emptied of content fired by light arm armour of roman soldier be collected hut tent rifled of everything of value storehouse emptied of store of grain provision of tool have be used for building of boat everything must be of use to defender be taken fire be then applied to building tent morning broke before be accomplished laden down with spoil iceni returned to swamp boduoc aska party rejoining there former have met roman hurrying from nearest fort to aid garrison of camp beric order have be that boduoc be if possible to avoid fight a in open discipline of roman must probably prevail over british valour iceni therefore set up great shouting in front in rear of roman shooting missile among being unable in dark to perceive number of assailant fearful that have fallen into ambush roman fell back to fort aska party have also returned laden with plunder a soon a whole be united division of be made provision clothing arm be divided equally among men while store of rope metal canvas other article must be useful to community be set aside to be taken to island thither also shield armour helmet of roman soldier be to be conveyed to be broken up melted into spear arrow head a roman boat returned two day later from useless passage down river be astonished enraged by outburst of mocking laughter from tangle of bush fringing river not foe be to be seen for mile sound of derisive laughter assailed from side of stream veteran ground teeth with rage must have rowed towards bank have not officer believing that be intention of briton to induce to land then to lead into ambush ordered to keep on way on passing beyond region of swamp cry of dismay burst from crowded boat a be perceived that town of huntingdon have entirely disappeared a neared camp however sight of numerous sentry on wall relieved of part of anxiety upon landing learnt whole truth that five hundred roman soldier in camp at huntingdon have fallen to man that whole of store collected have be carried away destroyed news have be sent rapidly along chain of fort on side of swamp fifty men from have be despatched to repair reoccupy camp be now held by thousand men who have already begun to repair palisade have be fired by briton disaster at once depressed infuriated roman soldier while showed to general commanding that task have be appointed to perform be vastly more serious than have expected already a have traversed mile after mile of silent river have be impressed with enormous difficulty there must be in penetrating pathless morass extending a knew in place thirty forty mile in width proof now afforded of number determination courage of men lurking there still further impressed with gravity of undertaking messenger be at once sent off to suetonius who be at camalodunum be occupied in rebuilding to inform of reverse to ask for order general with five hundred men immediately set out for camp of godman suetonius at once proceeded to examine for extent of fen country riding with body of horseman along eastern boundary a far a sea then returning to camp followed up western margin until again reached sea saw at once that whole of roman army in britain must be insufficient to guard so extensive line that must be hopeless to endeavour to starve out men who must at time make raid over country around first step to be taken must be to endeavour to circumscribe limit order be at once sent to british tribe in south midland to send available men a arrived be set to work to clear away by axe fire tree bush on eastern side of river ouse a soon a intention of roman be understood british camp at junction of river be abandoned a with so large force of workman roman must have made wide road up to although might have resisted for time must eventually fall while roman by sending flotilla of boat down must cut off retreat of garrison for two month thirty thousand workman laboured under eye of strong party of roman soldier work of denuding swamp east of ouse be accomplished winter have now set in season be wet one although roman made repeated attempt to fire brushwood from south west failed to do so severe frost accompanied by heavy snow set in late a soon a ground be hard enough roman entered swamp near huntingdon began advance northward briton be expecting whole of fighting force have gathered to oppose beric aska set to work a soon a roman army crossed river marched north a roman advanced slowly carefully through tangled bush heard strange confused noise far ahead of after marching for two mile came upon channel where ice have be broken into fragment at once set to work to cut down bush form into faggot to fill up gap a approached channel with be assailed by volley of arrow from bush on opposite side light armed troop be brought up work of damming channel at dozen point be covered by shower of javelin arrow briton however have during past month made shield of strong wicker work of roman pattern long enough to cover from eye down to ankle wicker work be protected by double coating of ox hide boy collected javelin a fast a be thrown handed to men a soon a road across channel be completed roman poured over believing now must scatter invisible foe be mistaken for briton with levelled spear body covered with buckler burst down upon a crossed while storm of dart javelin poured in from behind fighting line again again be driven back until after suffering great loss made good footing at several point when at sound of horn resistance at once ceased briton disappeared a if by magic advancing cautiously roman found that ice in channel have be broken up be soon involved in perfect network of sluggish stream across briton have felled tree to form bridge for retreat dragged after a soon a crossed one of stream be desperately defended a line of swamp grew wider roman front became more more scattered late in afternoon sudden furious attack be made upon from rear beric having taken strong force round flank number of roman be killed before must assemble to make head against attack a soon a did so assailant a usual drew off after long day fighting roman have gained scarce mile from point where resistance have commenced at cost of over three hundred men suetonius have commanded attack when troop halted for night at edge of unusually wide channel felt that task have undertaken be beyond power summoned commander of two legion to hut have be hastily raised for what think asked be warfare even more terrible than waged with goth in forest beric who be leader have indeed profited by lesson learned at camalodunum roman general must have handled men better be full of resource did not reckon upon breaking up ice upon channel if have have so much trouble in forcing way where swamp be two mile across that with frost to help task will be terrible one when get into heart of morass where be twenty mile wide yet can not leave untouched there must never be peace quiet a long a band under so enterprising leader remained unsubdued can think of other plan by may advance with le loss two officer be silent resistance may weaken one said after long pause have learnt from native that have not in all much above three thousand fighting men must have lost a heavily a have suetonius shook head marked a advanced said that there be not one british corpse to four roman shoot at random while from bush can see even when charge archer can aid little seeing that fighting take place among bush however will press on for time native behind must clear ground a fast a advance foot gained be gained for good three time during night british attacked roman once by passing up river in coracle landing behind once by marching out into country round left flank once by pouring out through cross channel in boat landing in front night too shout kept roman awake in expectation of attack for four day fighting continued roman at cost of over thousand men won way eight mile farther by end of time be utterly exhausted with toil want of sleep swamp day became wider channel larger deeper then roman leader agreed that more must be done twelve mile have be won cleared be mere tongue of fenland to add to difficulty that day weather have suddenly changed in evening rain set in be therefore determined to retreat while ground be yet hard having lighted fire left party to keep burning to deceive british roman drew off marched away bearing to left so a to get out on to plain to leave ground encumbered with sharp stump of bush network of channel behind a soon a possible chapter x betrayed briton soon discovered that roman have retreated made movement in pursuit knew that legionary once in open ground be more than match be well content with success have gained have lost in four hundred men while be certain that roman have suffered much more heavily that there be little chance of attack being renewed in same manner for if progress be so slow when have frost to aid what chance must have when there be scarce foot of land must bear weight winter passed indeed without further movement briton suffered to extent from damp a whole country be undrained for most part covered with forest be accustomed to damp laden atmosphere so supported fog of fen far better than must otherwise have done in spring grain have be carefully preserved for purpose be sown in many place where land be above level of swamp number of large boat have be built during winter a beric aska be convinced that next attack must be made by water having learned from country people to west that vast number of flat bottomed boat have be built by roman early in spring fighting again began great flotilla of boat descended from huntingdon turning off side channel entered swamp briton be prepared be now well provided with tool number of tree have be felled across channel completely blocking passage a soon a boat left main river be assailed with storm of javelin from bush roman when attempted to land found movement impeded by deep swamp in often sank up to waist while foe in swamp patten traversed easily inflicted heavy loss upon driving back into boat again at point where channel be obstructed desperate struggle took place roman from boat in vain endeavoured under storm of missile from invisible foe to remove obstacle a soon a landed to attempt to do so be attacked with such fury that be forced to fall back several time found way of retreat blocked by boat have come down through side channel have to fight way back with great loss difficulty after maintaining struggle for four day suffering loss even greater than that have incurred in first attack roman again drew off ascended river fenmen have joined iceni in repelling attack portion of swamp inhabited be not far away felt that too be threatened by roman advance have therefore rejoined iceni although for time have kept aloof from owing to quarrel have arisen because a asserted of iceni have entered district carried off bird from trap beric have done in power to allay feeling recompensing for loss declared have suffered bestowing many present upon aska often talked matter over agreed that greatest danger be from fenmen view a intruder in country aska said doubtless consider that in time will become master must turn against must lead roman direct to island if be lost must be lost if fear that aska boduoc who be present said have better kill little wretch at once boduoc beric said have nothing against at present must be undeserving of protection of god be to act towards a roman act towards moreover attempt must only bring about what fear of knowing way a do through marsh must be sure to make escape must bring roman down upon even did slay tribe here fenmen in north must seek to avenge kinsman must invite roman to aid must speak fenmen fair avoid cause of quarrel do can to win goodwill show that have nothing to fear from still must always be on guard against treachery night day watch must be set at mouth of channel by might penetrate in direction month passed roman still remained in fort round fen native have now be brought round to western side under protection of strong body of soldier be occupied in clearing swamp on side made little progress however for briton made frequent eruption among depth of morass in direction rendered well nigh impossible for to advance progress must only be made by binding bush into bundle forming road a went on from kinsman in northwest beric learned that new propraetor have arrived to replace suetonius for be reported that wholesale severity of latter be greatly disapproved of in rome so that successor have come out with order to pursue milder policy to desist from work of extirpation that suetonius be carrying on be known that at rate newcomer have issued proclamation saying that rome wished to destroy enslave people of britain that fugitive be invited to return to home adding promise molestation must be offered to that amnesty be granted to for share in late trouble what do think aska beric asked when heard news may be true may not aska said for after treatment of boadicea seizure of husband property have faith in roman promise however be rumour will be time enough to consider when send in flag of truce offer term of surrender besides supposing proclamation have be rightly reported amnesty be promised only for past trouble new general must have heard of heavy loss inflicted on roman a soon a landed have meant proclamation to apply to must have said so however sincerely trust that be true even if be not included be to be hunted down like wild beast rome can not wish to conquer desert have told generally treat native of conquered province well after resistance have ceased may well be that roman disapprove of harshness of suetonius although rising be not due to so much a to villain decianus still be harsh in extreme massacre of druid enlisted briton against other measure may now be tried ground must be cultivated be useless to rome there be at present many tribe still unsubdued be men like suetonius decianus to continue to scourge land by cruelty might provoke rising a formidable a ours bring fresh disaster upon rome whether amnesty applies to not will be glad to hear that suetonius have left know three day ago at rate be at camp opposite huntingdon may well wish to strike blow before leaf in order that may return with credit of having crushed out last resistance two night later hour before daybreak man covered with wound breathless exhausted made way up to intrenchment on principal island to arm shouted roman be upon one of sentry ran with news to beric hut springing from couch beric sounded horn band who be at time kept to strength of four hundred rushed to line of defence what be what be news beric asked messenger be treachery beric with two comrade be on watch at point where principal channel hence run into river suddenly thought heard sound of oar on river above must not be sure be faint confused sound stood at edge of bank listening when suddenly from behind sprang out dozen men before have time to draw sword be cut down hewed at till thought dead for time knew nothing more when came to myself procession of roman boat turning in at channel for time be too faint to move at last crawled down yard two to water have drink then strength gradually returned struggled to foot to proceed by land through marsh at night be impossible found coracle have hidden under bush poled up channel after roman who be now distance ahead danger gave strength gained upon when must hear oar ahead turned off by cross channel so a to strike leading direct hither what be horror when reached to see flotilla of roman boat passing along then guessed that not only watcher at other channel must have be surprised killed by treacherous fenmen followed boat till reached spot where knew there be track through marsh to island for hour struggled on often losing path in darkness falling into swamp where be nearly overwhelmed at last approached island roman be already near tried avenue by boat approached be held by at last made way through by one of deepest marsh where at other time must not have set foot even in broad daylight so have arrived in time to warn have done well warning come not fear in time to save will enable at least to die like men with arm in hand party of men be at once sent down to hold intrenchment erected to cover approach of who knew swamp best be sent out singly found roman everywhere have formed complete circle round island channel being occupied by boat while party have be landed upon plank thrown across soft ground between channel to prevent from passing on foot will not attack until broad daylight aska said when men who have be sent out have returned with similar tale must fight under disadvantage of not knowing ground must fear that in darkness of must slip away contrary to expectation next day passed without movement by roman beric aska agreed that most likely greater portion of boat have gone back to bring up more troop will not risk defeat aska said must be sure that hemmed in a be will fight to last practicability of throwing whole force against roman at one point of so forcing way through be discussed in case woman child over thousand in number must be left behind idea be therefore abandoned day of suspense passed during evening loud shout be heard in swamp briton have doubt that boat have returned with reinforcement there be three point where boat must come up to shore of island aska boduoc chief with hundred men took post in intrenchment there while beric with hundred of sarci remained in great intrenchment on summit in readiness to bear down upon point where aid be required soon after daybreak next morning battle began roman advancing in flat bottomed boat springing on shore in spite of hail of missile advanced against intrenchment be strongly built in imitation of roman work having steep bank of earth surmounted by solid palisade breast high constructed of massive timber for hour conflict raged fifty of defender at intrenchment thrusting down with long spear assailant a strove to scale bank while other fifty rained arrow javelin upon whenever succeeded in getting up to palisade through circle of spear threw down bow opposed sword in hand again again roman be repulsed with great slaughter cry of exultation from woman who lined upper intrenchment rose loud shrill beric divided force into three body first be to move down instantly if saw defender of lower intrenchment hard pressed others be to hold position until summoned by beric to move down join in fray paced round round intrenchment occupied le with three desperate fight going on below than with edge of bush between point knew that morass be so deep that even active unarmed man must scarce make way through that only by springing from bush to bush feared that roman might form path by throwing down faggot so gain island at undefended point until noon saw nothing to justify anxiety everything seemed still in swamp knew that silence be deceptive canopy of marsh loving tree completely hid bush undergrowth from sight be just noon when roman trumpet sounded at once at six different point line of roman soldier issued from bush beric raised horn to lip blew signal for retreat at sound defender of three lower intrenchment instantly left post dashed at full speed up hill gaining long before roman who a issued out formed up in order to repel attack might be made upon so have made path across swamp aska said bitterly a joined beric must never have made way in by fair fighting well beric said there be one more struggle stout one then go to join friend who have gone before in happy island in far west need not be ashamed to meet will welcome a men who have struggled to last for liberty against oppressor who have nobly upheld honour of iceni will meet with great welcome not until roman have landed whole of force have brought up beric estimated a exceeding two thousand men did advance to attack pressing forward against point of intrenchment iceni be too few for proper defence of so long circuit of intrenchment woman boy took place beside armed with hatchet club knife struggle be for long time uncertain so desperately did defender fight be not until suffering loss of third of number from missile weapon of british that roman at last broke through intrenchment even then british fought to last none thought of asking for quarter died contented if must kill one roman woman flung on spear of assailant preferring death infinitely to falling into hand of roman soon only survivor of briton be group of thirty men gathered on little knoll in centre of camp beric have successfully defended chief entrance to camp until roman burst in at other place then blowing horn have tried to rally men in centre for final stand aska have already fallen pierced by roman javelin boduoc small body of sarci have rallied round beric have for time beaten off assault of roman soon be reduced to half number be on point of being overwhelmed by crowd surrounding when roman trumpet sounded assailant fell back officer made way towards addressed beric suetonius bid say that honour bravery that life will be spared if lay down arm tell suetonius that scorn mercy beric said will die a have lived free men roman bade men stand to weapon not move until return be few minute before came back again behind be number of soldier who have laid aside arm provided with billet of wood long pole before beric must understand what be intended companion be struck to ground by discharge of wooden missile knocked down by pole then roman threw upon bound hand foot camp be plundered fire applied to hut palisade beaten down then captive be carried down to boat roman rowed away through marsh have little to congratulate upon have captured leader of iceni have destroyed stronghold slain four hundred of follower have cost double that number of men large portion of remainder bore wound more le severe boduoc other prisoner be furious at capture briton have fear whatever of death capture be regarded a disgrace that alone must have be preserved when comrade have be killed woman child massacred be to terrible misfortune considered that have be captured by unworthy ruse for have known what be intended must have slain other stabbed rather than become captive beric feeling be more mixed although must have preferred death to captivity idea have be much modified by residence among roman saw nothing disgraceful in what must not avoid must never have surrendered must never have voluntarily accepted life a have be taken captive against will in fair fight saw disgrace in wondered why companion have be spared might be that be to be put to death publicly a warning to countryman thought more likely that suetonius have preserved to carry back to rome a proof that have before giving up command crushed out last resistance of briton to roman rule a captive have be distributed among boat have opportunity of speaking to companion until about midnight flotilla arrived at godmancastra then be laid on ground together guard of six men taking post beside boduoc at once broke out in torrent of execration against roman have right to kill said have right to dishonour have right to die with others fought fairly refused to surrender be shameful tyranny thus to disgrace by making captive must not have refused death to most hated foe will not exult over long if will not give weapon with to put end to life will starve there be exclamation of fierce assent from other captive have not meant to dishonour boduoc to do honour beric said roman view thing in same light that do be because in opinion be brave men whom be honour to to subdue that have thus taken see slew others even woman child be captured not from pity not because wished to inflict disgrace upon simply a trophy of own valour just a must take standard may deem aggrieved because have not like rest died fighting to last so departed for happy island be will of god that must not make journey for time be really honour to that have deemed worthy of trouble of capture instead of slaying like must rather thousand time have died since god have decreed otherwise be for to show that not even captivity can break spirit that be able to bear a brave men who having done that men must do against vastly superior force still preserve own esteem give way to unmanly repinings to sullen struggle against fate nothing must please roman better than for to act like wild beast caught in snare gnashing teeth vainly when can no longer strike sulkily protesting against lot seeking to escape pain of death servitude by flying from life let preserve front haughty unabashed have inflicted heavy defeat upon rome be proud of let see that chain on body have not bound spirit that though captive still hold a free men fearless of what can do to in way will win at least respect will say be men whom be proud of having overcome by sacred oak beric speak rightly boduoc exclaimed such be bearing of caractacus a have heard when fell into hand one can say that caractacus be dishonoured man can control fate a say may show that be above fate what say friend have beric spoken well murmur of hearty assent came from other captive then roman sergeant of guard uneasy at animated colloquy among captive gruffly ordered silence beric translated order best sleep if can added will be stronger tomorrow few however slept for be suffering from wound more le severe following morning bond be unloosed wound carefully attended to by leech then water food be offered to of following beric example partook heartily hour later be placed in centre of strong guard then fell in with troop who be formed up to escort suetonius to camalodunum what be going to do to think boduoc asked beric be either going to put to death publicly at camalodunum a warning against resistance be going to take to rome think latter have suetonius be going to remain here might be taking to public execution a have a have heard be ordered home must not think have troubled to have made prisoner simply that successor might benefit by example of execution be far more likely think that will carry to rome in order to show a proof that have before leaving britain succeeded in crushing out resistance here what will do with at rome know not boduoc possibly will put to death there be not usual custom suetonius have gained triumph terrible disaster have fallen upon roman during command here though may have avenged defeat certainly doe not return home in triumph after triumph chief of captive be always put to death sacrificed to god a will be no triumph will must say be treated a ordinary prisoner of war of be sold a slave be employed on public work of make gladiator men who fight kill other in arena for amusement of people of rome who gather to see struggle just a do when two warrior who have quarrelled decide difference by combat choice doe not appear pleasing one boduoc said to be private public slave to be killed for amusement of roman well latter be shortest way out of anyhow one must choose must be terrible to have to fight with man with whom one have have quarrel beric said well know beric if be captive like must be just a tired of life a be so if kill be doing service if kill have greatly obliged so looking at in way doe not much matter way go for if do service one day someone else may do like good turn next have not looked at in way boduoc beric said laughing well there be one thing suppose choice will be given at rate will be glad to see rome have always wished to do so though never thought that must be a captive still will be something even in evil have befallen to see so great city with wonder camalodunum be a little hamlet beside on evening of second day after leaving godmancastra arrived at camalodunum in year have passed since destruction have already be partially rebuilt settled by gaulish trader from mainland roman official with family attendant officer engaged in civil service army friend associate of procurator who have be sent out to succeed catus decianus priest servant of temple suetonius have already sent to inform new propraetor petronius turpillianus of success have gained crowd assembled a procession be seen approaching while eye be directed upon little party of british captive who followed chariot of suetonius many of newcomer have a yet scarcely seen native so complete have be destruction of trinobantes looked with surprise admiration at men towering full head above guard carrying in spite of bond with air of fearless dignity most of be surprised when learned that youth for beric be a yet eighteen who walked at head be noted chief who have during past year inflicted such heavy loss upon troop of rome who have now only be captured by treachery a yet lacked inch of height of companion bade fair in two three year to rival tallest among in strength vigour procession halted before building have be erected from ruin of old city a residence for propraetor petronius surrounded by number of official came out to meet suetonius congratulate on success suetonius said will make task easier in carrying out order to deal mildly with people will make return to rome more pleasant petronius thank again for having permitted to continue in command of troop until have revenged loss have suffered at hand of barbarian be of course for to decide upon fate of beric companion assuredly deserve death must like to take with a captive to rome must prefer doing so suetonius must hardly pardon men who have so withstood upon other hand must grieve to commence rule by act of severity besides hope through to persuade others for a told in letter be fraction of outlaw that have subdued to lay down arm be well indeed that have taken chief that a hear have partly be brought up among speaks language yes lived here for five year a hostage for tribe be under charge of caius muro who returned to rome after defeat of briton made inquiry about when learned that be chief of insurgent heard that be tractable studious when among that caius thought very highly of intelligence be noble looking men petronius said surveying group of captive be honour to conquer such men will speak with chief presently will make no longer delay suetonius said ship have be lying at port in readiness for departure for last two week must fain sail tomorrow next day glad will be to leave island where have have nothing fighting hardship since landed have done well petronius said courteously be half conquered when landed be wholly subdued now be for only to gather fruit of victory never be there such obstinate race suetonius replied angrily look at men bear a if be conqueror instead of conquered be good for something better than to be killed suetonius if must mate roman woman with fair giant what race must raise must admire le if saw pouring down on shouting like demon suetonius said sullenly perhaps so suetonius will endeavour to utilize strength in service not to call into field against now let enter house varo said to one of officer take charge of captive until suetonius sail guard strongly treat well place in house where will not be stared at by crowd if chief will give word that will not attempt to escape bond can be removed if not must remain bound varo at once called centurion of legion in garrison at camalodunum bade bring up company on arrival surrounded captive marched with to guardhouse near when entered varo said to beric order of propraetor be that will be released from bond if will give oath that will not try to escape beric turned to others asked if be willing to give promise in case must escape said may be sure will be guarded too strictly for that be better that must remain bound by own promise than by fetter a consented beric in name took oath that must not attempt to escape so that rope bound arm be at once taken off in short time meal be sent to from house of petronius soon after have finished officer came in requested beric to accompany to propraetor will bring two of follower with beric said must not say aught to roman governor that tribesman must not hear officer assented beric with boduoc subchief followed to house of propraetor petronius be seated with suetonius at side while number of officer official stood behind how be beric asked that a hear who speak language have lived for year amongst come to be leader of who have warred against be perhaps because studied roman book learned how value freedom independence beric replied how revolt against tyranny have rome be conquered by more powerful nation roman must have risen in arm have one tenth of tyranny be practised against catus decianus exercised against have be treated worse than beast of field life property honour of woman be sacrificed at will death be thousand time better than such treatment read that rome have elsewhere be worthy conqueror respecting religion of tribe subdued treating leniently well have be so treated must have be if not contented patient under lot being men rose against infamous treatment to be subject although have be conquered well nigh exterminated there be briton still remaining if such be treatment to be subjected be not till last briton be exterminated that will rule island murmur of surprise at boldness with young captive spoke ran round circle have inquired since arrived beric went on of infamous deed of decianus how seized without shadow of excuse property of boadicea how when came here for justice for herself insulted daughter ordered to be scourged must free born people submit to indignity to queen knew from first that enterprise be hopeless without order discipline must in end be conquered be better thousand time to die than to live subject to treatment worse than give to slave believe that there be justice in complaint beric petronius said calmly be to lessen grievance rome have sent hither vengeance have be fully taken for rebellion be time that sword be laid aside have already issued proclamation granting amnesty to who then rose against case be different have still continued in arm have resisted power trust that with capture will end companion will go to rome with suetonius there be many of follower still in arm with must treat not a conqueror with conquered a soldier with brave foe if will lay down arm will share amnesty be free to return man to own land to dwell there cultivate free from penalty interruption surrender must benefit not only briton so long a stand in arm defy power must rule land with sword when surrender there will be peace throughout island trust that briton in time will come to look upon a friend if rome have so acted before beric said trouble must have arisen might now be ruling over contented people instead of over desert there be still many of tribesman in fen there be army beric replied have taken one stronghold that by surprise lesson will not be lost upon there will be traitor to guide next expedition by time last fenman in southern swamp will have be killed there will be heavy vengeance taken by countryman must fain put stop to petronius said upon what term think must countryman surrender will not surrender at beric said there be not man there will die rather than yield if will solemnly take oath that who leave fen return to village will live unmolested save that will when home be rebuilt herd again grazing around pay tribute such a be able to bear will believe gladly leave fen return to village fugitive who have fled north will also come back again be ready to take such oath at altar petronius said have come to bring peace to land be ready to do in power to bring about how be to know what have done must say petronius let captive be present when take oath release four of band choose most sorely wounded who be least able to support journey to rome will send with bracelet to fen will tell what have said will testify to having seen swear before god will send last injunction to to return again to land to send for fugitive to return from north to say from that will return a free men not a slave that there be dishonour in accepting such term a offer will do a say roman agreed suetonius can spare four of captive especially a there be assuredly among who must ill support fatigue of journey return now to friend beric tomorrow morning will meet at temple there will take oath of peace with britain chapter xi prisoner on leaving propraetor beric further informed comrade of offer that petronius have made think will keep oath boduoc asked be sure of beric said have be sent out by rome to undo mischief suetonius decianus have caused face be honest one roman must not lie to god more than must ought to have made term with beric boduoc said ought to have made condition that must be allowed to stay matter not for be chief of iceni who be left in first place boduoc be not in position to make term seeing that be captive at mercy in next place must not if must think that tribesman must then accept counsel to leave fen return to home must say that have purchased life freedom from roman have agreed to betray into hand one must venture to say that of beric may think not boduoc if not now in future must be said that a before be brought up among roman so now have gone back to no even if offered to of liberty must say let go who will remain captive have message come to when be free in fen must have accepted for knew that although might struggle long must be finally overpowered moreover marsh fever be a deadly a roman sword though for year have supported must in time perhaps year when summer heat come have lost strength have melted away thus have believed that roman be sincere in wish for peace that desired to see land tilled must have accepted term because be in arm free must still have resisted a captive conquered scorn to accept mercy from rome by time have arrived at house where other captive be guarded beric repeated term petronius have offered will not benefit said be captive of suetonius being taken with arm in hand warring against rome must pay penalty for sake of brother rejoice land may yet be peopled again by iceni will have consolation that may befall be partly valour have won such term from rome there be still fifteen hundred fighting men in swamp twice a many woman child there may be many more lurking in fen to north for great number especially from northern district must have taken refuge with brigantes thus then there will when have returned be goodly number be defence of fenland have won freedom for may be captive slave be not dishonoured

wander in old wood that woman be spinning by hearthstone that iceni be again tribe that be who have won for enthusiastic assent greeted beric word now said must choose four who will carry message said most sorely wounded since four be to go can care little who be chosen most of have lost love there be whose wife may have be elsewhere when attack be made let stay let who have tie save that of country go to rome only two men be found whose family have not be on island when be attacked two most seriously wounded be at once chosen a messenger next morning whole of captive be escorted to temple be small building in comparison with great edifice have be destroyed at capture of camalodunum here petronius principal officer official be assembled sacrifice be offered then petronius laying hand on altar declared solemn peace with briton swore so long a remained peaceable subject of rome man must interfere with must be free to settle in village to till land to tend herd free from molestation beric translated word of oath to briton petronius then bade four men who have be chosen stand forward told to carry message to countryman enough blood have be shed on side said be time for peace have proved yourselves worthy valiant enemy let now lay aside sword live together in friendship sent order last night for legion to leave fort by fenland to return so that way be now open to own land can settle term of tribute hereafter will not be onerous after leaving temple beric gave message to men at once started under escort for camp officer in charge of being ordered to provide with boat in be to proceed alone to countryman that evening petronius sent for beric received alone be sorry said that can not restore companion to tribe in be powerless a suetonius have captured to belong have begged a personal favour to hand over to have refused placed a be can do more have however written to friend in rome concerning have said that have done in power to bring about pacification of land have begged to represent to senate that if report reach island that have be put to death will undo work of pacification perhaps light up fresh flame of war there have indeed be angry dispute between suetonius successor former although well pleased to return to rome be jealous of petronius be angry at seeing that be determined to govern britain upon principle very reverse of have adopted moreover regarded possession of captive a important deemed that appearance in train a proof that before leaving have completely stamped out insurrection must create favourable impression must go far to restore to popular opinion be a have heard from friend in rome strongly adverse to in consequence of serious disaster heavy loss have befallen roman arm during propraetorship have therefore refused with heat to grant request of petronius next morning captive be mustered be marched down to river placed on board ship there be six vessel lying in readiness a suetonius be accompanied not only by own household by several officer official attached to personally by two hundred soldier whose time of service have expired who be to form escort to rome to beric from residence in camalodunum large ship be novelty briton with be struck with astonishment at craft so vastly exceeding anything that have before seen must sail in ship to rome boduoc asked must do so must be very long stormy voyage passing through strait between two mountain roman call pillar of hercules voyage will be short one if wind be favourable will reach coast of gaul in two day thence will travel on foot fortunately weather be fine on third day after setting sail reached one of northern port of gaul when be known that suetonius be on board be received with much pomp be lodged in house of roman magistrate a have desire to impress inhabitant of place captive be left unbound marched through street under guard of roman spearmen gaul have long be completely subdued inhabitant looked at captive with pitying eye when reached house in be to be confined native brought present of food bribing roman guard to allow to deliver a language of two people be almost identical gaul have difficulty in making understood by captive asked many question relating to state of affair in britain have heard of chief beric who have for year successfully opposed force of rome great be surprise when found that youngest of party be noted leader two day later started on long march inured a briton be to fatigue daily journey be nothing to found country flourishing village occurred at frequent interval passed through several large town with temple handsome villa other roman erection similar to that have sacked at capture of camalodunum people here seem to suffer under roman rule at rate boduoc remarked appear to have adopted roman dress tongue for that be slave not slave boduoc though can not be said to be free however have become so accustomed to roman dominion that doubtless have ceased to fret under be indeed to intent purpose roman furnish large body of troop to roman army rise to position of command importance among in time doubt unless misfortune fall upon rome will become a one people such doubt in far distance will be case with britain will adopt many of roman custom retain many of own there be one advantage see in roman dominion there be more tribal war more massacre slaughter man posse land in peace quiet what do do with boduoc asked puzzled in such country a there can be few wild beast if men can fight hunt how be to employ time must become nation of woman must seem so to boduoc for have have nothing else to employ thought when look at what roman have done how great empire have formed how wonderful be art how good law what learning wisdom have stored up one see that there be other thing to live for see though roman have learned thing can still fight if once turn so much to art of peace a to forget virtue of war empire will fall to piece more rapidly than have be built up boduoc shook head thing be well enough for beric who have lived among roman learned many of way give life in man be man when can live in open air hunt wolf bear meet enemy face to face die a men must go to happy island without bothering brain about such thing a art luxury that roman put such value on bed on fallen leaf under oak tree with star shining through leaf be better than finest chamber in rome covered with painting well boduoc beric said good temperedly be much more likely to sleep under star in rome than in grand apartment covered with painting though one may be very nice a say in summer must very well

monster soon after captive be lodged in prison pollio came to see beric told that have obtained permission for to lodge at uncle house being guarantee for safe custody there accordingly at once started together house be large one for a pollio have told beric by way uncle be man of great wealth be matter of constant complaint on part of wife that did not settle down in rome passing straight through atrium where be respectfully greeted by servant slave pollio passed into tablinum where uncle be sitting writing be guest told must bring uncle said be great chief young a look have given

beric cordially welcome young chief said will try to make stay here comfortable will be glad indeed to learn from about people of whom unfortunately have have opportunity hitherto of learning anything save that when journeyed up last year to northwest of gaul found people calling by same name a told that be kindred race that religion be similar to theirs may well be beric said be gaul though be long since left country settled in britain may well be that in of war in south of island tribe finding overpowered may have crossed to gaul with country be always in communication until be conquered by certainly did not come thence for tradition say that iceni came by ship from land lying due east from that be offshoot of belgae whose country lay to northwest of gaul people speak of magistrate

sun at rising threw ray upon stone only upon longest day of summer be so with great temple beric said upon day sacrifice be offered what signification of stone arrangement be can not say mystery be known only to druid be strictly preserved from knowledge of outside priestly rank spare for today uncle pollio said laughing be like hear to be fortnight here before sail so will have abundant time to learn everything that beric can tell will take up now with permission introduce to aunt cousin will find in garden pollio supper will be served in hour tomorrow beric will after breakfast renew conversation that feather brained young nephew have cut so short aunt lesbia will be greatly surprised when see pollio laughed a issued out into garden did not see until after have spoken to uncle horrified by telling that noted british chief beric who have defeated best troop several time with terrible slaughter be coming here to remain under charge until sail for rome be shocked considering that must be monster of ferocity even pretty cousin be terrified at prospect have mind to get to attire in roman fashion thought that must not consent however will surprise sufficiently a be lesbia be seated with two daughter on couch placed under shade of tree two three slave girl stood behind with fan dalmatian bore hound lay on ground in front of slave girl be singing accompanying on instrument resembling small harp while negro stood near in readiness to start upon errand to fetch anything that mistress might for moment fancy lesbia rose from reclining position when saw pollio approaching accompanied by tall figure with hair of golden colour clustering closely round head briton generally wore hair flowing over shoulder iceni have found such inconvenience from in making way through close thicket of swamp that many of beric among number have cut hair close to head with be recurrence to former usage a while living among roman hair have be cut short in fashion two girl who be fifteen sixteen year old uttered exclamation of surprise a beric came near lesbia exclaimed angrily have be jesting with pollio told that be going to bring beric fierce british chief here young giant be beardless lad pollio burst into fit of laughter be increased at expression of astonishment in lesbia face when beric said in excellent latin pollio have not deceived lady name be beric be chief of briton follower gave trouble even to suetonius be not beric whom have heard of a leading insurgent briton there be other chief of name beric said therefore if heard aught of good evil concerning beric briton must relate to be beric aunt pollio said must not judge by look be with suetonius in battle against can tell that held in high respect a have good cause for doing considering that in cost life of twelve hundred legionary before must overcome took by treachery rather than force how be that speaks language lesbia asked be hostage for five year among roman beric said knowledge may have of art of war be learned from page of caesar polybius other roman writer roman taught how to fight now pollio broke in must introduce in proper form be aunt lesbia a see be cousin aemilia ennia do know girl that briton big strong a be be ruled by woman take part in council be queen chieftainesses when be necessary will fight a bravely a men be held by in far higher respect than with can not say that deserve for think of other thing than attiring spending time in visit pleasure be not complimentary pollio aemilia said a to attire young roman think a much of a do that without same excuse for be cut off from public life have none save home pursuit if treat a say briton treat woman doubt not that must show a worthy of now ask fairly aemilia can fancy encouraging legionary in heat of battle seizing spear shield rushing down into thick of fight a have seen british woman do can not imagine that aemilia said laughing must not bear weight of shield spear much le use in battle if british woman be a much bigger stronger than be a beric be bigger stronger than be can imagine fighting wondered how briton must withstand troop now that see one of there be difficulty in comprehending yet look fierce beric think that be fierce beric said smiling even most peaceful animal will try defend when be attacked have seen lesbia asked have seen pollio replied if have not be for must be with still for uncle wished to engage at once in discourse upon religion custom of people carried beric away almost forcibly lesbia sighed impatiently interest of husband in matter be to perpetual source of annoyance be owing to so frequently travelled from one province to instead of enjoying at court in rome although in other matter norbanus gave way to wish in be immovable be forced to pas life in what considered exile ceased to take further interest in conversation reclined languidly on couch while pollio gave cousin description of life in britain beric answered numerous question a to people conversation be interrupted by slave announcing that supper be ready lesbia be relieved at finding beric thoroughly understood roman fashion comported at table a other guest must have done girl sat down at meal although be contrary to usual custom insisted that family must take meal with save upon occasion of set banquet seems wonderful ennia said to sister later on that must have be dining with fierce chief of whom have heard so much that must be a courteous pleasant well mannered a young roman good deal more pleasant than most of aemilia said for put on air be just like merry good tempered lad while if young roman have done tithe of deed have must be insufferable must get pollio to take tomorrow to see other briton must be giant indeed when beric who say be little more than eighteen year must take pollio under arm walk away with in morning accordingly pollio started with two cousin to prison while beric sat down for long talk with norbanus in study beric soon saw that roman viewed matter on spoke from standpoint of philosopher without prejudice after listening to beric must tell about religion of briton said be remarkable that people appear to think that have private deity of own who interest specially on behalf aid to fight battle have found exception to rule more primitive people more obstinate be belief in rome at present learned no longer believe in jupiter mar rest of deity though still attend state ceremony at temple holding that state religion be necessary lower class still believe then can not be said to reason in greece scepticism be universal among upper class same may now be said of egypt roman belief be more unaccountable since have simply borrowed religion of greek god attribute being same with only change of name yet fancy that greek god be special patron of rome religion seems to most reasonable of have studied approach more nearly than other to highest speculation of greek philosopher believe in one god who be invisible impersonal who pervades nature having formed so lofty idea of belittle by making special god of own country while if pervades nature must surely be universal jew too believe in single god in respect resemble in religion be far more reasonable than of nation who worship multiplicity of deity too consider that god confines attention simply to rule over only little tract call own province about hundred mile long by thirty forty wide from religion have sprung have made many convert even in rome have made way among learned seeing that be more strange extravagant than other have however advantage that new god be believe universal have equal interest in people have naturally studied tenet of new sect be singularly lofty pure teach among other thing that men be equal in sight of god doctrine naturally gain for approval of slave lower people upon other hand brings into disfavour with in power be peaceful sect must harm one a preach that fighting be wrong fear that will before long come into collision with state for be doctrine to spread there must soon be lack of soldier to appears that view be impracticable on subject in other respect must make good citizen since religion prescribes respect to authority fair dealing in respect with other men be too distinguished by charity kindness towards other one peculiarity of new religion be that although springing up in judaea have made le progress among jew than elsewhere for people who be of others most obstinate intolerant accused founder of religion one christus before roman court be put to death in opinion most unjustly seeing that there be crime alleged against save that perverted religion of jew be in way concern of ours a be tolerant of religion of people suetonius attacked sacred island slew priest on altar beric objected be quite true norbanus said have nothing whatever to do with religion be simply because priest stirred up insurrection against have temple in rome to deity of almost nation have subdued have suffered without objection preacher of new doctrine to make convert persecution have already begun against sect be not because believe in christus because refuse to perform duty incumbent upon roman citizen two of slave belong to sect know well that care not to what religion belong indeed for part must be glad to see slave join for moral teaching be high slave must not steal from however good opportunity be more than can say of others doubtless have be fixed in rome fact that belonged to people must have be kept secret in province one trouble head about such matter be to mind matter of private opinion have leave from to go on meeting day to place where assemble for even here there be enough of to form gathering so long a be done quietly be offence to one matter be discussed other day among for order against christian came from rome when thing be spoken of said that a believed member of sect be chiefly slave who be not called upon to perform military duty must not deem that order applied to that a be harmless people religion taught to discharge duty in matter save that of carrying arm must not see why must be interfered with moreover did move in matter did people remain obstinate in faith might of lose valuable slave after more be said of matter now tell about institution of bard of have heard men seem not only to be depositor of tradition reciter of deed of forefather to hold something of sacred position intermediate between druid people for hour beric host conversed on subject beric learning more than taught wondering much at wide knowledge possessed by norbanus be not until dinner be announced that roman rose thank much beric for what have told marvel at interest that who have for last two year be leading men to battle evince in matter after five minute of such talk nephew pollio must begin to weary be fond of learning when be in household of caius muro time be chiefly occupied by study of military work in military exercise still found time to read manuscript in muro library think learned more from talk of cneius nepo secretary who be instructor than from book for have travelled much with muro have studied greek literature pollio have returned time before with cousin must have come in before to carry away whispered to beric a proceeded to dinner table must have put out uncle terribly a knew must have to go through thought a well that must finish with at once be glad did not beric replied have be great pleasure to to listen to uncle conversation from have learned good deal pollio glanced up to see if be joking seeing that spoke in perfect good faith said truly beric briton be strange fellow must rather go through day fighting in swamp than have to listen to uncle for whole morning a sat down went on girl be delighted with briton beric declare be not only biggest handsomest men ever saw believe that if lieutenant boduoc have asked either of to return with share hut in swamp must have jumped at offer girl laughed be wonderful beric aemilia said when told that be not yet full grown thought be jesting see now that truly men be bigger even than be wish have such golden hair a most of have white skin golden hair be fashionable in rome know be scarce except in few whose mother be gaul who have married with roman be nature of man to admire opposite to norbanus said admire briton because be fair while to doubtless roman woman must appear beautiful because hair eye be dark beric have not said so father aemilia said laughing be not accustomed to pay compliment beric said with smile assuredly father be right have be accustomed for last two year to see british maiden only be fair tall of well nigh a tall a a live life of active exercise be healthy strong that be pollio broke in must a soon meet soldier of goth a one of maiden beric speaks of when blood be up have seen soldier shrink from attack when with flashing eye hair streaming behind rush down upon armed with only stone billet of wood that have snatched up what may be in gentler moment know not must hesitate to pay court to one for if liked not must make small difficulty in throwing outside door of hut be too quick pollio aemilia said beric be about to compare with comparison be difficult beric said must not imagine woman a being always in mood in pollio have seen be fighting not for life in order to be killed rather than fall into hand of soldier ordinarily be gentle kind seemed to pollio to be giantess bear same proportion to height a do to height of roman men meant not to say aught against pollio broke in hastily meant to show cousin how impossible be for to make comparison between woman yours who know speak well of british woman admire devotion to husband child virtue bravery might a well compare libyan lioness with persian cat a british woman with little cousin of mine persian cat have doubtless lovable quality beric said smiling be softer gentler better mannered than lioness though perhaps lion might not think so truly roman lady be beyond comparison with ours ours live life of usefulness discharging duty a mistress of household intent upon domestic care yet interested a ourselves in public affair taking share in decision lady live life of luxury be shielded from trouble be like delicate plant by side of strong sapling rough air have blown upon be dainty with adornment gathered from whole world nature art have combined alike to make beautiful of mean aemilia pollio laughed that in beric opinion be pretty to look at good for nothing else meant not that beric said eagerly only that thing be good for be not thing british woman be good for have occasion to be good housewife because have slave who order everything for excel in many thing of british woman never so much a heard there be same difference that there be between cultured roman one of tribesman human nature be same everywhere norbanus said fair dark great small be modified by climate by education by custom by civilization at bottom be identical now pollio think have better take beric down to port sight of trade shipping will be new to chapter xii school for gladiator a vessel carrying suetonius suite captive sailed up tiber be met by galley bearing order of senate that suetonius be not to traverse street with armed suite captive in train be to land a private person that soldier be to march to barrack on capitoline where must receive arrears of pay be disbanded that captive be to be handed over to centurion who with company must be at landing place to receive pollio took news to beric who be on board same ship rest of captive being with soldier in vessel followed be rejoiced indeed said for although knew that general must not receive triumph feared that if made public entry be possible there might be public outcry for life must by custom have be forfeited have there be triumph doubt not that hand of petronius be in messenger must have arrived here week ago may be that letter despatched a much a month after left have preceded doubtless must have stated that clemency have have desired effect that trouble be at end may probably have added that be partly due to influence warned be put to death must have deplorable effect among people might cause renewal of trouble suetonius be furious for have hoped much from effect entry with captive in train must have produced have powerful enemy here scarce noble family have lost connection during trouble in britain suetonius be of course blamed for know although have borne harshly towards briton rising be due to catus rather than to a catus be creature of nero blame fall upon suetonius be deed of catus caused explosion beric said must have come sooner later be long grinding tyranny have well nigh maddened that drove caractacus first to take up arm raised western tribe made feel that roman yoke be intolerable news of massacre of druid overthrow of altar converted sullen discontent into burning desire for revenge insult to boadicea be signal rather than cause of rising be to rule of suetonius that be due that hundred of thousand of briton roman ally have perished fault of suetonius pollio said be that be too much of soldier thought of military glory left other matter save leading of troop in hand of civilian petronius be general have distinguished more in civil matter two general have be sent out with to lead troop if necessary have be chosen a administrator must have sent out ten year ago beric said there then must have be occasion for general be now approaching rome beric attention be entirely occupied by magnificent scene before with sight of temple palace rising thickly upon seven hill massilia have surprised by size splendour beside rome be only village rome must do well said to pollio to bring chief of conquered country hither sight must do more than twenty legion to convince of madness of effort to shake off roman yoke will see tomorrow pollio said a neared landing place will see many of friend today get to interest in behalf will find out for where caius muro be at present doubtless too will do what can for seeing that lived so long in charge for beric have not mentioned to friend aught of manner in have saved muro daughter at sack of camalodunum a soon a centurion came on board pollio recommended beric to care saying that be chief of party of british captive that during journey have formed close friendship with will not be in charge of long centurion said have to hand over to governor of prison will tell what have said to must now go on board other ship join companion for order be that be not to be landed until after dark pollio nodded to beric be proof that be determined populace must not be excited in favour of suetonius by passage of captive through street beric rejoined companion well boduoc what think of rome have be thinking how mad enterprise be beric told about greatness of rome from first predicted failure thought be because have be infected by roman training see now that be right well what do think be going to be done with be evident there be going to be public display of boduoc suetonius be at present in disgrace will be sent into school for gladiator set to work at of palace nero be building may do what like boduoc said

same time be to fight wild beast however settle none of thing at first after few month training see what man capability be what have fancy for always let man choose if have very strong wish in matter for be sure to succeed best in there be many who even with care never turn out first class be reserved to fight in what may be called general contest have become popular lately ten against ten fifty

waste of pain to try to make anything of be sent to galley to public work never find unwilling to learn beric said not one man said carelessly man have to defend even with blunt sword will get awkward crack if can not protect head besides in arena man life depends upon skill conquered be sure to have mercy shown unless have borne well therefore man be anxious to learn have have few obstinate fellow

did well life be not bad one after must be hateful having to fight with men with whom have quarrel beric said feel that after first minute two scopus laughed there be man standing opposite to with sword trident know very well that if kill be going to kill make very little difference after once face other whether there be quarrel between beforehand not moment fighting begin there be end of nonsense of sort what be enemy man who want to do harm man facing be going to kill unless kill there can not be worse enemy than after be just same with soldier in battle have particular quarrel with men facing directly arrow begin to fly storm of javelin come singing through air think of nothing of trying to kill men who be trying to kill thought a do before entered arena first time never felt so afterwards thing be matter of usage gladiator after first combat enters ring with just same feeling a soldier march to meet enemy beric be silent have doubt that there be truth in what scopus said own experience in battle have shown be still determined in mind that come what must must not fight for amusement of roman be of use to say now might be long time before be required to enter arena until then might a well apply to gaining strength science in arm did not seem to that there be possibility of escape might at least take to wood stand at bay there be killed in fair open fight next morning exercise began be at first of moderate character be only intended to strengthen muscle add to endurance for first six month be told that work must consist only of gymnastic exercise lifting weight wielding heavy club climbing rope wrestling running on foot food be simple plentiful adopted roman costume in order to avoid observation when went abroad being strong body individually formidable be free from rough joke generally played upon newcomer when after six hour of exercise sat down to hearty dinner general feeling among be that thing be better than expected life of gladiator with exception of appearance in arena be by mean bad one pollio called in afternoon a have promised have long talk with beric in first place have bad news for beric caius muro remained here month after return from britain be then sent to command legion in north of syria be bad news indeed pollio have looked forward to seeing have made sure must find one friend at least in rome be unfortunate indeed beric for must have spoken for might have obtained better lot for hate seeing here said passionately be better than being executed at once be lot generally befalls chief of captive taken in war scopus be not bad fellow when thing go well say that be fiend when blood be up be one of finest fighter ever have in arena though left before be old enough to go there know well however for used to come here with elder brother who be killed four year ago in africa be quite fashion among young roman to go round of school see gladiator practising then when sport come on bet on men consider most skilful fine sport beric said sarcastically well see beric have be bred up to wager upon just a briton do on fight between cock never felt hesitation about before because have particular personal interest in of combatant after know life be dull in rome for who take part in politics who have ambition to rise at court who care overmuch for luxury have none of hunting with harden muscle pas time in britain therefore be that sport of arena be so popular with class a well a with below must remember too that greater portion of gladiator be captive taken in war must have be put to death at once have not be kept for say have anything to complain of pollio be sure that most of must much rather perish in battle than be killed in arena yes be not question of being killed in battle beric be question of being captured in battle put to death afterwards may be fashion day other to treat captive taken in war with generosity honour certainly be not so at present with with other nation that know of think that people differ from rest for soul who fell into hand be slain quite admit that beric said must have have cause for complaint have be slain a soon a be captured there be something nobler in being killed a victim of hate by victorious enemy than to have to fight to death a holiday amusement admit that pollio said though since nero came to throne there have be increase in gladiatorial display methinks there be fewer now than in day before empire when spartacus led twenty thousand gladiator against rome there be one thing if creed of jew of whom norbanus be speaking to ever come to be dominant religion there will be end to arena for so averse be people to fighting that when placed in arena will not make even effort to defend a do goth sometimes lower sword fall on point suicide consider wrong simply wait calmly like sheep to be killed have be talking with friend over persecution of two year ago just after left for britain say be wonderful to see calmness with christian meet death say persecution be given up simply because people became sick of spectacle in there be interest excitement well beric be ready to go out with will not be ashamed to walk through street with gladiator pollio ashamed on contrary must know that gladiator be in fashion at present beric emperor pride on skill consort greatly with gladiator have even fought in arena therefore be thing with who be about court to affect society of gladiator a yet be not one of although may have commenced training for arena fashion not must have made difference to be friend evil fortune may have done for only difference be that whereas have not be in fashion must have taken with only to house of intimate friend a did at massilia now will be welcome everywhere besides beric even in rome chief who have kept suetonius at bay for year who be moreover latin scholar accustomed to roman society be recognized a being object of great interest especially when be young good looking be glad to see that have adopted clothes of fashion set off to much better advantage than doe british garb besides attracting le attention hope that be not going to take today to meet people pollio want to see temple public building will be just a wish beric for hour beric wandered about rome with pollio so interested in saw that be scarce conscious of attention attracted from time to time met acquaintance of pollio who introduced to beric a friend chief of iceni who cost year hard work twelve hundred men before captured petronius have written so strongly to nero in favour that life have be spared have be placed in school of scopus languid young roman looking at beric height proportion longer wondered at trouble that roman legion have have in overcoming resistance of mere handful of barbarian beric on part be by mean surprised at appearance of young courtier have seen many of same type at camalodunum have heard caius lament effeminacy of rising generation knew that scented young noble must if necessary buckle on armour fight a valiantly a roughest soldier though why must choose to waste life at present in idleness when there be so much work to be done in corner of vast empire be altogether beyond comprehension why be there crowd gathered round large building asked pollio be one of public granary corn be brought here in vast quantity from sardinia sicily from spain africa since nero came to throne be distributed gratis to who choose to apply for wonder nero be popular among people feed give show want nothing more be nothing to cruelty exercise upon rich must encourage people in lazy habit beric said pollio shrugged shoulder think because be citizen of capital of world have right to live in idleness that others must work for at rate keep in good temper there have be great tumult in rome in past time by drawing tribute in corn distributing freely here nero keep in high state of contentment like nero pollio hate pollio said be tyrant greedy cruel licentious have own mother murdered because opposed plan of best noblest citizen have be put to death either because nero be jealous of popularity because desired to grasp possession be horrible that rome have conquered world must lie prostrate at foot of creature like be because father feared that spy among slave might report what said about nero caused to send out to suetonius who be connection of family will ere long obtain for other employment away from capital will be glad to be gone atmosphere here seems to stifle one nero spy be everywhere man be afraid of speaking thought even in own house like to take life easily must rather be battling with people in swamp than living in idleness in rome thought be glad to return pollio thought must be beric suppose active life in britain have spoilt used to scent hair lounge in bath frequent show lead just life a young men have spoken to afternoon be contented with wonder at now can not take up old life where left have be back for twenty four hour be restless already be longing to be doing something must think beric said with smile that might well put up with rome for few week seems to that will take year to know wonder there be great library too filled with manuscript a understand greek must study writing of sage philosopher must rather row in galley pollio said mind hour two now then with historian philosopher be too deep for willow brain must like to look into library now beric assented eagerly entered one of building consisted of great hall with innumerable couch bench for reader round wall be pigeonhole in manuscript be deposited numerous attendant moved to fro among reader supplying with such manuscript a desired taking away have done with leaving hall passed through series of large apartment in hundred of men be at work copying manuscript be scribe pollio said very many of be slave whom owner allow to work here sharing with earnings others be freedman who have purchased liberty from saving have be manumitted by owner see many of most popular writing such a of caesar tacitus livy poet horace virgil ovid be constantly in demand score of copy must be kept on hand then again many of greek author be greatly in request manuscript wear out must be replaced so that at various library there be thousand of scribe always kept employed see among scribe men of many nationality men for instance be egyptian see roll be copying be made of papyrus be got a have heard uncle say from leaf of sort of water plant of be copying writing on to vellum for use of who understand egyptian language others be translating into latin men be persian at table near be jew be making translation of sacred book be much read at present partly owing to fact that people be troublesome probably army will have to be sent against partly because of christian sect whose doctrine be founded upon jewish sacred book be supported a claim by various prognostication of augur a call prophet book therefore be of interest to learned may be that who come here to read be secretly disciple of sect can come here read beric asked eagerly certainly can library be open to so be bath at least greater portion of everything be free here be nearly time for now to be going home beric availed at once of advantage offered by public library be only thus that men of moderate mean must in day obtain access to book for cost of manuscript be considerable library be only to be found in house of wealthy taste for reading be matter of astonishment among gladiator be subject of good deal of jesting however be for most part of good natured kind upon part of one named lupus be sneering offensive man who be professional gladiator be one of who have taken to a trade be roman of unusual stature strength have be worker in iron from making arm took to use have won many victory in arena be considered champion of school of scopus only man who approached in number of victory being porus scythian whose strong point however lay in activity dexterity in throwing net rather than in strength lupus have from first day of briton arrival at ludus viewed with aversion hostility to beric being especially marked particularly objected to slight deference shown to by companion in spite of protest of beric who in vain pointed out to that be now no longer chief that be in respect comrade equal lupus have carefully abstained from remark must bring into collision with other briton mortified a be that strength stature of be very proud have be thrown into shade by of newcomer felt that in quarrel rough strength might render more than match beric however considered a youth though doubtless powerful deemed that muscle must be match for own seasoned strength a yet have not seen beric tried with arm thought that young barbarian must know nothing of management of weapon at first annoyance only took form of addressing with affected deference a lord beric discovery while be unable to read write young briton be fond of study spent spare time in public library afforded opportunity for constant sneer beric took in good part boduoc who have now picked up enough latin to understand gist of remark one day intervened seizing lupus by shoulder dashed to ground roman sprang to foot caught up knife from table rushed at boduoc scopus however who be present with angry growl sprang upon seizing by throat with so vigorous grasp that face became purple eye stared in vain gasped for breath then flung down into corner of room with such force that lay half stunned dog exclaimed how dare take knife will have quarrel here a know if again venture on disturbance will bid comrade tie up will flay skin off back with lash briton be perfectly right why ca leave friend alone have marked ill natured jest before be glad that punished lupus rose slowly to foot with angry glare in eye knew however that scopus have in time be unrivalled in arena that moreover rest who have be offended by air of superiority must side with lanista against said nothing to briton said be boy addressed if be offence why did not take up be coward that others have to fight battle if be offended why doe not challenge to fight a be customary in ludi because be a yet pupil will not be fit to enter arena for three four year scopus said fight can only be between trained gladiator suppose that fresh joined youth be going to fight with one who have won score of time in arena excuse scopus beric said quietly be perfectly ready to fight with braggadocio challenge to contest few hard knock will do of harm therefore let go into school have out be much better so than to have perpetual quarrelling scopus must have objected gladiator broke into shout of fight fight a be according to rule of ludi that quarrel must be fought out with wooden sword without interference by lanistae simply shrugged shoulder well a have challenged lupus have nothing to say to whole of present at once adjourned to school combatant be armed with buckler with sword of same weight to ordinarily used with square edge with corner rounded off so though must give heavy blow must not cut lupus confident in skill furious at humiliation have just suffered at once sprang upon beric latter a nimbly leaped back catching blow on buckler at same time bringing own with such force weight upon roman left shoulder that brought for moment on knee shout of astonishment applause burst from looker on lupus must have instantly renewed fight beric stepped back lowered sword left arm be disabled said have best wait till can use buckler again must not be fair match now furious a be lupus felt truth of what opponent said though burst of applause at beric magnanimity angered even more than before drew back step two at order of scopus two of others came forward with oil with for minute kneaded shoulder be ready again said at last gladiator drew back opponent faced other lupus have learned that beric be not a have supposed entirely untaught although attributed blow have received solely to own rashness renewed conflict with same care prudence must have shown have be fighting with edged weapon in arena soon found however that have met with opponent differing widely from have hitherto fought beric have have excellent teacher among veteran legionary at camalodunum to skill in sword added prodigious activity instead of fighting in ordinary roman method standing firm with body bent forward buckler stretched out at level of shoulder in front of stood lightly poised on foot ready to spring forward back with shield across body in vain lupus tried to get to close quarter cramped attitude prevented rapid movement must not get even within striking distance of opponent save when latter sprang in to deliver blow however fell vainly for lupus be fighting now calmly warily with sword shield guarded blow aimed at beric soon felt that must exhaust did continue to attack in fashion presently desisted standing ground awaited attack of lupus blow fell fast heavy now then beric purposely lowered buckler moment lupus instantly struck springing pace forward beric sharply threw up left arm striking up hand of lupus a fell at same moment brought weapon with tremendous force down upon head of antagonist who fell a if killed habet habet shouted gladiator alike exultant astonished at defeat of bully of school by god beric scopus said have given lesson talked abut four year training even now must send into arena without fear why there be one two gladiator who be considered superior of lupus with sword have from first chance with be simply because did not understand way of fighting beric said quietly scopus will have four year training before fight have chanced to overcome lupus time be not going to match against men until have full strength scopus laughed look a if there be strength enough in arm beric said pointing to prostrate figure however know from what have said that wish to put off entry into arena a long a possible doubtless practice teaching will render far better swordsman than be now take away said to others pointing to lupus dash cold water over till come round then bandage head doubt if skull be not broken one of have better go for leech to examine mind let not word be breathed outside school a to contest will keep silent until be time for beric to enter arena then will be dull indeed if lay bet enough on to keep in wine for year there be fear of lupus saying word about may be sure that roughly shaken a conceit may be will hold tongue a to fact that have found master in what be pleased to call boy mind if ever hear word spoken outside school on subject will make business to find out who spread report will be very bad for man who did when bring home to be upwards of week before lupus be able to enter gymnasium again beric have particularly requested others to make allusion to discomfiture from time superiority of lupus be gone be position in school be fully established chapter xiii christian while beric thus spent time between exercise school one other of library varied occasionally by paying visit with pollio boduoc companion be not ill contented with life most of have during long journey through gaul picked up few word of latin from guard a be language of gymnasium be only medium by men of various nationality must communicate with other now rapidly increased knowledge of beric strongly urging to become acquainted with a soon a possible a might be most useful important to none of others besides boduoc be scopus thought ever likely to be credit to in more serious contest in ring showed aptitude for wrestling boxing lanista be well content with a game in arena frequently commenced with comparatively harmless sport in many of provincial city wrestler boxer be in great request beric be much pleased when heard from master that intended to confine teaching to two exercise only with regard to companion for although men be sometimes seriously hurt by blow given by mass of leather lead wound round fist be used to give weight to blow final termination to contest be rare in exercise men practised with many wrapping of wadding cotton wound round caestus answering purpose of modern boxing glove beric be very partial to exercise a strengthened muscle gave quickness activity to limb scopus encouraged in see use of caestus beric said one day one must hit guard much more quickly without be good doubt for exercise a strengthens muscle surely for fighting must be better to lay aside what be advantage of with bare fist one can knock opponent down with very few blow strike senseless what more can want than yes for men like briton must do for straight blow from one of must well nigh break in bone of face of ordinary man a say must strike much more quickly without weight on hand with smaller men contest might last for hour without caestus spectator must get tired of will try experiment day put up one of briton against asthor gaul hand against caestus see what come of at present be more skilful than of people be getting on fast when one of be fairly match in point of skill will try if briton win will when first go into arena match against champion of other school with bare hand against armed one will get great credit if win under condition at at wrestling briton be likely to carry before must like to train only for wish must beric said earnestly there be le honour in winning at wrestling boxing than in other contest scopus said for care nothing scopus besides must get more credit from winning in game than from being killed in others strength height count for much in while against active retiarius strength go for very little be active a well a strong beric so be boduoc moreover when caesar sent to to be prepared for ring meant that must take part in principal contest must be furious if on great occasion when expected to see stand up against famous champion turned out that be only wrestler be ready willing to learn exercise scopus must like to excel in might put up a wrestler boxer then if nero insisted on betaking to other weapon must do so without discredit to opinion be that man must do what can do best be to fight with club think that need have fear of antagonist strength be for most part thrown away at sword play at active man with strength be match have told that nero often look in at school doubtless will do so when come back from greece must then tell that have found that briton be likely to excel rather in wrestling boxing where strength height came into play than in other exercise that therefore be instructing chiefly in will see what can do scopus said like briton be good tempered give trouble will tell will do will send to greece for best instructor in wrestling can get hold of be better at than be wrestling have always ranked very high in sport most of already be nearly match for decius be worth taking pain about for there be rich prize to be won in provincial arena a well a at rome in greece where care for serious contest there be high honour paid to winner in wrestling game a time went on beric have little leisure to spend in library for exercise increased in severity a instead of confining a most of others did to one particular branch worked at day be almost entirely given up to exercise of one kind muscle of companion have increased vastly under training received have be accustomed to active exercise under steady training ounce of superfluous flesh disappeared limb became more firmly knit muscle showed out through clear skin in massive ridge must astonish at home beric boduoc said one day be strange that people like roman who compared to be weakly by nature must have so studied art of training men in exercise requiring strength used to wonder that roman soldier must wield such heavy spear sword now quite understand be just a nature made be men built up by art why when began arm used to ache in short time with heavy club now feel more than if be willow wand pollio have remained two month in rome have then gone out with newly appointed general to syria beric have missed light hearted friend much be not sorry to give up visit with to house of friend felt that in house be regarded a sort of show that captured british chief who be acquainted with latin tongue with roman manner be regarded with something of same curiosity interest a tamed tiger might be besides however much gladiator might be fashion in rome felt degradation in calling although quite appreciated advantage that training must be to must ever return to britain be pleased to learn from pollio on day before started that have heard that uncle must ere long return to rome believe said that be entirely aunt doing know how hate what call exile hear that have be quietly using family influence to obtain recall appointment a magistrate here learn be likely to succeed that uncle will be one of fine day astounded at receiving news that be appointed magistrate here suppose will ever learn aunt share in matter will regard what others must take a piece of supreme good luck a cruel blow of fortune however if did discover aunt must maintain stoutly that did for sake of girl whom did not wish to see married to provincial officer condemned a have be to perpetual exile a must have support of relation even of father who be also convinced that be greatest of earthly happiness for roman to reside at rome uncle for once will have to give in aemilia too will be glad to return to rome though know that ennia be of different opinion believe from what let drop one day that have leaning towards new sect of have heard from old slave who be nurse will be great misfortune if have for must cause terrible trouble at home if fresh persecution break out might be involved be sure aunt have suspicion of for if have slave must be flogged to death thrown to fish ennia life must be made burden to till consented to abandon absurd idea have taken up if norbanus have returned with family to rome beric have heard nothing of have pollio be at rome must at once have taken to see on return now that have gone there be one from whom must hear of movement norbanus must be so much occupied with new duty with society with lesbia must fill house that must have time to inquire about british captive have received a guest at massilia one evening when rest of gladiator be engaged in hot discussion a to merit of of who be to appear at game given in celebration of funeral obsequies of wealthy senator beric asked boduoc to accompany for walk one get sick of talk about fighting said a went out how men can sit indoors in hot room heavy with smoke of lamp when can go out on lovely night a can not understand have such night a at home boduoc boduoc assented reluctantly for be seldom that must allow anything roman to be superior to what be accustomed to in britain night be certainly fine here so need be when be so hot day that one can scarcely breathe outside house seems to that heat take strength out of limb beric laughed did not seem so boduoc when today threw borthon who be a heavy well nigh a strong a full five yard through air let turn out from busy street get among hill not on palace stand away from house people what night must be for wolf hunting boduoc said suddenly when have walked along for distance in silence yes be fine sport boduoc when slew knew be ridding land of fierce beast well many of gladiator be not much better beric there be porus who may be likened to panther there be chresimus who be like savage bull gripus who when not at work be for ever trying to stir up strife truly used to think beric must not slay man unless be enemy scarce feel now captive in war be like ourselves must not if must help lift sword against many of men be malefactor who have be sentenced to death a gladiator rather than to death by executioner who by term of sentence must be killed within course of year well there be objection to killing if do someone else will then there be roman be roughest most brutal of be men who have be bully of quarter who fight for money only boast that be disappointment to when by vote of spectator have to spare antagonist have conquered be at least a good work to kill one of men a to slay wolf at home then there be patrician who fight to gain popular applause kill a matter of fashion for have assuredly pity hope will never have to stand up against captive like against others can draw sword without of scruple used to feel hear that if one of can hold own for three year in most case be given liberty mean that must be allowed to go home be free from arena be now near summit of one of hill where clear sweep have be made of house standing there in order that stately temple must be erected on site suddenly heard scream in female voice there be villainy going on boduoc let break in upon game ran at top of speed in direction from have heard cry came upon group of seven eight men belonging a must see by light of moon to dreg of city female be lying on ground be clinging to two men with coarse jeer laughter be dragging from hold when two briton ran up beric struck one of men to ground with terrible blow while boduoc seizing other hurled through air fell foremost among heap of masonry of demolished building other men drew knife a beric companion turned upon there be cry be gladiator whole of without moment hesitation took to heel beric then turned towards female a light of moon fell full on face one with whom men have be struggling exclaimed why be surely beric beric looked at in surprise be lady ennia exclaimed why what be doing at time of night in so lonely place without other attendant than woman be nurse ennia said be on way with beric to secret meeting of christian held in underground room of one of villa stood here have be there several time before have not be molested a gathered from what men said noticed light fall upon necklace bracelet a passed by lamp so followed happily overtook before reached place of meeting have followed farther might have come upon there then much more harm must have be done came up roughly demanded who be bade hand over jewel lycoris answered struck down threw down on clung to must soon have plundered perhaps killed have not arrived think ennia that be foolish wrong of thus to go out unprotected at night to place a a suppose without knowledge of father mother know said be duty to go be only opportunity have for hearing word preached can not think ennia be duty beric said gravely first duty of young woman be to obey parent think that being a yet scarce woman be not able to judge between one religion

to one of age ennia be reading jewish sacred book other day one of chief commandment be to honour father mother well think at rate that be best not to go there tonight men may return at rate will not allow thus to wander about at night unprotected boduoc will escort to house when get there trust that will think over that will see that such midnight excursion be altogether wrong whatever motive may be at rate if must go must obtain promise that will write to at school of scopus gladiator to tell at what hour start will not intrude presence upon accompany for must be to make accomplice in what consider folly will always be near if be again disturbed on way boduoc will be at hand to punish who meddle with old nurse by time have regained foot be nurse of young lady beric said to sternly must know better than to bring into danger if norbanus knew what have done must have cut in piece be not fault of lycoris begged entreated not to come must not listen to be angry with beric must not be angry if knew what be to younger than have died for faith must die too if be necessary beric made reply be indeed deeply vexed at what considered act of mad folly daughter of norbanus have be very friendly kind to at massilia felt debt of gratitude to father escapade on part of ennia who be a yet scarce sixteen vexed exceedingly be not sure indeed that ought to go straight to norbanus tell have happened yet feared that in case anger of magistrate must be so great that ennia must be forced by into becoming one of vestal virgin be shut up in strict imprisonment scarce word be spoken a passed down hill into street now almost deserted at last ennia stopped at entrance used by slave to father house will give promise asked about going out at night again implore beseech again leave house of father at night unknown to can not tell danger run by so doing misery may bring not only on on parent promise ennia said owe so great debt of gratitude that even harsh word anger will think over what have said try to do what may seem to duty be ask beric said more gently then turning walked away with boduoc who have faintly understood what be being said be surprised at recognition between beric girl whom have not particularly noticed when at massilia be pollio cousin younger daughter of magistrate stayed with at massilia be well for that be not pollio who came to rescue instead of must say so boduoc said dryly pollio must scarcely be match for eight cutthroat did not mean that boduoc meant that must have rated soundly seemed to that be rating somewhat soundly beric scarce ever heard speak so harshly before wondered more a be kith kin to while by heartiness with scolded might have be own brother did not think whether have right to scold not boduoc liked maiden sister father be very kind to moreover after pollio have done for least must do be to look after cousin even if have known nothing whatever of friend must have spoken just a did idea of young girl like wandering about at night with one old slave to protect in unfrequented quarter of rome be unheard of be doing there beric be going to meeting place of new religion there be in rome people who belong to be persecuted obliged to meet in secret old woman belongs to have suppose taught ennia have heard that sect be spreading that although most of who adhere to be slave belong to poorer class there be many of good family who have also joined well must have thought boduoc said that roman have cause to be dissatisfied with god have given victory dominion power wealth what more must want of must understand that whose god did nothing to assist in fight against roman must seek other god who might do more for that roman must have be discontented with god be more than can understand what be sudden flash of light be fire in narrow street with brisk wind blowing may well spread there do hear watchman trumpet giving alarm let get back quickly boduoc may be that will be turned out to fight fire if spread be not far from school now few minute run took there house be quiet few oil lamp burning here there enabled to make way to broad plank arranged like modern guard bed on slept with three comrade be that beric scopus who slept in cubicule leading off great room asked yes be boduoc be very late growled late hour be bad for health be sober beric laughed need not ask scopus went on if have be of others who

said uneasily let go up on roof see what be like short a time have be since beric first saw flash of light fire have already spread broad sheet of flame be shooting up into air be down there in most crowded quarter wind be blowing strongly be likely to be big fire listen to din chorus of shout shriek of woman tramp of many foot running mingled with sounding of watchman horn soldier will soon be there to keep order scopus said a household be obliged to keep bucket in readiness there be abundance of water will cope with at rate wind be not blowing in direction be mile away fully can go down see if can be of assistance beric asked might help in removing good from house in carrying off aged sick can if like beric must not say a much for who be training hard for loss of night rest be serious a will be month before briton be ready for arena will do harm beric went below aroused countryman went with boduoc street be alive men be running in direction of fire carrying bucket woman be standing at door inquiring of passersby if knew what street be on fire whether be likely to spread sound of military trumpet calling soldier to arm rose in various part of city mingled with hoarse

will do that magistrate said be business a say may be of use in helping clear house outside line flame be spreading come with will take to centurion commanding company of night guard here for if saw coming out of house with good might take for plunderer centurion who be hard at work with men nodded assent be well to get more stout fellow like said to magistrate in spite of effort fire be making headway sooner house in path be stripped better strong body of volunteer for work be soon organized official placed in charge of night worked without intermission beric comrade keeping together astonishing who be working with by strength activity displayed fast a worked flame advanced faster be half suffocated by smoke spark fell thickly round worker carried good out of house into street

not be removed party of troop strove to pull down house in path of flame while others again marched up down preserving order night guard entered house compelled to leave saw that none be left behind while sentry kept guard over good piled high in open space when morning broke beric gave up work to fresh party returned with companion to school found deserted save by slave others having a learned gone to fire hour before with scopus will have bath to get rid of dust sweat beric said first will go up to roof have look at fire have time when be working to think much of a be always being driven back by must have spread good deal exclamation of surprise broke from when gained roof smoke flame be rising over large area dense canopy overhung town confused din filled air while momentarily deep heavy sound told of falling roof wall be terrible boduoc why terrible beric for part must like to see rome utterly destroyed a have destroyed so many other town roman must build up again more magnificent than before boduoc must be misfortune to world if rome be destroyed there be little chance of that have have many fire before now be large one certainly by time troop in city must be there if wind drop will soon arrest progress of flame other briton quite agreed with boduoc though ready to work hardest to aid in saving property of individual looked on with undisguised satisfaction at great conflagration on point a beric knew that must be useless to argue with have better come down from roof boduoc there be others watching fire besides ourselves if be reported that of gladiator from school be seen making exulting gesture there must be popular tumult be likely a not must be charged with being author of fire let go down get food then have bath sleep for while there be little chance of fire being checked at present at rate have done share of work after few hour sleep beric again went up to roof fire have made great progress a must see be not only travelling with wind working up against be already much nearer to school than have be a to width of area of conflagration smoke prevented from forming opinion judged that length be fully mile be evident that progress of fire be causing great dismay group be gathered on housetop everywhere while street be crowded with fugitive laden with household good making way towards thinly populated portion of hill after eating bread fruit beric again sallied out with four companion on way down met scopus with several of gladiator returning what be being done scopus a far a stopping fire nothing be being done have be given up what can be done when fire be sweeping along mile broad heat be so great that there be standing within hundred yard of soldier be there magistrate guard rest of can be done be to prevent scum of city from sacking plundering score of men have be scourged beheaded be easy matter to keep down mob there be party of guard in street whole of praetorian be under arm terror confusion be so great spread over so wide space that be well nigh impossible to preserve order proclamation have just be issued by senate calling upon citizen to gather at place of assembly in arm enjoining to preserve order authorizing slaying of robber caught in act of plundering person within certain distance of fire be recommended to send wife family with jewel portable wealth to public garden where strong guard of praetorian will be posted seems to that fire be advancing in direction also scopus be spreading everywhere scopus said gloomily heat seems to draw air in from direction flame surge sometimes one way sometimes have better not go far away beric if flame crawl up much nearer will have to prepare for move have jewel to lose be furniture of much value arm armour apparatus clothes other thing must be carried off scene a beric went forward be pitiful in extreme weeping woman carrying heavy burden with child clinging to dress came along searched up down frantically for member of family who have be lost in crowd old men woman be being helped along by relation sick be being borne past upon door top of table among fugitive be group of men from poorest district by river who be only restrained from snatching at ornament casket of woman by presence of soldier standing at short interval along street at door of principal house in spite of vigilance of guard however such theft occasionally took place scream that from time to time rose in side street told of work of plunder going on there must like to turn down here give lesson to of villain boduoc said must like nothing better boduoc must not do to get into fray at present must only bring up guard must not be likely to ask many question a to who be in fault must probably assume at once that being gladiator be there for purpose of robbery that row have arisen over division of spoil look there be centurion taking party of men down street where heard scream let move back few pace see what be going to happen yes there be party of soldier coming in at other end woman be running out of house to tell grievance small party of soldier entered house shout yell must be heard even above surrounding din men jumped from window ran out into street only to be cut down by troop there so body of soldier continued to advance until met in centre of street then after few word between officer party returned by way have come have done work street have be completely cleared of plunderer see boduoc have run down there when heard cry must have gone hard with troop certainly spent time in questioning woman might have told perhaps that have come to assistance still be just a well that keep clear of matter beric party skirted along fire for distance at point to windward of flame effort be still being made to prevent spread large number of men being employed in pulling down house under supervision of fire guard body of troop guarded entrance to street kept back crowd of sightseer who have assembled from part of city fearing that might be impressed for work of demolition briton returned to school familia a member of school of kind be called be assembled scopus be walking moodily up down gymnasium be evident by countenance of most of men that felt deep satisfaction at misfortune have befallen rome from time to time scopus ascended to roof sent one of men out to gather news be always to same effect fire be still spreading assuming hour more serious proportion towards evening flame have approached so closely that scopus gave order for men to take up bundle have already be made up containing everything of value in school have better not wait longer said at moment there may be order for school to go down to help troop then must lose everything accordingly heavy packet be lifted by men on to head shoulder started for palatine be nearest hill here be many of house of wealthy owner of most of have already thrown open garden for use of fugitive in one of gladiator deposited good two of party having be left to guard

dropped fury of flame abated more than half of rome lay in ash of fourteen district of city three be absolutely destroyed in seven others scarce house have escaped nero who have be absent reached rome on third day of fire accusation that have caused to be lighted brought against by enemy year afterwards be absurd there have be occasional fire in rome for century just a there have be in london before one destroyed strong wind be blowing be responsible for magnitude of fire there can however be little doubt that misfortune appeared so terrible to citizen be regarded by nero in different light nero be prouder of being artist than of being emperor up to time rome although embellished with innumerable temple palace be yet rome of tarquin street be narrow house huddled together mean cottage stood next to palace there be absence of anything like general plan rome have spread a population have increased be collection of house rather than capital city nero saw at once how vast be opportunity in place of rambling tortuous street crowded rookery city must rise stately regular well ordered with broad street noble thoroughfare while in midst must be palace unequalled in world surrounded by garden lake park there be ample room on seven hill across tiber for population with breathing space for everyone what glory must there not be to who thus transformed rome made worthy capital of world first however people must be attended to kept in good humour accordingly order be at once issued that garden of emperor palace must be thrown open fugitive allowed to encamp there

engaged with best architect in rome in drawing out plan for laying out new city on superb scale in making preparation for commencement of work claim of owner of ground be at once wiped out by edict saying that for public advantage be necessary that whole of ground must be treated a public property on claim being sent in other site must be given elsewhere summons be sent to town district of country under roman sway calling for contribution towards rebuilding of capital so heavy be drain so continuous exaction to raise enormous sum required to pay for rebuilding of city superb palace for emperor that wealth of known world scarce sufficed for roman empire be for many year impoverished by tremendous drain upon resource great mass of roman population benefited by fire there be work for everyone from roughest labourer to most skilled artisan artist crowd of workman be brought from part greece sent most skilful architect decorator sculptor painter money be abundant rome rose again from ruin with rapidity be astonishing people be housed far better than have ever be before rich have now space convenience for construction of house although most of have lost greater portion of valuable in fire be yet gainer by shared in pride excited by new city with broad street magnificent building groan of provincial at whose cost be raised troubled not at be true that nero in need for money seized many of wealthier citizen upon one pretext other put to death confiscated property mattered little to crowd disturbed none save whose wealth exposed to risk of same fate beric saw nothing of thing for upon very day after fire died out scopus started with scholar to villa on alban hill have be placed at disposal by one of patron there be several other school in neighbourhood a air of hill be considered to be far healthier more strengthening than of rome in spite of public calamity nero continued to give game for amusement of populace other rich men followed example sport of amphitheatre be carried on on even more extensive scale than before scopus took six of best pupil to first game be given after fire four of returned victorious two be sorely wounded defeated life have however be spared partly on account of skill bravery partly because emperor be in excellent humour mass of spectator on whom decision of life death rested saw that signal for mercy must be acceptable to briton greatly preferred life on alban hill to in rome for exercise done must wander about without being stared at commented upon pure air of hill be invigorating after of great city here too met ten of comrade whose ludi have be all along established on hill plan of escape be sometimes talked over though must not resist pleasure of discussing knew that be hopeless though altogether unwatched free to do a liked after work of day be over be a much prisoner a if immured in strongest dungeon arm of rome stretched everywhere must be at once followed hunted down wherever went height complexion rendered disguise impossible even if reached mountain of calabria traversed length of italy successfully reached alp almost hopeless prospect must find none to give shelter must ere long be hunted down at time talked of making way to seaport seizing small craft setting sail in none of knew aught of navigation task of traversing mediterranean passing through pillar of hercules navigating stormy sea beyond until reached britain must have be impossible for news came daily from city heard that nero have accused new sect of being author of conflagration that most rigid edict have be issued against that who refused to abjure religion be to be sent to wild beast in arena beric have not seen norbanus since day when have saved library from fire few day after have established in hill received letter from saying that have after much inquiry learned where scopus have established ludus greatly regretted beric have left rome without seeing hoped must call a soon a returned family be already established in house near of lucius after beric occasionally received letter from aemilia who wrote sometimes in father name sometimes in own gave gossip of rome described wonderful work be being done sent letter from pollio to read one day letter instead of coming by ordinary post be brought by one of household slave be in terrible distress beric said have told about severe persecution have set in of christian terrible thing have happened know that old nurse belonged to that sect often talked to about did not seem to that what said must be true knew ennia who be graver in disposition than be thought much of did not think for moment that have joined sect two night ago spy reported to one of praetor that person believed to be christian be in habit of assembling one two night week at lonely house belonging to freedman guard be set house surrounded fifty people be found there of be slave freedman of belonged to noble family among be ennia have gone accompanied by wretched old woman who have be questioned boldly avowed to be christian be taken down thrown into prison imagine alarm in morning when found that ennia be missing from house terrible grief when hour later messenger came from governor of prison to say that ennia be in charge father be quite broken down by blow doe not seem to care about ennia having joined new sect know be opinion that everyone must choose own religion be chiefly grieved at thought that must have gone out at night attended only by nurse that must have done secretly without knowledge mother on other hand be most of shocked that ennia must have given up god of rome for religion of slave that being daughter of noble house must have consorted with people beneath think much of of thing ennia may have done wrong be nothing to only think of a in terrible danger of life for say that nero will spare none of christian whether of high low degree father have gone out morning to see head of family of allied to by kinship to try to get to use influence to obtain ennia pardon mother doe nothing bemoan on disgrace have fallen upon be beside with grief so a can hing else write to tell of trouble have befallen will write often tell news beric first emotion be that of anger that ennia must after promise have given have again gone alone to christian gathering then reflected that a be away from rome be of course unable to keep promise have not seen since night for have passed straight through atrium with mother while be assisting slave to take up burden must not help feeling admiration for steadfastness in new faith that have taken up by side of livelier sister have regarded a quiet retiring girl be sure that to midnight outing by stealth must have be very terrible that only from very strongest sense of duty must have undertaken now open avowal of christianity when must have known be penalty that confession entailed seemed to heroic must be strange religion must thus influence timid girl said to mother killed because must not survive disaster have fallen upon people god death be deemed by briton to be honourable besides mother be briton strong firm capable of heroic action child be courting death that who belong to will deem most dishonourable there be nothing of heroine in disposition can only be faith in religion that sustains a soon a return to rome will inquire more into be now ten month since beric have entered school of scopus be nearly twenty year old constant severe exercise have broadened brought to well nigh full strength scopus regarded with pride for in various exercise of arena be already ahead of other gladiator activity be a remarkable a strength be equally formidable with trident net a with sword buckler while in wrestling with caestus none of others must stand up against have be carefully instructed in most terrible contest of against wild beast for scopus deemed that being captive of rank importance might be selected for such display libyan who have often hunted lion in native wild have described to over over again nature of animal attack spring with hurl upon opponent scopus having obtained skin of one of animal killed in arena libyan have stuffed with outstretched paw scopus obtained balista by be hurled through air a if in act of springing against beric frequently practised must remember libyan said that lion be like great cat a spring strike so that must avoid not only direct spring paw stretched to full extent a pass in air must be a quick a animal must not swerve till be in air then must leap aside like lightning turning a leap be ready to drive spear through a touch ground inert mass although may pas through air a rapidly a wild beast poorly represents force fierceness of lion spring libyan meet charge standing closely together with spear in advance for to spring on even then be rarely kill without one two being struck down before dy bull be thought by to be more formidable than lion a be quick can easily evade rush bear be ugly customer seem slow clumsy be not so be very hard to kill one blow from forepaw will strip off flesh a readily a blow of tiger will snap spear shaft a easily a if be reed be ugly beast to fight more than fair match for single man better by far fight most skilled gladiator in ring than have anything to do with creature yet be well to know how to meet so that if ill fortune place in front of may know how to do best account came almost daily to hill of scene in arena roman accustomed though be to fortitude with gladiator met death stroke be yet astonished at undaunted bearing of christian old men girl slave men of noble family calmly facing death even seeming to rejoice in one evening slave brought note from aemilia to beric contained few word effort be vain ennia be condemned will be handed to lion tomorrow in arena have received order to be present a punishment for not having kept closer watch over think will die beric went to scopus at once advised several time to go to arena scopus in order to learn something from conflict want to be present tomorrow porus lupus be to fight be going beric will take with will start two hour before daybreak so a to be there in good time a lanista will enter arena with can not take there know attendant can arrange for to be down at level of arena may not be long before have to play part there must like to get accustomed to scene wall of face roar of applause for thing be apt to shake nerve of one unaccustomed to beric smiled after meeting roman twenty time in battle scopus noise of crowd must no more affect than roar of wind over treetop still want to see more want to see how people of new sect face death british woman fear to die often slay rather than fall into hand of roman knowing well that will go straight to happy island have more trouble be christian a brave scopus shrugged shoulder yes die bravely enough who fear death among people rome have conquered where have met with coward everywhere woman be found ready to fall by husband sword rather than become captive to leap from precipice cast into blazing pyre be man anywhere lower than wild beast who will face assailant till last have seen men of tribe people fight in arena if conquered raise hand in order to live to conquer day not once when thumb have be turned down have seen one flinch from fatal stroke be true enough beric said methinks be one thing to court death in hour of defeat when friend have fallen round hope be lost quite to stand alone friendless with eye of multitude fixed on still must see next day beric stood beside scopus among group of guard attendant of arena at one of door leading from above seat of vast circle be crowded with spectator in centre of lower tier sat emperor near be member of council court lower tier round arena be filled by senator equity with wife daughter above be seat of official others having right to special seat then came tier above tier to uppermost seat vast concourse of people when great door of arena opened procession entered headed by cneius spado senator at whose expense game be given then two two marched gladiator who be to take part in accompanied by lanistae teacher scopus after seeing beric well placed have left to accompany porus lupus gladiator be variously armed there be hoplomachi who fought in complete suit of armour laqueatores who used noose to catch adversary retiarii with net trident wearing armour helmet mirmillones armed like gaul samni with oblong shield thracian with round one with exception of retiarii wore helmet right arm be covered with left being protected by shield gladiator saluted emperor people procession then left arena first two matched against other again entering accompanied by lanista gladiator be novice men who have frequently fought conquered being reserved for later contest a excitement of audience became roused one of combatant be armed a gaul other a thracian combat be not long one men fought for short time cautiously then closing exchanged fierce rapid blow until one fell mortally wounded murmur of discontent rose from spectator there have not be sufficient exhibition of skill to satisfy eight ten pair of gladiator fought one after other excitement of audience rising with conflict a men of noted skill now contended victor be hailed with shout of applause vanquished be spared proof that spectator be in good temper satisfied with entertainment beric looked on with interest in age in lived feeling of compassion scarcely existed war be normal state of existence tribal war be of constant occurrence vanquished be either slain enslaved men fought out private quarrel to death beric being by birth briton by education roman felt more compunction at sight of blood than did briton roman to only unnatural feature in contest be that there existed personal tribal hostility between combatant that fought solely for amusement of spectator otherwise be more moved by scene passed before eye than be briton of present day by friendly boxing match be more interested when porus entered arena accompanied by scopus liked porus who although quick fiery in temper be good natured not given to brawling have often practised against knew exactly strength skill be clever in management of net failed sometimes from eagerness to use trident be received with loud applause when entered justified good opinion of spectator by defeating antagonist who be armed a samnite spectator expressing dissatisfaction at clumsiness of latter by giving hostile signal when gaul for vanquished belonged to nationality instead of waiting for approach of porus at once stabbed with own sword last pair to fight be lupus one of briton have not be trained in school of scopus in one of other ludi a be first of brought over by suetonius to appear in arena be greeted with acclamation a loud a with lupus be received tall a lupus be briton far exceeded in stature interest of spectator be aroused by question whether strength of newcomer must render fair match for well known skill of lupus buzz went round amphitheatre a bet be made on result beric felt thrill of excitement for briton be one of youngest most active of follower have often fought side by side with against roman how well have be trained beric knew not a knew that be superior in swordmanship to lupus felt that countryman chance of success be good be not long however before saw that teaching briton have received have be very inferior to given at school of scopus although twice nearly beat lupus to ground by sheer weight of blow latter thrice wounded without receiving scratch warned however of superior strength of briton lupus still fought cautiously avoiding blow trying to tire out for long time conflict continued then thinking that opponent be now weakened by exertion by loss of blood lupus took offensive hotly pressed antagonist presently inflicted fourth more severe wound than previously given shout rose from spectator lupus win when briton with sudden spring threw upon opponent shield clashed together a stood breast to breast lupus shortened sword to thrust in below briton buckler when latter smote with hilt of sword with strength full upon assailant helmet so tremendous be blow lupus fell inert mass upon ground while tremendous shout rose from audience at unexpected termination of contest scopus leaned over fallen man be insensible breathed being simply stunned by weight of blow scopus held up own hand unanimous upturning of thumb showed that spectator be well satisfied with skill courage with lupus have fought chapter xv christian to lion after contest in lupus have be defeated there be pause gladiatorial part of show be now over there be greater excitement still awaiting audience for knew nero have ordered that of christian be to be given to lion there be hush of expectation a door be opened procession consisting of priest of jupiter several attendant of temple followed by four guard conducting elderly man with two son lad of seventeen eighteen entered made way across arena stopped before emperor priest approached prisoner holding out small image of god offered life if must pay customary honour to refused be then conducted back to centre of arena rest leaving there filed out through door old man laid hand on shoulder of son began singing hymn in joined voice rose loud clear in silence of amphitheatre there be pause waver in tone a entrance to one of cage at other end of arena be opened lion lioness appeared animal stood hesitating a looked round at sea of face then encouraged by silence stepped out side by side made circuit of arena stopping uttering loud roar a came upon track along bleeding body of who have fallen have be dragged when have completed circle again paused now for first time turned attention to three figure standing in centre for minute stood irresolute then crouching low crawled towards beric turned head must view without emotion contest of armed men must not like population of rome see unarmed unresisting men pulled down by wild beast there be dead stillness in crowded amphitheatre then there be low sound a of gasping breath one voice alone continued hymn soon that too ceased suddenly tragedy be over buzz of conversation comment again broke out among spectator certainly christian knew how to die be bad citizen have doubtless assisted to burn rome knew how to die strong body of guard provided with torch now entered lion be driven back to den body being left lying where have fallen four batch of prisoner who be brought out one after met with similar fate then there be pause be known that girl of noble family be to be last victim eye be turned to norbanus who with wife aemilia sat in front row near nero with two praetorian guard standing beside be deadly pale pride of noble blood stoicism of philosopher knowledge of own utter helplessness combined to prevent showing other sign of emotion lesbia sat upright immovable be not one to show emotion before gaze of common people aemilia half insensible must have fallen have not guard beside supported have seen nothing of what have passed in arena have sat frozen with horror beside mother again door opened priest of diana followed by procession of white robed attendant six virgin from temple of diana entered followed by ennia between attendant of temple while band of lictors brought up rear even hardened heart of spectator be moved by youth beauty of young girl who dressed in white advanced calmly between guard with gentle modest expression on feature when procession formed up before emperor saluted priest virgin surrounded urged to pay reverence to statue of diana pointing to parent implored for sake to recant pale a death with tear streaming down cheek shook head quietly can not deny lord who died for said nero rose from seat maiden said if not for own sake for sake of who love pray to cease from obstinacy how can child like know more than wisest head of rome how can deny god who have protected given victory to country must fain spare be child a say caesar ennia replied have strength of own be strong in strength of worship gave life for be not much that must give mine for sank back on seat with angry wave of hand saw that sympathy of audience be with prisoner must willingly have gained approval by extending clemency towards procession now returned to centre of arena where girl weeping took leave of ennia who soon stood alone slight helpless figure in sight of great silent multitude nero have spoken in low tone to one of attendant door of cage be opened lion larger in bulk than have previously appeared entered arena saluting audience with deep roar a did so tall figure naked to waist sprang forward from group of attendant behind strong barrier at other end of arena be armed only with sword have snatched from soldier standing next to deep murmur of surprise rose from spectator master of ceremony exchanged few word with emperor body of men with torch trumpet ran forward drove lion back into den then beric who have be standing in front of ennia advanced towards emperor who be nero asked be beric once chief of iceni now british captive received great kindness on way hither from norbanus father of maid a briton be not ungrateful be ready to defend to death crave a boon caesar that will permit to battle against lion with such arm a may decide be christian emperor asked coldly be not be of religion of nation rome have always permitted people have be subdued to worship in own fashion know nought of christian doctrine know that damsel at least can have have nought to do with burning of rome that though may have forsaken god of rome in only can have offended pray pray assembly to let stand a champion against beast burst of applause rose from spectator be novelty excitement beyond what have bargained for have be moved by youth of victim now prospect of something even more exciting than rending to piece of defenceless girl enlisted in favour of applicant moreover roman intensely admired feat of bravery that captive must offer to face single handed animal be known to be one of most powerful of in amphitheatre filled with admiration accustomed a be to gaze at athlete be struck with physique strength of young briton with muscle standing up massive knotted through white skin granted granted shouted let fight nero waited till acclamation ceased then said people have spoken let will be done must not be unfair to lion a maiden be unarmed so will stand unarmed before lion decision be received in silence by spectator be sentence of death to young briton silence be succeeded by low murmur of disapproval beric turned little pale showed other sign of emotion thanks caesar for so much of boon said in loud steady voice accept condition being understood must god of country of maiden defend against lion damsel will be free from pain penalty will be restored to parent be understood nero replied with inclination of head to emperor wave of hand to audience in general beric turned walked across arena to barrier scopus be standing there be mad beric grieve for be favourite pupil looked for great thing from now have come to be over be not quite over yet scopus will try to do credit to training give cloak wrapped in ample fold then walked quietly back to centre of arena murmur of surprise rose from spectator why must briton cumber limb with garment on reaching position beric again threw off cloak stood in short skirt reaching scarce to knee be unarmed cried in loud voice see have not a much a dagger then tore off two broad strip from edge of garment twisted into rope forming running noose in threw cloak be composed of stout cloth used by common people over arm signed to attendant at cage to open door oh beric why have thrown away life in useless attempt to save mine ennia said a stood before may not be useless ennia god have protected through many danger god will surely assist now do pray to for aid then a door of den opened stepped few pace towards roar of applause rose from vast audience have appreciated action in making rope guessed that meant to use cloak a retiarius used net there must then be contest not massacre enraged at former treatment lion dashed out of den with sudden spring made three four leap forward then paused with eye fixed on man standing in front of still immovable in easy pose ready for instant action then sank till belly nearly touched ground began to crawl with stealthy gliding motion towards more more slowly went till paused at distance of ten yard for few second crouched motionless save for slow waving motion of tail then with sharp roar sprang through air with motion a quick beric leaped aside a touched ground sprang across loin at same moment wrapping cloak in many fold round head knotting end tightly then a lion recovering from first surprise sprang to foot with roar of anger disgust beric be on foot beside for moment strove to tear away strange substance enveloped head beric dropped end of noose over one of forepaw drew tight with sudden pull jerked animal over on back a sprang up again other forepaw be noosed be again thrown over time a sprang to foot beric struck tremendous blow on nose unexpected assault for moment brought down mad with rage sprang up struck out in direction at invisible foe leaping bounding hither thither beric easily avoided onslaught taking opportunity struck three four time with force on ear time rolling over over last of blow seemed almost to stun lay for moment immovable again beric leaped upon coming down astride of loin with weight seizing at once two rope lion uttered roar of dismay pain struck at first with one paw then with other by coolness quickness however escaped blow then when lion seemed exhausted jerked tightly cord twisting behind lion back with rapid turn fastening together lion be helpless now have beric attempted to pull cord in other position must have snapped like pack thread in position have strength pad of foot being fastened together limb almost dislocated a animal rolled over over uttering roar of vain fury beric snatched cloth from head tore off strip twisted without difficulty bound hind leg together then again wrapped round lion head standing up bowed to spectator mighty shout shook building never have such feat be seen in arena before men woman alike standing up waved hand with frantic enthusiasm beric have not escaped altogether unhurt for a lion struck out at have torn away piece of flesh from side blood be streaming down over white skirt then went up to ennia who be standing with closed eye hand clasped in prayer have seen nothing of conflict have believed that beric death own be inevitable ennia said god have saved lion be helpless then sank down insensible raised on shoulder walked across arena passed barrier ascending step walked along before first row of spectator handed over to mother then descended again bowed deeply first to emperor then to still shouting people giver of game advanced placed on head crown of bay leaf handed to heavy purse of gold beric placed in girdle again saluting audience rejoined scopus who be in state of enthusiastic delight at prowess of pupil have proved first gladiator in rome said school of scopus be ahead of rival now must get side dressed inch two beric conflict must not have ended a did yes if lion have not be in such hurry to strike have stretched paw to fullest must have fared badly with beric said be out of breath spiteful have not recovered from blow from shock of jumping on must have pretty nearly broken back knew be risk be only chance of getting paw in position in other must rope have be strong enough to hold how came to think of fighting in way scopus asked after leech who be always in attendance to dress wound of gladiator have bandaged up side never expected to have to fight beast unarmed beric said have sometimes thought what must be done in such case thought that if one must wrap one cloak round lion head beast must be at one mercy have have caestus must have beaten skull in without saw that only plan be to noose limb surely man ought to be able to overcome blinded beast must not try for gold in rome beric even now have seen do did mark caesar there be one appreciates valiant deed more than doe at first countenance be cold marked narrowly half rose to foot countenance changed when first threw on lion none applauded more warmly than did when victory be gained listen to be shouting for again must go never before did know to linger after show be over will give present care not for beric said must take scopus said will undo favourable impression have made will be useful to must ever enter arena again be conquered go go beric again entered arena attendant led up to emperor who presented with gold bracelet saying will speak to again beric have wondered that people must have resisted suetonius so long wonder no longer then beric be led round arena lady threw down ring bracelet to be gathered up by attendant handed to a bowed to giver norbanus wife daughter have already left seat surrounded by friend congratulating bearing with still insensible girl having made tour of arena beric again saluted audience retired one of imperial attendant met a left building emperor bid say scopus when beric be recovered from wound be to attend at palace thought emperor meant well towards scopus said will in case fight more in arena how be that beric asked in surprise did not hear shout of people last time entered beric heard great confused

wholly ignorant idea be of simple british chief rome way be too complicated for to understand be to speak to on such matter must soon forfeit favour for in britain be a be people of world simple straightforward in thought way with idea of state expediency therefore pray let stand aloof from such matter regard simply a one ready to strike die in defence a having more interest knowledge of state affair state intrigue than statue in garden there so be nero said be modest beric modesty be virtue rare in rome appreciate honesty feel sure can rely upon for faithful service let see to what office will appoint can not call bodyguard for must excite jealousy of praetorian sat in thought for minute ah exclaimed be fond of book will appoint private librarian library be vast will have

beric though a say place be not without danger guessed when caesar sent for that purposed to use strength courage in service face be one invite trust nero be wise enough to see that if be to trust must trust altogether have acted wisely deemed that having friend connection in rome must rely upon a must rely upon one who be native here will be great man for time at rate must rather have remained at ludus scopus will feel like little dog saw other day in cage of one of lion beast seemed fond of little creature knew well that at moment lion might stretch out paw crush scopus nodded be true enough beric though there be ten of thousand in rome who must gladly run risk for sake of honour profit still a said to before started have faith in good fortune quickness believe that may escape from bar where must lose skin tell to none what caesar have said to world will soon guess that post a private librarian be pretext for caesar to have near be not by such post that victor of arena must be

farewell know comrade at ludus will always be glad to see will be back in rome a soon a place be rebuilt may be sure will come scopus have shown much kindness if in way can repay will do so tell boduoc hope very shortly to have with that maybe will be able to find mean of withdrawing others from arena a soon a separated beric walked rapidly to house where norbanus have taken up abode a reached door paused for heard within sound of wailing felt that have come too late tell norbanus said to slave at door that beric be here that unless wish to see will leave undisturbed a fear by cry

will go to happy island though may not be same that druid tell briton of how be lady lesbia aemilia wife be well magistrate said have not consolation of philosophy a have think that feel be better for child that must have so died ennia must always have remained christian fresh trouble persecution must have come besides religion must have put apart from mother family to of course must have made difference holding view do a to religion of world wife see thing in different light aemilia be worn out with watching grief know that will see presently be if be not compelled to return at once to hill return there no more have seen nero today have appointed official in household will seem ridiculous to when say that be to be private librarian that of course be pretext to keep near person deeming that be strong enough to be useful guard to being stranger be not likely to be engaged in intrigue may be going on must rather have remained at ludus for time there be refusing offer of emperor spoke to fairly answered a one man must do frankly openly nero have done wisely norbanus said warmly though for promotion be perilous to be friend be to be condemned beforehand to death though for time may shower favour upon be fickle inconstant have not learned to cringe flatter be a likely a not to anger by outspoken utterance will assuredly say what think if question beric said quietly if value a guard will scarce question when know must express opinion contrary to own when do enter service beric be to present tomorrow morning then will stay with tonight beric be house of mourning be a one of must excuse ceremony for have many arrangement to make a ennia will be buried tomorrow will go out into garden beric said do so will send up word to aemilia that be there doubtless must rather meet there than before slave beric have be sitting in shade for hour when saw aemilia coming towards face be swollen with cry tear be still streaming down cheek beric took hand must have bent over when grasped with of hers pressed to lip oh beric cried what have not done for how much do not owe have not be for must be mourning now not for ennia who lie with smile on face in chamber for ennia torn to piece devoured by lion seemed to that too must die when suddenly stood between fierce beast seeming to eye a if god have come down to save when people gave up a lost standing there unarmed calmly waiting lion attack felt that must conquer truly ennia god yours must have stood beside though saw not how else must have be so strong fearless ennia thought so too told so one night when house be asleep only watching beside bey god be with ' said 'none other must have given strength to battle with lion will bring to in good time will meet again ' said something about knowing that be christian of course must not have known that did know aemilia beric then told of meeting with ennia old slave when be attacked by plunderer on way home from place of meeting promised not to go again said without letting know in case must have escorted protected from harm just after there be fire have to go away with scopus to alban hill so a knew must not escort never heard from must have be with night be arrested then might not have fallen into hand of guard indeed have be here must have gone gladly for seemed to there must be something strange in religion must induce quiet gentle girl like to go out at night unknown to parent now desire even more to learn about god must surely have given strength courage that showed when chose death by lion rather than deny too must like to know something about aemilia said by way ennia spoke when said knew that be christian seemed to that if did know thought be impossible thought be angry with for becoming christian be angry with not for being christian for going out without father knowledge told so frankly if have be must not have be so much surprised because have high spirit be fearless in disposition for to do so seemed so strange unnatural deemed religion of hers must be bad in that taught girl to deceive parent what did say beric must see that considered duty beyond other duty so said more knowing nothing of religion beyond what father told wish pollio have be here girl said must have thought a do about loss of ennia father have philosophy considers rather good thing to be out of world mother be so horrified when heard that ennia be christian that be sure be relieved at death be not philosopher be nothing to whether ennia took up with new sect not so see have one who can sympathize with ca think how dreadful thought be that will be alone in future grow accustomed to thing beric said have lost relation country everything be here stranger little better than slave yet life seems not so unpleasant to in time grief will be healed will be happy again be sure must never have be happy beric if have died in arena must always have have before eye must have dreamt of why do say that until today have be almost slave why be different today beric told of new position if must take position have strength for one night aemilia said passionately must slay tyrant be monster be to that ennia death be due have committed unheard of crime will kill too beric kill whom once favour will be on guard aemilia besides danger will not be great for will have nothing to gain by death will keep aloof from intrigue will have reason to suspect danger if danger there be will come from refusing to carry out of cruel order be ready to be guard not executioner know how will end girl sighed will hope always conquered lion maybe will conquer nero who be very much le imposing creature beric smiled slave girl at moment summoned aemilia into house waited moment remember beric said that if trouble danger come upon such poor aid a can give will be yours be roman girl have not strength to fight a have have courage to die a at risk of life saved ennia for so must risk life to save yours remember that woman can plot scheme that in dealing with nero cunning go for a much a strength have many relative friend here too ennia death in arena must have be viewed a disgrace upon whole family so can rely upon help from if need be remember must occasion arise will feel refusal of help much more bitterly than misfortune acceptance of must bring upon then turning girl went up to house on arriving at nero palace next morning

saved little daughter when others have be slain at sack of camalodunum that have hidden away until after defeat of boadicea have then sent safe unharmed back to roman matter escaped mind till now though in truth bade secretary write to to say must befriend be strange that having so much life spirit in great body of yours must yet hold life so cheaply be way with forefather be not so now

of ours what private act may be may be that be cruel to powerful wealthy on other hand spends money lavishly on people of rome be beloved by if a roman resent act towards senator patrician be business of ours stranger foreigner here to meddle in matter may be that in time if do duty well nero may permit to return to britain there be murmur of approval nero may cut off head of man in rome for what care boduoc said owe nothing to roman be enemy from highest to lowest if nero be disposed to be friend can do what like with do wish have given something more to do than to hang about palace six month passed beric stood high in favour with nero two three time in order to test vigilance of guard have sounded bell on occasion armed figure have instantly entered room only to retire when waved hand so that slave who slept at other door found nero alone when entered brought cooling drink performed other little office served a excuse for summons emperor being well aware how great must be jealousy of praetorian guard be report to reach that caesar have guard save beric often followed in train of emperor when went abroad a speedily became known that be favourite of nero friendship be eagerly sought by who frequented court good office solicited by who have request to make of emperor large sum of money have be sometimes offered for good office steadily refused to accept present to mingle in affair

placed in hand of norbanus handsome appointment nero have assigned to office be very much more than sufficient for want be always welcome guest at house of norbanus now that be official high in favour with nero even lesbia received with marked courtesy conversation always turned when lady be present upon general topic gossip of society in rome news from province other similar matter for beric

from sleep silently brought out of house by scopus a soon a beric explained to what have happened joyfully agreed to join stole in fetched arm then with hearty adieu to scopus beric placed at head of band struck off by road to praeneste walking fast arrived at bank of lyris before daybreak crossed river in fisherman boat found on bank just a daylight showed in sky entered extensive grove having walked over forty mile since leaving rome slept during day taking by turn to watch at edge of wood when be again dark started afresh be when morning broke high up on slope of apennines feel free man

flour be divided packed in small bag sheep be killed cut up three of men lifted wine skin on to shoulder rest took flour meat marched away leaving farmer family astounded at appearance of strange men with fair hair blue eye of stature appeared to gigantic still ascending mountain band halted in forest wood be soon collected fire lighted content of one of bag be made into dough at stream hard by divided into cake placed on red hot ash while meat be cut up hung over fire have forgotten drinking horn beric said steel cap porus will serve for drinking cup for today after hearty meal lay down for hour to sleep then resumed march be getting well into heart of mountain when figure suddenly appeared on crag above who be shouted what do here in mountain be fugitive from tyranny of rome beric replied mean harm to man who must meddle with be likely to regret swear that be fugitive man called back swear beric said holding up hand man turned round spoke to someone behind moment later party of fifteen men appeared on crag began to descend into ravine up beric band be making way be briton leader exclaimed a neared why beric be tired already of dignity of rome how fare with boduoc beric recognized at once gaul one of gladiator of scopus who have month before fled from ludus in minute two band met most of newcomer be gaul like leader escaped gladiator a beric name be well known to saluted with acclamation party be pleased at meeting for akin by race speaking dialect of same language regarded other a natural ally life of outlaw will be change to after nero palace beric gatho leader said pleasant change beric replied have taste for gilded chain how do fare here gatho there be plenty of wild boar among mountain can always get goat when be lacking there be plenty of wild over hill escaped captive like ourselves a for wine flour have occasionally to make raid on village propose to do beric said have money to buy what require if set villager against sooner later will lead troop after up mountain must gladly do too mean be lacking owe peasant ill will one must live know have place make headquarters hour march from hence will lead to united band continued to climb hill on emerging from ravine gatho led for distance along upper edge of forest then turned up narrow gorge in hillside with little rivulet running down ravine widened out a went up till reached spot where formed circular area of hundred fifty foot in diameter surrounded on side by perpendicular rock with tiny cascade hundred foot in height falling into at farther end rough hut of bough of tree be erected near centre good hiding place beric said see mode of retreat if peasant be to lead party of roman to entrance must be caught in trap have only be here ten day gatho said never stop long in one place have disadvantage speak of however have always one two men posted lower down at point where can see body of men ascending hill brought notice of coming when be far below so see be not likely to be taken by surprise roman soldier be not fond of night march among mountain a be hour since briton have partaken of meal be quite ready to join gaul in carcass of wild boar hanging up near hut be soon cut up roasting over fire briton contributing wine flour to meal after be over there be long talk after consulting together gatho band unanimously agreed in asking beric to take command of whole party know beric gatho said none must like have fought lion barehanded know that there be one in ludus who be match with sword while boduoc other five be infinitely superior to of in strength besides be well versed in roman way have led army against therefore be ready to accept a leader to obey order if will take will do so willingly gatho wish to have more than fifty men with for must be difficult to find subsistence for larger number hundred be outside number doubtless will be able to gather other recruit must choose to raise band to number who follow must obey a implicitly a did own tribesman in struggle with roman must swear to do harm to innocent people to abstain from violence robbery be ready to be leader of outlaw not of brigand desire only to live free life among mountain if roman come against will fight against spoil may take from be lawful booty to be used in exchange for such thing a may require with peasant will make friend if treat well will bring news of expedition may be on foot for capture a said have money enough to buy everything want at present can obtain more if necessary so that there be reason for to rob poor people of good here be too near rome for to be disaffected further south will find not unwilling to aid for province be ground into dust by exaction necessary to pay for cost of rebuilding of rome to support extravagance of nero gaul cheerfully took required oath gatho will continue to act a lieutenant with gaul boduoc command briton under may be necessary at time for band to divide a when game be scarce may find difficulty in keeping together especially if recruit band up to hundred be determined to have malefactor who have fled from justice riotous men among must prefer that must be chiefly countryman will not refuse gladiator of other nation who have be captured a prisoner of war want escaped slave among man who have once be slave might try to buy pardon freedom by betraying will be free men asking only to live in freedom among mountain injuring none determined to fight die in defence of freedom sentiment be warmly welcomed by gaul next day number of men on lookout be increased band breaking up into small party scattered among mountain in pursuit of wild boar goat be to return successful not at night to encampment on following day to take place of on watch relay be provided so that during week must take turn at duty never did men enjoy week hunting with greater zest than briton to life seemed to begin anew although sky be bluer mountain higher rougher than of britain seemed to that be once again enjoying native air of evening rude chant of gaul britain echoed among rock porus syrian stood somewhat apart from rest not understanding tongue of others therefore became naturally special companion of beric for having be six year in rome spoke latin fluently be who must go down to get news beric said one day briton must not disguise yourselves for even if stained cheek dyed hair blue eye height must betray at once gaul too though shorter than be still much taller broader men than roman there be none of who speak language well enough to ask question without foreign tongue being detected be about height of roman be swarthier than gaul must if borrowed dress of one of goatherd pas among without notice must certainly be well a be saying to know what be being done below whether there be idea of sending troop up into mountain to search for may be sure that after scare gave nero defeat of guard matter will not be allowed to drop that will search italy for must think that at first will seek for in north thinking that must be likely after taking to hill must be sure to do for party must never hope to traverse plain unnoticed to keep along chain to north cross cisalpine plain try passage of great mountain at rate will be well porus to know what be doing if be at present confining search to northern range can stay where be with confidence must be sorry to move for be well placed here there be good water game be abundant certainly will soon lack wine for everything else can manage have meat in abundance have flour to last for time for gaul eat little bread besides if pushed can do a peasant do pound up acorn beechnut make sort of bread of very well beric will go down tomorrow early in morning however two of men on sentry came in said that observed glitter of sun on spearhead armour far down hillside if be after beric said a expect be have doubtless learned that be somewhere in part of mountain from man of whom bought wine flour suppose intended to do harm when went down to purchase fresh supply may well have mentioned that party of strong men of unusual height with fair hair have bought up stock paying for honestly must perhaps surprise more than anything if news have come to ear of of official knowing hue cry be being made for must have sent word at once to praeneste rome must at once recall who be away philo take couple of brand go light signal fire pile of dry wood have be placed in readiness upon projecting rock mile away standing in position where be visible from considerable extent of hillside have be settled that party of hunter who did not return at must occasionally send one of number to point whence must get view of beacon directly pile be well alight philo pluck up green bush tuft of grass throw upon so a to make a much smoke a possible there be eighteen men in encampment four out on guard boduoc gatho be away a soon a philo have started with brand beric porus set out with two scout be where saw one of said pointing far down hillside by time will doubt have entered wooded belt must find out something about number beric said not that wish to fight for be to inflict loss upon must more than ever make effort to overtake still will be a well to know what force may think sufficient to capture will go down through forest porus said doubtless will have light armed troop with spearmen must be fleet indeed if overtake after training let see if can help porus will follow close behind although might not overtake that might bring on fight will be careful leaving buckler behind porus started on way down mountain in hour half returned have have good view of said have halted at place where got flour there be hundred heavy armed troop hundred archer slinger have come in strength beric said show that hold briton cheaply will return at once to camp by time hunter must be back sending one of men to call in other sentry returned to hut boduoc with party of ten men have already come in said that have seen gatho party making way down from point high up in mountain will pause no longer beric said will meet a descend take flour what little wine remains let be going fire extinguish brand unless have found goatherd who have marked coming going may not find place hope will not do so a must encourage by thought that have nearly captured party have ascended mountain mile when met gatho returning like not to retreat without fighting said when have heard from beric of coming of roman force agree with that be better not to anger farther want three of fleetest footed of men gatho to stay behind with porus watch unseen will cross over crest of hill to eastern side porus do mark that tall craig near summit will find one of there will lead to camping place want to know whether roman after spending day searching hill go back through forest whether encamp here in one case can return in other will be better to move south at once must laugh at heavy armed spearmen archer slinger carry more weight than do must harass sorely with missile have mean of returning a soon a men to remain with porus be chosen rest of band proceeded on way chapter xix outlaw be late at night before porus with three gaul joined rest of band in new encampment on eastern slope of hill a soon a moon rise beric must be up moving roman be in earnest when came through forest ascended for little distance then spearmen halted light armed troop scattered in party of four searching country like dog after game be not very long before discovered sign of whether footmark broken twig know not following soon came upon entrance of ravine doubt mark be plain enough there for spearmen be brought down what happened then know not doubt entered found that have gone at rate in short time set out briskly up mountain spearmen a before keeping together light armed men scattering day searched be well that crossed crest halted for night halfway between forest summit determined to learn something of intention so after be dark laid aside arm crawled into camp ground be broken rough there be great difficulty in getting close to fire learned that whole of legion at praeneste have be sent into mountain that there be twenty party of equal force be mile half apart considered that must search foot of ground for thirty mile along must assuredly discover if be still in part more than troop from corfinium marrubium have started to search eastern slope between made sure that must catch now that have found by heat of earth where fire have be that must have be there hour so before arrival if be case must make way to south at once beric said be well indeed that decided to retreat without fighting for have retired closely pursued by archer shout must certainly have be heard by of other party be fortunate did not light fire have done so might have brought of troop from marrubium can not be far distant from here upon moon will not be up for three hour yet be useless to try to make way among mountain until have light therefore let lie down to sleep will keep guard will rouse when be time to move beric sat listening intently for sound must tell of approach of foeman have however small fear that roman be moving at present must be even more difficult for than for men to make way about in darkness besides day must have be extremely fatiguing one for have doubtless started long before dawn have have to climb mountain have be day on foot must scarcely recommence search before morning easy on score thought turned to rome that aemilia have gained shelter of catacomb have doubt wondered how fared there among christian fugitive a to norbanus have slight hope of ever seeing alive nero vengeance always extended to family of who offended norbanus must certainly be held responsible for flight of aemilia thought indeed probable that a soon a aemilia left norbanus must have called friend together having opened vein must die a piso have done discussing philosophy with a soon a moon be fairly up aroused companion started along hillside be difficult work making way on now descending into deep ravine now climbing rugged slope now passing along bare shoulder there be pause until day broke when descended into gorge lay down among clump of bush one man being sent mile down while two others be posted on side of ravine have good reason for hope however that have got beyond point to searching party must extend on eastern side of hill day passed without alarm although sentry above more than once heard sound of distant trumpet a soon a sun set continued way halting again until moon rose then keeping south until daybreak be sure now that be far beyond party of roman after few hour sleep again pressed on at night lighted fire prepared for longer stay order of nero be so imperative that troop having thoroughly searched mountain at point where have ascended united also moved south in long line extending from summit of hill to lower edge of forest after two day halt fugitive again moved south continued journey until found among wild lofty hill of bruttium number have swollen a went for other fugitive band among hill be also driven south by advance of roman be miscellaneous body of gladiator escaped slave malefactor in over five hundred strong crossed mountain into bruttium there be general wish among that beric must take command of whole however absolutely declined to do upon ground that be impossible for so large body of men to keep together a there must be mean of feeding scattered about must find ample supply of meat from wild goat boar semi wild swine together must soon scare away game from among gladiator however picked out sufficient men to raise own force to hundred strong separating from rest led guided by charcoal burner to one of wildest most inaccessible point in promontory here be safe from pursuit bruttium now called calabria be chain of rugged hill at time thickly covered with wood although be possible fairly to search apennines in centre of italy with six seven thousand men large army must fail to find band of fugitive in recess of mountain of south on evening of arrival at spot determined to make headquarters beric held sort of council of war whole of band a be custom in gaul britain joining in deliberation so far beric began have retreated without fighting rome can not complain that have be in insurrection against have simply acted a fugitive a there be nowhere else whither can retire must turn upon if again pursue must then regard a abode for long time make ourselves a comfortable a can hut can erect of branch of tree skin of goat kill will provide with bedding if need be with clothing meat will not fail for must game become scarce can buy goat sheep from shepherd who come up with flock herd from village by sea besides need many thing for comfort must have utensil for cooking drinking cup will need flour wine must therefore open communication with one of town by sea be great difficulty because of thing fear treachery for nigh year fought roman at home must have fought for twenty more have not be betrayed surrounded of there will always be danger have gold will always pay for what require other band among hill will not be so scrupulous a indeed will be forced to take food will set inhabitant against roman will have difficulty in finding guide among so long a keep far apart from rest be comparatively safe none of native must know of hiding place can anyone propose good plan for obtaining supply there be silence for time men be good for fighting few of have head to plan at last porus said be a guide tell two hour journey from hill whence may look down upon gulf dividing bruttium from sicily lower slope of hill be say closely cultivated there be many small village distance up on side solitary farm well nigh up to crest seems to that must use one of farmer a agent must be man with wife family must be hostage if told that if did bidding must be well rewarded while if unfaithful must destroy farmhouse slay wife child think might trust two three of must go down with to town on seashore dressed a men working under help bring up good purchase quantity might excite suspicion did always go to same place for need not always do if found impossible to get enough by mean of one man might carry out plan with three four of none of men need know direction of camp must suffice that wine flour be brought to house must always send strong party to fetch thence a require think can hit on better plan porus a there be murmur of assent continued propose friend that appoint porus head of victualling department leave arrangement to entirely point be settled next morning porus taking three of gladiator who most resembled native in appearance started on mission be completely successful farmer on upper slope of hill lived in terror of bandit among mountain one be readily induced by offer of reward for service of freedom from molestation to undertake business of getting up corn wine henceforth supply of article be obtained regularly hut be soon erected men be divided into hunting party life of fugitive passed quietly for time without incident person with whom beric have deposited money have be chosen for by norbanus have be too long away from italy to be acquainted with outside wall of rome among friend there be several who be able to recommend men of property character to whom money must be committed with certainty that must be forthcoming whenever demanded at present beric be amply supplied with fund for money that norbanus have sent to must last for at least year four month after reaching bruttium thought must be a well to warn in whose charge own store have be placed to hold in readiness by in case must be suddenly asked for philo seemed to only person must send on mission upon more important one of going to rome communicating with aemilia be certain of fidelity of lad properly disguised be le likely to be recognized in rome than porus must be clothes such a must be worn by son of well to do cultivator be obtained for be directed to take road along coast to rome putting up at inn in town giving out that be on way to capital to arrange for purchase of farm adjoining that of father letter be given to person holding beric money one for goldsmith in rome with whom portion of money have given for jewellery that beric have received at game be still deposited letter be not to be delivered until have be to catacomb seen aemilia a although scopus have spoken very highly of man be possible that might to gain favour with nero hand over beric messenger to beric fully impressed upon philo risk must run told to make call after to be prepared for instant flight if mistrusted manner of of men visited be afraid beric philo said will not be taken alive know that must torture to force to lead to hiding place must rather die thousand time first be slave when be allotted to in palace of nero have be kind to trusted have allowed to go with have behaved to a if have be free one of own people have dagger if see that evil be intended will not wait until lay hand on for then blow might fail will make sure before start give full instruction what be to say to lady aemilia for however fully may write will be sure to want to know more above instruct what to do if demand to join command to bring here methinks be sure to do must have instruction in matter will tell in letter philo that be place for can not possibly have here among rough men where at moment may be called upon to make distant toilsome journey even to fight for life be very well lord suppose say to be only because beric think can not support fatigue hardship that doe not send for be willing ready to do so charge therefore to take to be point beric have many time thought over deeply too felt sure that aemilia must choose to be with accustomed a briton be for wife to share peril to journey with when went on warlike expedition seemed to that have almost right to be with then too life must be dreary in extreme shut up in cavern where light of day never penetrated in ignorance of fate cut off from kinsfolk friend question so puzzled that finally took porus into confidence having high idea of good sense can not come here porus agreed see why must not bring from that dismal place where say be establish near at hand at one of upper farmhouse in town by sea let think over in hour will tell seems to best plan counsel be said after have be absent for hour from hut myself will go with lad to fetch roman lady even though fugitive must not be travelling about country under protection of lad dare not go into rome be known to too many of gladiator disguise a might must be recognized before have be there hour will obtain dress such a must suit respectable merchant will go down to one of port below take passage in trading craft bound for ostia there will take lodging giving out that daughter who have be staying with friend for education in rome be about to return to messina with will purchase two three female slave when arrives with philo who can pas a brother son will take ship come down can then bring up place in house of one of farmer can if like take house in town lodge there with people to whom one of farmer might recommend at rate must come up to one of farm house first to see then must arrange matter between must really run no danger say went out little in rome must be ill luck indeed be there anyone on coast who met there if be not for preposterous height yellow hair blue eye there must be difficulty about matter at for must have to cross strait into sicily to buy small property there to settle down quietly be impossible with appearance to pas a one of latin race besides beric said must not desert comrade whatever lot may be mine must be also if be ever to escape must escape together for rest think plan be good one porus thank heartily when get to ostia will learn be going on in rome what have befallen norbanus other matter if be alive aemilia will certainly be in communication with by mean of christian will of course be guided by advice next day porus philo set out together three week passed then one morning philo entered camp have gone well lord lady aemilia be at house of farmer cornelius with whom porus arranged to receive on morning left have sent letter for there be writing material in house awaits coming beric hastened away at once accompanied by lad who by way gave account of journey be a thought said when came to house told of knocked a instructed gave ring to man within begged to take to lady aemilia at first pretended that knew nothing of person at last on showing letter addressed to said that friend of might know where be that if called again two hour before midnight might have news of when came back lady aemilia be there asked many question about health before opened letter one first wrote to when have read said bey lord bid stay here philo be above thing bound to obey say that bid remain because hardship must be too great for know must support hardship kind a be to here must rather go through anything with husband than remain here darkness silence be more trying than hardship so see that lord order be given under misapprehension a be sure must not have given have known be not afraid of hardship desired above thing to be with will disobey when join must decide whether have done wrong if think so send away from then lord seeing that be so gave second letter in said that if wished to join have made arrangement for doing so then kissed letter cried over said that be ready to depart when came to fetch then told that norbanus have opened vein night after have left that soldier of nero arrived just too late to trouble that property have be confiscated that have friend in world took week for porus to obtain two suitable slave one elderly woman other young servant goldsmith handed over money to at once saying ' be glad to hear that beric be alive tell that did badly in not slaying tyrant when have at mercy tell too there be rumour of deep discontent among legion in province general hope among better class of roman that will ere long proclaim new emperor overthrow nero tell also to be on guard there be talk of expedition on large scale to root out who be gathered in mountain of bruttium be said that be to be commanded by caius muro who week ago returned from syria ' be so beric exclaimed know well having lived in house for year must be sorry indeed that must meet a enemy heard aught of daughter not from goldsmith afterwards be married hear to pollio who be of family of norbanus be indeed glad to hear philo also be great friend of mine a knew muro in britain must doubtless have sought out in syria where too held office 't be strange indeed that must have married berenice whom last saw a girl now fully four year back went well on voyage well indeed lord took lady aemilia down to ostia in carriage with closed curtain stayed two day in place porus have hired none suspected on voyage that be other than daughter how be looking philo at first lord be looking strangely white feared that health have suffered said that be dwelling in darkness have so whitened indeed sun during voyage have brought colour back to cheek be now looking a used to do when carried letter to house from nero palace once arrived at brow of hill looking down upon strait of messina beric impatience must be no longer restrained descended slope with leap bound left philo far behind porus be at door of farm beric grasped hand be in there said pointing to door moment later aemilia fell into arm in hour door opened come in porus philo beric called must first thank in own name that of betrothed for great service have rendered care kindness with have watched over have settled nothing yet about future except tomorrow will complete betrothal will become wife must be done today faithful boduoc must be here a witness must be disappointment indeed to be not to be present at marriage for present at rate wife will remain here must fain go up into mountain can not be not only be life too rough for presence there must greatly add to anxiety here will be safe philo will remain with be convinced that can trust cornelius have told porus that be assured of honesty a can pay well can have idea that roman must be glad to pay far higher sum for capture have temptation to be unfaithful to besides face be frank open one will charge that while aemilia remains here none of men be to accompany when go down to port for without meaning harm might talk to people there of what be going on matter might come to ear of authority think porus said must be well beric that three men who go down with to bring up good must take up residence here there be out house be unused can occupy in way can keep eye upon two men on farm one can be always on watch to see that party of armed men be coming up from port believe in good faith of farmer be always better to take precaution far better porus plan suggest be excellent one must try make chamber little more fitting for aemilia abode will soon be done porus said knowing what wish must be in such matter purchased at ostia sufficient stuff to cover bare wall with rug such furniture a be requisite brought up in cart a far a road extends will now go down with philo two men bring up here help slave get room in order before sunset beric returned alone to camp next morning came back to farm with boduoc there be one thing must tell beric aemilia said when went in alone to see have become christian thought be likely must do so aemilia said living among people knowing how ennia have embraced religion must hardly be otherwise will tell about afterwards know little of tenet know how who held faced death there must be much indeed in religion teach men so to die told that must not object beric must have abstained from attending assembly still be right must tell before became wife porus companion have spent morning in gathering flower slave have made into wreath have decorated room be completely changed in appearance since beric left on afternoon before roughly built wall be hidden by rich hanging floor be covered with matting on be placed thick rug woven in east two three carved couch be placed against wall a many small table on tripod leg stood beside farmer wife be called in in presence that of three follower beric performed simple ceremony of roman marriage consisting only of taking aemilia hand in declaring that in conformity with condition of pact before made signed with full consent authorization of father took to be wife beric remained three day down at cottage then rejoined band few day later messenger came in from one of band at other side of promontory of bruttium saying have obtained news that preparation be being made at sybaris for landing of very large body of troop that be said to be intention of roman to make great expedition through mountain entirely exterminate outlaw must have left alone beric said bitterly if have not be that made yourselves scourge to country pillaging ravaging village among hill slaying innocent people be obliged to live man said rome have driven into mountain must feed at expense of rome beric be silent felt that have not have mean own band must have also taken to pillage men who took to hill regarded a at war with rome rome sent soldier against slew man captured hunted like wild beast a wild beast have to live at expense beric be not in advance of spirit of time be custom in war to burn destroy slay that a rome warred with must war with rome seemed natural to fugitive in hill regarded leader action in purchasing what must have taken by force simply a act of policy own people have be slain by roman doomed to risk life for amusement of roman mob if recaptured must like follower of spartacus be doubtless put to death by crucifixion under circumstance must be in slightest degree influenced by feeling of pity humanity towards roman must if suggested to have appeared supremely ridiculous beric felt then that for to say further word of blame must only have effect of causing to be regarded with suspicion dislike must lessen own influence among mountain band therefore said that must take what be necessary be not blamable against have nothing to say be to interest of of that nothing more must be taken rome must not have be stirred to send army against merely by complaint of peasant that of goat sheep have be driven off granary emptied when come to burning village slaughtering inhabitant carrying fire sword down to seashore rome be roused felt majesty insulted now be going to have veritable army invade mountain be no longer viewed a affair of brigand a insurrection however there be more to be said mischief be done have now only to do best to repel invasion tell leader that tomorrow morning will set out join will with examine country mark line by enemy be likely to advance decide where obstacle have best be erected where first stand must be made may be week yet before come roman army be not moved a quickly a tribe of mountaineer following day beric taking with greater portion of band marched across hill under guidance of charcoal burner who have now enrolled regularly in rank have taken oath of obedience course lay to northeast a be in bay of tarentum that rumour reported that roman must land a after two day marching neared spot fixed upon for rendezvous came upon other band journeying in same direction when united on shoulder of hill commanding view of great bay eight hundred men be assembled fire have be already lighted number of sheep killed roasted leader withdrew from rest a soon a have finished meal seating at point whence must see plain stretching away from foot of hill to gulf began consultation wonder why be coming round here one of chief said might have landed at rhegium in strait thence marched straight up into hill from where camp be beric must know what be going on there for town stand almost below be nought said there about military preparation nothing beric replied do think likely that will attack from point for if advanced thence must simply retire through mountain to north just a retired south when before attacked be clear what object be will sail up river will disembark at cosenza hill narrow there be short distance across to western sea ascending will at once cut off from retreat north will have magazine close at hand thousand men stationed in chain across mountain will suffice to bar way while rest will move south penning up a go until drive down to very edge of promontory where joined perhaps by force coming up from rhegium will have altogether in grip expression of dismay spread round circle have thought that roman must march straight through mountain in case must be easy to evade saw at once that by erection of chain of permanent post across hill from cosenza must be completely hemmed in must sooner later be hunted down then think that only chance be to move to mountain north of cosenza before land beric say that beric replied to begin with be not going to remain passive allow ourselves to be driven like flock of sheep into hurdle did bring against only heavy armed troop must laugh at for can march two mile to one move easily among rock where must find footing be only light armed soldier have to fear even must move at same rate a hoplites for if ventured far away from protection of spearmen must make short work of have over thousand fighting men in mountain one of in close conflict be match for at least three of light armed men in plain of course must suffer greatly from missile before came to close conflict among wood precipice must fall on suddenly be in midst before have time to lay arrow to bow therefore see roman can move slowly among hill will soon teach that dare not scatter even twelve thousand men go for much among mountain extending seventy mile from cosenza to rhegium from ten to twenty mile across how about food one of others asked in respect will be far better off than must will really have difficulty about food must need twenty legion to form cordon along slope of hill on side can while opposing roman always detach party to make foray down into plain drive off sheep goat cattle besides among lower forest there be herd of swine pasturing will be available for use question of food will be of trouble to on other hand will be vast trouble to roman foot that advance from magazine at cosenza difficulty will increase must make road a go convoy will always be exposed to attack very large body of men must otherwise be employed in escorting may form depot at foot of hill a advance even then difficulty will be prodigious must propose to fight a fought in swamp of native land to harass night day to wear out with false alarm to oppose in defile to hurl down rock on from precipice to cut off convoy fall upon camp at night until lose confidence in dare only move hither thither in solid body not until have destroyed whole of forest between cosenza rhegium made road everywhere across mountain ought be able to overcome will be time enough to think of retiring then by descending western slope long night march must take north of cosenza must then take to hill again must descend upon coast near rhegium at night seize fishing village embark in boat cross strait before morning be among mountain of sicily be so vast far stretching that operation though possible be difficult here must not probably be carried on against beric word be received with enthusiastic approval before have felt dispirited though ready to fight to last have deemed that resistance must be short fate certain now saw before veritable war in must hope to defend successfully if beaten here escape to renew elsewhere promised abundant opportunity for encountering roman be what most longed for not one there hated rome with bitter hatred a author of unnumbered woe to tribe family death have terror to men so that must die fighting with roman rising to foot returned with exulting shout to comrade chapter xx mountain warfare gladiator sprang to foot a leader returned to eagerly questioned a to news have so reanimated only replied beric will tell beric be obliged to mount rock near spot where have be feasting to repeat to whole of assembly plan for campaign against roman loud shout greeted speech gaul briton clashing sword against shield a be custom others signified approval after manner of country beric be leader beric be leader shouted will follow to death when tumult have subsided beric raised hand for silence be willing to accept leadership said if must lead must be obeyed in warfare like everything depends upon order of who command being carried out promptly without question only accept command because although younger than most of have already fought roman often successfully of will remain under respective chief who will act a lieutenant must be ready to sacrifice own wish own opinion to general welfare whom order to fight will fight know whom tell off to fell tree to raise obstacle to pile stone on edge of precipice must labour with equal zeal while who be despatched to drive up cattle to guard until needed in forest will know that turn for active fighting will come in good time man who disobeys dy be only by acting a one man under one leader that can hope to resist successfully be free men may consider humiliating thus to obey order of roman be free men too yet submit to severest discipline without slightest question obey order of general so must be here if be disposed thus to follow accept command let who can not so submit withdraw fight in own fashion will be free to depart none harming great shout followed conclusion of beric speech whole of present lifted up hand swore implicit obedience to next few day be spent in making careful examination of mountain above cosenza fixing upon point where active resistance must be best made must have missile beric said one day when lieutenant be gathered round will not begin war until roman do so must have weapon boduoc will tomorrow take whole of band descend to plain fall upon town of castanium at daybreak band of victor marsus will accompany will be also under order order be strict that one be to be injured unless resists tell inhabitant that wish harm ransack armourer shop for arrow javelin head search private house for weapon also bring off brass copper iron can find with axe head chopper in town can erect charcoal furnace here similar to used at home so provide with ample store of missile bring off from carpenter shop seasoned wood can find suitable for making of bow touch gold silver ornament of woman metal be useless to here take garment spoil of other kind must show that until driven to be not foe of people at large above frighten woman let see that though gladiator outlaw be a well disciplined a humane a own soldiery accordingly at sunset boduoc marched away at head of two hundred men returned to mountain late on following afternoon with large store of arm metal beric order having be scrupulously carried out must have seen wonder of people boduoc said to when saw that meant harm that touched person good save in matter of arm gave best to eat many even accompanied distance on return overjoyed with clemency have shown town there be lack of charcoal in many place stack have be left by charcoal burner untouched when band first appeared among mountain who have be accustomed to smelting of metal at home be appointed to cast head for arrow javelin others cut down split up tough wood fashioned shaft others made bow strong party be set to work to fell tree form obstacle in defile where rock rose steeply while others piled great heap of stone heavy rock along edge of precipice a yet there be sign of expected fleet when preparation be complete band again scattered a be easier so to maintain in provision party being left to watch for arrival of roman legion beric returned with band to former station there will be plenty of time to gather again before move forward said to lieutenant will have to collect cart from country round to land store to make arrangement for victualling will know that be easy task that be undertaking that have desperate men to meet will be week after land at very earliest before leave cosenza for fortnight beric remained quietly passing greater portion of time at farmhouse with aemilia be terrible to that be going to fight roman beric said have desire to fight roman be who want to fight with replied a have desire for crucifixion of other form of death bestow upon captive have choice to resist a think worse of aemilia for having fought countryman before see that can take to heart be going to do again especially a have very small reason to be grateful to for treatment that yours have received at hand must remember dear that a wife be briton now must no longer speak of roman a people still be not for countryman must gladly bury with in cottage far up among hill of sicily there pas life in quiet seclusion without leader others must speedily fall victim to roman a long a roman press must remain with at end of fortnight messenger arrived saying that great fleet have arrived at mouth of crathis river will from time to time send messenger to aemilia beric said a took tender farewell of wife to tell how matter go with alarm about for time there be little chance of close fighting band gathered in full force above cosenza during week elapsed before roman advanced renewed labour at various pass through be probable that enemy must move of men be already skilled archer rest have spent time for last fortnight in incessant practice must manage weapon sufficiently well to be able to send arrow into crowded mass of men be with feeling of satisfaction that roman column be seen one morning issuing from cosenza moving up road that there crossed mountain once on crest proceeded to cut down tree form camp while be so occupied gladiator remained on defensive light armed troop have be pushed by roman into wood after being permitted to advance distance sound of horn be heard followed instantly by flight of arrow then by rush of gladiator who drove light armed troop before killing many till reached protection of spearmen again again during ensuing week roman endeavoured to penetrate wood heavy armed troop accompanying archer before have penetrated far into forest found way arrested by obstacle line of felled tree with branch pointing towards be only taken after severe loss defender shooting through green hedge be only broken through when working party with heavy ax came up covered by spearmen one party pushing on incautiously be suddenly attacked on side after pouring in missile gladiator charged broke rank of spearmen destroyed whole party three hundred in number after advance be delayed until fortified camp be complete stored with provision then roman army moved forward be soon engaged in succession of combat valley ravine be defended invisible foe rolled down mass of rock among hail of arrow be only when very strong body of archer supported by spearmen climbed height on side that resistance ceased roman halted for night where stood there be little sleep for for wood rang with war cry in many language sentry be shot stabbed by men who crawled up close to at time shout became so threatening near that whole force be called to foot to repel attack in morning be quiet a before be attacked a soon a moved forward serious opposition be offered to column of spearmen light armed troop who covered advance formed connection between column be exposed to incessant attack third day roman after disturbed night again advanced time met with opposition a moved cautiously forward wondered uneasily what be meaning of silence late in afternoon learned have advanced man carrying three day provision with beric being aware that be custom have during night led men distance down hillside making detour occupied before morning ground roman have passed over at midday great convoy of baggage animal laden with provision came along extended over great length came in straggling order men leading animal making way with difficulty through thick tree five hundred roman soldier be scattered along line suddenly sound of horn rose in wood in instant at point along line of convoy strong body of men burst down upon in vain roman soldier tried to gather in group animal frightened by shouting din broke loose from leader rushed wildly hither thither adding to confusion greatly outnumbered attacked by foe individually superior in strength skill of arm animated by burning hatred roman must do little combat terminated in few minute in annihilation men with convoy be killed line of gladiator having be posted through wood ahead behind before attack began so that fugitive might escape way to carry news animal be then collected burden taken off examined flour be divided up into parcel that man must easily carry on shoulder large number of skin of wine set aside must not be taken be scattered destroyed animal then slaughtered a soon a became dark band descended mountain side marched for many mile along foot then again ascended hill ready to oppose roman advance there be movement in morning surprised alarmed at non arrival of train by general sent strong body of troop back to meet with torch in time came upon body of men animal at once returned with news of disaster to camp be terrible blow pollio general said to son in law have reckoned on obstinate resistance did not dream that gladiator must thus oppose put in mind muro of work in fen of britain indeed more than once have thought recognized war cry with iceni attacked strategy be similar to then encountered can be possible that beric be again opposing heard during short time be in rome that briton in palace of nero have risen escaped be too heartbroken at fate of uncle family to ask many question be fully occupied in preparation first thought must have be to find beric out have not be met on landing with news of disgrace death of norbanus shunned palace of nero a if pestilence have be there doubt beric must have left with other briton in case may well be at head of opposing tactic be adopting certainly look like pollio if continue to fight a have done so far be likely to have better fortune than suetonius have in campaign against be ten day since left cosenza have made ten mile advance among hill have lost already eight hundred hoplites know not how many light armed troop at rate force will melt away to nothing before have half cleared wilderness of rock forest hitherto in revolt gladiator have met troop in pitched battle strength skill have not availed against roman discipline in such fighting a discipline go for little be fighting on ground know can choose moment for attack hurl strength on one point while be groping blindly how can have got through line in night muro pollio asked men be posted down to edge of forest on side of hill there be two thousand under arm night there be nothing to prevent pollio from descending far below forest line coming up again in rear be what must have done have mean of preventing doing so for nothing short of force strong enough to reach down to sea on hand must prevent passing at rate must halt here for time whole of baggage animal be destroyed nothing can be done until train be collected war proceeded slowly roman indeed made slight advance be worn out harassed by incessant alarm to prevent recurrence of disaster to baggage train supply be now carried along plain at foot of hill then taken up under very strong escort directly to point at army have arrived soldier worn out dispirited by constant alarm became reluctant to advance unless in solid order in way five thousand men taking nine day provision with made way through heart of hill until reached southern slope sea lay before occupied only ground on stood passage brought nearer to end desired fact that army have made passage right through mountain be regarded a triumph in rome believing that end be near fresh reinforcement be sent to muro to enable to finish campaign rapidly report however to senate left doubt in mind of who read a to situation be fighting said enemy who will not allow to strike three month have passed since entered mountain yet can not say that be end than be when began have lost three thousand men of whom half be spearmen gladiator have suffered slightly for always burst down in overwhelming number slay retire at least twenty time camp have be attacked although have lost one convoy difficulty labour of victualling troop be enormous if gladiator must take to plain must annihilate in first battle a be be who select ground for action not troop be utterly worn out well nigh mutinous at what consider hopeless task ask what have best be done own opinion be that must retire from mountain establish troop in camp near foot so a to restrain gladiator from making excursion to fall upon when hunger drive to leave mountain treachery may then do what force have failed in among such body there must be traitor when war be apparently ended may through shepherd goatherd open communication with great fear be always have be that a gradually press south may pour down on to one of village on strait seize boat cross to sicily take refuge in mountain there where must laugh at effort to pursue must advise that must be announced publicly that army having traversed whole mountain of bruttium without meeting with foe object of expedition have be attained enemy may now be considered a mere mass of fugitive whom must be impossible to root out a long a take refuge among fastness for present army will be placed in cordon of camp round foot of mountain by mean fugitive will be starved into surrender if course be not approved have one other to suggest namely that whole of population of southern italy must be ordered to take part in total destruction of forest of bruttium tree must be cut down to level of soil trunk branch be burnt by fire task must be tremendous one loss to country around by destruction of forest wherein flock of sheep goat herd of swine find sustenance shelter in winter must be enormous thus thus alone be assured can band of gladiator be rooted out muro advice be taken exulting gladiator beheld troop descending from mountain to plain below own loss have not exceeded three hundred men shout of triumph rose high in wood reached ear of roman retiring sullenly down slope in few day plan of roman became apparent camp in pas above cosenza be still strongly held four well fortified camp be established in plain on side of hill muro took up post at rhegium where two thousand legionary be posted gladiator again broke up into band beric returning to former encampment to delight of aemilia must not suppose that trouble be over aemilia said have indeed beaten on own ground will now have to fight against famine wild animal have already become scarce may be sure that villager will be allowed to send more flock herd up hill to pasture before long will be necessary to make raid for food will see emboldened by success men will become rash may be cut off defeated a for there be fear a long a can pay for provision will be able to obtain for although there may be difficulty in obtaining regular supply now that troop be at rhegium upland farmer villager will continue to deal with knowing that if will take what need without payment perhaps burn house over head be not long indeed before beric prediction be verified a soon a provision became scarce band on other side of mountain recommenced foray on villager from roman camp party of soldier be sent off after to upper village marauder be several time surprised almost exterminated must be more more careful beric said to aemilia when heard of one of disaster prisoner roman take will under torture tell know will not be long before roman ascertain general position of encampment force will dwindle rapidly in last two month have lost well nigh a many men a in campaign in mountain more than have seen several of leader who told have determined seeing starvation be approaching here to endeavour to pas between roman camp with band regain mountain beyond cosenza so a to establish far north indeed can not blame retreat add to danger so long a roamed eastern hill there be danger of roman force surprising when have gone of captive may be forced to lead roman across hill to neighbourhood boduoc be vigilant scout be scattered far round camp at worst may have to carry out plan of crossing to sicily at rate have order what to do in case of sudden surprise if be absent knowing foot of wood now will at once make way north leaving to to rejoin a best can upon one thing beric have not reckoned so long a gladiator be in force among mountain country people on slope above strait be glad enough to purchase safety by silence a heard of one band after being crushed by roman learned that party from various camp have penetrated far into hill without meeting with single opponent fear of gladiator decreased there be two thousand legionary at rhegium must crush band remained somewhere about crest of hill with ease need no longer fear vengeance roman general must surely pay great reward for information must lead to being able to deal final blow to gladiator farmer with whom aemilia lodged have such thought have earned in last eight month a much a farm have brought in three best year since inherited found terrible outlaw gentle pleasant ready to lend hand on farm if needful delighted to play with child a to chief be source of never ending wonder to gladiator be according to idea fierce savage men barbarian who be good for nothing to kill other while tall man bore like roman of high rank conversed in pure latin must even read write aemilia too have become great favourite in house farmer wife wondered at seeing one with two slave to wait upon active busy interested in went on eager to learn detail of housework must manage roman household beric said did so indeed time be in rome may have to live in hut must know how to manage cook for there in rhegium life be more cheerful than usual many of upper class of rome who shrank from festivity of court of nero yet dared not withdraw altogether from rome have country estate villa along coast where must for time enjoy freedom live according to taste berenice have joined pollio three week before when found that be likely to remain stationed at rhegium for time lived with muro in villa short distance from town looking over strait must feel perfectly happy here pollio berenice said one evening a walked to fro on terrace with looking at water in moonlight be reflected bringing up into view boat rowing here there with pleasure party with music lantern if be not for thought of beric be curious that must be mixed up with life be playmate a boy saved at massacre of camalodunum restored to father when left britain be fighting against suetonius expected when left that news of defeat death must reach rome before at rome heard vague rumour that suetonius have not yet overcome final resistance of briton glad be when petronius be sent out to take place heard that gentler measure be to be used towards briton then after time when be in syria came news that suetonius have returned bringing with beric british chief with twenty of follower father at once wrote to emperor praying clemency might be extended to for kind action in saving life then when came out to syria beric name again came up have journeyed with from britain to rome have become friend then few month afterwards newcomer from rome brought story of how cousin ennia having turned christian have be condemned to lion how british gladiator named beric have sprung into arena craved to fight lion how nero have cruelly ordered to do so unarmed how have a seemed by miracle overcome lion bound by strip torn from mantle then again learned from one who came from nero court that beric stood high in favour with caesar that be always about person rumour said kept guard over at night then again when returned to rome father be at once ordered to take command of expedition against revolted gladiator among whom be be said british captive who have created disturbance in nero palace well nigh killed emperor after slaying many of praetorian escaped after father have left at house of uncle lucius made many inquiry found that beric have doubtless escaped with other briton a have never be seen in palace night heard too that have be whispered by of who be present at supper that fault have not be have be betrothed to cousin aemilia nero urged thereto by rufinus disappointed suitor ordered beric to bring to orgy upon refusal rufinus attacked beric slew by dashing head against marble pillar then nero called upon praetorian briton ran in to aid of chief defeating praetorian escaped be same night that uncle died aemilia be missing may be that fled with beric knowing that must be sacrificed to fury of nero be not strange pollio that briton must be so mixed up in life be indeed berenice there be one to whom owe so much first owe life to then owe that of ennia cousin for although died afterwards be in father house not terrible disgraceful death in arena now have be fighting against for month though of course made best of matter there be doubt that have worst of have twelve thousand men against thousand yet beric kept at bay inflicted terrible blow upon for lost third of number after first battle there be longer doubt that beric be leader of opponent even have not heard shout name a attacked who have fought against in britain must have recognized that be again opponent for used same tactic among mountain that have done in swamp know from prisoner have taken since that be unharmed

ruler seeing how fond be of exercise of arm have thought long before insurrection broke out that day might lead countryman to battle against that benefiting by study of caesar other military writer must give far more trouble to roman than even caractacus have done assuredly never dreamt of a fighting lion barehanded in roman arena in defence of roman girl a to marriage own that thought crossed
