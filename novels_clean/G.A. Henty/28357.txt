such men in country ne'er do well who have tired out friend have taken at last to life permit certain amount of freedom furnishes with living sufficient for necessary want be from such men a that great body of tramp be largely recruited many such men drive hackney coach in large town of enlist in army wherever be take up be sure to stay near foot of tree have inclination for better thing work a hard a men who have steady employment prefer own liberty with crust to solid meal regularly earned agree with myself that there be appearance of having seen better time about man can go so far with a to admit that think at time other moved in decent circle if must get at truth have doubt that must find that have thrown away opportunity alienated friend having cut adrift from tie took to life of wanderer for such man nothing must be done hope that boy beginning in vastly poorer circumstance than father will day come to earn living honestly in position of life in be placed interest however miss warden took in boy remained unabated have very useful effect upon persuaded to come up day for hour to rectory then instructed in lesson educating in manner very different from perfunctory teaching of old dame at school must urge on by telling that if must attend to lesson must day be able to rise to better position than of village fisherman father doubt have have good education from circumstance over have have control have be obliged to take to life of strolling musician be sure that must have wished of thing that son must be able to obtain good position in life when grew up under miss warden teaching boy made very rapid progress be before two more year have passed vastly in advance of rest of child of village a to however by miss warden advice remained silent when be ten regular schooling be great deal interrupted a be considered that when boy reached that age be high time that began to assist father in boat be glad of freedom sense that be able to make useful of evening when be at home weather prevented boat from going out went up for lesson to miss warden stealing away from others must lie down on moor work at book be now admitted to society of watcher have often heard whisper among other boy of look out have to be kept upon custom house officer heard thrilling tale of adventure escape on part of fisherman smuggling be indeed carried on on large scale on whole yorkshire coast cargo be sometimes run under very nose of revenue officer who be put off scent by many ingenious contrivance before vessel be expected in rumour must be circulated of intention to land cargo on distant spot mysterious light must be shown in direction by fishing boat sometimes however smuggler be caught in act then there must be fierce fight ending in at least of engaged being taken off to prison afterwards sent on voyage in ship of war will gilmore be now admitted a helper in proceeding often at night must watch one other of revenue men if saw stir beyond usual beat must quickly carry news to village score of boy be thus employed so that movement seemed to evidence concentration of coast guard men be almost certain to be thwarted expected vessel be warned off with light if concentration left unguarded place fixed upon for landing cargo must be immediately run thus five year passed will be now strong lad friend miss warden must teach little more often have up of evening to have chat with be afraid william said one evening that good deal of smuggling be carried on here last week there be fight three of men of village be killed several be taken away to prison be terrible state of affair did not for moment answer be something entirely new to that there be anything wrong in smuggling regarded a mere contest of wit between coast guard fisherman have taken keen pleasure in outwitting former there be harm in smuggling miss warden almost everyone take part in farmer round send cart in when run be expected be very wrong william fact that so many people be ready to aid in be evidence in favour people band together to cheat king revenue thereby bring additional taxation upon who deal fairly be a much robbery to avoid excise duty a be to carry off property from house have be great grief to father that parishioner otherwise honest god fearing people must take part in such doings a be evidenced by fact that so many of be involved in fray last week only abstains from denouncing in pulpit because fear that might thereby lose affection of people impair power of doing good in other respect never thought of in way miss lad said seriously just think in own case william suppose be caught sent off to sea there must be end of work have be doing must be mixed up with rough sailor after being away on long voyage must forget that have learnt must be a rough a must be poor ending indeed to pain have taken with labour have expended in trying to improve must be great grief to can assure cruel disappointment to know that hope for have come to naught sha' miss warden boy said firmly know will be hard for to draw back if necessary will leave village now that be going to be married if have be going to stay must have stopped too village will not be like to after have left be glad to think mean have remained here a long a must be of use to for though have taught a much a must in branch of education must be likely to be useful to have lent father book pushed forward till must no longer lead way there be still of course many thing for to learn have got fair start must not be content with if have to leave think longer stay here must be of use to will endeavour to obtain situation for at scarborough whitby where must after work be done continue education beg to hing rashly must be better if must stay here for year so may hope that men will not be so annoyed a think at refusal to take further part in smuggling operation at rate stay if can for time will be two month before leave three more before be settled in new home at scarborough when be so have doubt that husband will aid in obtaining situation for have be there for year will of course have very many friend acquaintance who must interest in if however find that position must be intolerable might remain quiet a to determination after fight of last week be not likely that there will be attempt at landing for little time to come will not blame therefore if at least keep up semblance of still taking part in proceeding miss warden boy said sturdily did know that be wrong therefore joined in willingly enough now tell that be so will take further share in come of be glad to hear say so william for show that aid have given have not be thrown away what sort of work must like if can get for must rather go to sea miss warden than do anything else have for last year taken lot of pain to understand book of navigation bought for say have mastered understand good deal feel sure that after few year at sea will be able to pas a mate well william know that when got book for told must not help with can quite understand that with knowledge of mathematics must be able at rate to grasp great deal of subject be afraid then that must take to sea be hard life one in young man capable of navigating ship must be able to make way brought up a have be on sea be not wonderful that must choose a profession though may regret must not think of trying to turn from very well then will endeavour to get apprenticed be hard life not harder than of fisherman to be accustomed when william returned to foster father informed that did not mean to have anything more to do

spy have intention of being spy boy said have spoken to none of revenue men mean to do so must not peach even if be certain that cargo be going to be landed surely be possible to stand aside from without being suspected of having gone over to enemy gold that must give must tempt to say word must lead to failure of landing surely there can be great offence in declining to act longer a watcher old man shook head wilful man must have way said know fellow better than do foresee serious trouble be likely to come of well if must be must boy said doggedly mean if live to be good man now that know that be wrong to cheat revenue will have more to do with must be nice reward for pain miss warden have spent upon to turn round do what tell be wrong john hammond be getting to age when few thing

get out of a soon a possible quite see that really think must not do better than pas few year on man of war for after must be fit for work might find to do well sleep upon lad will sat down on low wall in front of station thought over after seemed to that must be better to be on fine ship have chance of fighting with french than to sail in merchantman at end of five year must be twenty must pas a mate if chose settle on land must have liked to consult miss warden be out of question knew men who have pursued well enough to be sure that life must not be safe if caught might make way out of

most noted smuggling village on yorkshire coast be saying great deal struck against smuggling because lady in place told that be wrong of course drew upon enmity of whole village coast guard stopped landing two three of fisherman be killed hostility against lad be entirely unfounded rose in consequence of to such pitch that be obliged to take refuge in coast guard station hear from captain of hearty that boy have be far better educated than generality of fisher lad be specially recommended to by officer of receiving ship be there anything extraordinary about other boy captain asked with slight smile sir believe joined chiefly to be near companion two being great friend look different kind of boy altogether captain said must pick out a fisher boy anywhere picture in high boot baggy

learn more than young fellow bully who be seventeen blustered will have to learn be senior of mess will have to do a tell have made one voyage already rest of be greenhorn seems to from manner in speak that be not question of seniority simply of bounce bullying hope that other boy will no more give in to sort of thing than stevens have yet to learn that one boy be in way superior to others in course of next hour will ascertain whether be so perhaps after meal be over will go down to lower deck allow to give lesson a told will answered quietly friend be one suppose single handed must fight great hulking fellow like friend be quite willing to do so together so now if there be talk of fighting know what to expect bully eyed two boy curiously like most of type be at heart coward felt considerable doubt whether two boy must not prove too much for therefore muttered sullenly that must choose own time right choose by mean whenever like to fix time will be perfectly ready to accommodate who on earth be with long word be gentleman in disguise never mind who be will said have learnt enough at rate to know bully coward when meet lad be too furious to answer finished dinner in silence anger being more acute from fact that saw that of other boy be tittering nudging other resolved that though might be prudent for present to postpone encounter with boy must take revenge on first opportunity chapter iii sea fight a conflict of word came to end roar of laughter burst from sailor at next mess table well done little bantam one said have taken that lout down good many peg must not mind backing to thrash single handed have noticed going on for past two three day with other boy have intended to give lesson have done right well may have be on voyage before must wager that have never be aloft must back to be at masthead before have crawled through lubber hole now lad just understand that if be ready to fight boy wo interfere if try one on one of will boy duty consisted largely of working with watch to be attached of scrubbing deck cleaning brass work in battle place be to bring up powder shot for gun on second day when work be done will gilmore went up to boatswain if please sir said may go up mast boatswain looked at out of one eye do really want to learn lad do sir well when there be a at present other hand aloft may go up not at other time thank sir will at once started be accustomed to climb mast of john hammond boat be very different matter from scrambling about cliff so frequently have steady eye must look down without feeling of giddiness lubber hole have be pointed out to be determined to avoid ignominy of having to go up through when got near paused looked round did not seem to that there be great difficulty in going outside a knew must trust to hand went steadily up until stood on main top hallo lad said sailor who be busy there do mean to say that have come up outside yes there did not seem to be difficulty about be first time have tried yes then one day will turn out first rate sailor what be going to do now will looked up be going up to top of next mast be sure that wo get giddy yes be accustomed to climbing up cliff on yorkshire coast have not least fear of losing head well then fire away lad if find that be getting giddy shout will come up to thank will call if want help steadily went up till stood on cap of topmast may a well go up one more said ca think why people make difficulty of what be so easy sailor called to a saw preparing to ascend still higher will only waved hand started up when reached cap of top gallant mast sat upon looked down at harbour presently heard hail from below saw first lieutenant standing looking up at right sir will come down at once steadily descended to maintop where sailor who have spoken to abused roundly then went to where lieutenant be standing how old be youngster be little past fifteen sir have ever be up mast before never sir except have climbed up fishing boat mast many time be accustomed to clambering about cliff hope there be harm in going so high harm a have turned out be courageous little fellow never before saw lad who went outside lubber hole on first ascent well hope lad that will be a well behaved a be active courageous will keep eye upon have permission henceforth when have other duty to climb about mast a like lieutenant afterwards told captain of will exploit be sort of lad to make good topman captain remarked will soon be up to duty will have to wait to get beef on before be of much use in furling sail be very glad to have lad on board said lieutenant if be at station on mediterranean have sport between ship must back against other boy in fleet to get to masthead down again one of midshipman named forster came up to will when left lieutenant said well done young un be a much a must do at age though have be two year in navy to climb up where did if there be anything can do for at time will gladly do say that be likely for midshipman have power to speak of still if there must be anything must gladly help there be something if must be so very good sir be learning navigation there be thing ca make out must be kindness indeed if must spare few minute occasionally to explain to midshipman opened eye well be blowed exclaimed in intense astonishment idea of newly joined boy wanting to be helped in navigation beat altogether however lad will certainly do a ask though can not think that unless have be at nautical school can know anything about come to evening during dog watch then will see what have learned about subject that evening will went on deck rather shyly with two three of book midshipman be standing at quiet spot on deck glanced at will enquiringly when saw what be carrying do mean to say that understand book not altogether sir think must work out latitude longitude if knew something about quadrant have never seen one have idea of use what wanted to ask first of be meaning of of word can not find in dictionary seems to youngster that know pretty well a much a do for can not do more than fudge observation how on earth did learn thought be fisher boy before joined so be sir be orphan at age of five father left enough money to buy boat a one of fisherman have lately lost adopted became bound to a apprentice till be fourteen clergyman daughter took fancy to from first used to teach for hour day gave great advantage over other boy in school be very fond of reading supplied with book a said meant to go to sea bought book must help so there be nothing extraordinary in knowing thing came from kindness to for ten year why did try to get into mercantile marine got married left place sir before went told that be very wrong to have anything to do with smuggler so decided to give up that set whole village against must probably have be killed if have not taken refuge in coast guard station there officer in charge spoke to of joining royal navy seemed to that must do good to serve few year in for must afterwards if chose pas a officer in merchant service be rummest boy that ever came across forster said well must think over now if there be anything that specially wish to know will explain to for hour talked together midshipman solved many of problem have troubled lad then with many thanks will went below be true will tom stevens said that have be right up mast not exactly tom went up to top of top gallant mast why did do wanted to get accustomed to going up there be not bit of difficulty about except that be necessary to keep steady head must do just a well a for have climbed about cliff together score of time do think will do good will yes think so when see that fellow be willing anxious to learn be sure to do good in long run will help on perhaps in two three year may get rated a able seaman longer be regarded a boy useful only to do odd job one of midshipman be going to give help with navigation wish tom must take up too be afraid must be use have got to learn tremendous lot before can master what little be taught at school must hardly help at know well enough will must never think of thing always be fool must hardly take in little old woman tried to teach be of use trying to make silk purse out of sow ear hope that soon will be able to hit good round blow at frenchman be about will be fit for though hope may day get to be smart topman next time climb mast will go with think there be enough in head to make unsteady at rate think that can promise wo do anything to bring discredit upon feat will have performed have great effect upon bully of mess before that have frequently enjoyed boasting of experience in climbing even hinted that have upon one occasion reached masthead now more be heard of for a tom said openly be afraid that will might challenge to climbing match next evening first lieutenant said to captain that other lad who be brought down from yorkshire have be up mast with chum afternoon a told sir heard that be great friend stevens did a well a other there be great difference between one be a sharp a bright a can be other be simply solidly built fisher boy who will have doubt make good sailor be not likely to set thames on fire do know sir mr forster came to morning told that on talking to boy astounded by asking if must be kind enough to explain few thing in navigation a have pretty well mastered book work have have opportunity of learning use of quadrant forster asked if have objection to giving lesson be first time that ever heard of such request to allow must be contrary to idea of discipline still lad of sort deserves encouragement will talk with padre concerning be one of most good natured of men think must not mind giving quarter of hour day to boy after have dismissed midshipman from study of course must do same work a other boy distinction must be made between certainly not think idea be excellent one have not much doubt that mr simpson will fall in with first lieutenant went off at once to find clergyman well must be strange boy chaplain said when case be laid before must not be surprised if fellow like found way to quarter deck day appears to be sort of admirable crichton amount of learning be extraordinary in boy of age with opportunity especially in one active courageous enough to go up to cap of top gallant mast on first trial in climbing mast certainly will be very glad to take boy on will willingly give a say quarter of hour day feel sure that time will not be wasted never before heard of ship boy who wished to be instructed in navigation will be glad to help exceptional lad next day furious having received store went out to spithead midshipman have be fully engaged there be lesson with padre on following day be resumed presently one of other boy came down with message will be to go to padre cabin have arranged chaplain said when entered to give quarter of hour day to help on with navigation take on part be ready to do work seems to almost out of question that can be advanced enough to enter upon such study that however will soon ascertain now open that book let see how must work out following observation gave necessary data in five minute will handed result of course sir to obtain exact answer must require to know more than have given be quite right to morrow will go on deck with will show how to use quadrant take altitude of sun from how to calculate longitude be somewhat more difficult than latitude see have good knowledge of figure be quite sure that at end of few day work will be able to take observation will be close enough for practical purpose then asked will many question a to course of study book have read manner in have got up book work of navigation how did manage about logarithm said generally find great stumbling block in way of pupil really understand now sir can look down column find number want see how work out result why must do so have not be able to understand seems quite different from other operation in figure be so chaplain said let tell that not one navigator in fifty really grasp principle 'fudge ' a be termed answer if get right be quite content without troubling in way with principle involved if want to be good navigator must grasp principle work answer out for when can do will have right to call navigator if come to at twelve o'clock to morrow will show how to work quadrant theory be easy have to take angle sun make with horizon at moment of highest ascension in practice however be far from easy will be time before can hit upon right moment requires patience close observation if have quality will soon pick up sailor be next day greatly astonished at seeing chaplain take place at side of ship explain to will method of taking observation in meantime will be making rapid progress in good grace of crew be always ready to render assistance in running message in hauling on rope generally making useful in respect fight with robert jones have come off will have gained great confidence in when found that be able to climb mast in ordinary way while tom stevens be able only to crawl up through lubber hole goaded to madness by chaff of other boy of whom have ranged under will banner jones threw down challenge tom stevens be most anxious will must not take up except on condition stated will proclaimed profound contempt for bully will try tom can hardly fail to lick braggart a believe have muscle to speak of in big body of while be a hard a nail doubt will be tough fight if have scrap of pluck in think will win besides if doe beat will certainly get little credit for while will have learnt lot will be useful to in next fight accordingly at time appointed two lad went down to orlop deck good many of sailor accompanying ordinary fight between boy attracted little attention disparity between year of combatant liking entertained for will brought most of who be off duty to witness difference between antagonist when stripped be very marked robert jones be fully three stone heavier four inch taller be flabby altogether out of condition while will be a hard a nail a active on foot a kid be ten to one against young un one of men said if hold on for first five round must back at even so must said doubt whether can do so odds be too great against will take four to one said look at young un muscle down back wo often see anything better among lad two year older than be fight began with tremendous rush on part of jones will stood ground doggedly struck opponent fairly between eye making shake head like exasperated bull time after time jones repeated manoeuvre only once twice landed blow while never escaped without hard return at length began to feel effect of own effort stood on defensive panting for breath now be will turn danced round round opponent with activity of goat dodging in delivering heavy body blow then leaping out again before opponent must get return cheer of sailor rose louder louder will heard shouting go in finish lad will be too prudent to risk anything knew that battle be in hand unless threw away that jones be well nigh pumped out at last after dealing heavy blow saw antagonist stagger back in instant sprang forward struck between eye with far greater force than have before exerted jones fell like log be altogether unable to come up to time burst of cheering rose from crowd many hearty be congratulation will received illustration after first fight what be going on afternoon mr farrance asked captain heard lot of cheering made enquiry about sir boatswain told that be only fight between two of boy of course have not be present ah be not often that boy fight excites such interest who be be jones biggest of boy by mean satisfactory character young gilmore why jones be big enough to eat yes sir at rate ought to have be be great bully when first came on board other tackled a soon a be together seems have to day given a handsome thrashing a must be wished for without being seriously hurt have certainly established supremacy among boy of ship that boy be out of common captain said ship boy newly joined taking up navigation going about mast like monkey finally thrashing fellow two year senior must be considered a altogether exceptional will certainly keep eye upon give opportunity can for making way will received honour quietly there be nothing said in fighting fellow who be altogether out of condition have very small amount of pluck to make up for be convinced when first met that have nothing behind brag though certainly did not expect to beat a easily a did well hope will be good friend in future have enmity against there be reason why must not get on well together after know said sailor to whom be speaking decent fellow will make up think more about if be not mistaken robert jones will do bad turn if get chance one be more delighted at result than tom stevens who have cheered loudly enthusiastically dimchurch be also exuberant at will success knew that be good un never thought must have tackled that fellow know what to make of a general thing a far a have seen fellow who take to book be good for anything else everything seems to agree with if be not mistaken will be on quarter deck before many year have passed be now running down channel boy be astonished at ease smoothness with ship breasted wave at mass of snowy canvas towered above a sat one day at bow watching sheet of spray rise a ship cut way through water tom said to friend be going up above quick will anyone can see that be thought lot of knew must be so said must not grudge in fact greater success better will be pleased did not think that learning must have made difference already first lieutenant often say word to a pass padre generally speaks to when go along deck be wonderful what difference learning make not mind must ever have gone in for even have known how useful be must never have taken in be sure old woman must never have taught suppose fellow be born clever others grow to never be clever at be way suppose just learned to spell word of two letter of course be of use fellow ca do much with ba be by bo be about word remember used to think when first became chum how foolish be to be always reading studying now see what pull have got by expect be partly because father be clever man a most of people thought gentleman that came to take to well if have time over again must really try to learn something must never make much of still suppose must have got to read decently certainly must tom when once have got to read so a to be able to enjoy must have gone through sort of book got lot of information from be afraid however be too late to worry over that man may be good man good sailor without knowing how to read write be sure will do share when come to wonder when will fall in with frenchman there be saying may be sure that man on board be longing to do so hope will be bit bigger than be know captain hope so too be for ever watching ship come in sight when running down coast of spain one day look out at masthead shouted sail what be like first lieutenant hailed can only see top gallant sail sir be certainly square rigged ship bound south sail have foreign cut first lieutenant swung telescope over shoulder mounted rigging when came to top gallant crosstrees sat down gazed into distance through glass after making careful examination of ship called to captain who be now on deck be a johnson say sir square rigged ship agree with a to cut of sail be certainly frenchman evidently large frigate be running down coast a be expect hope to get through strait at night well edge in towards captain said lower top gallant sail if have already made out will be able to work in good deal closer to before doe so hand be now on qui vive be not for time that stranger must be made out from deck can get up top gallant sail again captain said must have made out by time certainly have gained upon since first saw there be longer possibility of concealment so hoist royal a well a top gallant sail stranger made addition to sail by time on board furious be able to judge of size came to conclusion that be battle ship of small size ought to be more than match for furious vessel gradually approached other until at last shot be thrown across bow of frenchman made reply continued on way a if unconscious of presence of english frigate crew of furious must now make out that have fifty gun whereas own ship have thirty four just comfortable odds captain said quietly when be reported to have doubt carry heavier metal a well a more gun altogether must be satisfactory prize to send into portsmouth men have not waited for order have mustered to quarter on own account gun be run in loaded boarding pike got ready in five minute order be given to fire shot there be cheer a white splinter be seen to fly from frenchman side helm be put up at once swept round fired broadside into furious four five shot took effect stay rope be cut two shot swept across deck killing three of sailor knocking down several of others aim steadily lad captain shouted throw away shot be turn now aim at centre port fire ship swayed from recoil of gun then swung half round broadside be poured into frenchman from other side after will tom knew little more of what be going on for be kept busy running to from magazine with fresh cartridge be not tall enough to see over bulwark be only able to peep out occasionally from one of port hole presently heard from shout exclamation of men that everything be going well on looking out saw that enemy foremast have be shot away in consequence be unmanageable crew of furious have suffered heavily main spar be intact captain manoeuvring with great skill be able to sail backwards forward across enemy stern rake repeatedly fore aft so fight continued until at last captain gave order to lay ship alongside frenchman board there be more work for powder monkey now so will tom seized boarding pike joined in rush on to enemy deck resistance however be short lived enemy have suffered terribly from raking fire of furious a captain many of officer have fallen senior survivor soon ordered flag to be lowered tremendous cheer broke from british now learned that ship have captured be proserpine be on way to enter mediterranean effect junction with french fleet at toulon next day crew worked hard to get up jury foremast when be done prize crew be put on board french prisoner be confined below a far outnumbered captor then having repaired own damage furious proceeded on way on arriving at gibraltar captain received order to proceed to malta to place under order of admiral there for time matter proceeded quietly for wind be light baffling took fortnight to get to destination here ship be thoroughly examined damage have suffered more satisfactorily repaired than have be possible while be at sea when overhauling be completed received order to cruise off coast of africa be by mean pleasing to crew who considered that have small chance of falling in with anything of own size on station be told however that there have be serious complaint of piracy on part of moor that be specially to direct attention to punishing perpetrator of such act one morning three strange craft be sighted lying close together unfortunately however be dead calm be moor certainly captain said to first lieutenant after examining with glass what must not give for breath of wind now be not going to escape get boat hoisted out take command of expedition immediately be bustle on board ship in very short time boat be lowered into water will be looking on with longing eye a men took place lieutenant noticed clamber down into bow of boat said deserve in highest state of delight will seized spare cutlas made way into bow of boat amid joke of men however be stilled moment first lieutenant took place in stern moor have not be idle a soon a saw that boat have be lowered got out sweep began to row at pace lieutenant saw must tax effort of oarsman to utmost moor have fully three mile start although men bent to oar with best will gained very slowly officer in various boat encouraged with shout men pulled nobly five mile have be passed one mile gained be evident however that effort of moorish rower be flagging while sailor be rowing almost a strongly a when started three more mile mile have be gained then from three vessel came confused fire of cannon of size several men be hit boat splintered oar smashed first lieutenant shouted order for boat to open out so that enemy must no longer have compact mass to aim at at last after mile moor evidently came to conclusion that must not escape by rowing at once drew in oar lowered sail formed in line a soon a manoeuvre be completed heavy firing began again will lying in bow looked out ahead seeing sea torn up with ball wondered that of boat must escape unharmed lieutenant shouted to boat to divide into two party one led by to attack vessel on left of line other under second lieutenant to deal with ship on right for middle boat must assuredly be captured if other two be taken row quietly men shouted will want breath if come to fighting keep on at steady pace until within two hundred yard of then make dash order be carried out by party when within given distance men gave cheer bending back to oar sent boat tearing through water pirate craft be crowded with men who raised yell of rage defiance however except one boat be sunk by shot struck full in bow lieutenant farrance party reached vessel first to try to climb on

why have be sent for made way to where captain be standing surrounded by group of officer men captain said in loud clear voice be going to take somewhat unusual step raise one of comrade to quarter deck still more unusual be that honour must fall to ship boy in case however be sure will agree with that boy in question have distinguished not only by activity keenness aloft by fact that have under great difficulty educated in manner education be perfectly fit to be messmate of midshipman of vessel moreover in fight yesterday saved life of lieutenant farrance when have fallen be attacked by two

said seeing that lad be quite unable to speak when have recovered from wound ship tailor will take uniform in hand lieutenant farrance have kindly expressed intention of providing with will with greatest difficulty restrained feeling till reached sick berth then threw into hammock burst into tear presently tom stevens came in to see be glad will said more glad than can possibly express be splendid to think that be really officer be too much altogether tom have hoped that day might come to be mate even captain in merchant ship to think that in le than two month after joining must be on quarter deck be beyond wildest dream well hope sha' get puffed up be sure tom that will be a much friend a ever doubt will must not be if made difference in dimchurch asked to tell how much too be pleased that be not surprised at for felt sure that in le than year must be on quarter deck a must be ridiculous that anyone who must take observation be at same time one of smartest hand aloft must remain in position of ship boy one of elder sailor said that in experience have never known three four case of men being promoted from deck except when old warrant officer be made mate appointed to revenue cutter thank dimchurch very heartily for tom tell that hope will sail many year together although may be in different part of ship now will lie quiet for time for arm be throbbing dreadfully

must not be better will said with smile for have got appetite must eat horse with satisfaction feel immensely indebted to mr forster for if have not brought request before first lieutenant must not have be able to make such progress with book a have done chaplain be first rate fellow by way have mister here call other by surname plain simple even peter who have welcomed in name who be full fledged master mate doe not claim to be addressed a mister though will probably do so before long for wound of lieutenant ayling who be settled will be invalided when get to malta will give step on occasion will solemnly drink health at own expense of course be not ordinary way mate laughed know that fellow will be game to shell out bottle apiece think can do not at least until get three month of new rate of pay so laughed chaffed will felt grateful to for saw that be in small degree due to desire to set at ease will be in starboard watch gilmore mate said when meal be finished that be one ayling have third lieutenant bowden who be now in charge be bad fellow of course be little cocky third lieutenant on first commission generally be be kind hearted like to make popular will wink one eye when take nap under gun be mean virtue boatswain who be in same watch be much more formidable person busies quite unnecessarily one can not however have everything on whole will get on very comfortably be in other watch rodwell forster be with be well meaning lad know that can say anything more for will find out fault soon enough will then went up on deck with others seemed strange to to enter upon what have hitherto regarded a sort of sacred ground stood shyly aside while others fell into duty of looking after men seeing that work be being done presently first lieutenant came on deck will went up to touched hat can not tell sir said how indebted feel to for kindness in speaking for to captain especially in providing with outfit can assure sir that a long a live will remember kindness lad thing weigh little against saving of life can assure that be great satisfaction to to be able to make slight return will watch career with greatest interest for be convinced that will be brilliant one owing to fact that two officer have gone away in first prize that three have be killed disabled in late fight there be shortage of officer on furious three have left in moorish prize when week later moorish vessel be captured without much fighting captain have officer to spare above rank of midshipman mr forster said have selected to go in prize can take one of junior with can not spare either of senior who must like to take must rather have gilmore sir feel can trust thoroughly think have made good choice can not spare more than thirty men will go straight to malta hand over prize to agent there wait till return come back again if there must be mean of doing so will be delighted when heard that be to go with forster will pick crew asked friend must arrange without difficulty for anyone specially wished must like very much to have friend tom stevens sailor named dimchurch be good hand in way be very friendly with before got promoted all right there will difficulty about will want boy to act a servant one able seaman be a good a have noticed dimchurch be fine active hand will appoint boatswain great be pride of will a prize crew rowed from furious to moorish galley of be to be second in command must not help bursting out laughing a went down with forster into cabin what be laughing at forster asked be having bit of laugh at thought of change have come over position not that be conceited about seems so strange must be here second in command doubt doe laughed forster will soon get accustomed to be almost a strange for for be first time have be in command have brought chart on board with course be north north east distance be between two three hundred mile in decent part of world must do in couple of day with baffling wind may take week more well much care how long be will be luxury to be one own master for bit first step be to divide crew into two watch be entitled not to keep watch forster said will certainly waive privilege will take watch tom stevens be appointed cabin servant one of men be made cook nine of others be told off to watch wish have prisoner on board forster said will be constant source of anxiety there be over fifty of a hang dog scoundrel a one must wish to see will have to keep sharp look out on to make sure that get ghost of chance of coming up on deck for if did must not think twice about cutting throat see how must possibly get out will said generally doe look like manage sometimes for that fellow know that when get to malta will be set to work in yard if there be opportunity however small for to break out may be sure that must take moorish pirate be about a ruffianly scoundrel a be to be found if put prisoner to death only spare for what will fetch a slave after three day sailing have made little way for be only in morning evening that there be breeze will have just turned in for middle watch have scarcely dropped to sleep when be suddenly awakened by loud noise sprang out of bed seized dirk brace of pistol be part of equipment given by first lieutenant a ran up companion heard coil of rope thrown against door so leapt down again ran with speed to men quarter too be on foot hatch have be battened down above be bad job sir dimchurch said how have got out have idea looked at fastening of two hatch when came down twenty minute ago looked to right be afraid will cut comrade throat fear so dimchurch what do think have better do know sir will require good deal of thinking out suppose will meddle with at present of course will sooner later well dimchurch a first step will bring mess table other portable thing forward here make barricade with will also obtain two three barrel of water stock of food so when time come may at rate be able to make stout resistance be good idea sir will set to work at once in short time with aid of tub of provision barrel of water bale of good barricade be built across bow of vessel forming triangular enclosure of about fourteen foot on side arm be then collected placed inside when be done there be general feeling of satisfaction that must at least sell life dearly now sir what be next step dimchurch asked have only to give order be ready to carry out have thought of nothing at present will said fancy will be better to allow to make first move for even with advantage of attacking in dark must hardly hope to overcome four time number must be tough job certainly sir if worst come to worst might try must come to quite worst dimchurch before take step a that a evening approached moor be heard descending companion there be buzz of talk then came rushing forward when reached door between fore aft portion of ship will men opened fire upon a poured out be shot down seven eight fell then others dashed forward seaman lined barricade made strenuous resistance cutlas clashed against moorish yatagan moor be too crowded together to use gun a must gather more closely in front than sailor stood be unable to break through barricade at last after many have fallen rest retired three four of sailor have received more le severe wound none be absolutely disabled tom stevens have fought pluckily among rest will be ready with shout of encouragement cutlas have taken for use instead of dirk wherever pressure be most severe when moor have retired dimchurch two others went outside barricade piled heavy bale against door after first carrying out dead moor will hardly attack way again sir said to will will be turn next time yes six of number be killed probably several badly wounded so ought to have good chance of success if make dash at in dark waited until night have fallen then will said do think can lift hatchway dimchurch will have pretty hard try anyhow man said will roll tub under will give chance of using strength although be able to move slightly utmost effort failed to lift more than inch two have piled too many rope on for sir think that if others will get on tub join will be able to move thing wait minute dimchurch let man make sure that musket be loaded there be short pause during firelock be carefully examined when saw that be in good order will said now lad heave away slowly hatchway yielded with great effort be pushed up far enough for man to crawl out piece of wood be shoved in at corner so a to hold hatch open men who have lifted stood clear clamber out dimchurch have look round be there many of on deck only about dozen a far a can make out sir be jabbering away among disputing must say a to best way to get at expect intend to leave alone take into algiers however that doe not matter two crawl out lie down then give hand hoist out think others can reach except tom have better hoist up after man a clambered out lay down on deck when be up crawled along aft to within few yard of moor then leapt to foot fired volley five of moor fell while others panic stricken ran below now pile cable over hatchway will shouted sailor rushed to carry out order be startled a did so by shout from above hillo below there have got possession of ship yes be that forster yes thank god for will shouted back while men gave cheer why come down be going to slide down mast what for why come down by rattling have cut shroud when last man fell made dash for directly got to top cut dozen men who be climbing after fell sprawling to deck then cut on other side thought then that must at once shoot there be lively argument among shout of laughter evidently thought that must be great joke to leave up here until chose to slide down be killed of course heard attack on trembled for result when noise suddenly ceased guessed that have repulsed well here go minute later slid down to deck how do matter stand asked when stood among killed six wounded eight ten in first attack upon have shot five more now rest be battened down below there have better remain for present well gilmore congratulate on having recaptured ship have be bad affair for have lost nine men killed a far a be concerned have done splendidly be afraid will get pretty bad wigging for allowing to get out though certainly bolt of hatchway be all right when changed watch of course see now ought to have placed man there a sentry be always so mighty easy to be wise after event expect rascal pretty nearly cut wood away round bolt after watch be changed set to work completed job will not however be able to investigate that until get to malta have blocked up door between fore after part of ship said will think must be a well to place sentry at hatch now a might turn table upon again certainly be badly wounded dimchurch have got slash across cheek sir nothing to speak of well will take post at after hatch for present stevens may a well go down guard door will be able to tell at least if be up to mischief must think however fight be pretty well taken out of that will resign to fate now be bad job for forster said a will sat down together on gun be awfully sorry forster be afraid there be getting out of be out of question there be one thing forster if did not put sentry over hatchway did so be just a much to blame for disaster a be if have have man there must hardly have cut away woodwork without hearing certainly wish to state in report that took watch over from just a left that sentry have be placed there a ought certainly to have be done when came on watch at eight o'clock be very kind of gilmore to wish to take blame upon own shoulder responsibility be wholly mine ought to have reminded to put man there there can be question at about never gave matter thought blunder have cost nine good seaman will be lucky if only escape with tremendous wigging must bear a well a can while be talking sailor be busy splicing shroud when be done two of men swarmed up mast by mean of halliard then hoisted up shroud fastened round mast making taut by mean of lanyard sail be still standing flapping loosely in light breeze so sheet be hauled in vessel again began to move through water two day later anchored in valetta harbour here go forster said a stepped into boat with report depends now on what sort of man admiral be must not be surprised if ordered to take court martial oh hope not will exclaimed do wish must let go with to share blame can not be thought of forster said commanding officer must make report two hour later forster returned be all right gilmore said a boat came alongside of course got wigging admiral read report then looked at a fierce a tiger 'how be that sentry be placed over prisoner ' have to admit sir ' said 'that entirely overlooked that be quite conscious that conduct be indefensible have certainly paid very heavily for ' 'it be smart trick taking to shroud ' admiral said 'though one must have thought must have shot at once after have cut ' 'that be what expected sir ' said 'but seemed to think be very good joke being prisoner up there preferred to wait till be driven down by thirst suppose men sold life dearly asked 'yes sir ' replied 'taken by surprise a be certainly accounted for more than one man doubtless did same mr forster ' 'yes sir cut down two of did not cease fighting until saw that be lost suppose thought that duty to majesty be to take care of yourself ' said slyly ' be afraid sir ' said that moment thought more of duty towards than of duty to ' smiled grimly have doubt be so mr forster well committed blunder hope will be lesson to in future 'it will indeed sir ' said then started to question about 'your junior officer seems to have behaved very well ' said 'extremely well sir ' said only wish have done a well ' 'his plan of forming barricade across bow so that little force be ample to defend be excellent ' said 'also blocking up of door of communication through bulkhead be well thought of final escape through hatchway sudden attack upon enemy be well carried out will make note of name suppose be not a old a a be junior sir be not yet sixteen be only promoted from being ship boy to quarter deck three week ago 'promoted from being ship boy ' admiral said in surprise then have to give detailed account not only of fight led to promotion also of life so far a knew when have finished admiral said must be singular lad gilmore be likely to prove honour to navy bring up here at hour to morrow will be glad to see there now may go forget in future that when be in charge of prisoner must always place guard over ' so unknowingly have done good turn gilmore for expect that if admiral have not be so interested in must not have let off so easily must put on best uniform for first time go up to morrow well be afraid must have felt very shaky if have not heard account of admiral from what say be evident be kindly man after have told about ca have many question to ask well feel good deal easier in mind a may guess forster said when went ashore felt like bad boy who be in for flogging dare say will get little hotter from captain will be just wigging there will be talk of court martial by what saw of good on board craft before rumpus took place fancy moor have captured plundered well laden merchantman in case prize money will be worth good round sum a admiral get picking out of will be still more inclined to look favourably on matter here come boat to take off prisoner have doubt of will be hanged especially a will not be able to give satisfactory explanation a to fate of merchantman a soon a have got rid of will overhaul few of bale see what be content when last of prisoner be taken ashore forster gilmore went below examined cargo proved to consist of valuable eastern stuff broad cloth silk turkish carpet must not be better forster said must be worth lot of money will add to nice little handful of prize money will get when return home ought to give good round sum for proserpine then there be three moorish vessel though think be worth much for hold be nearly empty fancy have only be cruising short time fellow however be rich prize certainly have very hard luck falling in with a did fancy ship pillaged be frenchman italian more likely latter think there be many french merchantman about be most likely that cargo be intended for genoa whence good part of might be sent to paris well make little difference to what destination be proceeds be certainly destined to enrich instead of original consignee next morning will put on best uniform for first time landing with forster ascended nix mangare stair called on admiral well mr gilmore admiral said a be shown in give great pleasure to meet so promising young officer will kindly tell such detail of early history a may seem fitting to will gave fairly detailed account of history up to time joined navy well sir can not be too grateful to young lady at same time there be few who must have availed so well of assistance be nothing short of astonishing that must have progressed so far under care that be able after few lesson from chaplain of ship to use quadrant a mark of approbation will present with one will send off to ship to morrow morning with many thanks will took leave returned with forster to prize on following morning quadrant arrived that afternoon prize be handed over to prize agent crew transferred to naval barrack forster gilmore receiving lodging money to live on shore hitherto only fortification will have seen be of portsmouth so be greatly interested in castle with heavy frowning stone battery deep cut separating from rest of island towering rock then there be church of st john paved with tombstone of knight other place of interest costume appearance of inhabitant amused pleased a did shop with lace cameo lovely coral ornament beyond wall there be garden full of orange tree bright with fruit burying place of old monk body standing in niche dressed in gown cowl a in life will wished that must get share of prize money at once promised that very first expenditure must be suite of coral for lady who have done so much for in way thought must lay out money with such gratification to fortnight later furious came into harbour bringing prize with have be taken without trouble one morning when day broke be seen only quarter of mile from frigate gun be at once fired across bow seeing that escape be impossible hauled down colour without resistance forster gilmore with officer who have brought in other prize went on board at once made report a forster have predicted be severely reprimanded for not having placed sentry over prisoner in consideration of fact that have already be spoken to by admiral captain be le severe on than must otherwise have be gilmore on other hand be warmly commended managed extremely well captain said showed that fully deserved promotion chapter v pirate hold furious be at once placed in hand of dockyard people who set to work immediately to repair damage while large quantity of provision be brought off from store on shore be not generally a sharp a forster said must say there must be something in wind such be general opinion on board ship for double gang of worker be put on in three day be reported to be again ready for sea captain came on board hour later spoke to first lieutenant order be at once issued to get up anchor set sail head be pointed west a left harbour general opinion be that be bound for gibraltar leaked out however in afternoon that be sailing under sealed order a must hardly be case if be bound for gibraltar there be innumerable discussion among sailor a to destination must be meant to cruise along west coast of france to return to england join fleet being got ready there for important operation what do say bill one of men asked old sailor who have sat quietly taking part in discussion well if asks said must say be bound for west indie west indie bill what make think well think that because seems to a be where be most wanted french have got stronger fleet than have out there well have got a strong fleet at toulon quite a strong one at brest yes may be so think be pretty safe to lick at of place if will come out fight fair whereas in west indie be good bit stronger there be so many port island that a be so to speak good deal scattered might at moment come upon in double strength have ever be there before bill ay two three time in respect must not be better can buy fruit 'bacca rum for next to nothing when officer give chance lor ' game nigger be up to to circumvent must make laugh when land old black woman will come up with basket full of cocoa nut officer step up to examines look a right a can be perhaps break one be full of milk very good so go up to buy officer look on woman hand two three when give last one wink eye say anything drop sixpence into hand among copper have to pay for others when have quite sold out officer order into boat to lie off till come back when return be quite astonished to find most of crew be three sheet in wind then will bring sugar cane half a thick a wrist looking a innocent a may be end be sealed up with bit of pith when open one end find that joint have be bored through cane be full of rum mind lad be fool if touch be new strong rank bottle of must knock silly be not worst of for fever catch hold of fever out there ai joke eats good dinner at twelve o'clock be buried in palisade at six called yellow jack be country where can enjoy yourselves reasonable with fruit perhaps small sup of rum where must beware of drinking if do that be right island be beautiful downright beautiful there ai many place trouble to look at west indie be like garden with feathery sort of tree mountain everything that can want in nature be very hot be bill ai so to speak cool in summer time in winter be just right in summer must like to lie naked day have cold water poured over still one get accustomed to in time then see there be always excitement of kind there be pirate frenchman there be spaniard whom regard a cross between other two hide about among island pop out when least expect always have to keep eye in head cutlas handy when go ashore worst of be what call mulatto be whity brown sort of chap one thing other nice cut throat lot be sailor who drink too much loses boat be a like a not to be murdered by of before morning hate chap like poison there be score of small craft manned by prey upon negro who be honest merry lot not bad sailor in way sometimes four five of pirate craft will go together many of be good size carry lot of gun make island head quarter nigger there may be on turn into slave there be thousand of island so at least must say scattered about of mere sand spot others goodish size well hope be west indie there be plenty of amusement plenty of fighting to be done there must like to know what sailor can want more there be hum of approval picture be certainly tempting after six day run with favourable wind passed through strait without touching at gibraltar held west for twenty four hour then sealed order be opened be soon known throughout ship that be indeed west indie for be bound ship course be at once changed teneriffe be passed stopped for day to take in fresh water vegetable at st vincent then head be turned more westward three week later furious anchored at port royal captain went on shore at once to visit admiral returned with news that furious be to cruise off coast of cuba exact position of french fleet be unknown when last heard of be in neighbourhood of island must keep sharp look out for captain said bring back news of whereabouts if do catch sight of be of course if catch tartar for not only do french ship carry heavier gun than do sail faster be a speedy however a of class will hope be able to show clean pair of heel in addition to be told that three piratical craft have rendezvous on island off south coast of cuba have be committing great depredation number of merchantman have be missed so be to keep sharp look out for to clip wing if can what size be asked first lieutenant one be said to be cutter carrying eight gun long tom other two be schooner carrying six gun on broadside be not known whether have long tom probability be that have must be rather formidable opponent then if caught together a carry a many gun a do long tom be vastly more powerful than anything have think be pity that furnish ship on station with long twenty four must be worth nearly broadside be so mr farrance somehow people at home can not get out of regular groove fill up ship with eight ten pounder while a say one long twenty four must be worth dozen of if do catch one of pirate will confiscate long gun to own use must be capital plan sir well be glad will have something to look for besides french fleet may be hundred mile away ay thousand captain added will have be standing not far from captain heard conversation heart beat high at thought of possibility of fight with murderous pirate for three week cruised off coast of cuba saw sign of french fleet from time to time heard from native craft of pirate native differed somewhat widely a to head quarter of pest agreed that be on island lying in middle of dangerous shoal one day saw smoke rising fifteen mile away at once shaped course for when approached found that rose from vessel enveloped in flame be european ship captain said a neared send officer in boat to row round gather particular a to fate see boat near be afraid that be work of pirate watched boat with intent interest a rowed round ship have doubt that be work of pirate officer said on return bulwark be burnt away must make out several pile on deck looked like dead men send man up to mast head farrance tell to scan horizon carefully for sail must say ship ca have be burning above three hour at most sooner have man reached top of mast than called down sail ho where away mr farrance shouted on port bow sir what do make out to be must say be schooner by topsail ship course be at once changed rag of sail put upon first lieutenant climbed to upper crosstrees after long look through telescope returned to deck must say be certainly one of schooner that be in search of sir doubt whether with light wind have much chance of overhauling will try anyhow captain said be probably steering for rendezvous so by following may at least get important information day chase continued there be apparent change in position of two vessel furious be kept on same course through night to satisfaction of on board found when morning broke that have certainly gained on schooner a mainsail be now visible at twelve o'clock low bank of sand be sighted ahead schooner have entered channel in two hour later furious have to be hove to outside shoal sand extended long distance there be several break in from masthead net work of channel must be made out be great disappointment to crew of furious to have to give up chase see schooner only four mile off on way under easy sail be awkward place mr farrance captain said will need deal of examination before go farther first thing to do will be to sail round note sound various channel wish must go aloft with glass see whether there be ground higher than rest place must naturally be point of rendezvous lieutenant farrance went aloft presently returned there be clump of green tree said ten mile off schooner be nearing think though of be not certain that can make out mast of craft lying there well be something to have located captain said now must find how can best get there will be work of time may a well begin by examining of channel four boat be at once lowered rowed to mouth of nearest sounding operation quickly showed that in three of there be two foot of water other be somewhat deeper there be still two foot le water than furious drew deep part be very narrow winding may be one that schooner have gone up captain said have doubt draw three four foot le than do knowing passage perfectly must get up easily hope however will find something deeper presently next three day be spent in circumnavigating sand bank in sounding various channel at last captain be obliged to admit that none of be deep enough for furious although there be fully dozen by vessel of lighter draught might enter be ready to run fair risk mr farrance said dare send boat expedition against force a especially a have doubt thrown up battery to strengthen position must have number of cannon have taken from ship have captured must certainly be desperate enterprise first lieutenant agreed a say too dangerous to be attempted now gilmore forster said a midshipman met at dinner be always full of idea ca suggest way by might get at be afraid not will laughed only possible way can see must be to sail away get together number of native craft then make dash at place what must be advantage of native craft over boat one of others said scoffingly great advantage must be that if have dozen native craft men must be scattered about deck instead of being crowded in boat must therefore be able to land with comparatively little loss upon word one of senior said think there be something in gilmore idea of course must have to be very willow one must have to choose night when there be just enough breeze to take quietly along at rate will run risk of being snubbed will mention to one of lieutenant word more think of more feasible doe seem after dinner be over midshipman went up to mr peter who be now third lieutenant saluted what be lieutenant asked well sir be idea of gilmore may not be worth anything at certainly seemed to that there be something in idea be generally worth something what be midshipman explained will plan there be certainly something in peter said what beggar that boy be for idea at rate will mention to mr farrance mr farrance at first pooh poohed idea on thinking over concluded that must be a well at rate to lay before captain word doe seem feasible captain said must tow boat in after so that when came under pirate fire men must get into boat so be in shelter only one hand must be required to steer vessel rest must remain out of sight of enemy until near enough to make dash either for shore pirate craft a case might be be good idea really brilliant idea well worth putting into effect besides of vessel must carry one two small gun so keep down enemy fire to extent send for gilmore in few minute will entered captain cabin cap in hand mr farrance tell mr gilmore that have idea by collecting number of native craft of willow draught might attack pirate with hope of success be only idea sir occurred to on spur of moment well be inclined to regard a feasible one captain said dozen boat of kind must carry greater part of ship crew if have couple of light cannon on board must be able to answer enemy fire if do attack in manner propose to send boat in towing behind native craft so that when enemy fire becomes really heavy men can take place in so be in shelter until close enough to make dash be there other suggestion can offer sir plan of taking boat certainly seems to to be good one captain smiled little be not accustomed to have plan approved of by midshipman however only said think will work must other suggestion occur to will mention to mr farrance be really obliged to for idea doe great credit to sharpness thank sir said will retired hour later frigate be sailing away from sand bank what did old man say midshipman asked will a rejoined think that there be something in idea of course have greatly improved mean to send boat towing behind native craft so that if fire get very heavy men can take to be towed in perfect shelter until near enough to make rush intends to put gun two in of native boat to keep down enemy fire bit a approach be improvement forster said certainly seems gilmore a if have found way out of dilemma who have be most disposed to laugh at will suggestion be eager to congratulate now that captain have expressed approval of have adopted furious sailed direct for port royal there be fear that pirate must abandon island for must naturally take retirement of furious a admission of defeat be of course open to boat attack must consider strong enough to beat off such attempt without difficulty arriving at port royal lieutenant farrance went ashore in search of suitable craft have difficulty in buying dozen old native boat then procured large quantity of cane lashed in bottom of boat using sufficient quantity to keep afloat even if be riddled with ball then carpenter set to work to make platform in bow of to carry seven pounder gun in three day work be completed furious started again putting two men in of boat taking in tow five day later arrived off sand spit preparation be at once made for attack lying low in water keeping in line behind furious native craft must be altogether invisible from central island so that pirate must not be aware of method of attack greater portion of men be told off to only forty remaining on board furious be ready hour after men took place in native craft fastening boat to stern in case sail be at once got up following other in single file entered channel have be found to be deepest leading boat kept on sounding easy matter a wind being light rate of progress did not exceed mile hour will have be posted by first lieutenant in own boat be leader dimchurch tom stevens be among crew dimchurch have exchanged place with seaman tom have be allowed place by special solicitation of will fought stoutly in fight on moorish prize be very much attached to must be obliged sir if must take right said first lieutenant let stow away in bow till fighting begin accordingly tom curled up by gun be between two three in morning when tree of central island be made out be not more than five hundred yard away presently from projecting point where heavy mass must be made out cannon be fired shot flew overhead effect be instantaneous shout be heard on shore sound of oar in rowlock take to boat lieutenant shouted two line of light in port hole showed position of two vessel men on native craft left to work gun at once opened fire at for minute two there be return be evident that greater portion of crew have be ashore battery have first fired now kept up steady discharge a boat be almost invisible shot flew wildly overhead splashed harmlessly in water gunner on board disregarded maintained steady fire at port of enemy vessel from now came answering flash shot did little damage when attacking party have got within hundred yard of pirate ship lieutenant gave signal boat with cheer dashed forward at full speed have received instruction how to act in case two vessel be found dividing made for respective quarter race be short sharp officer urging men to fullest exertion instant be alongside oar be cast aside men drawing cutlass leapt to foot endeavoured to climb up be thrust back with boarding pike ax weapon of kind at last managed to get foothold aft will in vain endeavoured to get on deck side be too high for finding left with crew made way in boat forward along side of pirate vessel clambered up by bowsprit shroud of men in other boat seeing what be doing followed example be unnoticed fierce fight be raging on quarter deck shouting be prodigious when thirty men be gathered will led way aft arrival be opportune for attacking party under lieutenant have be vastly outnumbered by pirate although fighting stoutly have be penned against bulwark where with difficulty defended illustration will lead party to take enemy in rear with cheer will party rushed aft taking pirate in rear many of be cut down rest fell back confused by unexpected attack now be time lad lieutenant shouted throw yourselves upon drive back although pirate still fought desperately knowing that mercy must be extended steady valour of sailor be too much for at last pirate captain be cut down by dimchurch with fall men entirely lost heart threw down arm many of jumped overboard swam ashore loud cheer burst from sailor a resistance came to end fight be still raging on board other ship lieutenant ordered men of own boat to row to unseen by pirate reached bow climbed on deck then a soon a have gained footing rushed aft here too rear attack decided struggle in five minute be over daylight be now breaking be able to see that there be line of storehouse on island together with large number of hut greater portion of men be ordered to land fugitive from ship be hunted down most of have taken refuge in battery at mouth of harbour a be open on land side be soon stormed defender cut down then hut be searched burnt storehouse opened be found to contain enormous quantity of good spoil evidently of many ship men be at once set to work to transfer to prize when be full to native craft boat have be sent off directly fighting be over with news to captain of success have gained in morning message be sent saying that must take four five day to transfer store to ship furious have in consequence hoisted anchor gone for short cruise away from dangerous proximity of sand on afternoon of third day large cutter be seen approaching lieutenant farrance ordered native craft to be towed behind small islet where be hidden from sight of vessel entering harbour crew to take place on captured vessel when be done gun be loaded men stood to quarter new comer approached without apparently entertaining suspicion that anything unusual have happened hut have be destroyed being hidden by grove of tree a came abreast of gun be run out lieutenant shouted call upon to surrender vessel be prize of majesty frigate furious if surrender will sink at once there be hoarse shout of fury astonishment then captain called back will never surrender schooner at once poured in broadside doing immense damage killing large number of pirate few cannon be fired in answer in such haste that have effect when two more broadside have be fired into cutter blew up with tremendous explosion shook vessel to keel threw many of men down when smoke cleared away cutter have disappeared whether shot have reached magazine whether be blown up by desperate commander be never known a not single survivor of crew be picked up when work of loading be completed storehouse have be destroyed by fire two schooner sailed out followed by native craft with boat towing behind victory have be won at very little cost only three men have be killed seventeen wounded while with exception of thirty prisoner for most part wounded whole pirate force have be annihilated captain have already visited scene having rowed in a soon a have received news of success of expedition in lieutenant farrance despatch several officer be noted for distinguished conduct among be will gilmore to whom lieutenant gave great credit for manner in have boarded pirate by sudden attack upon rear of enemy converted what be distinctly perilous situation into success tell what be gilmore one of midshipman jestingly said if go on like will send to coventry be unbearable that must always get to front great be rejoicing among merchant of port royal when furious returned with two prize became known that third have be destroyed nest of pirate completely broken up on following day will be sent for by admiral lad said wish to tell that although be not usual for captain to acknowledge in official despatch that acted on idea of young midshipman captain marker have done full justice to in verbal report to idea showed great ingenuity although surprise be so complete that even have attack be made by ship boat only must probably have be successful detracts in way from merit of suggestion of course have year to serve yet before can pas can promise that a soon a do so will if be still here have appointment at once a mate with employment in can distinguish thank very much sir will said saluting retired in three day ship prize native craft be unloaded content be found to be of very great value for by mark upon good be evident that at least twenty three merchantman must have be captured pillaged a none of be ever heard of after have sailed be reasonably concluded that must have be burnt on board murdered case be so atrocious that prisoner be tried condemned to death executed in batch there be little doubt that pirate must have have agent in various port who have kept informed of sailing of ship there be mean of ascertaining who party be furious sailed four day after return time cruised on northern coast of cuba one day when sailing along by stretch of high cliff ship of war suddenly appeared from narrow inlet be followed by two others furious be headed round at once with three french frigate in pursuit started on way back wind be light though stitch of canvas be set be evident after hour sailing that one at least of pursuer gained steadily on french ship must indeed have gained more than have done have not yawed occasionally fired with bow chaser furious have shifted two of broadside gun to stern to reply although aim be good only one two hit be made distance being still too great for accurate shooting wish other two frenchman be little slower captain said to first lieutenant be only little farther behind than when started be think only about mile astern of if continues to travel at present rate will be close up to by sunset be just about own size make doubt that must give good account of must not hope to do so before two consort came up must not expect to beat three if must fall in with one of cruiser must fight willingly yes odds be too much against at present sir say that must not fight separately must hardly hope to beat three of at once ca make go through water faster than be doing a far a can see sail seems to be doing best there be nothing for to pray for frigate for more wind be not sure that wind must help still might think sir lieutenant said two hour later that one of wish be going to be fulfilled there be cloud rising very rapidly on larboard bow from colour appearance seems to that be going to have tornado will be welcome indeed captain said have be hit ten time in last half hour nearest ship be not more than three quarter of mile away five minute later captain said be certainly tornado hand reduce sail waste moment lad will be on in three minute in moment vessel be scene of bustle men swarmed up rigging urged to greatest exertion not only by voice of officer by appearance of heaven frigate behind held on three four minute longer then sheet be let fly immediately be scene of wild confusion will be on before be ready captain said grimly if be will turn turtle be a much a will do to be ready just a line of white foam be seen approaching with speed of race horse last man reached deck must give great deal captain said to have time to get down light spar get ready small fore try sail small stay sail to run up on mizzen minute later storm be upon blinding sheet of spray driven with almost force of grape shot swept over ship followed by deafening roar force of wind seemed about to lift ship bodily out of water over over heeled thought that be about to founder when even above noise of storm three loud crash be heard three mast with lofty hamper went over side thank god lieutenant exclaimed have saved hand with ax knife began cutting away wreckage at same time two try sail be hoisted at once blew out of bolt rope think sir first lieutenant shouted that if lash hawser to hamper hang to will act a floating anchor bring head up to wind very well thought of mr farrance captain shouted back by mean do so order be given immediately carried out tangle of rope spar with ship strongest hawser attached soon drifted past a cable tightened vessel head began to come slowly up into wind will delay fate for bit captain said ca hope that will more than delay unless can get up sail crawl off coast get ready strongest try sail have in case may be wanted in few minute sail be got ready for present there be nothing for to hang on to wreckage shore be mile away in spite of floating anchor drift be great crew of furious have now time to breathe be pitch dark nothing must be seen save white head of wave now moment threatened to overwhelm not trace of frigate have so hotly pursued must be seen god rest soul captain said earnestly be afraid be gone in fair fight one strives to do a much damage a possible such catastrophe a be awful trust other two took warning in time hope so too be under lee of island passed shortly before began so must be partially sheltered there be hope for first fate be terrible indeed sir more awful perhaps because know that may become ours before long there be doubt about that captain said unless wind drop chop round fate be sealed few hour will see ship grinding bone on rocky shore be too dark to see know that be most surely approaching a day broke shore be made out little more than mile away captain then called crew together lad shouted in spite of effort voice be heard few yard away everything have be done for ship must be done a see for yourselves effort have be in vain trust that will get ashore a far a can see at present rock be almost precipitous high a be spray fly right over thank for good conduct while ship have be in commission be sure that will know how to die will preserve calm courage till end go to station remain there until be about to strike then man must make best fight for life that can men went quietly off mr farrance stood watching shore with telescope presently exclaimed see sir there be break in cliff know how far go in look to a if might be opening to inlet be nearly opposite to so if shift hawser from bow to stern will swing round will probably drift right into creek if be what be by mean let make attempt captain said thank god there be hope of escape for men sprang to foot with alacrity when heard news hawser be brought up firmly spliced to one in use just beyond bulwark forward then be led along outside shroud fastened to bitt astern then to mizzen mast done first hawser be cut at bulwark forward ship swung round almost instantly a soon a headed dead for shore raffle have so long served for floating anchor be cut adrift try sail be hoisted on stump of foremast with six good men at wheel vessel surged shorewards under force of gale man on board holding breath opening be ship length across driven by wind steered with greatest care furious shot into a quickly a surely a if be propelled with oar great shout of relief burst from whole crew when after proceeding for hundred yard along narrow channel passage suddenly widened out into pool quarter of mile across let go anchor captain cried have scarce spoken when great anchor went thundering down pay out chain gradually be next order check when get half way across order be obeyed vessel head swung round in le than minute be riding quietly over great wave came rolling in through entrance broke in foam against shore of inlet quiet after roar din be almost startling above cloud must be seen flying past in rugged mass breast of pool sheltered a be from wind by lofty side be scarcely rippled wave rolled in a if be made of glass not word be heard until captain spoke be least can do men to thank god for miraculous escape trust that there be not man on board ship who will not offer fervent thanks to who have so wonderfully brought out of jaw of death head be bared for two three minute sound be heard on board ship then captain replaced hat men went quietly off to duty chapter vi narrow escape be hardly anchored before gale showed sign of breaking in few hour sun shone out wind subsided destruction of timber on hillside have be prodigious large space be entirely cleared captain first lieutenant have anxious consultation boat have gone mast rigging be in what be practically hostile country for although spain have not declared war against gave assistance to french left port open to in few week probably must openly throw into scale against be clear that must communicate with port royal somehow captain said certainly be clear how be to do between nearest port there may be mile mile of mountain encumbered by fallen tree must be almost impossible to get through then again have heard that there be always band of fugitive slave in mountain who must be sure to attack a to sea might possibly make shift to build boat there be certainly lack of timber lying round have plenty of sail cloth for sail so must fit out fairly well must be journey of fully thousand mile seems most feasible plan small craft of say forty foot long might be built got ready for sea in course of week must say so certainly sir with amount of labour have at disposal might be built even sooner than that have plenty of handy men on board who must give efficient help to carpenter gang suppose must build rather a ship than a boat yes think so must build of one half inch plank fill seam well with oakum give couple of coat of paint let be of willow draft with plenty of beam must of course be decked over a might meet with tornado crew must consist of officer ten men with vessel there must be difficulty in reaching port royal carpenter be at once told off to carry out work can have a many hand to help a wish captain said to head of gang what will do first will get plank from below sir make raft by mean of can get on shore choose trunk must be most suitable for purpose be sure to find plenty about then will find suitable spot for ship yard at once start on work will set gang of men with ax to square trunk make ready for sawing need not be more than six inch square when finished a have couple of double handed saw can soon rip into plank how long do think will be must say sir with help can get ought to be ready to start in le than week of course rib will take time to prepare when have keel stem stern post in place planking will not take very long be to be decked thompson over sir yes think so may meet with weather like have just come through if be well decked may feel assured that will reach port royal will leave mr farrance to draw out line think said first lieutenant must be like magnified launch with greater beam larger draft of water must perhaps best be gained by giving deep keel of course must be good deal higher out of water than launch say good four foot under deck there must be need to carry much ballast will gain stability by beam understand sir first thing to be done be to form raft ship crew be soon at work be not long before raft be constructed rope be at once taken ashore made fast to tree so that raft must be hauled rapidly backwards forward between ship shore carpenter mate be first to land while chief selected suitable point for yard assistant scattered examining fallen tree cutting branch off seemed most suitable be soon dragged down to yard then strong gang set to work to square carpenter to cut into plank first lieutenant remained with encouraging at work while junior officer midshipman be divided among various gang by six o'clock when furious signalled for hand to come on board have indeed done good day work pile of plank lay ready to be used a required carpenter have made progress with keel be laboriously chopping out from straight trunk of large tree by evening of next day be finished placed in position on third day started to shape stem stern post while head carpenter made from thin plank template of rib set others to chop out rib to fit in two more day be ready for fastening on plank hundred fifty men can get through amazing amount of labour when work well heartily plank be bent by main strength to fit in place a there be abundance of nail other necessary article on board sheathing be finished in two day rest of work be comparatively easy while deck be being laid hull be caulked painted two mast sail rigging prepared boat have bulwark being considered that must be much better sea boat without a in case of shipping sea water must run off at once hatchway fore aft be made very small with close fitting hatch covered with tarpaulin captain be delighted when be finished be really fine boat said with forty foot of length fifteen of beam have taken longer to build than have expected have not reckoned sufficiently on difficulty everything however have now be done to make seaworthy so of who remain here may feel sure that will reach port royal safely in case of gale sail must be lowered lashed to deck hand must go below fasten hatchway securely have ballast except store think will be perfectly safe there be very little chance of capsizing with such beam depth of keel said first lieutenant must not possibly capsize in case of tornado mast might very well be taken out of used a floating anchor to keep head to now whom do intend to send in sir will send two officer captain said peter midshipman to take place in case must be disabled think be robson turn for special service next morning boat started soon after daybreak ship crew all watching till two white lug sail disappeared through opening now will take strong party of wood cutter captain said see if can make way to top of hill get idea of country round expect will see much of interest be just a well that must be kept employed by way before do will get hawser to shore work frigate round so a to bring broadside to bear upon opening ought to have done at first french may know of place if may learn of from spaniard two ship astern of probably got snug before tornado struck weathered right though doubt very much if did so unless knew of inlet must run for if did escape be likely that will be taking trouble to find out what became of may have seen companion fate must hardly have made out in darkness still must certainly want to report loss may sail along close inshore to look for timber other sign of wreck think therefore that will be advisable to station well armed boat at end of cut tell to row half hour so to other end see if can make out sailing rowing craft coming along shore if do see must retire to end of opening unless can find place where must hide till boat came abreast of then pounce out capture must certainly be good precaution sir will see to at once be forgetting that have boat bless did forget that altogether well here be little dug out carpenter made for sending message to from ship will carry three must be glad if must take couple of hand row down to mouth of entrance see if there be place where without great difficulty small party with gun must be stationed so a not to be noticed by boat coming up understand sir lieutenant started at once when returned hour later reported that there be ledge twenty foot long twelve deep be about eight foot from water edge twelve above sir said be not noticeable until one be almost directly opposite if be to pile up rock regularly four foot high along face gun crew must be completely hidden get one of hand on board mr farrance will myself go see with one of men at once climbed on deck captain took place in little dug out when reached ledge made careful inspection of yes said ten men must certainly lie hidden here with rough parapet constructed to look a natural a possible must certainly be unobserved by incoming boat especially a attention of in stern must be directed into inlet will order mr forster one of other midshipman to go with a many men a raft will carry build such parapet have better take one of rope ladder with fix to ledge by mean of grapnel there be plenty of building material among rock have fallen from precipice above must leave to ingenuity to make a natural a possible when returned to ship first lieutenant called forster gave captain order can take young gilmore with said object will be to make a natural a possible so a to look in fact a if rock have fallen out behind have lodged on ledge height be not very important for if boat be coming along men must of course lie down till be abreast of cannon must be withdrawn only run out at last moment very well sir will do best raft be again brought into requisition be found that must carry twelve men dimchurch nine others be chosen using oar a paddle slowly made way down to spot will be difficult job to make anything like natural wall there forster said yes will agreed see how be to be managed at of course must pile up line of stone must not look in least natural if must get up three four big chunk might do if filled in with small stone must be impossible to raise great block to shelf ladder be fixed climbed up to ledge when reached found that be very rough uneven consequently that task be more difficult than have seemed from below only way see forster said must be to blast out trench six foot wide one foot deep in men must lie question be whether captain will not be afraid that blasting might draw attention to presence here be just starting for top of hill when came away will said may be able to see whether there be habitation in neighbourhood couple of men in dug out must be able to bring news of craft in sight certainly see other way when forster made report captain said believe will be best plan at top of hill must see nothing forest for most part levelled must make out sign of smoke anywhere operation of blasting can be done with comparatively small charge occurring a doe at foot of gorge like that sound must hardly spread much over surrounding country must of course take care that there be ship in sight when fired charge well can begin to morrow believe there be blasting tool in store take gunner with work come within province on following morning raft went off again at midday number of sharp explosion told that work be begun in evening series of shot be fired party returned with news that ground have be broken up to depth of two foot of ample size to give men cover next morning rock be cleared out seven pounder carriage with tackle for hoisting up be sent over in afternoon captain went in dug out inspected work expressed a thoroughly satisfied with garrison consisting of officer ten men be then placed in fort remained there day returned to ship a darkness fell a be thought pretty certain that one must try to explore inlet during night next morning party be told off to garrison duty so on man being given two consecutive day in fort on fourth day dug out returned in haste to ship from post at mouth of gap reported that two men of war be to be seen in distance cruising close inshore mr farrance landed with difficulty made way up hill to point near mouth of opening commanded view over sea from point must easily see hull of ship with telescope have doubt that be former antagonist of furious after watching for time made out four little black speck very close to shore examined closely then hurried down to cove be searching coast with boat reported a feared must news have be given to little party at battery a dug out came in be at once on alert carpenter who after departure of first boat have be employed in building large gig to pull twelve oar be at once recalled to ship magazine be opened gun loaded gun from larboard main deck have be brought up to upper deck port hole made for boom of tree have be built from bow stern of ship to shore so a to prevent craft from getting inside thus prepared captain considered that be fully match for two ship of own size knew nevertheless that even if beat off might be exposed to attack from still larger force unless assistance arrived from jamaica did not think only of ship dug out have brought mr farrance back with report be at once sent off with order to party at battery that must if possible sink boat boat entered that if ship of war came in must not try to work gun after first shot a if did so must simply be swept away by enemy fire that one shot be to be aimed at enemy rudder then be to lie down if have not disabled ship be to keep up heavy musketry fire aimed solely against steersman be hardly likely that must be attacked by boat a enemy must be fully engaged with furious even if must frenchman must have mean of climbing eight foot of precipitous rock dug out went to from entrance bringing back news of progress made by enemy boat about three hour from time when have first be made out by mr farrance little boat reported that be only two three hundred yard from entrance on board ship listened anxiously for slight bend in narrow passage prevented from seeing battery presently boom of cannon be heard followed by cheer told that little garrison have be successful then for two three minute there be rattle of musketry when stopped dug out at once went out to fort returned with news that two boat have come up abreast one of have be sunk by cannon at fort that crew have be picked up by other boat have rowed hastily back suffering good deal from musketry fire under operation be carried on be act one captain said now will have to look for act two will go up with mr farrance to place whence saw may be sure that there will be great deal of signalling consultation before make further step accordingly landed went up to look out two vessel be lying close to other with sail aback more fortunate of two boat have attempted to explore passage have just returned to with load of wounded survivor of late companion boat be passing to fro between two ship be awkward question for to decide captain said of course know well enough that ship must be in here gun show that can not tell that be capable of making defence beyond single gun battery on ledge be hour before there be change in position at end of time sail be filled two vessel headed for mouth of inlet have evidently concluded that english ship be lying there disabled two officer hurried back to furious gave order to prepare for attack men at once stood to post presently gun of fort boomed out again by cheering followed sound be evident that shot have taken effect smashed rudder of one of french ship several gun be fired in reply minute later bowsprit of leading ship came into view men waited until must see whole vessel then crashing broadside from gun on board furious be poured into bow effect be tremendous hole ten twelve foot wide be torn in bow ship be swept from end to end by ball splinter shriek groan arose from told that execution be heavy be evident that battle be already half won a far a be concerned there be not room enough in little inlet for to manoeuvre in light wind so a to bring broadside to bear on furious crashing broadside from latter vessel completed discomfiture other vessel now came up by side have be disabled by fort helm must not act captain at once lowered boat tried to get head round be smashed up by fire of furious two vessel lay together side by side helpless to reply in efficient way to incessant fire kept up upon frenchman did be possible for brave men to do in circumstance position be hopeless after suffering terribly for ten minute one after other hauled down flag tremendous burst of cheering broke from furious have lost two men killed four five wounded by bullet of french topmen have also be struck twice by ball from bow chaser of second ship be extent of damage while loss of life on board french frigate have be frightful sixty men have be killed eighty wounded on first ship while thirty be killed still more wounded in boat of second vessel captain harker went on board capture to receive sword of commander have done best gentleman said one in circumstance must have done more have there be ten of instead of two result must have be same if boat have got in seen situation must have understood that position be impossible one there be room in here for manoeuvring even have one of not be damaged by shot from little battery of ours position must have be practically unchanged must not possibly have brought broadside to bear upon french captain who be much mortified by disaster bowed silently be fortune of war sir one of said certainly must not have anticipated that must be so wonderfully placed for defence agree with that case be hopeless from first compliment upon disposition be certainly admirable officer will be perfectly at liberty captain said crew must be placed in partial confinement third of can always be on deck surgeon have come on board with will at once assist yours in attending to wounded considerable portion of crew of furious be at once put on board french frigate eclaire set to work to dismantle mast spar rigging be transferred to furious erected in place of own shattered stump be thrown overboard thus after four day of hardest work for furious be again placed in fighting trim preparation be immediately made for sailing furious led way towing behind dismantled hull in whole of prisoner be carried prize crew of sixty be placed on board actif when be about half way to jamaica squadron of three vessel be sighted preparation be made to throw off eclaire if ship proved to be hostile before long be evident that be english approached rapidly when rounded to near furious crew manned yard greeted with tremendous cheer officer in command be at once rowed to furious a boat neared ship friend recognized mr peter robson sitting in stern what miracle be captain harker officer cried a came on deck lieutenant brought news that be dismasted lying helpless in little inlet here be with what can see be french equipment couple of prize can almost accuse of having brought here on fool errand must have appearance to fact of case be simple told story of fight battle be practically over when first shot be fired said two french ship lost upwards of seventy killed over hundred wounded while have only four men killed two wounded if place have be designed by nature specially for defence must not have be better adapted for see captain ingham said made most of advantage plan of laying broadside to entrance getting cannon on one side building boom to prevent vessel from getting behind be most excellent well be splendid victory more so a have be won with so little loss french certainly showed little discretion in thus running into trap have prepared for of course must not tell what to expect at least might have cost ought to have sent strong boat division in to reconnoitre english captain must have risked vessel in such way with very little delay voyage to jamaica be continued two of relief party went straight on other remained with furious in case must fall in with french fleet when little squadron entered port royal received enthusiastic welcome from ship on station prize be bought into service handed over to dockyard for thorough refit name be changed eclaire being rechristened sylph actif becoming hawke lieutenant farrance be promoted to rank of captain given command of latter vessel of survivor of ship have fortnight before be lost on dangerous reef be told off to be according to rule permitted to take boat crew midshipman with from old ship selected will gilmore among men dimchurch tom stevens planter of jamaica be celebrated for hospitality officer received many invitation be quite at liberty to accept of like captain farrance said to will till vessel get out of hand of dockyard men there be nothing whatever for to do may tell that there be good deal of unrest in island among slave doings of french revolutionist excitement have caused by becoming patron of mulatto have a might be expected spread here be greatly feared that trouble may come of of course planter generally pooh pooh idea be not to be despised few of have already left plantation come down here say that must not accept invitation if like if outbreak take place suddenly fancy very few of planter will get down safely mean of course if there be general rising hope will not be case negro be good deal like other people where be well treated be quite content to go on a be where be badly treated be apt to try better still be not always case there be doubt that altogether french planter of san domingo be much gentler in treatment of slave than people be here large number of be of good old french family look on slave rather a child to be ruled by kindness than a beast of burden a there be doubt not many hope certainly of english planter do with san domingo in throe of slave revolution therefore will not be surprising if movement communicates to slave here know that admiral think prudent to keep extra ship of war on station so a to be prepared for emergency very well sir then will not accept invitation for overnight say that mr gilmore in nine case out of ten must say must be done without danger for if rebellion break out will not at first be general will begin at of most hardly managed plantation there will be plenty of time to return to town before spread a will have desire to mix up in slave insurrection declined invitation to go out to house beyond distance whence must drive back in evening at house visited be struck by apparently good relation between master slave planter be almost aggrieved when insisted on leaving in evening have excuse that be sort of aide de camp to captain farrance be bound to be there first thing in morning to receive order that might have to give generally hired gig drove over early so a to have long day there always took dimchurch tom with enjoyed very much be not sorry when repair on hawke be completed a admiral be anxious for to be away men be drafted from other ship others be recruited from crew of merchantman in port by dimchurch who spoke very highly of life on board man of war of good quality of hawke commander complement be completed by draft of fresh hand from england brought out to make good loss of various ship on station within three week therefore of leaving dockyard hawke sailed to join expedition under sir john laforey general cuyler to capture island of tobago where on th april troop be landed french governor be summoned to surrender refused so work be attacked carried after spirited resistance attempt to capture st pierre in island of martinique be not equally successfully french defended place so desperately that troop be re embarked with considerable loss chapter vii independent command will be hit by musket ball in last engagement took place be sent back with batch of wounded to port royal three of finger of left hand have be carried away bore loss with equanimity a must not compel to leave service tom who went with a servant fretted good deal more over than be often loud in lamentation must not have made difference if have be said be awfully hard on what ridiculous nonsense tom will said quite angrily after one of outburst if have be must have be really serious for though officer can get on very well without of finger sailor must be useless must be turned adrift with trifling pension will do very well have be mentioned in despatch be certain to get step a soon a have served long enough to pas so after time will not miss at tom be silenced though not convinced wound healed rapidly thanks to will abstemious habit in six week after entering hospital be discharged a fit for duty hawke be not in harbour so went to hotel on following day received order to call upon admiral when did so that officer received very kindly be sorry said to learn that have lost finger mr gilmore hope will not interfere much with efficiency sir think not admiral said have received surgeon report morning in stated that wound have from first gone on most favourably that have really kept in hospital fortnight longer than be absolutely necessary lest in anxiety to rejoin might do harm three day since cutter of about hundred ton be sent in by sylph be pirate like vessel of class very fast must most likely have outsailed sylph have not caught up creek have purchased for government service propose to place in command will gave start of surprise at age must not have expected for moment to be given independent command have noted behaviour here have looked through record of service since joined be convinced that will do credit to post will give midshipman junior to from thetis will have forty hand before mast hawke be expected in in few day so can pick five men from rest will make up from other ship cutter will be furnished with four twelve pounder long sixteen a bow gun have when be captured duty will be to police coast to overhaul a many craft a may find committing depredation of course avoiding combat with adversary too strong for thank most heartily sir for selecting for service will do best to merit kindness be right mr gilmore have acted a believe for good of service to extent a incentive to other young officer to use wit will went out with head in whirl must hardly have hoped within year of term of service a midshipman to obtain separate command must have shouted with joy at altogether unexpected promotion first thing did be to take boat row off in to new command be handsome boat evidently designed to be fast weatherly beggar know how to build boat much better than how to fight said when have examined assuredly in anything like light wind must run away from sylph admiral be right when said that be only by chance that be caught hope fellow who be going with be good sort must be awkward if did not pull well together at rate a admiral seems to have picked out for service must be worth salt of course will have dimchurch a boatswain will take one watch youngster other will be hard if catch something having rowed round cutter two three time returned to shore a little vessel have be taken by surprise have not be able to offer resistance to craft so much more powerful than be uninjured be in fit state to be immediately recommissioned be called l'agile name will thought very suitable for forty men will be none too strong for said for will have to work two gun on side that long one in bow went to bed that night dreamt of fierce fight many capture laughed at when awoke still said will always be able to tackle craft of own size carrying anything like number of men three day later hawke came in will at once rowed off to have chat with friend when mentioned new command news be at first received with absolute incredulity when at last messmate came to understand that be not joking be heartily congratulated on good fortune afterwards be not little chaffed on tremendous deed craft be going to perform when at last became serious latham master mate remarked what be new command like be cutter of about hundred ton carrying four twelve pounder sixteen pounder long pivot gun at bow be to have forty men young midshipman from thetis very tidy little craft must say gilmore will probably get good deal more fun out of than from frigate line of battle ship will want good boatswain to take charge of one of watch will have one for be to take five men out of hawke may be sure will take dimchurch a boatswain must not have better man latham said be certainly one of smartest fellow on board ship be very popular with men be full of life go always first to set example when there be work to be done suppose will also lose service of boy tom think so will laughed must be quite lost without so faithful hand indeed though still rank a boy be big powerful fellow match for many ab at hauling rope pulling oar be right be a big round chest a many of men though perhaps not so active quite a powerful when will hoist pendant have to get crew together yet be to have small draft from several of ship may be few day before can be collected next morning thetis arrived young midshipman came on shore hour later to report to will looked surprised for moment at age of new commander gravely reported for service will be pleased with appearance be merry faced boy with look on face indicated pluck determination be surprised at age doubt harman will said can not be more than year older than have be fortunate enough to be twice mentioned in despatch indeed have have wonderful luck feel sure that will get on well together hope do well be to act a police on coast of cuba swarm with pirate will be hard if fall in with of will of course keep one watch boatswain who be thoroughly good man will take other need hardly say that will have nonsense about commanding officer except when on duty hope will be good chum mean of course that when enemy be in sight weather be dirty must be in absolute command thank sir harman said be good term promise to obey command a readily a if be old enough to be father be good now have dinner ordered hope will share with can then talk over matter comfortably before dinner be over lad be more than satisfied with new chief felt sure that at rate cruise must be pleasant one just a have finished dimchurch tom came in to see will on finding that be engaged must have withdrawn will called in sit down join mr harman in chat harman be bob dimchurch who be going to be boatswain tom stevens whom have known since be five year old although have gone over head be a good friend a ever dimchurch took under wing when first joined since then have fought by side on several occasion came to wish success in new command sir dimchurch said must not have intruded have known that be not alone be intrusion at dimchurch there be man whose congratulation can be more pleasing to have seen cutter yes sir tom noticed what smart likely craft be when came in dropped anchor little thought that be who have command of have fear that will do full justice must hardly believe ear when be told afternoon tom be ready to jump out of clothes with joy be wonderfully good fortune dimchurch can hardly believe yet be sure deserve sir be who recaptured prize in mediterranean be who saved first lieutenant life be who suggested plan by accounted for three pirate if did deserve promotion be hard to say what must owe small portion of dimchurch to fact be able to take observation so soon after have joined be due to kindness of good friend miss warden yes sir that go for something doubt there be good deal more than in after further talk of past future dimchurch sprang to foot saying well sir wish success be time be off be told be to remove dud on board new craft to morrow yes be going to start manning at once will be on board with mr harman directly after breakfast have not put foot upon yet be most anxious to do so craft fully answered will expectation after accommodation be exceedingly good cabin be handsomely fitted there be two state room will be in clover here harman said one must wish for better command must set to work to get store shipped at once how many of crew be on board twenty three sir believe will have full complement before night a spoke boat laden with provision came alongside hand be at once engaged transferring load to cutter in course of forenoon remainder of men came on board in two three after dinner will called crew together read out commission then made maiden speech lad said wish to be comfortable ship will do best to make so will expect ready obedience of may be assured that if possible will put in way of gaining prize money there be plenty of prize to be taken hope confidently that many of will fall to share men gave three cheer will added will order extra supply of grog to be served out evening on following day l'agile dipped ensign to admiral set off on voyage will be well pleased with smartness crew displayed in getting under weigh more than satisfied with pace at moved through water for month cruised off coast of cuba during time picked up eight small prize be for most part rowing galley carrying one large lateen sail none of be sufficiently strong to show fight be not intended to attack merchantman preyed upon native craft be manned by from ten to twenty desperado most of when overhauled pretended to be peaceful fisherman trader search always brought to light concealed arm in case captured good boat be burned crew mostly mulatto with sprinkling of negro rascal whose countenance be sufficiently villainous to justify being hanged without trial be put ashore for admiral have given instruction to will not to burden with prisoner who must have to be closely guarded must therefore weaken crew if brought to port royal must take up prison accommodation at last one day schooner rather bigger than be sighted appearance be rakish there be little doubt a to character sail be at once crowded on l'agile schooner be nearly a fast a be at end of six hour chase be still two mile ahead suddenly headed for shore disappeared among tree l'agile proceeded on course until opposite mouth of inlet pirate have entered be getting dark will decided to wait until morning then to send boat in to reconnoitre have not forgotten said to harman way in two french frigate have told of ran into trap mean to be caught so if can help l'agile remained hove to during night in morning lowered boat with four hand commanded by dimchurch who be ordered to row in until obtained fair view of enemy observe a far a possible what preparation have be made for defence be absent for hour then returned saying that schooner be lying anchored with sail stowed at far end of inlet be about mile long nearly a wide with broadside bearing on entrance if be a large a will said there will be plenty of room for to manoeuvre did make out what number of gun carried sir mounted four gun on side must say be for most part ten pounder think can reckon upon taking gun be of heavier metal than hers long tom will make up for deficiency in number l'agile be put under a easy sail a must suffice to give manoeuvring power then headed for mouth of inlet be half way through when suddenly two hidden battery mounting three gun opened upon drop anchor at once will shouted will finish with gentleman before go farther schooner at same time opened fire at mile range gun did not inflict much damage upon cutter lying between two battery engaged broadside gun firing with grape while long tom sent shot into alternately in quarter of hour fire be silenced three of gun be dismounted men who have be working fled precipitately take boat spike remaining gun dimchurch will said want more bother with in few minute dimchurch returned to cutter having accomplished mission anchor be then got up again proceeded to attack schooner l'agile casualty have be trifling only one have be killed three wounded of slightly a sailed up inlet replied with pivot gun to fire of enemy at shot splinter be seen to fly from schooner side much to discomfiture of pirate gunner whose aim became so wild that scarcely shot struck l'agile when within hundred yard of schooner helm be put down cutter swept round opened fire with two broadside gun shot have scarcely rung out when harman touched will on shoulder look there sir said will turned saw vessel emerging from side channel be so closed in with tree that have be unperceived by anybody aboard cutter aim be evidently to get between sea be cutter of about same size a l'agile carried six ten pounder schooner have enticed in here will said there be doubt about now there be nothing to do to fight out take head round said will settle with cutter first schooner can not come to assistance for minute a have sail furled accordingly ranged up to new comer furious contest ensued engaged with two broadside gun long tom at same time kept other two gun playing upon schooner crew of be busy getting up sail long tom be served by dimchurch shot went crashing through side of pirate cutter fire of two broadside gun being almost equally effective keep up lad will shouted will finish with before other can come up a spoke shot from long tom struck cutter mainmast tottered for moment then fell over side towards l'agile sail hamper entirely prevented crew from working gun for five minute fire be kept up then crew be seen to be leaping overboard presently man stood up shouted that surrendered schooner be now coming up fast let escape will shouted have have enough of be trying to get away run aboard in minute two vessel crashed together headed by will harman dimchurch l'agile crew sprang on board schooner pirate crew be evidently discouraged by fate of consort by complete failure of plan to capture l'agile captain gigantic mulatto fought desperately a did two three of principal men one of charged at will while be engaged with must have killed have not tom stevens sprung forward caught blow on own cutlas sword flew from man hand tom at once cut down dimchurch engaged in single handed contest with great mulatto captain strong a sailor be must with difficulty parry ruffian blow skill made up for inequality of strength after few exchange laid man low with clever thrust fall of leader completed discomfiture of pirate most of whom at once sprang overboard made for shore who remained being cut down by sailor when at last be master of ship crew gave three lusty cheer will did not permit to waste precious time in rejoicing knew that though have accomplished so much there be still great deal to be done for prize might even yet be recaptured before got out to sea without moment delay therefore sent boat to take possession of cutter sail wreckage be cleared away boat proceeded to tow out of inlet in meantime warp be taken from l'agile to schooner sail of latter be lowered will sailed proudly out with second prize in tow once fairly at sea crew began to repair damage five men in have be killed eleven be wounded several of latter however be able to lend hand shot hole in l'agile be first patched with piece of plank then covered with canvas afterwards given coat of paint then schooner be taken in hand when be got into something like ship shape order sail be hoisted again ten men under harman placed on board to work cutter be taken in tow only three men being left on board to steer be late in afternoon before repair be completed before sailing rough examination be made of hold of two vessel to great satisfaction of l'agile crew be found to contain considerable amount of booty be probable that there be storehouse somewhere will said a have under thirty available men must be madness to try to land for certainly two third of scoundrel escaped by swimming a craft must have carried nearly hundred men must have be altogether overmatched well have certainly right to count upon success arrangement be exceedingly good doubt expected to leave battery alone from position in be placed must have peppered hotly while be engaged with schooner in case must probably have have easy victory be cleverly laid trap ought to have succeeded must sir dimchurch said if have not turned from schooner settled with cutter before other must come to assistance credit be largely due to will said that shot of yours took mast out be turning point of fight completely crippled a luckily fell towards altogether prevented from returning fire very proud be will crew when sailed into port royal with two prize will at once rowed to flagship where received very hearty greeting have not come empty handed see mr gilmore admiral said be lucky indeed to take two ship of own size one after other took at same time sir will said a will see by report admiral gave look of surprise opened document first ran eye over then read more attentively when have finished said have fought most gallant action mr gilmore most gallant action be indeed long odds have against two vessel considerably over own size manned by far heavier crew besides two battery be excellent idea to leave vessel with be first engaged turn upon second one if have tried to fight at once must almost certainly have be overcome succeeded because be cool enough to grasp fact that schooner at anchor with sail down must not be able to come to friend assistance for minute acted so promptly on conclusion oldest officer in service must not have done better congratulate very heartily on conduct what be content of cargo of prize can not say sir with three vessel on hand have time to examine certainly contain number of bale of various sort opened one contained british good then doubt be pick of cargo captured admiral said will go off with ascertain have nothing else to do afternoon will be matter of interest to a well a to may a well let own gig row back will take mine accordingly gig be sent back to l'agile with order for two boat to be lowered twenty of men to be ready to go to two prize a soon a admiral came on board hatchway be opened men brought up number of bale be found to contain fine cloth material for woman dress china ironmongery carpet other good of british manufacture other vessel contained sugar coffee ginger spice other product of island be enough said admiral think will be far wrong if put down value of two cargo at two vessel will sell for about l apiece so that prize money will be altogether about l even after putting aside portion will share to handsome amount in proceeds be advantage of not belonging to squadron in case share must not be worth anything like what will now be by way since have be absent have received account of prize money earned by furious in mediterranean by capture of french frigate amount in to l of course a midshipman share will not be very large probably indeed will not exceed l so see pirate hunting in west indie in command even of small craft pay enormously better than being midshipman on board frigate doe indeed sir though l must be fortune to midshipman well if calculation a to value of cargo ship be correct will get more than ten time amount now a there be only flag one other officer to share with men portion will be something like l apiece few more capture like laughed will become rich man then rowed away to own ship will returned to l'agile gladdened heart of harman crew with news of value of capture l'agile remained week in harbour during time sign of recent conflict be removed received draft of men sufficient to bring crew up to former level then again set sail have cruised for about fortnight when one morning just a will be getting up dimchurch ran down reported that have sighted two sail suspiciously near other one said look to full rigged ship other large schooner will have look at will said putting on clothes ran on deck yes certainly look suspicious said when have examined through telescope will head towards look to very large schooner sir said dimchurch yes be larger than pirate generally be there be very little doubt a to character how far be off do think ten mile sir must say have got land breeze while be becalmed by look of water must say must carry wind with until be pretty close to sail cutter must carry be hoisted approached two vessel rapidly be four mile from when sail of schooner filled began to move through water will be long chase now will said cutter have light wing so have good chance of overhauling sail of ship be anyhow sir harman said so be mr harman foul play have be going on there have not least doubt fact that crew be not making effort to haul in sheet come to meet be in proof of think be duty to board see what have taken place even if allow schooner to escape will light upon again day have doubt be very low in water said after examining merchantman carefully through telescope cargo be of value to pirate have allowed to remain in have scuttled be afraid be that sir dimchurch said for be certainly lower in water than when first saw be right dimchurch scoundrel have scuttled please god will get to before founder oh for stronger wind do think must row there quicker than sail sir gig might go a fast a cutter other boat must not be able to keep pace with well make preparation for lowering heaven only know what tragedy may have taken place there after have be got ready eye on board cutter be fixed on vessel there be doubt now that be getting deeper in water minute when got within quarter of mile of ship be so low that be evident must not float many minute longer to boat men will cried row for life moment later three boat started at full speed gig in dimchurch tom be rowing be first to search sinking ship will leapt on board at once a did so gave exclamation of horror for deck be strewn with dead body without stopping to look about ran aft to companion went down to cabin be already foot deep in water there found fifteen men woman sitting securely bound on sofa will drew dirk running along cut thong up on deck for life cried get into boat alongside will not float three minute at farther end of cabin young girl be kneeling by side of stout old lady who have evidently fainted come will said going up to be matter of life death will have water coming down companion in minute two ca leave girl cried will attempted to lift old lady be far too heavy for can not save said raised shout for dimchurch be unanswered there said water be coming down will sink in minute can not save indeed be a good a dead already can save snatching girl up ran to foot of companion water be already pouring down struggled up against managed to reach deck before must cross to side vessel gave sudden lurch went down be carried under with suck by desperate effort gained surface just a breath be spent for moment two be unable to speak be none le ready to act looking round saw hen coop floating near swimming to clung to with one arm while held girl head above water with other then when have recovered breath shouted dimchurch fortunately gig be not far away hail be at once answered moment later boat be alongside hen coop illustration rescue take young lady dimchurch lay in stern sheet ca be dead for be sensible when ship went down be not under water minute after girl have be laid down will be helped in did save asked yes sir at least think so came running on deck jumped straight into boat be busy helping did not notice that be missing a last seemed to have come up called to other boat to make off for saw that must only float minute longer a be have only just got clear when went down indeed have narrow escape of men have to row be standing up to look for have just discovered that be not in of boat when heard call gave bad turn a may guess sir glad be when saw be holding on to hen coop now let try bring young lady round will said turned over first upon face let water run out of mouth then laid flat on back with jersey under head rubbed hand foot pressed gently at time on chest after five minute of treatment girl heaved sigh shortly afterwards opened eye looked round in bewilderment at face of men then suddenly realized where be remembered what have happened oh be dreadful murmured poor miss morrison be lost be not if be name of lady be kneeling by regret to say that be be impossible to save for though tried best must not lift a call miss morrison presume be not close relation have be governess since be child have be mother to oh to think that be dead while be saved must remember that might have be worse will said certainly can not require governess many more year will find others on whom to bestow affection how old be be fourteen girl said well here be ship will do best to make comfortable ship girl said in surprise do mean to say that be in command of look more than boy be not much more than boy said with smile for be commander of vessel young gentleman be second in command chapter viii splendid haul when be got on board boat hoisted to davit will conducted lady down to cabin handed over to then having ordered cook to prepare hot soup for girl have rescued came on deck again questioned male passenger be dressing for dinner one said when heard shouting on deck almost immediately there be great bump knocked most of off foot thought that have be run into directly afterwards heard great tumult going on above guessed that ship have be attacked by pirate clashing of sword falling of body went on for two three minute then there be loud savage yell told that pirate have taken ship next moment ruffian rushed down upon took away valuable have about person then tied up threw on sofa after scouring cabin left by noise followed guessed that have removed hatch be getting up cargo continued night time morning heard brute going down to boat thanked god that have spared life presently became still after time saw water rising on floor dreadful thought struck that have scuttled ship left to perish one of managed in spite of bond to make way up companion endeavour to open door found however to horror that be fastened outside time after time flung against must not yield water rose higher higher be waiting for end when to delight heard bump a of boat coming alongside vessel then sound of someone running along deck of companion door being hurriedly opened know rest ship be northumberland of bristol thank god arrived in time will said be affair of second if have be two minute later must have be drowned what have become of terrible pirate asked one of passenger there be six mile away hope day to avenge murder of captain crew ship look good deal larger than yours yes will said take much account of size captured two pirate in one fight of bigger than ourselves ship look small thing too in comparison with vessel yes ship must pretty well take up carry weight doe go for much in fighting be really commander have honour be midshipman before got command of l'agile be on board majesty ship furious hawke have great deal of luck in several fight came through a result be entrusted by admiral with command of vessel a say be small gun be heavy for size be more than match for most of carried by pirate well sir in name of myself fellow passenger offer sincerest thanks for manner in saved life how close shave be be shown by fact that be unable to get off ship in time be carried down with be in way of business will laughed be after pirate when saw state of vessel reluctantly gave up chase in order to see if must be of assistance expect schooner must have run away from have not be so full of cargo got from ship must not have have time to stow below must have hampered in working gun besides probably affecting speed will know again when see then will try if scoundrel be a good at fighting a be at cold blooded murder where be going now sir be cruising at present be master of own movement so if will let know where be bound for will try to set a many of down at destination a can most of be bound for jamaica sir others will be able to find way to respective island from there very well then will head for jamaica at once in meantime cabin that of second in command be at service of lady there be sofa too in saloon if be not enough will get hammock slung will sleep on deck of who prefer can do same for others will have hammock slung in hold most of lady soon came up girl will have saved did not appear till next morning be very pretty likely to be more so if have allowed must have overwhelmed with thanks made light of whole affair learned from other passenger that be daughter of one of richest merchant in jamaica at death of mother when be five year old be sent home to england in charge of governess who have be drowned in northumberland when catastrophe occurred have be on way to rejoin father although saddened by death of old friend soon showed sign of disposition naturally bright cheerful bantered will about command professed to regard l'agile a toy ship expressing great wonder that be not manned by boy ab a well a boy officer must surely seem very ridiculous to said to be giving order to men old enough to be father can quite understand that seems so to said for doe to sometimes custom be everything suppose men give matter thought at rate be a ready to follow a be oldest veteran in service will carried sail must set a be anxious to get craft free from passenger to be off in search of schooner have escaped be again loaded with thanks by passenger when landed after seeing off went made report to admiral how be mr gilmore admiral said a entered cabin prize time who be people saw landing just now will handed in report a usual admiral insisted on hearing detail uniform look shrunk mr gilmore said when will have finished said nothing about being in water will be then obliged to relate how have rescued girl from cabin well done again young sir be deed to be a proud of a capturing of two pirate well done indeed now suppose want to be off again yes sir must like to sail a soon a possible in first place because be most anxious to fall in with schooner bring captain crew in here to be hanged be very laudable ambition why in second place because want to get off before lot of people come to thank for saving relative so on sir if get away at once then may hope that before come back again whole thing will be forgotten ought to be for acted very wisely gallantly well sir want lot of thanks for only doing what be duty very good mr gilmore understand feeling quite expect that when do return will have to go through ordeal of being presented with piece of plate probably after will have to attend complimentary ball now can go back to ship at once here be letter to chief of store department instructing to furnish with store may want without waiting for signature thank very much sir hope when return that will bring pirate in tow can have three month from present time certainly hope will be able to make good use of returning to ship will at once made out list of store required sent harman on shore with telling to take two boat bring everything back with at five o'clock in afternoon two boat returned carrying store required water tank have already be filled up quarter of hour later cutter be under sail leaving harbour will of course have nothing whatever to guide in search for schooner beyond fact that be heading west at time when last saw at time be to south of porto rico so concluded that be making for cuba day therefore cruised along coast of island sometimes sending boat ashore to examine inlet at other time running right out to sea in hope that pirate whose spy have doubt be watching movement might suppose have given up search be sailing away nevertheless must not be certain that must endeavour to avoid must catch sight of for with glass pirate captain must have made out number of gun l'agile carried must doubtless feel confident in own superiority a must not be able to discover weight of gun will felt that if pirate must fight best policy must be at first to make pretence of running in hope that in long chase might manage to knock away of schooner spar one day saw boat have gone up deep inlet coming back at full speed saw schooner up there harman reported think be one be in search of when sighted be getting up sail will just suit will run out to sea at once will make believe be afraid of scarcely have boat be got on board cutter head turned offshore when schooner be seen issuing from inlet will ordered sail to be crowded on have satisfaction of seeing schooner following example then set whole of crew to shift long tom from bow to stern muzzle be just high enough to project above taffrail in order to hide better have hammock other material piled on side of so a to form breastwork three foot high will think said that have put up a protection against shot from bow chaser after watching schooner for quarter of hour will said think gain upon at lower sail over bow to deaden way small topsail will do only want to check half knot hour be hour before schooner yawed fired bow gun be good will said to dimchurch show that doe carry long tom thought did might have hidden a have done answer yet want to fire till get within mile of then will have a hot a like schooner continued to gain slowly occasionally firing bow chaser when have come up to within mile of l'agile cutter be yawed two broadside gun fired be purposely aimed somewhat wide a will be anxious that pirate must not suspect weight of metal did not wish by inflicting small injury to deter from continuing chase schooner evidently depended upon vastly superior strength of crew to carry cutter by boarding so abstained from attempting to injure a le damage suffered better value must be a prize be not more than mile off now think sir dimchurch said at last very well then will let have gun be already loaded so dimchurch took steady aim applied match leapt upon bulwark to see effect of shot cheer broke from crew a struck schooner on bow about four foot above water in return schooner yawed so a to bring whole broadside to bear on cutter six tongue of flame flashed from side at same moment l'agile swung round fired two starboard gun ship immediately resumed former position a did so dimchurch fired again shot scattering shower of splinter from almost same spot a other have struck must elevate gun little more dimchurch said will bring mast about ear get that sail on board shouted want schooner to get nearer order be executed difference in speed of cutter be at once manifest again again dimchurch fired several of shot went through schooner foresail a yet mast be untouched little more to right dimchurch time sailor be longer than usual in taking aim when fired schooner foremast be seen to topple over head flew up into wind thus presenting stern to cutter be lame duck now will said may a well take mainmast out of too fire away take a good aim a did last time ten more shot be fired with last pirate mainmast went over side well done dimchurch now have her at mercy will sail backwards forward under stern rake with grape want to injure more than be necessary do want to kill a many of crew a possible be better for to die way than to be taken to jamaica to be hanged for hour cutter kept at work crossing recrossing antagonist stern time poured in volley from two broadside gun long tom stern of schooner be knocked almost to piece grape shot carried death along deck be only afraid that will blow up will said probably a have not done so already captain most of officer be killed for must require desperado to undertake job at last black flag be hoisted on spar at stern then lowered again when saw crew of l'agile stopped firing sent up cheer after cheer now must be careful sir dimchurch said scoundrel be quite capable of pretending to surrender then when board blowing ship into air be right dimchurch might very well do for must know well enough that can expect mercy bringing cutter to within hundred yard of schooner will shouted have boat can swim receiving reply in negative shouted back very well then will drop one to then placed cutter exactly to windward of schooner lowering one of boat to rope be attached let drift down to prize now shouted fasten hawser to boat largest have there be evidently discussion among few men gathered on deck of pirate seeing that hesitated will shouted do a be ordered will open fire again decided pirate in short time end of hawser be tied to one of thwart of boat boat be then hauled back to l'agile when cable be got on board be knotted to own strongest hawser will keep good bit astern will said otherwise if wind be to drop at night might haul own vessel up to carry out plan of blowing up be wise to take precaution sir harman said think trick of sort must be likely to succeed may be sure must keep too sharp watch on while hawser be being spliced will shouted to pirate to cut away wreckage from ship when be done started with prize in tow a soon a be fairly under weigh hailed prisoner through speaking trumpet questioned about casualty replied that at beginning of engagement have have one hundred twenty men on board captain have be killed by first volley of grape slaughter among crew have be terrible officer being killed eighty of men remainder have run down into hold remained there until after consultation one of crawled up on deck hoisted lowered black flag suppose will said intention be to blow ship yourselves into air a soon a came on board be just what did mean one of shouted savagely if must have paid out must not have minded what became of ourselves be well indeed dimchurch that suggested possibility of doing to for must certainly have lost nearly number for not knowing how many of crew survived must not have ventured to go on board without pretty nearly man will be lesson to in future when be fighting pirate to act a if be wild beast well sir know that be altogether to be blamed be only human nature to pay back blow for blow with savage like especially when know that be bound to be hanged must hardly expect anything else suppose not dimchurch certainly for must rather be blown up than hanged suppose reason why did not blow up ship when found plan have failed be that clung to life even for few day expect be that sir besides know man may think that although doubt rest will be hanged may get off yes dare say have something to do with will agreed think likely however that one of will be spared after affair of northumberland very probably be only one of dozen ship destroyed in same way now harman will put head round sail back sail back sir certainly think there be doubt that inlet be pirate head quarter that be certain to have storehouse there choke full of plunder of associate will in case be on shore looking after if ship doe return will divide most valuable portion of store among set fire to rest have done extremely well so far big haul will make matter pleasanter what will do with prize asked harman will cast off eight ten mile from shore have boat schooner be mere log on water when see what plunder have collected will be able to decide how to act cutter can hold great deal if find more than can carry must load schooner also what must do with pirate in case sir must try to make come off in batch then iron if must not do must be inclined to tow schooner to within mile of shore so give must swim chance of getting away of be unable to do so must probably manage to get off on spar hatchway have be richly punished already fancy admiral must be much better pleased to see schooner come in loaded with valuable plunder than if carried only forty scoundrel to be handed over to hangman if be to let escape must have to take great care on shore while be rifling storehouse may be sure must do harman fellow must certainly take firearm on shore must keep ten men with loaded musket always on guard while who be at work must have firearm handy to towed schooner to within seven eight mile of shore then cast off made for creek from pirate have come out a entered inlet be two mile long must see sign of house so sailed a far a must anchored will then landed with party of ten well armed men at once began to make careful examination of beach in short time found well beaten path going up through wood before following however will took precaution to have fifteen more men sent ashore a be of course impossible to say how many of guard have be left at head quarter when second party have landed all advanced cautiously up path holding musket in readiness for instant action met however with opposition pirate be evidently unaware of presence have gone very short distance when came to large clearing in middle of saw several large hut three great storehouse went on at double towards have gone only short distance when heard shout shot saw dozen men number of woman issue from back of hut make for wood now lad shouted will break open door of storehouse there be not likely to be much be of value in hut have better take four men dimchurch set fire to of course can just look in see if there be anything worth taking before apply light will superintended breaking open of storehouse when entered first paused in amazement be filled to very top with box bale other two be in similar condition there be enough to fill cutter prize dozen time will said expect trade to extent with spaniard evidently have intention in storing good probably proposed when have amassed sufficient to charter large ship fill up to hatchway sail to american port other place where question be not usually asked there be safe in corner of one of storehouse blew open when will examined content found that consisted of paper manifest of cargo of fewer than eleven ship conjecture be right said intended doubt to keep large merchantman have captured fill with content of prize then with paper manifest of cargo must go almost anywhere dispose of ill gotten good have doubt be so sir dimchurch said only wonder did not set about before be quite possible have done so already will said may have taken prize quicker than must dispose of must account for immense accumulation now dimchurch will sit down go through bill of lading pick out most valuable good will then take off to begin with can leave to admiral to send man of war charter merchantman to bring rest schooner must carry between two three hundred ton must manage to cram eighty hundred into hold if get safely to jamaica need not grieve much if find that rest of good have be burned before ship can come to fetch took three hour to go through bill of lading making mark against most valuable good then of men be set to sort out there be great difficulty about a good have be very neatly stored belonging to ship being separated by narrow passage from rest remainder of men except two be meanwhile brought from cutter sentry be then placed to watch approach to storehouse while ten men got out bale box remaining twenty six carried down path at night men remained in storehouse other half returning to cutter before sunset will went with small escort to top of neighbouring hill to see that be well with hulk of schooner with aid of telescope must see plainly to great satisfaction noted that have made little drift next morning work be resumed be carried on day with only short break for meal so on following two day at end of time a much have be put on board cutter a must carry ten men be then left to guard store rest going on board sailed out to schooner towed in did not a be at first intended stop mile outside inlet came right into anchored opposite path a labour of continually loading cutter then transferring cargo to hulk must have be very great next morning party of twelve men went on board found a will have expected that be entirely deserted will be too happy at having made escape to do anything for next day two will said so can go on working a usual fortunately fellow who be left in hut be taken so completely by surprise that bolted at once left gun behind if therefore be joined by friend from schooner attack will have firearm with for a hulk be anchored about two hundred yard from shore must require marvellously good swimmer to carry musket ammunition ashore with in future however will leave twenty men to guard storehouse at night there be boat in inlet by mean of must attack cutter be not likely to try to do so by swimming at rate harman will place in command of will therefore feel perfectly confident that will not be taken by surprise can trust for sir promise will sleep with one eye open though think must be likely to attempt enterprise be much more likely to attack at store think must be advisable to take twenty five men with leave with fifteen must be ample must divide into two watch so that there must always be seven on deck jefferson who be uncommonly sharp fellow must be in charge of one of watch williams of other a must be up down night there must be chance of being caught napping will agreed to arrangement prize be now brought close inshore water being deep enough to allow of be great advantage a good must be put on board direct work be thereby greatly accelerated behind pile of good safe be discovered be found to contain l in money nearly hundred watch large amount of lady jewellery many watch have also be found in hut before be burned bale box contained chiefly spice silk sateen shawl piece good coffee on night of fourth day after escape of prisoner one of sentry perceived dark mass moving from wood at once fired musket in minute will dimchurch with five twenty men be in readiness now men will said fellow will attempt to rush will divide into three party will fire by volley one party must not fire till see that be loaded in way will always have sixteen musket ready for have fear of result even if close with cutlass will be more than match for knife here come get ready first section fire till tell enemy fully sixty strong came on with fierce cry knowing that garrison be on guard although must not see in shadow of storehouse when got within fifty yard will gave order to fire first eight musket flashed out second eight fired almost immediately after third eight waiting only till first section have reloaded followed suit nearly shot told shock be so great that caused advancing enemy to hesitate for moment gave second third section time to reload so that when pirate again advanced three more deadly volley be poured into in quick succession effect of be instantaneous fully five thirty have be brought to ground by six volley remainder halted swayed for moment then turned fled at full speed pursued however before reached wood by general discharge will be well pleased with tremendously heavy punishment have inflicted out of sixty men who attacked said to harman next morning calculate that forty belonged to schooner suppose be worse than other twenty have seen of crime have committed have accounted for forty in so of who escaped from schooner probably five six twenty have be killed after such thrashing be not likely to make attempt be right work now went on undisturbed at end of fortnight schooner be laden hatch have be closed made water tight so full be that deck be only two foot half above water although gun have be thrown overboard landed now think be ready to sail harman said ready to sail have fortnight hard work before said will suppose be going to leave hogshead of sugar puncheons of rum bale of good to be burnt destroyed by scoundrel how can prevent very easily there be plenty of material on spot to form four battery one on side of storehouse will drag up eight of schooner gun mount two on battery will be loaded crammed to muzzle with grape shot battery will be built clear of storehouse in echelon so that if one be attacked can be supported by others a garrison will leave sixteen men under dimchurch dimchurch be called up matter explained to readily agreed to take charge two men said can be on watch in battery while others sleep so there will be chance of being taken by surprise may be quite sure that matter how strong mob may come down wo stand discharge of eight cannon loaded a say suppose sir mean to form battery of bale of cotton there be whole ship load of be intention dimchurch have have in mind time whole strength of crew with exception of two to watch on board cutter now went up to storehouse men delighted to know that booty be not to be lost set to work with great vigour will marked out site for battery bale of cotton be rolled to built up into substantial wall took ten day of hard labour to do haul up gun when work be completed dimchurch chose sixteen of crew there be ample supply of provision have be taken out of hut before be burnt so be not necessary to draw upon store of cutter when be ready two party said good bye with mutual cheer cutter crew went on board be hazardous business admit will said a having got up sail moved down inlet with schooner in tow of course will be little uneasy until can return from jamaica relieve dimchurch feel convinced that will be able to hold own to give lesson to pirate if necessary when see sail out will naturally conclude that great number can be left to guard store still may be sure that have kept watch on doings from edge of forest that sight of gun will inspire wholesome dread in can not think that eight discharge of grape langrage will send to right about however strong may be besides have given men three musket in addition to own from found on board schooner so if enemy press on will be able to give warm reception then even if attack be too much for have still resource for have left exit in rear of battery by can retire to storehouse have instructed to carry musket back with sixteen men with four musket apiece must make very sturdy defence a know have door repaired strengthened loophole cut in wall still think will be needed how much do think prize will be worth harman asked have really idea be sure that what have got here in schooner must be worth thousand of pound what have left behind must be content of about ten vessel a have be able to take be only full cargo for one good sized ship chapter ix spell ashore ten day later arrived at jamaica will at once went to make report to admiral well admiral said heartily have brought in prize mr gilmore look mere hulk be remarkably deep in water what be be schooner sank northumberland must have knocked about terribly for be evidently sinking sir be right except that stern be shattered have covered over with tarpaulin backed by batten otherwise be almost uninjured be glad indeed to hear that have caught that scoundrel mr gilmore hardly think can be worth towing in be worth good deal sir for cutter be choke full of loot indeed admiral said in tone of gratification in case must be valuable let hear about have stated in report sir always leave out good deal in report please give full account of first how many gun did carry six gun side sir then must have done wonder now tell about will modestly gave full account of fight of step have afterwards taken to prevent from playing treacherous trick upon of land fight arrangement made to secure good found at head quarter now what have brought home time admiral asked be list sir took from bill of lading found at pirate head quarter altogether storehouse contained cargo of eleven ship picked out most valuable good loaded cutter schooner with be only very small portion of total have left nearly half crew there to guard storehouse until must send ship from here to bring content with cutter to navigate schooner to tow dared not weaken further have left sixteen of men there under boatswain have erected four battery with cotton bale mounting two gun be charged to muzzle with grape langrage have confidence therefore that little garrison will be able to hold own against greatly superior force be great risk admiral said gravely be aware of sir be worth running risk for splendid prize value of nearly eleven cargo must be something very great indeed must admiral said what be composed of will see entire list in bill of lading sir must say that nearly good be sugar rum molasses other half be bale box of detail be given have brought home be silk satin cloth shawl other material of female dress coffee spice well mr gilmore certainly appears to be richest haul have ever be made in island at rate since day of spanish galleon will lose time in chartering ship how many do think will be necessary must say sir that if have five vessel must do in two trip meanwhile wish must give thirty men to strengthen garrison certainly will do so there be several vessel in harbour have discharged cargo have not yet taken fresh one on board be waiting to sail for england under convoy will doubt be glad of job in meantime four day later cutter again put to sea with five merchantman frigate be charged to act a convoy when arrived off inlet will went ashore to delight found storehouse intact little garrison well crew of ship be at once landed in short time place be scene of bustle activity in spite however of exertion be fortnight before ship be loaded before setting sail again will told off thirty additional men to remain harman be left in command dimchurch have reported that only once have pirate shown in force have allowed to come within hundred yard of battery be facing then poured content of gun into whereupon have at once fled leaving ten killed behind when little fleet arrived at jamaica again will found that good have brought in cutter schooner be valued at far higher price than estimate merchantman be unloaded a fast a possible started again for cuba without delay be well with garrison at inlet serious attack have be made on fort day after fleet have sailed for jamaica garrison have repulsed so effectually that have not seen sign of enemy since even hope of plunder be not strong enough to induce negro to make attempt a for pirate have be almost entirely wiped out after storehouse have be emptied be burned harman party returned to cutter fleet once more sailed for jamaica will immediately started again on short cruise time met with adventure at end of three week returned when went to make report admiral told that total value of capture amounted to l must congratulate said a well a on haul must say must make richest midshipman in service share a know be eighth a officer in command altogether independent of fleet will get one quarter mr harman share will be eighth rest will be divided among crew boatswain getting four share be astounded sir will said seems almost impossible that can be master of so much money have satisfaction at rate mr gilmore of knowing that have earned by own exertion courage skill think now that be only fair must send back to ship when next come in give someone else chance agree with sir can not feel deeply indebted to for having put in way of making fortune little knew what be coming of admiral said when gave command of little craft if have have slightest notion must assuredly have given to older officer will returned to cutter in state of bewilderment at good fortune when came on deck little later found waiting for gentleman who advanced with open arm mr gilmore said name be palethorpe be father of young girl whose life so gallantly saved when northumberland sank have be trying to catch ever since live up among hill except when business call down here stay here have always be so short that never before heard of arrival until have started again can not say sir how intensely grateful feel be only child may guess what terrible blow must have be to have be lost only did duty sir be glad indeed be able to save daughter life pray say anything more about dear sir be quite impossible one man can not render so vast service to escape without being thanked have driven down here to carry off to home whether like not called on admiral morning said that must willingly grant week leave longer in fact that must be unemployed until hawke came in a master mate must take

pair of fine horse be waiting for a soon a be seated at once started inland after leaving town began to mount be soon high among mountain scenery be lovely will who have not before made excursion so far into interior be delighted with drive so much so indeed that mr palethorpe gradually ceased speaking of subject nearest heart suffered will to enjoy journey in silence at last drove up to handsome house be surrounded by broad veranda covered with rose other flower a stopped girl of fourteen ran out will must scarcely have recognized be now dressed in white muslin hair be tied up with blue ribbon while broad sash of same colour encircled waist have now also recovered colour shock of adventure have driven from cheek looked picture of health happiness oh dear boy cried out to will be

to see one no be not thing that anyone must wish to see second time word can not describe how terrible be hope however if have one that will be light one be rather afraid of nothing more be said on matter till retired to bed when mr palethorpe said half in fun half in earnest must advise to have clothes handy by bedside mr gilmore for may want quickly badly if hurricane come will laughed to at warning nevertheless took advice have be asleep for hour when felt whole house rock moment later roof blew bodily from over head at same time there be roar so terrible that did not even hear crash of falling timber leapt out of bed seized clothes hurried down met mr palethorpe coming from daughter room carrying wrapped up in bed clothes went down together to front door will turned handle door be blown in with force knocked to floor struggled to foot again tried to get out force of wind be so tremendous that for time must not stem when did manage to get through doorway saw mr palethorpe standing distance from house fought way towards against wind be not going to get into shelter shouted in planter ear be safer here in open planter said dare not get below tree will put daughter in

in entering one have to descend short flight of step just hold daughter on foot planter said while clear place out much a tried will be unable to keep girl upright after vain effort allowed to sink down on knee then knelt by side a soon a have cleared away tool mr palethorpe came up carried down into shed think be quite safe here said wall be only two foot above ground so even gale will not shake roof be strongly put together to keep out marauder now mr gilmore there be room for to crouch inside be only place of safety know of for even in open might be struck by flying branch torn from tree besides will be comfort to alice to know that be in safety beside spoke only occasionally for roar of tempest be deafening now then must hear crash a tree yielded to force of hurricane towards morning gale abated soon after sunrise wind suddenly stilled when looked out scene of terrible devastation met eye tree have be torn up by root branch twisted from others be strewed upon ground everywhere house be wreck whole of roof be gone part of wall have be blown down inside there be utter confusion furniture be scattered about in direction even looking glass have be torn from wall

everywhere that of thing be mile away will go down with will at once to slave hut be afraid damage loss of life there have be great during passage from house to shed wind have several time threatened to tear will clothes from arm have clung to with might main succeeded in carrying safely into shelter have therefore be able to dress while waited for storm to abate mr palethorpe have felt so sure that hurricane be impending that have simply lain down on bed without taking off clothes accordingly started at once for slave hut a have expected destruction there be complete hut have be blown down

intact carriage be brought round took seat in planter ordered two strong negro to get ax to stand on step when be ready started journey be long broken at few yard tree have fallen across road have to be chopped through removed before carriage must pas be therefore late in day before reached town will must not help grieving at terrible destruction wrought in forest in place acre of ground have be cleared of tree in others trunk branch lay piled in inextricable chaos hut cottage passed on way be in ruin former inhabitant be standing listlessly gazing at destruction mr palethorpe have placed in carriage two gallon jar of spirit large quantity of bread have distributed among forlorn inhabitant while men be chopping road through tree when arrived in town beheld terrible scene of devastation

condition slave be still in temporary home with usual light heartedness have already recovered from effect of shock loss seemed a merry happy a usual on return to port royal will be object of greatest attention on part of other passenger of northumberland received so many invitation to dinner that be obliged to ask admiral to allow to give up leave to take short cruise in l'agile promising that if did so must take good care not to capture more prize admiral consented in few day cutter set sail once more after have be out month will found necessary to put in to get water chose spot where little stream must be seen coming down from mountain losing in shingle rowed ashore set of men to fill barrel when saw work fairly under weigh started to walk along shore with dimchurch tom have gone short distance when number of negro rushed suddenly out upon will have just time to discharge pistol before be knocked senseless by negro armed with bludgeon tom dimchurch stood over made desperate defence just before be overpowered dimchurch shouted at top of voice put off be captured for saw that number of assailant be so great that must only be sacrificing crew to call to assistance be bound carried away by exulting negro illustration tom dimchurch made desperate defence be bad job will said when came to sens mighty bad job master will who be nigger do think suppose be escaped slave there be certainly many of in mountain of cuba suppose saw sailing in came down from hill in hope of capturing of be likely enough take for pirate who be constant scourge to capturing in little fishing boat cutting throat forcing to serve with be afraid will have very little opportunity of explaining matter to for of course speak english none of understand word of spanish be carried up hill thrown down in small clearing on summit will in vain endeavoured to address in english received attention what do think be going to do with sir dimchurch asked well must say that be most likely going to burn alive put to death in other devilish way well sir think nigger know much about tying rope seems to must get free without much trouble must dimchurch ca say a much for mine be knotted so tightly that can not move finger wo matter sir if can shift out of mine have got jack knife in pocket can make short work of rope tom well try then dimchurch fellow be away in wood by sound hear be cutting brushwood so there be time to lose for five minute remark be made then dimchurch said be free immediately afterwards will felt bond fall off minute later exclamation of thankfulness from tom showed that too have be liberated now must crawl towards edge of forest will said then instead of going straight down hill will turn off for short distance be sure to miss immediately will believe that have made direct for sea have barely got into shelter of forest when heard sudden shout so at once turned aside hid in brushwood minute two later have satisfaction of hearing negro rushing in body down hill waited until pursuer have covered hundred yard then jumped to foot held on way along hillside for nearly quarter of mile after began to descend just a changed course heard outburst of musketry fire hooray dimchurch exclaimed fellow be coming up hill in search of be right give hot guess will go back a quick a came now changed direction taking line must bring to rear of friend firing soon ceased negro having evidently got entirely out of sight of sailor by shouting have difficulty in ascertaining position of party who be pushing on up hill presently will hailed be captain voice one of party exclaimed then general cheer broke from seaman in two minute be among friend harman have landed with three thirty men leaving only five on board l'agile great be rejoicing on finding that three missing men be safe have better fall back now will said there must be at least three hundred negro at top though say must not beat must certainly suffer loss might well be avoided there be doubt took for pirate believed be going to avenge own wrong so may a well make way down before whole force gather attack retired at once to shore have just taken place in boat when crowd of negro rushed down to beach four five shot be fired by will order reply be made pushed off quietly in few minute reached cutter have be narrow escape will said when harman be together again on quarter deck a narrow a ever wish to experience if have be for dimchurch think must have arrived in time for be cutting brushwood for fire on intended to roast fortunately be not so tightly bound a be so managed to free can not say how thankful be when heard voice of course be proceeding only by guesswork must only hope that must find at top of hill if have carried farther away must not have followed be turning over in mind a advanced when heard rushing of large number of men down hill towards at once concluded that have escaped that be in pursuit a soon a negro appeared opened fire well be well that end well be very foolish of to wander away from men of course there be nothing whatever to tell that be being watched ought to have assumed that there be possibility of such thing not to have run risk will be mighty careful that play fool trick again be lucky that dimchurch shouted when did to watering party otherwise must have lost whole of with ten gone must have found very hazardous work to land sufficiently strong party must have tried if have only have dozen men concluded that must have be negro who have carried off only thought be to rescue before set to work to torture in abominable manner well expect must soon have be over harman certainly must have be very unpleasant ending to fall in battle be death at none must grumble to be burnt by fiendish negro must be horrible of course man must run risk take chance one hardly bargain for being burnt alive make flesh creep to think of more now fancy than when be face to face with when be lying helpless on hill there seemed something unreal about must not appreciate position now that think of in cold blood make shiver will take watch to night be quite sure that if did get to sleep must have terrible nightmare can quite understand that must rather be on deck than lying down trying to sleep be sure must do so even now thought of peril be in make shudder for time l'agile cruised off shore of cuba effecting few small capture none of importance finally fell in with three french frigate be chased for two day succeeded in giving pursuer slip by running between two small island under cover of night passage be very willow frenchman be unable to follow before must make circuit of island l'agile be out of sight when cutter at length returned to jamaica admiral decided to lay up for time crew be broken up retransferred to vessel to belonged

later will started together for london on arrival at portsmouth at once joined tartar be quite ready to sail be under order to join lord hood fleet in mediterranean chapter xi captive among moor week later tartar proceeded to mediterranean one morning after cruising there for week when light mist lifted vessel be seen three mile away captain looked at through telescope be suspicious looking craft said to first lieutenant mr robert will lower cutter overhaul cutter crew be at once mustered will be midshipman in charge of took place by side of third lieutenant mr saxton lieutenant ordered men to take musket with may take dimchurch stevens will asked yes if like there be room for in bow two extra musket may be useful two men who be standing close by took place when heard permission given certainly like appearance gilmore lieutenant said can not help thinking that be algerine by rig though algerine be not necessarily pirate very large number of be fancy breeze will spring up soon in case may have long row before overtake breeze came presently algerine began to slip away be however puff boat again began to gain on when be five mile from ship be within quarter of mile from chase confound fellow lieutenant muttered think be mistaken for there be not more than dozen men on deck at boat swept up to side of craft a men leapt to foot couple of round shot be thrown into boat one of going through bottom cutter immediately began to fill men a climbed up be confronted by fully hundred armed moor lieutenant saxton be at once cut down most of sailor suffered same fate a usual will dimchurch stevens held together fought back to back contest however be too uneven to last moorish captain came up to signed to that must lay down arm do at once will said evidently prefer to take prisoner to killing must do without difficulty have be caught in regular trap must make best of so saying threw down cutlas others followed example be taken down below with three other unwounded sailor wounded dead be at once thrown overboard be worst affair have be in together said dimchurch since fell into hand of negro unless tartar overtakes be afraid be in for bad time be afraid so dimchurch fear that there be little chance indeed of frigate overtaking in such light wind craft must run away from with fully five mile start must be useless for boat to try to overtake be going to do with there be very little doubt about will make slave of set to work on fortification sell to be taken up country expect will keep long dimchurch said grimly know have great number of christian whom hold captive be rare indeed that one of escape suppose day other will send fleet to root out hand be far too full for anything of sort at present if have chance of escape may be sure that will take have better make up mind at once to make best of thing until opportunity offer only hope will be kept together sir must put up with if be so must be awful if be separated for even if one saw chance for escape must not let others know may be sure dimchurch opportunity might see must not avail myself of unless must take off with same here sir dimchurch said word be echoed by tom six day later heard anchor run down presently hatchway be lifted be told to come on deck found a have expected that craft be lying in harbour of algiers at other time might have admired city with mosque minaret massive fortification shipping in port be in humour to do so now regarded a jail three sailor be put into boat rowed ashore captain of craft going with be met at wharf by moor who be evidently official of rank captain held animated conversation by laughter will have doubt that captain be telling clever manner in have effected capture then official said something be not altogether pleasing to captain who however crossed hand on breast bowed submissively official then handed six prisoner over to men who have accompanied be immediately marched across to large barrack like building be evidently prison two hour afterwards great troop of captive came in be so worn wearied that asked few question of new comer talk about one said in answer to question from will there be not one of who must not kill if got chance be work work work from daybreak till sunset have enough to eat to keep alive be too valuable to be allowed to die get food before start in morning again at mid day again when get back here oh be very careful of mind how suffer sun blaze down day not drop of drink do get except at meal in spite of care slip through hand sunstroke fever be always thinning rank be history of mate if be to talk till morning must not tell more suppose by cut that be man of war man be right dimchurch said got caught in trap nine mate be killed without having chance to fire shot ah man said with sigh wish have have luck will wish so too before have be here long rough food be served out then slave after eating lay down without exchanging word anxious only to sleep away thought of misery three friend lay down together to prisoner small rug have be served out be only bedding be certainly in bad corner dimchurch said great point will be to keep up spirit make best of be so will agreed be convinced that however sharp watch may keep three resolute men will find way of escape will know little more about to morrow if there be window to building ought to be able to get out of if be surrounded by wall ought to be able to scale besides if be set to work in city might find opportunity of evading diligence of guard for one thing must assume air of cheerfulness while work in time when see that do work well be contented obedient watch will relax above must not like poor fellow make up mind that lot be hopeless if once lose hope will lose everything at rate for present must wait patiently have still got to find out everything know be that be confined in prison that will have to do work other during day have got to find out plan of city general bearing to learn something if can of surrounding country to see how must manage to subsist if got away of course natural idea must be to make for sea steal boat came up from shore through archway in wall be strongly guarded fear must be next to impossible to get down to port best plan think must be to take to country if can go down to shore distance from city might then light upon boat belonging to fisherman of course be pure conjecture can arrange be that will keep eye about look for empty house in might hide discover how might leave town on land side where be not likely fortification will be nearly so strong a on sea face next morning captive be deprived of clothes in place be given dirty linen jacket loose trouser shoe be also taken away then fell in with rest of captive on leaving prison be formed into company of under strong guard marched off in different direction three friend kept close together be assigned to company be told off to clean street of certain quarter of town be furnished with broom brush be soon hard at work a morning went on heat became tremendous several men fell overseer lashed until got upon foot again eye be like working in oven dimchurch muttered dust be choking must certainly get out of a soon a can sir agree with dimchurch feel a if be melting away if be to put bit of food in mouth believe heat must bake in time must swallow anything tom said not even mackerel fresh out of sea know agreed that must make best of everything will said if work a be doing ca please overseer will save from blow have better not strike dimchurch said man did must never live to strike might be will said must be small satisfaction to if be to be flogged to death afterwards suppose not sir flesh blood ca stand such thing a being struck by one of yellow hound at twelve o'clock gang returned men drank eagerly from fountain in courtyard of prison take a little a can will said if drink much will do harm can drink often if like provided that only take sip at time be easy to say mr gilmore be not so easy to do feel a if must drink till burst dare say do feel same myself be sure that to take lot of water just now must do harm instead of good abstinence so far benefited that felt work in afternoon le than have done in morning though heat be if anything greater that evening examined prison consisted of one great hall supported by row of pillar here whole of prisoner be confined be lighted by window five twenty foot from ground there be guard inside fifty men of whom be always on sentry slept outside hall be clear to therefore that escape must be made after be once locked up that if be to get away at must make attempt when be employed outside on third day one of sailor from tartar who have disregarded will advice to drink sparingly fell down dead after drinking till must drink more scarcely day passed without one more of captive succumbing of went mad be at once despatched by guard after working for fortnight in street gang be marched in direction be put to labour on fortification be great relief be now free from choking dust of street obtained view of surrounding country three a usual laboured together showed so much zeal activity that pleased head of guard have great advantage that be accustomed to work together while majority of gang have such experience there be men of nationality french spanish italian maltese greek though most of be accustomed to warm climate have nothing like strength of three englishman in moving heavy stone therefore three friend be able to perform a much work a dozen other prisoner be only englishman in gang for other two sailor have be from first placed with party on march to work passed by palace of considerable extent surrounded by ground be entered on side by small postern gate must give good deal to know if gate be locked will said what good must do sir well if must get in there might hide in shrubbery stop there till first pursuit be over one must think of searching there must say might if have luck seize bind three of gardener attendant so issue from one of gate dressed in clothes without exciting suspicion what must do for grub sir well for must trust to chance there be house might be robbed traveller who might be lightened of belonging ca think that three active men though might be unarmed must allow to starve of course must want to get rid of clothes find weapon great point of be to discover whether door be locked all right sir be ready to try anything may suggest for be sick to death of work heat food guard everything connected with looked at door with longing eye time passed at last one day man came out of gateway just a be passing pulling gate to behind walked away without apparently thinking of locking that settle point will said next most important question be be there people moving about inside then how be to slip away unseen to begin with will manage always to walk in rear of gang there be often row if poor wretch go mad attack guard there be generally rush of others to assistance if such thing be to happen near gate might manage to slip in unnoticed still admit chance be against anything of sort taking place just at point expect must try think of something better fortnight later just a be passing door small party of cavalry evidently escort to great chief came dashing along at full speed road being somewhat narrow slave guard scattered in direction several of being knocked down now be chance will exclaimed three ran to gate entered garden there be one in sight evening be coming on men who might have be working in garden have left closed gate behind turned key in lock then ran into shrubbery threw down trusted that in confusion absence must not be noticed seemed to be case for heard loud order given then be quiet so far so good will said first step be taken most difficult one to morrow when gardener come will spring upon three of bind must not think that there will be more than fortune favoured however for hour later three servant came along laughing talking together sailor prepared to act a men passed hiding place will gave word leaping out upon hurled to ground tom dimchurch stunned men then aided will to secure one have knocked down without ceremony stripped off clothes of fallen men tore up own rag bound captive securely shoving ball of material between teeth of then secured to three tree short distance apart be good said will a put on servant clothes be safe till be found in morning in clothes can boldly venture out from town gate a soon a be opened there be always risk that colour may betray be burnt nearly a dark a mahogany may very well pas will start now sir will find out when get to prison that be missing there will be keen hunt for now come to think of guard at gate will be warned of escape will probably question particularly a bright coloured garment must attract attention really think best plan must be to go out into town at once try to get hold of other disguise must be good thing if must do so sir dear how stupid be exclaimed will after pause know that wall be repairing to day be only about fourteen foot above ground outside so must have difficulty in dropping down be so sir be easy drop by leaving in way will avoid being questioned get well away before alarm be given then will lose time said will have to pas through busy quarter if go separately will attract notice though doubt by time search will have begun will be looking however for three men together of course will not so much a cast eye upon servant of palace for will know nothing of doings here till to morrow morning will go first when get into street dimchurch follow forty fifty yard behind tom same distance behind hardly think will be in search of dimchurch said be little more than hour since escaped wo find out till get to prison count gang when have done that must have to see who be that be missing then must take time to organize search be so dimchurch still will take precaution so saying started when be half way to wall saw number of soldier convict guard come running along questioning many people a passed trembled lest must be discovered fortunately question be put to of kept on way presently will emerged upon open space of ground between wall house when dimchurch tom have come up went together along foot of wall until came to place where have be working keep eye open will said a climbed up there be crowbar hammer lying about where stone cutter be working chisel crowbar heavy hammer be weapon not to be despised in few minute be armed with chisel light crowbar then went to edge of wall throwing weapon down lowered a far a must reach dropped to ground thank god be out of place will said fervently wo enter again alive now first thing be to get a far away a possible keeping a nearly parallel to line of coast a can four five mile back for may be sure that when can not find in town will suspect that have made for coast dozen horseman will be sent out to look for along shore be use thinking of trying to get to sea until search have be given up principal difficulty will be to live from wall country looked well cultivated in part even if have to exist on raw grain will not be much worse off than when be in prison care what be tom said so long a there be enough of to keep alive must have water think there will be much difficulty about tom a one of house scattered over plain will have well fountain in garden thank goodness wo miss take must go night fetch water without exciting suspicion that have be there one of first thing must do said will be to dirty white jacket trouser so that may look like field labourer for then if anyone must catch sight of in distance must attract attention walked night just a morning be breaking saw large country house with usual garden climbed over wall be not high drew water in bucket found standing at mouth of well bucket will confiscate will said can hardly lie hidden day without having drink of course will miss when can not find will suppose that have be mislaid stolen one of gardener will probably get blame ca help that now will go mile then look for hiding place there be lot of sand hill scattered about if ca find hole will suit must scoop one out believe be pretty hard inside crowbar will soon make place large enough after hour walk fixed upon spot on shady side of hill began to make cave must allow three to lie side by side work be completed in le than hour crawled in scraped up of fallen sand so a partially to close mouth behind thank goodness have got shelter water will said a for food must forage for to night be quite content to go without for to day dimchurch said to lie here sleep hing think anything must tempt to get up walk mile farther not even prospect of good dinner well a be so tired will probably sleep till evening in few minute be asleep once twice in course of day woke up took drink from bucket then fell off again at sunset sat up quite refreshed begin to feel have appetite will said now think for to night will content with going into one of field plucking lot of ear of maize message may have be sent out over country people may be watchful will be wise to avoid risk of discovery can gather few stick make fire in there to roast maize there be sand hill round so what little flame make must not be noticed how about light dimchurch asked picked up piece of flint a came along morning will said by mean of one of chisel ought to be able to strike light few dead leaf finely crumbled up must do instead of tinder be good thing to keep one eye open dimchurch remarked now if have seen that piece of stone must not have given thought here be going to give hot dinner a there be number of field in neighbourhood soon returned with armful of maize dried weed stick be then collected after repeated failure light be at last obtained soon grain be roasted jacket be stretched across entrance of den so must anyone be passing near must not observe light now will said a munched maize next evening must start foraging will go in opposite direction must take bearing accurately will never come together again be out for hour when returned be found that will have come across four fowl tom have gathered variety of fruit consisting chiefly of melon peach while dimchurch who be last to come in brought small sheep only want one thing to make perfect will said be pipe of 'bacca well must be welcome addition tom admitted doe not do to expect too much must not be at surprised if be to light upon tobacco plant in one of garden of course must hardly be like properly dried leaf dare say though must make something of so lived for month sometimes better sometimes worse with sufficient food of one sort so far a knew suspicion of presence have be excited though petty robbery must have be noticed one evening however will on going to top of sand hill a generally did saw large detachment of soldier coming along searching ground carefully ran down at once to companion take weapon lad said make off strong party of soldier be searching country be coming way doubt be looking for have run few hundred yard when heard shout looking round saw moorish officer waving hand gesticulating be alarming reckoned that have fully five hundred yard start keep up steady pace will said expect beggar can run faster than can will be pitch dark in hour a fortunately there be moon expect will be able to give slip a advanced found that vegetation became scarcer scarcer be afraid be on edge of desert will said mean that there be more fowl fruit for see dimchurch that have be most thoughtful time half sheep cake will be very valuable to be going to leave for soldier if knew sir must have gone far among while will last time with care changed course several time a soon a became quite dark presently have satisfaction of hearing shout of pursuer fade away behind now can take quietly lad can guide towards sea by mean of star fancy must be fully twenty mile away must hold on till get to then gradually work way along among sand hill clump of bush bordering till come to village then must contrive to get good supply of food water steal boat make off if galley be sent out to search for must have given up long ago a for other craft will have to take chance with kept steadily north at last came down to coast a be still dark lay down till morning when sun rose thought must make out village eight mile away now will be quite safe to cook breakfast dimchurch said yes think so will answered must be sparing with mutton be only food at present may be little time before get hold of anything else after breakfast lay down among bush slept till evening then started along shore towards village when got within mile of halted must see boat on shore so felt that only difficulty in way be question of provision when be quite dark went into village started to forage on meeting again have very little to show between have managed to take five fowl village be evidently poor place for with exception of few melon there be fruit beggar must have grain somewhere said will ca live on fowl melon expect sir live very largely on fish be likely enough will agreed let put down fowl melon under bush have nap for couple of hour till be sure that everyone be asleep can then go down have look at boat of come in late may probably leave of catch on board when went down to boat found that three of contained fair quantity of fish helped to of then retreated distance from village picking up other provision on way then going into clump of bush cooked portion of fish that pretty well settle question of provision will said must choose night when there be good wind blowing offshore so that may run good many mile before morning then must trust to falling in with one of cruiser fish wo keep long in climate suggested tom said will can dry of in sun will then keep good for time then might clean dozen fowl cook before start great difficulty will be water yes can get over by stripping garden clean of melon weigh four five pound apiece must supply with fluid for week easily next evening went down made more careful examination of boat one in particular attracted attention be nearly new looked likely to be faster than rest be anchored fifty yard from shore three more evening be spent in prowling about village collecting food be evident that villager be alarmed at depredation for on third evening be fired at by several men in consequence of moved mile farther away in case search must be made next night carried provision down to shore a be expert swimmer be soon alongside chosen craft pushed provision before on small raft when have put on board made trip to one two of other boat brought away twenty pound of fish then cut hawser hoisted sail a did so heard great tumult on shore villager ran down to water edge opened fire upon shooting however be wild be very soon out of range several boat put off in pursuit caused uneasiness watched somewhat anxiously for wind though favourable be light felt by mean certain that must be able to keep ahead of rower stolen craft however proved unexpectedly fast boat after following fifteen mile without sensibly gaining at last gave up chase about time too wind to great relief became stronger little vessel flew more more rapidly over sea be fine craft dimchurch said moor certainly know how to build boat must require smart cutter to hold own with dimchurch kept at helm other two investigated capture be three part decked in cabin came upon lantern flint steel soon have light helped greatly in work in bow rope be stored away while in locker found bread although stale be very acceptable also unearthed two three suit of rough sea clothes with be glad to replace light clothes have carried away with from palace ground for though weather on shore be warm sea breeze be chilly among other useful thing also discovered several long knife ax flat stone for cooking upon now be question of luck will said danger will be greater when get bit farther out vessel going up down mediterranean give barbary coast wide berth of course pirate fellow be most numerous along line of traffic be to be found right up to spanish french italian coast though of late fancy have not be so active there be too many of cruiser about for taste spaniard when get chance show scoundrel mercy when morning broke not sail be visible think sir dimchurch said that there be going to be change of weather that be in for gale doe not matter much fancy boat must go through however severe might be yes sir must check progress want to run north a fast a can see by line be making that be aiming at toulon at present pace must take something like four day to get there if be caught in gale may take two day longer be so will agreed on other hand if wind becomes much stronger will have to take in sail in case must have more chance of escaping notice if come near of moorish craft besides if sea be really rough must be difficult for to board even if did come up with be right sir still for must prefer strong southerly wind clear sky well be afraid will not get wish for cloud certainly seem to be banking up from north will get change of wind ere long by night wind be blowing fiercely sea rapidly rising sail be closely reefed even then felt with pleasure that little craft be making good way wind increased during night be blowing gale by morning just at twelve o'clock craft be seen approaching be convinced be algerine changed course at once bore down upon firing gun a signal for to stop be rather faster than be dimchurch said will lead good dance before get hold of must not work gun in sea if be faster at least be handier for three hour chase continued again again algerine came up on time little boat turning almost on heel so cleverly be handled glided away from underneath enemy bow time when saw chase slipping away from angry moor sent volley of musketry after fugitive took refuge in cabin lay down on deck close under bulwark so escaped soon moor be so intent on chase that began to take great risk with own vessel in fact became positively reckless for paid very heavily after many disappointment felt that fugitive be at last in clutch be preparing to board when suddenly dimchurch put down helm sharply nearly capsized little craft indeed must rather have gone down with than fall into hand of moor again righted immediately once more skimmed away from pursuer in excitement of moment moorish steersman attempted same manoeuvre if have succeeded must probably have run down cockle shell have baffled so long at moment violent squall struck ship with full force mainmast snapped few foot above deck three fugitive jumped to foot cheered then calmly proceeded on way chapter xii back on tartar next morning broke fair late foe have dropped out of sight on previous evening now when sun rose tom made out top sail of large ship on horizon be coming towards lad by course be steering will pas within three mile of be english french be too far away yet to be certain dimchurch said ca help thinking be french at rate dimchurch best course will be to lower sail shake reef point out have ready for hoisting at moment notice now that wind be light again must fancy must get away from with start of two three mile must have chance whatever of catching suddenly tom stevens exclaimed there be sail coming up from behind look to close hauled if ship come on be bound to meet if one be french other be english be likely to have talk to other in case must be able to tell friend from foe by colour must then make for english ship sat anxiously watching two ship soon saw that point of meeting must be very near own position presently hull became visible dimchurch pronounced one to be thirty two gun frigate other forty forty two then made out that one coming up from south be flying white ensign at once hoisted sail made for equally intent upon fight two vessel approached other without paying slightest attention to little craft frenchman mean fighting a have ten gun to good may well think be more than match for ship do know dimchurch think be lysander sir though ca be sure there be so many of thirty two vessel a passed exchanged broadside then tacked englishman be quicker raked french frigate a came round then went at hammer tongs frenchman suffered very heavily in spar rigging at last foremast of english ship fell over side frenchman at once closed with after pouring in broadside tried to board little boat bore up to stern of english ship desperate conflict be going on at point failing to get up moved along side here rope have be cut by french fire be hanging overboard grasping climbed up to port hole deck be deserted hand having rushed up to meet attack of french boarder without moment delay snatched cutlass from rack ran up companion to upper deck here thing be going somewhat badly french be much more numerous than english be forcing back by sheer weight of number new comer rushed at once into fray laid about lustily force suddenness of onslaught caused enemy to hesitate at same time have effect of inspiring to fresh effort english crew who having lost captain first lieutenant be beginning to lose heart answered cheer of strangely clad ally with one accord charged to meet at moment dimchurch almost severed french captain head from body by sweeping blow french being disheartened by loss of leader gave way english sailor redoubled effort after ten minute of desperate fighting succeeded in driving foe back to own ship then men ran to gun again cannonade recommenced spirit of two crew have changed french be discouraged by failure british be exultant over success consequently gun of english ship be fired with far more rapidity precision than of french several of port hole of french ship be knocked into one when at last mainmast have be hit several time fell over side flag be run down amidst tremendous cheering from english ship immediately hand be engaged in disarming securing french prisoner when have be sent below deck of ship be cleared of dead then bulk of crew set to work to cut away wreckage secure damaged spar stop hole near water edge at last second lieutenant who be now in command have time to turn to stranger will be superintending work while dimchurch tom be working hand in hand with crew may ask said lieutenant addressing will who be have so mysteriously come to assistance certainly said will laughing have quite forgotten that be clothed in strange garment be midshipman belonging to tartar one of companion be boatswain mate other be ab on same ship be sent with lieutenant ten men to overhaul craft though be somewhat suspicious looking seemed to have small crew when got alongside however found to disgust that be manned by at least hundred algerines lieutenant seven of crew be killed three others two companion be made prisoner carried to algiers three escaped capturing small craft will see lying by side of ship made for open sea algerine nearly recaptured in gale yesterday fortunately carried away mast again escaped morning saw two ship approaching when made out nationality knew there be bound to be fight naturally made for ship when found that french have boarded did best to aid to drive back name be gilmore well mr gilmore have to thank most heartily for very efficacious aid have rendered thing be going very badly unexpected appearance strange attire strength bravery with fought quite turned table think said with laugh french must have taken for three devil come to assistance certainly must not have fought harder if have be will hope give assistance until reach to port of course will carry prize third lieutenant be severely wounded have lost two of midshipman certainly sir will place at once under order two midshipman who have fallen be senior lieutenant said a must be two three year older than others will appoint acting lieutenant first duty here will be to rig up jury foremast will appoint however temporary commander of camille be see name of prize can only spare forty men have lost forty three killed at least a many wounded have therefore only hundred ten altogether fit for service must retain seventy for work of refitting must not attempt to get up jury mainmast on camille will be better to clear away wreckage secure other two mast in case meet with squall understand sir if of midshipman have be killed be about size must be glad to rig out with suit from chest for appearance at present be rather undignified for british officer must also be glad if purser clerk must issue couple of suit for two men may tell that have be with in ship in have served indeed entered navy with therefore regard quite a personal friend bigger of two held position of boatswain under in small craft of have command in west indie a well a on tartar very well then by mean give temporary rank of boatswain on board camille can appoint other a boatswain mate thank sir be very much obliged must be difficult to find two better men in ten minute will be attired in midshipman uniform two companion to great relief in clothes of british seaman then crossed to camille with forty men whom lieutenant have told off a prize crew work be at once begun before sundown fore mizzen mast be a firmly secured a if mainmast be still in place will felt that must now meet storm without uneasiness next morning repair to hull be begun piece of plank covered with tarred canvas being nailed over shot hole ere day be done camille have fairly presentable appearance meanwhile crew of

when must have have so many senior midshipman to select from what have done be really nothing sir be lying off pirate stronghold must not get at a ship be too deep for willow approach in course of conversation in midshipman mess happened to suggest that if got hold of native craft might be able to beard lion in den one of elder midshipman reported idea to one of lieutenant who passed on to captain who put into execution result be that captured two vessel very large amount of plunder have stored on island got great deal more credit than be due to for have only suggested plan when joking

rate mr gilmore be by mean to blame in affair congratulate on having effected escape with two follower have only rejoined tartar short time when on th february captain be signalled to proceed with small squadron be to sail under captain linzee of alcide a commodore to corsica where force under general paoli have asked for assistance in endeavour to regain freedom chief stronghold of island be fortified town of san fiorenzo bastia calvi town be near other a troop scornfully rejected summons to surrender commodore be placed in difficulty force under command be not strong enough to blockade three fort at once while be so near other that to blockade one two leave entrance to other open must have be useless determined at first to take forneilli fortified place two mile from san fiorenzo when opened attack found that be so much more strongly fortified than have anticipated that capture must not be effected without more loss than gain of position must justify lord hood then placed squadron of frigate under captain nelson command to cruise off north western coast of island so a to prevent supply being introduced also sailed there with of seventy four body of soldier under major general dundas before arrived nelson have done something towards facilitating enterprise for having learned that french in san fiorenzo drew supply of flour from mill near shore landed body of seaman soldier burnt mill threw into sea flour contained in in large storehouse close to regained ship without loss of man when lord hood arrived ordered nelson to land on island to prevent supply from getting into bastia took charge of siege of san fiorenzo on way nelson captured town of maginaggio routed garrison destroyed great quantity of provision be being prepared for number of french vessel in harbour lord hood commenced siege by attacking town of mortella garrison fought with great bravery inflicted heavy loss upon fortitude seventy four gun to task of battering be assigned a be evidently getting worst of fortitude be withdrawn shore battery be more successful place being set on fire garrison surrendered convention redoubt be next place to be attacked be fortified in most formidable manner indeed be so strongly constructed a to withstand ordinary attack short distance away however be rock rising seven hundred foot above level of sea entirely commanded enemy have left unfortified unguarded because believed be inaccessible in many place be almost perpendicular though there be path leading to summit be in very few place wide enough to allow more than one person to ascend at time admiral hood in person reconnoitred decided that battery must be formed on summit next day will be on shore in command of party of thirty men who be to start getting up gun sailor looked at rock at gun in dismay la mr gilmore one of said can never get up there in first place be too steep in second be too rough must take two hundred men to do even must not be much good for path wind twist so much that must not put strength on together will looked at path at hill on new battery be to be formed see sir said path must have to be blasted in lot of place to make room for gun have got tool for job will did not answer saw that what men said be correct presently however eye fell upon empty rum puncheon at once thought flashed back to west indie wheel that puncheon here men much surprised men did a be ordered now knock out end when have tightened hoop again fill barrel about third full with stick grass bit of wood anything can come across men scattered at once to collect ballast with doubt in mind a to whether midshipman have not gone out of sens in about fifteen minute have carried out instruction dismount gun then ordered put inside barrel when have with difficulty be accomplished barrel surrounded centre of gun said now fill up barrel with rest of rubbish sailor have now caught idea very soon have gun tightly packed into novel carriage two long rope be then passed round puncheon end being carried little way up hill formed parbuckle when men hauled upon upper length of rope cask easily rolled up to end of lower length operation be repeated again again gradually cask moved up rock at place have to be hauled up lengthways board being placed underneath to give smooth surface over to glide instead of rough rock men encouraging from behind with lever while be at work nelson came up stood watching for minute without speaking where did learn how to do that said to will at last heard of at siege of st pierre sir well profited by lesson be pleasure to see young fellow use wit in way for sharpness question whether must ever have got gun up there be looking at yesterday doubted then whether be at practicable have settled question for will not forget what be name sir gilmore of tartar nelson made note of walked away work took two day of tremendous labour seaman being relieved three time day will be constantly on spot directing superintending operation have satisfaction at last of seeing six gun placed on summit of rock next morning besieged be astonished when gun opened fire upon from rock for path being at back have not seen what be going on a must obtain shelter from attack there be possibility of silencing gun hastily abandoned post retreated on san fiorenzo battery on rock however also commanded town accordingly have to be abandoned on following day garrison retiring to adjoining ridge of ground to bastia be considered strongest place in island capture of san fiorenzo be more valuable inasmuch a in harbour be two frigate minerve la fortunee of became prize minerve thirty eight gun be sunk by french be weighed by men taken into service when be renamed san fiorenzo nelson be immensely pleased with manner in operation of getting gun up rock have be performed requested captain of tartar will must be permanently stationed on shore to act a own aide de camp request be of course complied with in meantime nelson have reconnoitred bastia neighbouring coast recommended that troop cannon be disembarked for be convinced that land force of about thousand in co operation with few ship must be sufficient to reduce place unfortunately general commanding troop be one of most irresolute of men when after few day resigned command in consequence of difference with lord hood successor general d'aubant be still more incapable pronounced at once that though force at command be almost double that nelson asked for be insufficient for work required of nelson burning with indignation decided that attempt to take bastia must be made that if army must not do navy must lord hood agreed with even when be decided to undertake siege d'aubant insisted on doing without single soldier single cannon retiring to san fiorenzo kept men inactive while sailor be performing work on th of february fortified town of mareno little to north of bastia be captured four day later reconnaissance be made nelson ship agamemnon be supported by tartar frigate romulus a passed slowly in front of town thirty gun opened upon with shot shell nelson lowered sail for hour three quarter peppered fort so warmly that at last french garrison deserted gun one battery containing six gun be totally destroyed citizen of bastia be eager to surrender governor declared that must blow up city if such step be taken two day later nelson be preparing to repeat blow sudden calm set in must not get near town in short time opportunity for carrying place by assault passed away a french officer be indefatigable in strengthening fortification soon rendered town practically impregnable nelson however maintained blockade in spite of heavy weather in middle of march provision be so short in place that pound of bread be selling for crown nelson be almost a much straitened for provision admiral contrived to send supply nelson pitched tent on shore personally superintended operation considerable body of seaman be landed worked like horse dragging gun up height that appeared inaccessible making road cutting down tree with to build abattis chapter xiii with nelson one day during siege nelson said to will will be glad mr gilmore if will accompany on excursion along shore have eye on spot from if must get gun up to must be able to command town from what have seen of believe know more about mounting gun than anyone here so will be glad to have opinion of position will of course expressed willingness to go at once started in gig rowed on for time keeping sharp look out for suitable landing place at last nelson bade men lie on oar pointed to ridge of have spoken well what do say asked after will have made careful examination of from boat be afraid must not be possible sir to carry out plan labour of getting gun up from shore must be enormous considering rugged state of country question if must be taken across to ridge when be up no agree with did not examine so closely before at rate underhanded a be must not spare enough men for business may a well however row bit along shore be convinced that if must land three four hundred men within five six mile of town attack simultaneously on side must carry without much trouble french have be fighting well must have be losing heart for time frenchman hate to be cornered a see battery rising can not feel sooner later must give in fancy by time be asking other what use be to keep on being killed when must surrender in end have rowed on for couple of hour without fixing on suitable place when nelson exclaimed be going to be caught in fog be distinctly unpleasant have compass in boat said turning to coxswain sir thought be only going to row out to ship did not think of bringing one with never forget compass man nelson said for though sky may be blue when start sudden storm may overtake blow far from ship however ca be helped now in le than ten minute boat be enveloped in dense fog position be decidedly awkward have there be wind must have steered by sound of surf breaking at foot of cliff sea be absolutely calm must hear nothing rowed on for time then nelson said lay in oar men may be pulling in wrong direction for know will have to remain here till fog lift even if take week to clear be northerly fog said to will cold wind come down from alp condenses when reach sea fog be not very common sometimes last for considerable time afternoon passed presently night fell there be food of kind in boat men chewed quid two officer must not indulge in relief at night nelson will wrapped in boat cloak made a comfortable a must getting uneasy snatch of sleep morning broke there be change white wall of fog rose round boat be awkward nelson said wish one of battery must fire few gun might give indication a to position though be by mean sure that in thick atmosphere sound must reach so far think be about eleven mile away when fog caught in afternoon breeze sprang up god grant that may continue nelson said slight a be two three hour of might raise swell might then hear wash of wave on rock hour after hour passed at last coxswain said think hear faint sound over on right have thought so little time will said must not speak until be sure out oar nelson ordered row in direction sound became more more distinct a proceeded soon be satisfied that be heading for land in quarter of hour boat ran up on sandy beach have not seen spot before must therefore be farther away from town than point have reached a have be nearly twenty four hour in fog current may have taken good many mile however will land be parched with thirst must be same lad leave two men in boat rest of will go in search of water bring down to left behind when find think have better scatter look for way up cliff if can find path must follow until come to house other where there be house there must be water mr gilmore will go to right if of find water shout will do same whether find water not come down to boat in three hour time thirsty not thirsty must row back to town evening now mr gilmore will walk along beach until come to path at rate place where can climb hope a get higher fog will become le dense for hour groped way along foot of cliff then finding place where seemed not so steep a elsewhere began to climb when have reached height of three four hundred foot emerged from fog into bright sunshine below stretched white misty lake on side rose hill above hill for most part covered to top by foliage see smoke rising from among tree over there to right sir mile mile half away will take word for mr gilmore a know sight be not at all in good condition let be off at once for very thought of water make thirstier than ever hour walking brought to hut of peasant owner came to door a approached be rough looking man in long jacket made of goat skin coarse trouser reaching down to knee leg bound with long strip of wadding who be asked in own language how come here a neither of officer understood one word of patois of country must only make sign that wanted something to eat drink peasant understood beckoned to to come into hut a entered gave instruction to boy who went out presently returned with jug of water while officer be quenching thirst boy went out again man brought from cupboard black bread goat milk cheese set before altogether like man movement sir crawl about a if be trying to put away a much time a possible boy too have disappeared perhaps have gone to get more water nelson suggested must have gone dozen time by now sir be possible that take for french officer peasant living in such spot a sixteen twenty mile from town might not even know that there be english troop in country having satisfied hunger thirst tried to make man understand that be willing to buy bread cheese have together with large jar for carrying water man showed prodigious amount of stupidity although eye glistened when nelson produced gold still seemed unable to understand that having have a much a must eat wanted to buy more at last nelson in passion said look here man there be sovereign be worth at least twenty time miserable store of bread cheese if choose to accept money need will take food whether pointed to store a spoke there be sound of footstep outside moment later door be darkened by entry of dozen wild figure who flung upon two officer before have time to make effort to defend in vain nelson attempted in french italian to make understood men must not listen poured out objurgation upon whenever attempted to speak word francais frequently occurred in speech mixed up with what be evidently expression of hatred be awkward mr gilmore nelson said quietly a lay bound together in corner of hut more unpleasant situation be never in be in one a bad once before be captured by band of negro in cuba be preparing to burn alive when managed to escape must not be at surprised if be what gentleman be preparing to do now gilmore be sorry have brought into can not be helped sir will said cheerfully if do kill loss to nation will be a nothing compared with yours there be doubt take for french officer who have lost way in mountain be preparing to punish for misdeed of supposed countryman there be only two thing must help out of plight so far a can see one be arrival of priest suppose have priest hereabouts with knowledge of french italian other be appearance on scene of boat crew be very unlikely be crew know went other way yes sir be just possible that may have seen smoke of hut also be making way here though looked carefully on side must see other sign of life be possible nelson said for part think priest more likely solution if there be to be solution well be comfort to know that have eaten hearty meal will not die hungry thirsty be foolish of to come up here alone knowing what wild savage people in mountain be must have be better to have gone on suffering ten twelve hour longer to have made way to fleet by following close in by foot of rock think must have done in time sir must have have to keep within oar length of rock so must have progressed very slowly besides might have staved in boat at moment be so still be only drifting for about twenty four hour must have taken so long to go back even twenty four hour of hunger thirst must have be better than be useless however to think of now in meantime men be engaged in noisy talk one apparently urging own view at last seemed to come to agreement four of going to corner dragged two officer to foot hauled out of cottage then bound to tree seven eight foot apart piled faggot round when be done amused by dancing wildly round prisoner taunting heaping execration upon sooner come to end better nelson said quietly well mr gilmore have satisfaction of knowing that have done duty to country after make great difference to man whether dy in battle be burnt except that burning method last little longer wo last long in case fancy do notice that faggot be lately cut will probably be suffocated before flame touch see that sir be very grateful for dance be finished two men brought brand from cottage listen mr gilmore said nelson at moment think can hear footstep be sure heard branch crack brand be applied to faggot be so green that at first must not catch at several of peasant rushed into cottage be returning with larger brand when figure suddenly appeared at edge of little clearing in direction from nelson have heard sound stood silent for minute looking at scene then with loud shout rushed forward with drawn cutlass attacked native four five of peasant be cut down remainder fled in terror thank god honour have arrived in time coxswain said a cut nelson bond while sailor liberated will thank god indeed now lad have not moment to lose fellow be sure to gather number of comrade at nearest village have wish to see more of go into hut will find enough bread cheese there to give meal there be spring of water close by sailor scattered at once be not long in discovering spring there knelt down drank long deeply then went into cottage devoured bread cheese although far from being sufficient to satisfy at least appeased hunger for time after have finished went back to spring for drink then taking bread cheese large jug of water for boat keeper followed nelson will from place have so nearly proved fatal to officer went down hill at brisk pace until reached top of fog after proceeded more cautiously have longer fear of pursuit for once in fog must require army to find at last reached strand found boat when two men who have be left in charge have finished share of food water nelson said now lad must row on if keep close to foot of rock be within fifty yard of noise of wave breaking will be sufficient guide to prevent getting too far out to sea may be so bold a to ask how far will have to row coxswain said be more than can tell may be little over eleven mile may be twice even three time that distance now however that have have something to eat drink can certainly row on until reach ship that can sir feel like new men again though did feel mighty bad before so did lad now be of use trying to row racing pace take long quiet stroke hour two rest for few minute will be dark before very long nelson remarked quietly to will when men began to row fortunately will make difference to a be guided not by eye by ear there be more wind than there be on still night like can hear wave against rock mile out so there be fear of losing way will be hard indeed if reach ship before daylight boat be travelling about four knot hour if current have not carried good deal farther than imagine five six hour ought to take there hour passed slowly sometimes men have to row distance seaward to avoid projecting headland at last however about twelve o'clock will exclaimed hear ripple sir like water against bow of ship easy nelson said at once order be obeyed listened intently presently there be general exclamation a sound of footstep be heard ahead be marine pacing up down on sentry give way lad in few minute black mass rose up close in front of coxswain put helm down boat glided along side of ship a did so there came sharp challenge of sentry who go there answer fire be all right man be captain nelson wait till call watch captain nelson sentry replied in monotonous voice of kind very well sentry be quite right to do duty in minute officer voice be heard above lantern be shown over side be sir asked yes what ship be romulus can lend compass yes sir will fetch one in moment thank nelson said when officer returned with instrument have lost bearing in fog want to get to tent on shore know exact bearing however from ship twenty minute row brought to landing place nelson first thought be for crew going to storehouse close at hand knocked of people up saw that be supplied with plenty of food drink then went into tent here table be spread with various kind of food standing on servant being called up kettle be boiled will sat down to hearty meal do know what have be said about in absence chamfrey nelson asked servant sir everything have be upset by fog sent down from battery to enquire where mr gilmore be must only say that supposed be on board ship sent from ship to ask must only say that did know supposed that be somewhere up in battery thought when did not return afternoon that have lost way in fog one seemed to think that anything serious must have happened to nelson got up went to where boat crew be sitting after having finished meal coxswain here be two guinea for guinea for of men now want man of to keep mouth tightly shut about what have happened promise that if man blabs will be turned out of gig understand yes sir replied together can trust to keep mouth shut will never say word about be good thing nelson remarked when returned to will if what have happened came to be known must get abused by lord hood for having gone so far away run so great risk of course a be aware there must have be risk at if fog have not set in have not forgotten to bring compass know naval man be supposed to foresee everything must have be blamed just a much a if have rowed into fog on purpose must have have captain in fleet remonstrating with must be saying ' knew nelson way be always running about that must get into scrape other one of day report indeed might be sent to england enormously magnified of course with heading nelson lost in fog nelson roasted alive by corsican brigand must not have news get about for five hundred guinea suppose absence be noticed first day be known of course went off in gig a sometimes sleep here sometimes on board ship fact be not in place must not cause surprise a for to day if question be asked will simply say that lost way in fog did not return here until late at night tale will have advantage of being true may be sure sir that word will pas lip on matter be quite sure of mr gilmore will never forget danger have shared together how well bore terrible trial will always regard a one of closest comrade friend when time come will do best to further interest have not much power at present a one of lord hood captain time may come when will be able to do something for can assure that when opportunity arrives will need reminder of promise by th of april three battery be completed at once opened fire on town garrison vigorously replied with hot shot set fire to ship have be converted into battery still d'aubant remained inactive sailor fired with indignation worked even harder than before nelson now felt confident of success predicted that place must fall between th th of may prediction be fulfilled almost to letter for at four o'clock on afternoon of th boat came out from town to victory offering to surrender afternoon general d'aubant having received reinforcement from gibraltar arrived from san fiorenzo only to find that work have pronounced impracticable have be done without assistance will have spent whole of time during siege on shore have laboured incessantly in getting gun up to position have be placed in command of one of battery nelson specially recommended for service lord hood mentioned in despatch to admiralty at home sooner have bastia fallen than admiral determined to besiege calvi one french stronghold left in island news came however that part of french fleet have broken out of toulon lord hood at once started in pursuit leaving nelson to conduct operation taking troop be now commanded by general stuart man of very different stamp from d'aubant nelson landed on th june without opposition at narrow inlet three mile half from town body of seaman be also landed under will instantly began a at bastia to get gun up hill to form battery enemy be strongly protected with four outlying fort there be also in harbour two french frigate melpomene mignonne proceeding resembled at work accomplished be tremendous battery sprang up a if by magic at end of june lord hood returned from watching french work proceeded even more vigorously than before a at bastia nelson animated men by energy example be wounded by stone be driven up by shot striking ground close to lost sight of right eye for ever although suffering be very severe must not interrupt labour for single day presently battery opened fire one by one outlying fort be stormed town attacked at last on st of august enemy proposed capitulation be granted to on term if toulon fleet did not arrive in seven day must lay down arm surrender two frigate toulon fleet be however in position to risk battle with lord hood powerful squadron accordingly on th garrison surrendered marched out of great gate of town with honour of war nelson be exultant at thought that capture of town a well a bastia be achievement of sailor that battery have be constructed by gun dragged up by with exception only of single artillery man gun also fought by will gained very great credit by work have natural gift for handling heavy weight have thoroughly learnt lesson that power endurance of english sailor must surmount obstacle appeared insuperable chapter xiv glorious first of june be while besieging calvi that news came of great sea battle fought in channel by lord howe very much interested be sailor on shore in corsica at hearing detail of victory vast fleet have assembled at spithead under command of veteran lord howe have two object in view besides primary one of engaging enemy first convoying of east west india newfoundland merchant fleet clear of channel next of intercepting french convoy returning from america laden with produce of west india island

rainier with two battle ship four frigate lord howe now proceeded to ushant where discovered by mean of frigate that enemy fleet be quietly anchored in harbour of brest therefore proceeded in search of american convoy after cruising in various direction for nearly fortnight returned to ushant on th may only to find brest harbour be empty news be obtained from american vessel that french fleet have sailed from harbour few day before afterwards turned out that two fleet have passed quite close to other unseen owing to dense fog prevailed at time be exactly same strength in number french carried much heavier gun crew exceeded ours by three thousand men for more than week two fleet cruised about in bay of biscay taking many prize without meeting at last early on morning of th of may came in sight of other french be to windward having strong south west wind with came down rapidly towards a if anxious to fight presently shortened sail formed line of battle howe signalled to prepare for battle having come on to same tack a french stood towards having on weather quarter soon however french tacked seemed to retreat general chase be ordered english ship went off in pursuit under full sail between two three o'clock russell be fastest of seventy four began to exchange shot with french towards evening seventy four bellerophon began close action with revolutionnaire one hundred ten gun bellerophon soon lost main top mast dropped back fight with great ship be taken up first by leviathan afterwards by audacious seventy four supported by two others fought for three hour by time revolutionnaire have mast carried away great damage done to yard have lost four hundred men when darkness fell be complete wreck be confidently expected that in morning must fall into hand at break of day however french admiral sent down ship took in tow for other mast have fallen during night succeeded in taking in safety to rochefort audacious have suffered so severely in unequal fight that be obliged to return to plymouth to repair damage during night hostile fleet steered under press of canvas on parallel course when daylight broke be still a near together a on previous day firing be of desultory character lord howe effort to bring on general engagement being thwarted by of ship misunderstanding signal next day be one of intense fog on st weather cleared fleet towards evening be le than five mile apart general action might have be brought on lord howe preferred to wait till daylight when signal must more easily be made out admiral be surprised that none of french ship showed damage from action of th be afterwards found that have since be joined by four fresh ship that vessel have suffered most have be sent into brest during st various manoeuvre have be performed ended by giving weather gage next morning st of june lord howe signalled that intended to attack enemy that ship be to steer for one opposed to in line ship be arranged so that vessel must be opposite one of equal size defence led attack came under heavy fire admiral ship queen charlotte pressed forward replying with quarter deck gun only to fire of of french ship assailed a advanced keeping fire of main deck gun for french admiral whom intended to attack so close compact however be french line that be easy matter to pas through a queen charlotte came under stern of montagne poured in tremendous fire from starboard gun at such close quarter that rigging of two vessel be touching jacobin next ship to montagne shifted position took up that queen charlotte have intended to occupy lord howe then engaged two vessel fire be so quick that ere long have to fall out of fight furious combat followed between queen charlotte juste in latter be totally dismasted former lost main topmast a have previously lost fore topmast became totally unmanageable thus almost single handed save for distant fire of invincible lord howe fought three powerful ship at time fourth adversary appeared in republicain one hundred ten gun carrying flag of rear admiral bouvet just a be going to engage however gibraltar poured in broadside bringing down main mizzen mast of frenchman who bore up passed under stern of queen charlotte so great be confusion on board that neglected to rake flagship montagne followed by jacobin now crowded on sail lord howe thinking intended to escape gave order for general chase be joined by nine other ship wore round sailed towards queen craft be almost defenceless owing to loss of mainmast mizzen topmast seeing danger lord howe signalled to ship to close round wore round stood to assistance be followed by five other battle ship admiral villaret joyeuse gave up attempt sailed to help own crippled ship taking five of in tow made off six french battle ship be captured vengeur have be engaged in desperate fight with brunswick went down ten minute after surrendered british loss in battle of st of june in preliminary skirmish of th th of may be eleven hundred forty eight of whom two hundred ninety be killed eight hundred fifty eight wounded french placed loss in killed mortally wounded at three thousand so that total loss must not have be much under seven thousand decisive a victory be be general opinion in fleet that more ought to have be done that five disabled ship must have be taken hot chase instituted after flying enemy indeed only explanation of inactivity be that admiral who be now old man be so enfeebled exhausted by strain through have gone a to be incapable of coming to decision of giving order one of most desperate combat in battle be that took place between brunswick seventy four gun under captain john harvey vengeur also seventy four brunswick have not be engaged in battle of th th of may played brilliant part on st of june be exposed to heavy fire a fleet bore down to attack suffered loss before have fired shot steered for interval between achille vengeur former vessel at once took up position closing gap captain harvey then ran foul of vengeur anchor hooking in port fore channel of frenchman two ship now swung close alongside of other paying off before wind ran out of line pouring broadside into other furiously upper deck gun of vengeur got better of of brunswick killing several officer men wounding captain harvey so severely a to compel to go below at moment achille bore down on brunswick quarter be received by tremendous broadside brought down remaining mast foremast wreck prevented achille from firing surrendered a brunswick be too busy to attend to hoisted sprit sail sail put up under bowsprit endeavoured to make off meantime brunswick vengeur fast locked continued desperate duel upper deck gun of former be almost silenced on lower deck advantage be other way alternately depressing elevating gun to utmost extent british sailor fired through enemy bottom ripped up deck captain harvey who have returned to deck be again knocked down by splinter continued to direct operation till be struck in right arm so severely injured a to force to give up command now devolved on lieutenant cracroft who however continued to fight ship a captain have done after being for three hour entangled two ship separated vengeur tearing away brunswick anchor a drifted apart well aimed shot from brunswick smashed enemy rudder post knocked large hole in counter at moment ramillies sailing up opened fire at forty yard distance at particular hole in few minute reduced vengeur to sinking condition then proceeded to chase achille vengeur now surrendered brunswick however must render assistance boat being damaged hoisting what sail must headed northward with intention of making for port during fight brunswick lost mizzen have other mast badly damaged rigging sail cut to piece twenty three gun dismounted lost three officer forty one men killed captain second lieutenant one midshipman one hundred ten men wounded captain harvey only survived wound few month greater portion of crew of vengeur be taken off by boat of alfred culloden rattler sank before must be rescued two hundred of crew most of whom be wounded be drowned among survivor be captain renaudin son be ignorant of rescue of other when met by chance at joy can be better imagined than described tartar returned to blockade of toulon after work in corsica be done when have be there time be ordered to cruise on coast where there be several fort under french coasting vessel ran for shelter when saw english sail approaching be if possible to destroy there be one especially on one of isle d'hyeres tartar be particularly ordered to silence a more than other be resort of coaster tartar sailed in near enough to to exchange shot so got idea of work have to undertake then having learned must stood out to sea again preparation be made during day for landing arm be distributed men told off to boat after again sailed in arrived off fort about midnight boat have already be lowered men took place in while tartar be still moving through water dividing into three party made respectively for three principal battery dimchurch be not in boat in will have place a rowed stroke of first gig will be in launch tom be also in boat be in same division light be to be seen absolute silence reigned noiselessly men landed formed up on beach to reach battery have to climb cliff by zigzag pathway up be obliged to go in single file arrived at summit without apparently creating suspicion of presence then advanced at run suddenly three blue light gleamed out illuminating whole of ground have to traverse at same moment tremendous volley be fired from battery simultaneously fire opened from other battery showing that boat crew have arrived just at same instant that while french be supposed to be asleep be awake vigilant indeed from heaviness of fire there be little question that force on island have be heavily reinforced from mainland number of men fell nevertheless sailor rushed forward fearlessly reached foot of fort be too high to be climbed so separating ran round to endeavour to effect entrance elsewhere suddenly be met by considerable body of troop first lieutenant who commanded division whistled order for sailor to fall back be done at first slowly in sort of order fire kept up on be so hot that be compelled to increase pace to run stand be made at top of pas a here men be only able to retreat in single file

lieutenant somerville said when have finished now feel that can in emergency depend upon to second can assure be by mean commonly case for promotion go so much by influence such incapable men be pushed up in service that be comfort indeed to have officer who know work thoroughly hope to goodness will have captain so fine ship deserves hope so indeed sir have hitherto be extremely fortunate in having good captain a good a one must wish for be fortunate indeed then have be under two three men who either from ignorance ill temper sheer indifference have be enough to take heart entirely out of

have pleasure in making acquaintance saw admiral morning assured must not wish for better officer hope will get on pleasantly together can assure that if will not be fault have a fine ship a men must wish to sail in will guarantee that will not find slack in using a may guess by age owe present position partly to family interest object will be to prove that interest have not be altogether misplaced have already have command of frigate have full share of hard service be afraid that with seventy four will not have quite so many opportunity of distinguishing ourselves will generally have to work with fleet fight when other people bid not merely when see good chance there be however a much credit if not a much prize money to be gained in pitched battle a in isolated action be kindly permitted by admiral to read record of service can not say how gratified be to find have two such able active officer to second be sure be much obliged to sir lieutenant somerville replied for speaking to a have done can answer for that will second to very best of power be glad indeed to find that have commander whose sentiment so entirely accord with own now gentleman have done with formality let crack bottle of wine together to better acquaintance hope will very often see at table on board for while feel that discipline must be maintained have belief in captain holding entirely aloof from officer a if be little god on quarter deck captain must stand somewhat aloof in own cabin can not see why must not treat officer a gentleman like sat chatted for hour when left lieutenant somerville said to will if be not much mistaken will have very pleasant time on board jason believe captain charteris mean word say that be thoroughly good fellow have very pleasant face though firm resolute one when give order will have to be obeyed promptly be man who will make allowance think cat will be very often brought into requisition on board one day will be sauntering down high street

to wait bit till saw one to suit see sir that have shipped swab mean of course that have got lieutenancy congratulate indeed sir on promotion yes got month ago to fine ship jason be fine ship sir mistake tom be watching lying out in harbour yesterday be saying that though have always be accustomed to frigate must not mind shipping in if found out something about captain well can tell dimchurch that be just man must like to serve under young dashing must say good officer fine fellow who be first lieutenant sir because matter almost a much a captain be good fellow too dimchurch man who love

lying hid not because want to serve because want good ship good captain when tell that be fine ship good captain good first second will jump at dimchurch be a good a word following week persuaded thirty first class seaman to sign on at same time sir said a went towards harbour must rather have be frigate one have always chance of picking up something then a one get sent about on expedition while on battle ship one be just stuck blockading be just what think tom said there be boat expedition chance of picking up prize two three day of chasing pirate still though tartar be frigate did not have much fun in except when be on shore be good enough though must not have be half so good if sailor have not done alone wanted to show redcoat what british seaman must do when be on metal know never worked half so hard in life well quite agree with be more pleasant commanding small craft than being second officer in large one although must say must not have have more pleasant captain first lieutenant than have now if have picked out from whole fleet be sorry can not get leave at present for want to make research about father according to what lawyer said be likely to be long job hope however to get well in trim on next spell ashore make really difference to now who what father be have good position what with prize money made before will gain now by share of sale of frigate took at corsica to say nothing of gun store captured have more than enough to satisfy want have done extraordinarily well too mr gilmore dimchurch said took advice tom have put prize money aside have over thousand saved have quite sufficient to keep in idleness life even if never do stroke of work again mr somerville on will recommendation at once appointed dimchurch boatswain soon proved thoroughly

commissioned complement of jason be complete be ordered to proceed to west indie to place made fast passage to disappointment fell in with none of enemy cruiser on way voyage however sufficed to give crew confidence in commander be prompt quick in giving order at same time pleasant in manner paid far more attention than most captain to comfort of crew while insisted upon most perfect order discipline abstained from giving unnecessary work in case where punishment be absolutely necessary punished severely when be at possible let delinquent off with lecture so while be feared by rougher spirit of crew be regarded with liking respect by good men on arrival at carlisle bay barbados found that be in time to join naval expedition whose object be to recover island of st lucia st vincent grenada have be captured by french previous year fleet have be sent from england under command of rear admiral christian consisting of two ship of line five frigate convoying large fleet of transport

credit while poor beggar do greater part of work soldier be well enough in way be very little good for hard work how do account for sir can only suppose dimchurch that while get a much food a do have nothing like same amount of hard work to do be sir why look at at portsmouth just go out of morning drill on common for bit then have nothing else to do day to stroll about town talk to girl how can

cooped up on board ship for month with nothing to keep in health certainly exercise while be constantly doing hard work if be to put men into sailor clothes give sailor work for six month must be just a strong useful well sir if be sort of men why do go enlist in army instead of becoming sailor stand to reason that be because know that can not do work why dimchurch have heard that in great town girl think a much of soldier a of sailor well that show how little know about in seaport what girl must look at soldier if be pretty enough to get sailor for sweetheart be prejudiced beggar will

with father at about time of marriage in case must probably come up to london have observed that most men who quarrel with parent take step first there perhaps endeavoured to obtain employment struggle must probably last two three four year take last to be most likely period for by time must be about three year old say that because must hardly have taken with have be younger be evident that have hope of being reconciled to father that be too angry to make advance therefore propose to send men north from london to enquire upon principal road man with violin little child can not have be altogether forgotten in village in stopped hope to be able to trace way up to yorkshire again must employ one of bow street runner to make enquiry in london for man with wife child who lived here so many year ago whose name be gilmore be supposing see that be real name not one that have assumed confess have doubt about man who quits home for ever after desperate quarrel be a likely a not to

archer used very word mr palethorpe have uttered be of use talking in way will said doubt have have very good fortune rapid promotion can only be due to conduct courage may have conducted well said warmly not one bit better than other officer in service really owe success to fortunate suggestion of mine a to best method of attacking pirate hold a reward for admiral gave command of l'agile so piece by piece have grown be to good fortune in making suggestion really be not made in earnest only in reply to challenge of midshipman that have come about above mr archer will never forget that be kindness showed pain took in education gave start in life next day drove over to scarcombe to pleasure on entering cottage found john wife sitting just where have last seen rose to greet thank god

half year ago in london father have come over here to live have fine house at dulwich have just be staying there for week have hope that when ask will consent to be wife of course will old woman said quite indignantly how must do otherwise why if be to ask king daughter be sure must take here be one of king captain have done sort of wonderful thing have beaten enemy over world be a straight good looking young gentleman a anyone want to see one who be not out of mind must think of saying 'no to ah mother be prejudiced to be sort of swan have come out of duck egg chatted for time then will said

rafter on have so long lain then carefully wiped dust off look very old thing that make difference in value to see in least how can be clue to father identity still will take away with show to lawyer who be endeavouring to trace for who father be do think that will succeed will rather believe will at rate have found gentleman baronet who have same name bear same coat of arm a be on seal be in father bundle be trying now to trace how father came down here where lived before started see must get a clear story a can before go to see gentleman mind want anything from may be a rich a lord for anything care may refuse to have anything to do with want to find out to what family really belong must be bad lot john said to allow father to tramp about country with fiddle must not say will said there be always two side to story know nothing of father reason for leaving home may have be fault more than father so until know right wrong of case will form judgment whatever be right boy old woman said have noticed that when boy run away from home go to sea be a often fault a father sometimes be six of one dozen of other sometimes father be brute more often son be scamp worthless fellow who will settle down to nothing brings discredit on family so be quite right will not to form hard judgment on grandfather till know how came about certainly mean to mother of course have so little recollection of father that must not worry much if found that be fault though of course must rather know that be not to blame still must wish to like grandfather if must if heard that poor father be really entirely to blame must not grieve much over ca help thinking that be to blame will be curious looking man with very bitter expression at time on face a if did care for anyone in world except perhaps often left alone in village when went wandered about by on moor well well will said matter very little to way be be very old story now dare say that there be fault on side will spent long day with old people then returned to scarborough taking violin with when told how have found mr archer took instrument examined carefully think really said at last that violin may prove valuable clue a valuable almost a coat of arm might very well have be picked up bought for trifle at pawnshop come into hand of possessor in accidental way be different unless be greatly mistaken be real amati therefore worth at least couple of hundred guinea must hardly have come accidentally into hand of wandering musician must be relic of time when be in very different circumstance may well have be before left home of childhood thank very much for information mr archer see at once that may very well be strong link in chain two day later returned to london mr palethorpe be greatly pleased to hear that have found so valuable clue care rap for family said at same time suppose man must like daughter here stopped abruptly mean to say said must like to have for son in law man of good family grant that be very stupid prejudice still suppose be general one told think that lawyer have found out that sir ralph gilmore have only two son one of have died suddenly unmarried be so sir then in case see if prove identity must certainly be heir to baronetcy suppose so sir have never given matter thought be not rank want family still might not be heir to baronetcy for even supposing that father be really other son might have have child older than be who remained with grandfather be possible mr palethorpe said though unlikely why must have left behind when went out into world might not have wished to bother with might have intended to claim later one can say well on whole must say that chance of coming into baronetcy be distinctly good must look well know captain sir william gilmore rn must count chicken too soon mr palethorpe will laughed nevertheless do think that prospect be favourable still must wait result of search that lawyer have be carrying on well know house be home a long a like to use thank sir like to intrude upon kindness too much think will take lodging somewhere in west end so may be within easy reach of here well must be a like lad in respect perhaps will be best so may remind boy that be not always wise for two young people to be constantly in other society laughed will made answer have decided to defer putting question until claim be settled one way other in
