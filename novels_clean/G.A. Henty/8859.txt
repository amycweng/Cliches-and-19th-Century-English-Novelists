backwoodsman john join in kind love to husband believe to remain affectionate cousin mary wilson four month after date of above letter lad fifteen year old be walking with man of middle age on shore of lake huron behind be large clearing of about hundred acre in extent comfortable house with building for cattle stood at distance of three hundred yard from lake broad field of yellow corn waved brightly in sun from edge of clearing came sound of woodsman ax showing that proprietor be still enlarging limit of farm surrounding house at distance of twenty yard be strong stockade seven foot in height formed of young tree pointed at upper end squared fixed firmly in ground house although far more spacious comfortable than majority of backwood farmhouse be built in usual fashion of solid log be evidently designed to resist attack william welch have settled ten year before on spot be then far removed from nearest habitation must have be very imprudent act under ordinary circumstance to have established in so lonely position so far removed from possibility of assistance in case of attack settled there however just after pontiac who be at head of alliance of indian tribe of part have after long desperate siege of fort pitt made peace with upon finding that friend french have given up thought of further resistance to english have entirely abandoned country mr welch thought therefore that permanent peace be likely to reign on frontier that might safely establish in charming location have pitched upon far removed from confines of civilization spot be natural clearing of forty acre in extent sloping down to water edge more charming site must hardly have be chosen mr welch have brought with three farm laborer from east a time went on extended clearing by cutting down forest giant bordered in spite of beauty of position fertility of soil abundance of crop advantage afforded by lake from plentiful supply of fish a highway by must convey produce to market have more than once regretted choice of location be true that there have be no indian war on large scale indian have several time broken out in sudden incursion three time have be attacked fortunately only by small party have be enabled to beat off once when more serious danger threatened have be obliged to embark with wife child more valuable chattel in great scow in carried produce to market have to take refuge in settlement to find on return building destroyed farm wasted at time have serious thought of abandoning location altogether settlement be extending rapidly toward with prospect of having neighbor before long natural reluctance to give up place upon have expended so much toil decided to hold on hoping that more quiet time must prevail until other settler must take up land around house have be rebuilt more strongly than before now employed four men have be unmolested since return to farm three year before date of story already two three location have be taken up on shore of lake beyond village have grown up thirty five mile away several settler have established between place home so be going out fishing morning harold mr welch said hope will bring back good supply for larder be low be looking at yesterday see that be becoming first rate hand at management of canoe so ought to be boy said considering that for nearly three month have done nothing shoot fish have sharp eye harold will make good backwoodsman one of day can shoot nearly a well a can now be lucky have good stock of powder lead on hand firing away by hour together a do consumes large amount of ammunition see there be canoe on lake be coming way too there be one man in be white by clothes for minute two stood watching boat then seeing that course be directed toward shore walked down to edge of lake to meet ah pearson be that mr welch asked thought knew long sweeping stroke at distance have be hunting see be fine stag have got there what be news about a bad a can be master welch hunter said iroquois have dug up tomahawk again be out on war path have massacred john brent family heard talk of among hunter met ten day since in wood said that iroquois be restless that chief war eagle one of most troublesome varmint on whole frontier have be stirring up to war told heard that pale face be pushing further further into injun wood unless drove back redskin hunting ground must be gone hoped that nothing must come of might have known better when redskin begin to stir there be sure to be mischief before be quiet again color have somewhat left mr welch cheek a hunter spoke be bad news indeed pearson said gravely be sure about attack on brent sartin sure hunter said met herder have be down to johnson to fetch barrel of pork just when got back heard injun yell saw smoke rising in clearing so dropped barrel made track met at johnson where have just arrived johnson be packing up with haste be going to leave so said must take canoe come down lake giving warning on way stopped at burn hooper burn said must clear out at once hooper talked about seeing through be got wife to be skeary about reckoned that with two hand must defend log hut told reckoned must get har raised if injun came way in course be business what do advise pearson like abandoning farm to mercy of redskin must be pity master welch be a true a gospel be likeliest clearing within fifty mile round have fixed place up a snug comfortable a if be farm in old province in course question be what war eagle intends to do section of tribe be pretty considerable strong although at present aint heard that others have joined injun be like barrel of gunpowder when spark be once struck there be saying how far explosion may spread when one band of 'em see a how be taking scalp getting plunder honor want to be at same work reckon war eagle have got two hundred brave who will follow when news spread that have begun work iroquois to say nothing of shawnee delaware other varmint may dig up hatchet question be what war eagle intention be may make clean sweep down attacking outlying farm waiting till be joined by lot more of red reptile before attacking settlement then on other hand may think strong enough to strike blow at gloucester other border village at once in case might leave outlying farm alone a news of burning of must reach settlement put 'em on guard know in course that if succeeds there can eat up at leisure attack upon brent place look a if meant to make clean sweep down mr welch said well hunter continued thoughtfully know a see in light brent place be long way from other might have wished to give band taste of blood so raise spirit might reasonably conclude that naught must be known about for day perhaps week to come then again attack might have be made by straggling party without order be dubious question have got four hand here think have seen wife shoot pretty straight with rifle so can count a one a young un here have good idea too with shooting iron make six gun place be strong one must beat off straggling party idea be that war eagle who know pretty well that place must make stout fight wo waste time by making regular attack upon might hold out for twenty four hour clearing be open there aint shelter to be have must be safe to lose sight of men must be bad beginning must discourage warrior greatly reckon war eagle will leave alone for present maybe will send scout to see whether be prepared be a likely a not that one be spying at somewhere among tree now must lose time in driving in animal getting well in shelter when see be prepared will leave alone at least for present afterward there be saying will depend on how get on at settlement if succeed there get lot of booty plenty of scalp may march back without touching will be in hurry to get to village have feast dancing if be beaten off at settlement reckon will pay visit for sure wo go back without scalp will be savage like wo mind losing men for sake of having something to brag about when get back now master welch must be going on for want to take news down to settlement before war eagle get there may be ahead of now for aught know give advice a to what have best do can judge circumstance a well a can when have be to settlement put on guard maybe will be coming back again in case know jack pearson rifle be at disposal may a well tote stag up to house wo be doing much hunting just for present meat may come in handy stag be landed minute later canoe shot away from shore under steady stroke of hunter powerful arm mr welch at once threw stag over shoulder accompanied by harold strode away toward house on reaching threw down stag at door seized rope hung against wall sound of large bell rung in quick sharp stroke summoned hand from field sound of woodman ax ceased at once shout of men a drove cattle toward house rose on still air what be matter william mr welch asked a ran from house have bad news dear indian be out again fear may have trouble before must hope that will not come in direction must be prepared for worst wait till see hand beast in stockade then can talk matter over quietly in few minute hand arrived driving before horse cattle what be bos asked be that alarm bell sure enough indian be out again mr welch said in force have massacred brent be making toward settlement may come way may not at rate must be prepared for get beast into shed then do take scythe set to work to cut down patch of corn be high enough to give shelter there be nothing else will cover within hundred yard of house of course will take rifle with keep sharp lookout will have heard bell if be in neighborhood will guess that be on alert so be not likely to attempt surprise shut one of gate leave other ajar with bar handy to put up in case have to make run for harold will go up to lookout while be at work having seen that be attended to mr welch went into house where wife be going about work a usual pale quiet resolute now jane said sit down will tell exactly how matter stand a far a pearson who brought news have told then will decide a to course have better take after have told pearson have said reason for against expecting early attack went on now remains for dear to decide whether will stay defend place till last against attack may be made whether will at once embark in scow make way down to settlement what do think william wife asked scarcely know answered if have quite own way must send nelly down to settlement in scow fight out here with hand certainly will not have own way in wife said if go of course go if stay stay must thousand time rather go through siege here risk worst than go down to gloucester have frightful anxiety of not knowing what be happening here besides be very possible a say that indian may attack settlement many of people there have have experience in indian war redskin be likely to be far more successful in surprise there than must be here if go must have to leave house barn stack animal to mercy of savage capital be pretty nearly embarked here now loss of must be ruin to at rate william be ready to stay here to risk what may come if be life on frontier be necessarily life of danger if be to abandon everything to have to commence life afresh time indian go on war path have better give up at once return to massachusetts very well dear husband said gravely be true frontiersman wife have chosen a must have done be choice of evil god have blessed protected since came out into wilderness will trust confide in now at rate went on more cheerfully there be fear of enemy starving out got in store of provision only fortnight since have enough of everything for three month siege there be fear of well failing a for ammunition have abundance seeing how harold be using powder ball have extra supply when store came in other day there be plenty of corn in barn for animal for month will have corn men be cutting brought in a supply of food for cow will be useful for purpose too will keep heap of soaked with water will cover shingle with in case of attack will effectually quench fire arrow day passed off without slightest alarm by patch of corn be cleared away uninterrupted view of ground for distance of hundred yard from house be afforded when night fell two out of four dog belonging to farm be fastened out in open at distance of from seventy to eighty yard of house others being retained within stockade garrison be divided into three watch two men being on alert at time relieving other three hour mr welch took harold a companion on watch boy be greatly excited at prospect of struggle have often read of desperate fight between frontier settler indian have longed to take share in adventurous work must scarcely believe that time have come that be really sharer in what might be desperate struggle first watch be set at nine at twelve mr welch harold came on duty men relieved reported that be silent in wood that have heard no suspicious cry of kind when men have returned to room mr welch told harold that must take turn round stockade visit dog harold be to keep watch at gate to close after went out to put up bar to stand beside ready to open instantly if called upon then farmer stepped out into darkness treading noiselessly at once disappeared from harold sight latter closed gate replaced heavy bar stood with one hand on other holding rifle listening intently once thought heard low growling from one of dog presently ceased be quiet again gate be solid one formed of strong timber placed at few inch apart bolted to horizontal bar presently felt gate upon hand rested quiver a if pressure be applied from without first impulse be to say be that mr welch have told that must give low whistle a approached gate therefore stood quiet with whole attention

crawling back to house when heard harold shot then waited to see if be followed by war whoop redskin must have raised at once on finding that be discovered have be about to attack in force seeing that

more than able bodied men in gloucester farm around thing must go bad with if did mind bless yer knew more than did about most of have moved from east have never seen injun in war paint gloucester have never be attacked since be founded nigh ten year ago did see reason why must be attacked now there be few old frontiersman like among who did best to stir up be manner of good when council be over put head together just went through township talking to woman have much difficulty in getting up skear among 'em before one of in farm around made husband move into stockade of village when night passed off quietly most of men be just a savage with a if have be false alarm altogether p'inted out that be not because war eagle have left 'em alone night that be bound to do so next night night after in spite of woman must have started out to farm fust thing in morning if man have come in with news that carter farm have be burned whole of people killed scalped a carter farm lay only about fifteen mile off gave skear be a ready now to believe in injun a have tried to make night before then asked old hand to take lead promised to do what told when came to promise be not worth breath have spent upon there be eight ten house outside stockade in course wanted pulled down must hear of howsomever got to work to strengthen stockade to make loop hole in house near to put up barricade from house to house to prepare generally for fight divided into three watch well just a expected about eleven o'clock at night injun attacked watch might just a well have be asleep for good did for be not till redskin have crept up to stockade round opened fire between timber on 'em that knew that be near will do justice to say that fought stiff enough then for four hour held line of house redskin who climbed stockade fell dead inside four fire have be lighted directly attacked to enable to keep from scaling stockade showed to enemy of course redskin took possession of house have wanted to pull down precious hot made for then shot such shower of burning arrow into village that half of house be soon alight tried to get men to sally out to hold line of stockade when might have beaten off if village have be burned down be manner of good man wanted to stick to wife family till last a flame went up man who showed be shot down when at last more than number have gone under redskin brought up fagot piled against stockade outside then hull tribe came bounding over rifle be emptied for must get men to hold fire of chap a knew what be coming gave redskin volley a poured in know much a happened after jack robin bill shuter who be old pal of mine made up mind what to do made rush for small gate that there be in stockade just opposite where injun came in got through safe enough have

hot reception if try a far a band be concerned be safe for day only fear be that others of tribe hurrying up at hearing of success may take place a go past now guess will take few hour sleep have closed eye for last two night week passed quietly pearson after remaining two day again went down lake to gather news returned day later with intelligence that almost settlement have be deserted by inhabitant indian be out in great strength have attacked settler at many point along frontier committing frightful devastation still week passed mr welch began to hope that little clearing have be overlooked forgotten by indian hand now went about work a usual always carried arm with while one be constantly stationed on watch tower harold resumed fishing never however going out of sight of house sometimes took with little nelly welch being considered that be a safe in canoe a be in house especially a boat be always in sight way up from landing to house be under cover of rifle of defender so even in case of attack must probably be able to make way back one afternoon have be out together for two three hour everything looked a quiet peaceable a usual hand be in field near house few of cow grazing close to gate harold have be successful in fishing have obtained a many fish a must carry stepped out from canoe helped nelly to land slung rifle across back picked up fish be strung on withe passed through gill have made few step when yell arose so loud terrible that for moment heart seemed to stop beating then from cornfield leaped up hundred dark figure then came sharp crack of rifle two of hand dashed down at full speed toward house one have fallen fourth man be in watch tower surprise have be complete indian have made way like snake through long corn whose waving have be unperceived by sentinel who be dozing at post half asleep in heat of sun harold saw in moment that be too late for to regain house redskin be already nearer to than be now nelly into boat again quick said must keep out of way till be over nelly be about twelve year old life in wood have given courage quickness beyond year without wasting moment on cry lamentation sprang back into canoe harold took place beside light craft darted rapidly out into lake not until be three four hundred yard from shore did harold pause to look round then when felt be out of gunshot distance ceased paddling fight be raging now around house from loop hole turret white puff of smoke darted angrily out fire have not be ineffectual for several dark form must be seen lying round stockade bulk of indian foiled in attempt to carry place at rush have taken shelter in corn kept up scattering fire round house broken only on side facing lake where there be growing crop to afford shelter be right now harold said cheerfully be anxious nelly will beat off pearson be host in expect must have be lying down when attack be made know be scouting round house night if have be on watch fellow must never have succeeded in creeping up so close unobserved wish be inside nelly said speaking for first time if be only with must not mind be sure wish be harold agreed be too hard being useless out here when such splendid fight be going on ah have eye on exclaimed a puff of smoke burst out from bush near shore ball came skipping along on surface of water sinking however before reached indian musket be good harold said contemptuously trade powder indian get be very poor stuff think that be well within range of rifle weapon harold carried be english rifle of very perfect make finish father have given on parting now said do paddle canoe few stroke nearer shore nelly will still be beyond range of fellow will fire again will see exactly where be lying nelly who be efficient in management of canoe took paddle dipping in water boat moved slowly toward shore harold sat with rifle across knee looking intently over bow of boat toward bush from shot have come that be near enough nelly said girl stopped paddling hidden foe seeing that did not mean to come nearer shore again fired harold rifle be in instant against shoulder sat immovable for moment then fired instantly dark figure sprang from bush staggered few step up slope then fell headlong be pretty good shot harold said father told when saw stag horn above bush to fire about two foot behind eighteen inch lower fired foot below flash expect hit through body have sight at three hundred yard fired little above now nelly paddle out again see said there be shawl waving from top of tower put hat on paddle wave be thinking of doing girl asked presently be just what have be asking for last ten minute harold replied be quite clear that a long a siege be kept up can not get back again there be saying how long may last first thing be what chance be there of pursuing be there other canoe on lake within short distance have one at braithwaite girl said four mile off look there be pearson canoe lying by shore so there be harold exclaimed never thought of expect indian have not noticed bank be rather high where be lying be sure to find sooner later think nelly best plan must be to paddle back again so a to be within range of rifle while still beyond reach of theirs think can keep from using boat until be dark after be dark harold well then must paddle out into lake so a to be well out of sight when get quite dark can paddle in again sleep safely anywhere mile two from house hour passed without change then nelly said there be movement in bush near canoe presently arm be extended proceeded to haul canoe toward shore by head rope a touched bank indian rose from bush be about to step in while number of puff of smoke burst out along shore bullet skipped over water toward canoe one of striking with sufficient force to penetrate thin bark few inch above water edge harold have not moved a savage stepped into canoe fired indian fell heavily into water upsetting canoe a did so yell of rage broke from comrade think will try game again a long a be daylight harold said little further out again nelly if bullet have hit must have given nasty blow though think must have penetrated still may a well avoid accident after hour passed fire round house ceased do think indian have gone away nelly asked be afraid there be chance of harold said expect be going to wait till night then try again be not fond of losing men pearson father be not likely to miss anything come within range a long a daylight last after dark harold oh will try sort of trick pearson be up to worry about dear hour passed slowly away until at last sun sank darkness came on rapidly so long a must see canoe just floated above water edge harold maintained position then taking one paddle while nelly handled other sent boat flying away from shore out into lake for quarter of hour paddled straight out by time outline of shore must be dimly perceived harold doubted whether must be possible to see boat from shore in order to throw indian off scent must be case turned boat head to south paddled swiftly until be perfectly dark expect saw turn south said to nelly redskin have wonderful eye so if pursue at will do in direction human being unless borrowed eye of owl must see now so will turn paddle other way for two hour rowed in direction can go in to shore now harold said at last must be seven eight mile beyond house distance to shore be longer than expected for have only light of star to guide have experience in night traveling have made much further out into lake than have intended at length dark line of tree rose in front of in few minute canoe lay alongside bank late occupant be stretched on soft layer of moss fallen leaf what be going to do to morrow about eating nelly asked there be four five good sized fish in bottom of canoe harold replied fortunately caught more than must carry intended to make second trip from house for be afraid will not be able to cook for indian can see smoke distance if worst come to worst must eat raw be sure to find berry in wood to morrow now dear have better go to sleep a fast a can first let kneel down pray god to protect father mother boy girl knelt in darkness said simple prayer then lay down harold be pleased to hear in few minute steady breathing told that cousin be asleep be long time before followed example during day have kept up brave front have endeavored to make best of position now that be alone felt full weight of responsibility of guiding companion through extreme danger threatened felt sure that indian must prolong siege for time a must be sure that re enforcement must possibly arrive in aid of garrison moreover by mean felt so sure a have pretended to companion of power of defender of house to maintain successful resistance to so large number of savage foe in daylight felt certain must beat off darkness neutralizes effect of superior arm better marksmanship be nearly midnight before lay down with determination to sleep scarcely have done so when be aroused by outburst of distant firing although six seven mile from scene of encounter sound of discharge came distinct to ear along smooth surface of lake must even hear mingled with musketry fire faint yell of indian for hour a seemed to sat listening to distant contest then unconsciously to dozed off to sleep awoke with start to find nelly sitting up beside sun streaming down through bough started to foot bless exclaimed did not know have be asleep seems instant ago be listening here checked be be wide awake here be in broad daylight harold first care be to examine position of canoe found that fortunately have touched shore at spot where bough of tree overhead drooped into water beyond so that must not be seen by anyone passing along lake be more fortunate a saw three mile away canoe with three figure on board for long distance on side bough of tree drooped into water with only opening here there such a through boat have passed night before must be moving nelly here be mark where scrambled up bank last night if indian take into head to search shore way a likely enough may do will be sure to see in first place let gather stock of berry then will get into boat again paddle along under arcade of bough till get to place where can land without leaving mark of foot if indian find place where landed here will suppose that went off again before daylight for time rambled in wood succeeded in gathering store of berry wild fruit upon nelly made breakfast harold appetite be sufficiently ravenous to enable to fall to upon fish declared be not so bad after then took place in canoe again paddled on for nearly mile see harold nelly exclaimed a got glimpse through bough into lake there be canoe must have got braithwaite boat passed place coming here know wonder what have happened there what do think be best to do nelly harold asked opinion be just a good a mine about will leave canoe behind land take to wood will stop quietly in canoe in shelter here will take to lake trust to speed to get away in case know if must come up must pick off with gun before got within reach think must do girl said shaking head shoot very well be not easy thing to hit moving object if be not accustomed to paddle so fast that if miss once must be close alongside at rate must be within reach of gun before must load again must be sure to catch for although might paddle nearly a fast for time must certainly tire out then a to waiting here in canoe if came along on foot looking for must be in power be dreadful to think of taking to wood with indian about really think must be safest plan think so too nelly if can manage to do without leaving track must not go much further for tree be getting thinner ahead must be seen by canoe fifty yard further harold stopped paddling here be just place nelly at point little stream of three four foot wide emerged into lake harold directed boat head toward water in stream be few inch deep now nelly said must step out into water walk up a far a can go will puzzle even sharpest redskin to find track then stepped into water harold taking head rope of canoe towing light boat when empty did not draw more than two inch of water behind directed nelly to be most careful a walked not to touch of bush at time nearly met across stream broken twig withered leaf must be quite enough to tell indian that came along way said where bush be thick must manage to crawl under never mind about getting wet will soon dry again slowly cautiously made way up stream for nearly mile have for distance be narrowing rapidly being only fed by little rill from surrounding swamp land harold have so far looked in vain for spot where must land without leaving mark of foot presently came to place where great tree have fallen across

at ten o'clock at night pearson dropped lightly from stockade on side opposite to gate a knew that if indian be there must be point that must be watching then crawling upon stomach made way slowly down to lake entering water stooping low waded along edge of bush for distance of mile then left water struck into forest few minute must hear discharge of rifle at house a before answering shot be heard treading very cautiously made wide detour then came down again on clearing at end furthest from lake where indian have be last seen moving about be still keeping among tree moving with great caution made way for considerable distance along edge of clearing then dropped on hand knee entered cornfield for two hour crawled about quartering ground like dog in search of game everywhere found line where indian have crawled along to edge nearest to house nowhere did discover sign of life then still taking great care moved down toward house made circuit of short distance outside stockade then rose to foot yer may stop shooting shouted pesky rascal be gone then walked openly up to gate be opened at once by william welch be sure have gone asked sure a gospel answered have be gone twenty four hour at least how do know that easy enough found several of cooking place in wood brand be out even under ash ground be cold so must have be out for long time must have walked straight on to

went down to lake watched until two when pearson took place mr welch be turning to go back to house when pearson placed hand on shoulder listen said for minute men stood immovable what be farmer asked thought heard stroke of paddle pearson said might have be jump of fish there there be again lay down put ear close to water there be canoe in lake to north'ard can hear stroke of paddle plainly mr welch must hear nothing minute passed then pearson exclaimed there saw break in water over there there be said straining eye in darkness be canoe sure enough although have ceased paddling be not mile away then rose to foot shouted halloo at top of voice answering shout faintly came back across water again hailed loudly time answer came in female voice be sure enough can swear to nelly voice william welch uncovered head putting hand before face returned fervent thanks to god for recovery of child then dashed off at full speed toward house before reached however met wife running down to meet shout having informed that something be seen hand in hand ran down to water edge canoe be now swiftly approaching mother screamed nelly be that mamma mamma came back in girl clear tone with low cry of gladness mr welch fell senseless to ground strain have for four day endured have be terrible even assurance of pearson have failed to awaken strong feeling of hope in heart have kept up bravely have gone about work in house with pale set face unexpected relief be too much for two minute later bow of canoe grated on shore nelly leaped into father arm where be mamma exclaimed be here dear have fainted joy of return have be too much for nelly knelt beside mother raised head farmer grasped harold hand brave boy said have to thank for saving child life god bless dipped hat in lake sprinkled water in wife face soon recovered few minute afterward happy party walked up to house mr welch being assisted by husband pearson two young one be soon seated at table ravenously devouring food when hunger be satisfied related story of adventure whole of garrison being gathered round to listen after relating what have taken place up to time of hiding canoe harold went on walked about quarter of mile until came to large clump of underwood crept in there taking great pain not to break twig disturb leaf ground be fortunately very dry must see that footprint have not left smallest mark there have lain hid ever since have fish berry fortunately fruit be ripe juicy quenched thirst well enough must sometimes hear firing by day always at night on day took refuge heard voice of indian down toward lake quite plainly have heard nothing of since last night heard firing up to middle of night then suddenly stopped to day crept out went down to lake to listen seemed that everything be still nelly be in terrible way be afraid that house have be taken by indian told that must not be for there must certainly have be tremendous lot of firing at last whereas stopped after few shot just a have be going on so long provision be gone nelly be getting very bad for want of water of course got drink at lake morning so agreed that if everything be still again to night must go back to place where have hidden canoe launch paddle here everything be quiet so came along a have arranged when saw light in window made sure be right still be great relief when shout from shore knew of course that be redskin shout besides indian must have kept quiet till came alongside very hearty be commendation bestowed on boy for courage thoughtfulness behaved like old frontiersman pearson said must have done better only made one blunder from time set out from shore what be harold asked be wrong to pick berry redskin of course must find where have landed 'd see mark where lay down must know that have paddled away again have not be for seeing track made in picking berry might have supposed have started before daybreak have gone out of sight across lake mark must have shown that did not take to canoe until long after sun be up therefore that must have made across lake without seeing must either have landed be in canoe under shelter of tree somewhere along shore be marvel to that did find trace however careful be to conceal be only error made tell young un have right to be proud of having outwitted hull tribe of redskin chapter iv fight at lexington harold remained for four month longer with cousin indian have made several attack upon settlement at other point of frontier have not repeated incursion in neighborhood of lake farming operation have gone on regularly men always worked with rifle ready to hand pearson have predicted that indian be not likely to return to neighborhood mr welch farm be only one along lake have escaped loss indian have sustained in attacking have be so heavy that be not likely to make expedition in quarter where chance of booty be so small certainty of desperate resistance so great other matter occurred rendered renewal of attack improbable news be brought by wandering hunter that quarrel have arisen between shawnee iroquois that latter have recalled brave from frontier to defend own village in case of hostility breaking out between rival tribe there be occasion for harold to wait for news from home for father have before starting definitely fixed day for return when time approached harold started on eastward journey in order to be at home about date of arrival pearson took in canoe to end of lake accompanied to settlement whence be able to obtain conveyance to detroit here took passage in trading boat made way by water to montreal thence down through lake champlain hudson river to new york thence to boston journey have occupied longer than expected mr mr be already in home at concord when arrived meeting be joyful one parent have upon return home found letter from mr welch wife describing event have happened at farm speaking in highest term of courage coolness in danger harold have displayed giving full credit for saving of daughter life upon day after harold return two gentleman called upon captain wilson asked to sign agreement number of colonist have entered into to resist mother country to last captain wilson positively refused to do be englishman said sympathy be wholly with country say that whole of demand of england be justifiable think that parliament have be deceived a to spirit existing here consider that have done nothing to justify attitude of colonist soldier of england have fought for against french indian be still stationed here to protect colonist pay nothing for land pay nothing toward expense of government of mother country appears to to be perfectly just that people here free a be from burden bear so heavily on at home must at least bear expense of army stationed here grant that must have be far better have colonist taxed to pay extra amount instead of mother country taxing must not do of colonist paid quota others refused to do so being case appears to that england be perfectly justified in laying on tax nothing must have be fairer than tax that proposed stamp tax must in way have affected poorer class in colony must have be borne only by rich by engaged in such business transaction a required stamped document regard present rebellion a work of clique of ambitious men who have stirred up people by incendiary address writing there be of course among large number of men among gentleman place who conscientiously believe that be justified in doing nothing for land gave ancestor birth who must enjoy great natural wealth of vast country without contributing toward expense of troop to whom be due that enjoy peace tranquility such gentleman be not sentiment consider gross hardship that colonist be compelled to trade only with mother country grant that must be more profitable better for have open trade with whole world in england only act a do other country toward colony france spain portugal netherlands monopolize trade of colony far more than doe england regard colony a source of revenue repeat think that course england have pursued toward have be always wise be sure that nothing that have done justifies spirit of disaffection rebellion be ripe throughout colony time will come sir one of gentleman said when will have reason to regret line have now taken sir captain wilson said haughtily time may come when line have taken may cost fortune even life will never cause one moment regret have chosen part of loyal english gentleman when deputation have departed harold who have be wondering listener to conversation asked father to explain to exact position in matter stood be indeed serious one success of england in struggle with france for supremacy of north america have cost great deal of money at home burden of people be extremely heavy expense of army navy be great ministry in striving to lighten burden of people turned eye to colony saw in america population of over two million people subject of king like living free from rent tax on own land paying nothing to expense of country be be true forced to trade with england obligation be set wholly at naught gigantic system of smuggling be carried on custom house official have force at disposal must have enabled to check operation law enforcing trade with england be virtually dead letter first step be to strengthen naval force on american coast by additional vigilance to put sort of check on wholesale smuggling prevailed step caused extreme discontent among trading class of america set to work vigorously to stir up strong feeling of disaffection against england revenue officer be prevented sometimes by force from carrying out duty after great consideration english government came to conclusion that revenue sufficient to pay considerable proportion of cost of army in america might be raised by mean of stamp tax imposed upon legal document receipt agreement license tax in fact resembling that on stamp now in use in england colonist be furious at imposition of tax congress composed of deputy from state met be unanimously resolved that stamp tax must not be paid meeting be everywhere held at strongest most treasonable language be uttered such violent threat be used against person employed a stamp collector that in fear of life resigned post stamp tax remained uncollected be treated by colonist a if be not in existence whole of state now began to prepare for war congress be made permanent militia drilled prepared for fighting everywhere position grew more more strained massachusetts be headquarters of disaffection here total break with mother country be openly spoken of at time more moderate spirit attempted to bring about reconciliation between two party petition be sent to house of parliament even at time have spirit of wisdom prevailed in england final consequence might have be prevented unfortunately majority in parliament be unable to recognize that colonist have right upon side taxation be so heavy at home that men felt indignant that must be called upon to pay for keeping up of army in america to untaxed colonist with free farm house must contribute nothing plea of colonist that be taxed by chamber in be unrepresented be answered by statement that such be also case with manchester leeds many other large town be unrepresented in parliament in england spirit strength of colonist be understood men must not bring to believe that must fight rather than submit still le that if did fight must be successfully ignored fact that population of state be one fourth a large a of england by far greater proportion of population be men trained either in border warfare in chase to use of rifle that enormous extent of country offered almost insuperable obstacle to most able army composed of regular troop that vast forest thinly populated country be in favor of population fighting a guerrilla against trained troop have perceived thing english people must have hesitated before embarking upon struggle even if convinced a assuredly great majority be convinced of fairness of demand be true that even have england at point abandoned altogether determination to raise tax in america result must probably have be same spirit of disaffection in colony have gone so far that retreat must have be considered a confession of weakness separation of colonist from mother country must have happened ere many year have elapsed a be parliament agreed to let stamp tax drop in place established import duty on good entering american port colonist however be determined that must submit to taxation whatever english government in desire for peace abandoned duty with exception of on tea even concession be not sufficient to satisfy colonist entered into bond to use english good riot took place at boston revenue officer be forced to withdraw from post troop be dispatched from england house of common declared massachusetts to be in state of rebellion must not be supposed that colonist be by mean unanimous in resistance to england there be throughout country large number of gentleman like captain wilson wholly opposed to general feeling new york refused to send member to congress in many other province adhesion given to disaffected movement be lukewarm be in new england province that spirit of rebellion be hottest state have be peopled for most part by puritan men who have left england voluntarily exiling rather than submit to law religion of country among a among portion of irish population of america at present time feeling of hatred against government of england be in way hereditary so far few act of violence have taken place nothing must be more virulent than language of newspaper of party against opponent beyond few isolated tumult peace have not be broken be lull before storm great majority of new england colonist be bent upon obtaining nothing short of absolute independence loyalist english be a determined to put down revolt by force congress drilled armed organized english brought over fresh troop prepared for struggle be december when harold returned home to parent for next three month lull before storm continued disaffected of massachusetts have collected large quantity of military store at concord general gage who commanded troop at boston determined to seize destroy seeing that must be collected only for use against government on night of april grenadier light infantry company of various regiment strong under command of lieutenant colonel smith of tenth regiment major pitcairne of marine embarked in boat be conveyed up charles river

party in town two of number be dispatched on horseback to rouse whole country on way to concord where news arrived at two o'clock in morning captain wilson household be startled from sleep by sudden ringing of alarm bell negro servant pompey who have be for many year in service be sent down into town lay quarter of mile from house to find out what be news returned in hour tink de people gone mad massa dey swarming out of deir house filling de street wid gun on deir shoulder de while shouting halloing 'down wid de english down wid de redcoat dey sha have gun dey sha take de cannon de powder ' dere be ole massa bill emerson preacher wid gun in hand shouting to de people to stand firm to fight till de last dey shout will ' dey bery desperate fear great fight come on be going to do father harold asked nothing boy if a be only too likely be beginning of civil war have determined to offer service to government great number of loyalist have sent in name offering to serve if necessary from knowledge of drill will of course be useful to day can take active part in fight will take horse ride forward to meet troop warn commanding officer resistance will be attempted here may go with father yes if like boy pompey saddle two horse at once be not afraid of being left alone mary said turning to wife there be chance of disturbance here house lie beyond town take place will be in concord when troop have captured gun store will return mr wilson said be not frightened have fear whatever of being left alone horse be soon brought round captain wilson son mounted rode off at full speed made detour to avoid town then gaining highroad went forward at full speed alarm have evidently be given along line at village bell be ringing people be assembling in street carrying arm while number be flocking in from farmhouse around once twice captain wilson be stopped asked where be going be going to tell commander of british force now marching hither that if advance there will be bloodshed that will be beginning of civil war if have order to come at hazard word will not stop if be left to discretion possibly may pause before brings on so dire calamity be just dawn when captain wilson harold rode into lexington where militia strong have assembled gun be loaded be ready to defend place numbered about inhabitant just a captain wilson rode in messenger ran up with news that head of british column be close at hand of militia have dispersed to lie down until english arrived john parker who commanded ordered drum to beat alarm gun to be fired men drew up in two rank across road be too late now harold captain wilson said let get out of line of fire british hearing drum alarm gun loaded advance company came on at double major pitcairne be at head shouted to militia to lay down arm be matter of dispute will always remain one a to who fired first shot american assert that be english english say that a advanced several shot be fired at from behind stone wall from of adjoining house wounded one man hit major pitcairne horse in two place militia disregarded major pitcairne order to lay down arm english fired several of militia be killed nine wounded rest dispersed there be further fighting english marched on unopposed to concord a approached town militia retreated from english took possession of bridge behind place held while troop be engaged in destroying ammunition gun carriage most of gun have be removed only two twenty four pounder be taken in destroying store by fire court house took flame at sight of fire militia armed countryman advanced down hill toward bridge english tried to pull up plank american ran forward rapidly english guard fired colonist returned fire of english be killed wounded party fell back into town hour later colonel smith having performed duty that be sent to do resumed homeward march with whole of troop then militiaman of concord with from many village around man in district capable of bearing arm fell upon retiring english road led through several defile tree rock depression of ground be taken advantage of by american scarcely man be to be seen deadly fire rained thick upon tired troop vainly attempted to return must hing against invisible foe man of whom possessed skill with rifle far beyond of british soldier very many fell retreat be fast becoming rout when near lexington column met strong re enforcement have be sent out from boston be commanded by lord percy who formed detachment into square in colonel smith party now so utterly exhausted that be obliged to lie down for time took refuge when be rested whole force moved forward again toward boston harassed whole way by american who from behind stone wall other place of shelter kept up incessant fire upon flank a well a in front rear against troop must hing at last retreating column safely arrived at boston spent worn out with fatigue loss be men killed wounded missing such be beginning of war of independence many american writer have declared that previous to battle there be desire for independence on part of colonist be emphatically contradicted by language used at meeting in newspaper have come down to leader may not have wished to go so far may not have intended to gain more than entire immunity from taxation absolute power for colonist to manage own affair experience have shown that when spark of revolution be once lighted when resistance to law have once commenced thing be carried to point far beyond dreamed of by first leader who commenced french revolution be moderate men who desired only that slight check must be placed on arbitrary power of king that people must be relieved in slight degree from horrible tyranny of noble from misery wretchedness in lived just demand increased step by step until culminated in reign of terror most horrible scene of bloodshed massacre of modern time men like washington franklin adam may have desired only that colonist must be free from imperial taxation popular voice went far beyond three year earlier wise counsel in british parliament might have averted catastrophe delayed for many year separation of colony from mother country at time march began from boston to concord american colonist stood virtually in armed rebellion militia throughout new england be ready to fight arm ammunition military store be collected in rhode island new hampshire cannon military store belonging to crown have be carried off by people forty cannon being seized in rhode island alone such being case be nonsense to speak of fray at lexington a cause of revolutionary war be spark in powder magazine be ready primed explosion be inevitable fight at lexington be accidental incident set fire to effort of american writer to conceal real fact of case to minimize rebellious language violent act of colonist to make england responsible for war because body of troop be sent to seize cannon military store intended to be used against be so absurd a well a so untrue that be astonishing how wide credence such statement have received from eminence at distance from line of retreat captain wilson son watched sorrowfully attack upon british troop when at last combatant disappeared from sight through one of defile captain wilson turned horse head homeward die be cast said to wife a met at door war have begun fear can have one termination colonist can place force in field twenty time a numerous a army that england can spare be inferior in drill in discipline thing be of such vast consequence in european battlefield matter little in such country a skill with rifle knowledge of forest warfare be far more important in point colonist be a superior to english soldier a be in point of number nevertheless dear duty be plain be englishman have borne majesty commission must fight for king harold have spoken to a rode home together wish to fight by side have pointed out to that a be born here can without dishonor remain neutral in struggle however insists that a royal subject

independence self reliance older than english boy harold too have already shown that possessed discretion coolness a well a courage although now that moment have come mr wilson wept passionately at thought of leaving abstained from saying word to dissuade from course have determined upon when recovered from fit of cry said that must accompany at once to boston a in first place duty might for time lie in city that in case must obtain far more speedy news there of what be going on throughout country than must at concord must too be living among friend must meet with many of same conviction opinion a husband whereas in concord whole population must be hostile captain wilson said that there be time to be lost a whole town be in tumult therefore advised to pack up such necessary article a

barefaced misstatement be never made men carry off cannon by score accumulate everywhere great store of warlike ammunition without thought of fighting colonist commenced war by assembling in arm to oppose progress of british troop obeying order of government matter not whit on side first shot be fired american troop have many time since event fired upon rioter in street under circumstance no stronger than brought on fight at lexington from part of new england militia volunteer poured in in three day after fight twenty thousand armed men be encamped between river mystic roxburgh thus besieging boston at once set to work throwing up formidable earthwork english troop remaining within intrenchment across neck of land joining boston with mainland street of boston be crowded with excited populace when captain wilson party rode into at two in morning one thought of going to bed be excited to last degree at news of battle sort of report prevailed on colonial side be affirmed that british in retreat have shot down woman child while soldier affirmed that colonist have scalped many of number who fell in fight latter statement be officially made by lord percy in report of engagement captain wilson rode direct to house of wife friend be still up be delighted to see mary wilson for such exaggerated report have be received of fight that be alarmed for safety belonged to moderate party who saw that there be fault on side regretted bitterly obstinacy of english parliament in attempting to coerce colonist determination of latter to oppose by force of arm legitimate right of mother country until morning event of preceding day be talked over few hour repose be then taken after captain went to headquarters of general gage offered service although boston be headquarters of disaffected party le than two hundred men came forward a volunteer in king service captain wilson be at once appointed to command of company of fifty men before leaving army have taken part in several expedition against indian knowledge of forest warfare rendered valuable acquisition boston be poorly provisioned a upon day when news of lexington reached new york two vessel laden with flour for use of troop at boston be seized by colonist many other supply cut off danger of place being starved out be considerable general gage therefore offered opposition to exit from city of who wished to avoid horror of siege considerable portion of population made way through to rebel line day brought news of fresh rising throughout country governor of various province be powerless small garrison of english troop be disarmed made prisoner fortress of ticonderoga held only by fifty men be captured by american without resistance in one month after first shot be fired whole of american colony be in rebellion news be received in england with astonishment sorrow great concession have be made by parliament news have reached america too late to avoid hostility public opinion be divided many be in favor of granting at once that colonist demanded many officer of rank position resigned commission rather than fight against american division indeed be almost a general complete a have be in time of own civil war in feeling in favor of colonist be strong in country generally determination to repress rising be in ascendant colonist have with great shrewdness dispatched fast sailing ship to europe upon day following battle of lexington giving account of affair representing a massacre of defenseless colonist by british troop story thus told excited sympathy must not perhaps have be extended to have real fact of case be known representative from colony met at philadelphia to organize national resistance a yet although many of bolder spirit spoke of altogether throwing off allegiance to england resolution be proposed to effect for first six week after arrival at boston captain wilson be engaged in drilling company harold be of course attached to entered with ardor upon duty captain wilson did not attempt to form men into band of regular soldier accuracy of movement regularity of drill must be of little avail in warfare in be likely to be engaged accuracy in shooting quickness in taking cover steadiness in carrying out general order be principal object to be attained most of men have already taken part in frontier warfare majority of be gentleman englishman who like captain have come out from home purchased small estate in country discipline therefore be not strict off duty be on term of equality toward end of may beginning of june considerable re enforcement arrived from england a step preparatory to offensive measure general gage on june issued proclamation offering in majesty name free pardon to who must forthwith lay down arm john hancock general adam only excepted threatening with punishment who must delay to avail of offer proclamation have effect near peninsula of boston on north separated from by charles river be navigable about breadth of thames at london bridge be neck of land called peninsula of charlestown on north bank opposite boston lie town of charlestown behind in center of peninsula rise eminence called bunker hill bunker hill be sufficiently high to overlook part of boston near enough to be within cannon shot hill be unoccupied by party about time american hearing that general gage have come to determination to fortify resolved to defeat resolution by being first to occupy about nine in evening of june detachment from colonial army one thousand strong under command of colonel prescott moved along charlestown road took up position on shoulder of bunker hill be known a breed hill just above town of charlestown reached position at midnight man carried pick shovel night worked vigorously in intrenching position not word be spoken watch on board men of war in harbor be ignorant of what be going on so near at hand at daybreak alarm be given lively opened cannonade upon redoubt battery of gun be placed on copp hill behind boston distant twelve hundred yard from work also opened fire american continued work throwing up fresh intrenchment singularly only one man be killed by fire from ship redoubt breastwork be carried down hill to flat ground intersected by fence stretched away to mystic by nine o'clock have completed intrenchment prescott sent off for re enforcement there be little harmony among colonial troop dispute between contingent of various province be common there be head of sufficient authority to enforce order upon whole long delay took place before re enforcement be sent forward in meantime english have be preparing to attack position fifth thirty eighth forty third fifty second regiment with ten company of grenadier ten of light infantry with proportion of field artillery embarked in boat crossing harbor landed on outward side of peninsula near mystic with view of outflanking american position surrounding force be under command of major general howe under whom be brigadier general piggott upon seeing strength of american position general howe halted sent back for further re enforcement american improved time thus given by forming breastwork in front of old ditch here there be post rail fence ran up by side of filled space between two with new mown hay cut only day before lay thickly over meadow illustration plan of action at bunker hill on th of june two battalion be sent across to re enforce howe while large re enforcement with six gun arrived to assistance of prescott english have now force consisting according to different authority of between men colonial force be also variously estimated have advantage in position in protection of intrenchment while british have to march across open ground a individual shot colonist be immensely superior british have advantage given by drill discipline english line advanced in good order steadily slowly artillery covering by fire presently troop opened fire distance be too great did little execution encumbered with knapsack ascended steep hill toward redoubt with difficulty covered a be by grass reaching to knee colonist did not fire shot until english line have reached point about one hundred fifty yard from intrenchment then prescott gave order from redoubt long line of intrenchment flanking flashed line of fire man have taken steady aim with rifle resting on earthwork before so deadly be fire nearly whole front line of british fell for ten minute rest stood with dogged courage firing at hidden foe sheltered while loaded only exposing momentarily while raised head above parapet to fire did such deadly execution that remnant of british fell back to foot of hill while force be under command of general pigott have be engaged division under howe moved against rail fence combat be repetition of have taken place on hill here american reserved fire until enemy be close then with musket resting on rail poured in deadly fire after in vain trying to stand ground troop fell back to shore captain wilson be standing with harold on copp hill watching engagement what beautiful order go in harold said looking admiringly at long line of red coated soldier be very pretty captain wilson said sadly may do in regular warfare tell harold that sort of thing wo do here there be scarce man carrying gun behind intrenchment who can not with certainty hit bull eye at one hundred fifty yard be simply murder taking men up in regular order against foe sheltered by earthwork at moment long line of fire darted out from american intrenchment look there captain wilson cried in pained voice front line be nearly swept away do see lying almost in unbroken line on hillside tell harold be hopeless to look for success if fight in way bravest men in world must not stand such fire a what will be done now harold asked a men stood huddled upon shore will try again captain wilson said look at officer running about among getting into order in quarter of hour british again advanced toward redoubt grass fence a before american withheld fire time until troop be far closer than before result be even more disastrous of grenadier light infantry company who led lost three fourth others nine tenth of men again british troop recoiled from terrible fire general howe officer exerted to utmost to restore order when troop again reached shore men gallantly replied to exhortation almost impossible a task appeared prepared to undertake for third time time small force only be directed to move against grass fence while main body under howe be to attack redoubt on hill knapsack be taken off thrown down man nerved to conquer die ship in harbor prepared way by opening heavy cannonade general clinton who be watching battle from copp hill ran down to shore rowed across harbor put at head of two battalion then with loud cheer troop again sprang up ascent american ammunition be running short many of men not having more than three four round left time held fire until british troop be within twenty yard have not fired shot order being that there be to be pause that redoubt be to be carried with bayonet for moment wavered when deadly volley be poured in upon then with cheer rushed at intrenchment who first mounted be shot down by defender troop must not be denied pouring over earthwork leaped down upon enemy for few minute there be hand to hand fight american using butt end of musket english bayonet soldier be exhausted with climb up hill exertion under blazing sun great majority of defender of redoubt be therefore enabled to retreat unharmed a fresh active be able to outrun tired opponent a ball served out to english field piece be too large artillery be unable to come into action colonist at rail fence maintained position against small force sent against till main body at redoubt have made escape british be unable to continue pursuit beyond isthmus in whole history of british army there be record of more gallant feat than capture of bunker hill few troop in world must after two bloody repulse have moved up third time to assail position defended by men so trained to use of rifle ten hundred fifty four men nearly number be killed wounded among whom be officer in few battle ever fought be proportion of casualty to number engaged so great american fought bravely extraordinary praise bestowed upon for valor appears misplaced position be one of great strength absence of drill be of consequence whatever in such engagement be perfectly sheltered from enemy fire while engaged in calmly shooting down loss up to moment when british rushed among be altogether insignificant casualty took place after position be stormed on retreat along peninsula amounted in to killed captured wounded may be said that side fought well from circumstance under fought highest credit be due to victor battle however though won by english be moral triumph for american british parliament must at once have given up contest be from first absolutely certain that american with immense superiority in number must if be only willing to fight hold vast country against british troop fighting with base thousand of mile away battle of bunker hill showed that be so willing that must fight sternly bravely point once established be little short of madness for english government to continue contest have not even excuse of desiring to wipe out dishonor of defeat soldier have won brilliant victory have fought with determination valor never exceeded england must have afforded to say will fight no more if inhabitant of vast continent be determined to go alone be ready to give life rather than remain in connection with go prosper acknowledge can not subdue nation in arm from height of copp hill must be seen that british have suffered terribly captain wilson be full of enthusiasm when saw success of last gallant charge of english soldier said to harold be disastrous victory few such battle a english army in america must cease to exist although be aware that loss be heavy be not prepared for truth long grass have hidden from view many of who fell when be known that nearly half of engaged be killed wounded feeling among english be akin to consternation generalship of british be wholly unworthy of valor of troop there must have be difficulty in placing of vessel of light draught so far up mystic a to outflank intrenchment held by colonist indeed british troop might have be landed further up mystic in case american must have retreated instantly to avoid capture lastly troop although fighting within mile of quarter be encumbered with three day provision knapsack constituting with musket ammunition load of pound be indeed heavily handicapping men who have under blazing sun to climb steep hill with grass reaching to knee intersected by wall fence american writer describe defender of position a inferior in number to assailant be due to english to say that estimate of number of defender of intrenchment differs very widely from general gage estimated a being fully three time a numerous a british troop be probable that truth lie between two account captain wilson returned with harold greatly dispirited to house lookout be dreadfully bad said to wife after describing event of day so far a can see there be two alternative peace long destructive war with failure at end be even more hopeless trying to conquer vast country like defended by irregular than if have trained disciplined army to deal with in case two three signal victory might bring war to conclusion fighting with irregular victory mean nothing beyond so many of enemy killed there be scarcely cannon to take store magazine to capture when enemy be beaten disperses move off in couple of day gather again in fresh position work have end there be fortress to take strategical position to occupy great road to cut enemy can march anywhere attack disperse a chooses scatter re form when have passed by be like fighting wind well john since seems so hopeless can not give up be too late altogether too late mary if be free tomorrow must volunteer service again next day be not le duty to fight in country cause because believe cause to be losing one must see that dear if england have be sure to win without aid might have stood aloof be because everyone help be needed that such service a can render be due to country must be in bad way whose son be only ready to fight when success be certainty congress determined now to detach canada from english side prepared force for invasion of colony where british have few regular troop captain wilson be one morning summoned to headquarters on return called together four five of men best acquainted with country have be in early day hunter border scout knew foot of forest lake have just seen general captain wilson said royalist brought in news last night that rebel be raising force intended to act against montreal reckon upon being joined by considerable portion of canadian among whom there be unfortunately good deal of discontent have two regiment in whole colony one of be at quebec rebel therefore will get advantage of surprise may raise colony before be in condition to resist general howe asked to take company through wood straight to montreal must be landed few mile up coast at night suppose of know country well enough to be able to guide several of men expressed ability to act a guide have fought injun through wood over over again said one of sinewy weather beaten man of sixty year old who be known a peter lambton have for many year be scout attached to army be one of most experienced hunter on frontier be tall angular man except that stooped slightly result of habit of walking with head bent forward in attitude of listening year have passed over have have effect upon figure walked with long noiseless tread like of indian be one of men attached to company in whom wisely captain wilson have made attempt to instill very rudiment of drill be captain thought well that younger men must have knowledge of drill a must enable to perform simple maneuver old hunter must fight in own way way infinitely better adapted for forest warfare than that must teach peter of companion be in receipt of small pension have be bestowed upon for service with troop men of kind be not likely to take lively interest in squabble a to question of taxation when found that be coming to fighting again offered service to government a matter of course be attached to regular troop a scout while others be divided among newly raised company of loyalist peter lambton have for last four year be settled at concord during war with french have served a scout with regiment to captain wilson belonged have saved that officer life when with portion of company be surrounded cut off by hostile indian strong feeling of friendship have sprung up between when four year before there have be lull in english fighting on frontier peter have retired on pension saving have made during many year work a hunter have located in cottage on captain wilson estate be many tale told by hunter of experience in indian warfare have fired harold with desire for life of frontier hunter have given such knowledge of forest life a have enabled to throw off indian from trail on harold return old hunter have listened with extreme interest to story of adventure have taken great pride in manner in have utilized teaching peter made appearance in city three day after arrival of captain wilson there look upon here affair a favorable occurrence for harold said to captain wilson boy have lot of spirit if have not be for might have grown up regular town greenhorn fit for nothing to walk about in long coat to talk pleasant to woman will jest be making of with permission cap will take under charge teach to use eye ear reckon will turn out a good injun fighter a will see on frontier be not indian that be going to fight peter captain wilson said heartily wish be will be same thing peter said not here in course there will be battle between regular colonist regular battle like at quebec where party be fool enough to march about in open get shot down by hundred call that fighting be jest killing there aint more sense in than in two herd of buffalo charging other on prairie there will be plenty of real fighting expedition in wood injun skirmish for will be sure that injun will join in on one side on other aint in nature to sit still in village while powder being burned few month of work will make man of might have worse teacher than peter lambton jest hand over to care cap will teach know of way of wood tell yer there aint better kind of edication for young fellow larns to use sens god have given to keep head when man must lose presence of mind to have eye of hawk ear of hound to get so that scarcely know what be to be tired hungry to be able to live while other men must starve to read sign of wood like printed book to be in way man not tailor figure there be great deal in what say old friend captain wilson answered training can not do man good wish with heart that have be entirely with red foe that fighting be to be done however can not be helped a be to fight must not be in better hand than yours so long a remain here will teach what drill can with rest of company when leave town work really begin will put in charge to learn duty of scout young negro jake have also enlisted for throughout war negro fought on side according to politics of master there be only two other negro in company captain wilson have hesitation in enlisting made good soldier in case of jake captain wilson knew that be influenced in wish to join solely by affection for harold lad father felt that in moment of danger negro must be ready to lay down life for there be great satisfaction in band when received news that be at last about to take field long inaction have be most wearisome to knew that fighting must take place round boston must be done by regular troop food too be very scarce in town be heartily weary of regular drill discipline be then in high spirit a embarked on board thetis sloop of war sailed from boston harbor be pitiful parting between mr wilson husband son have be arranged that must sail for england in ship be leaving in following week must there stay with husband family from whom have warm invitation to make home own until war be over thetis ran out to sea a soon a night fell bow be turned to land again about midnight anchor be let fall near shore twenty mile north of boston landing be quickly effected with three day provision in knapsack little party started on march one of scout who have come from neighborhood led by path avoided village farm at daybreak bivouacked in wood at nightfall resumed march by next morning have left settlement behind entered belt of swamp forest extending west to st lawrence chapter vi scouting party of six men be seated around fire in forest covered slope of northern shore of lake champlain spot have be chosen because great tree have fallen bringing down several others in course opening vista through view must be obtained of surface of lake party consisted of peter lambton harold jake ephraim potter old frontiersman two indian company under captain wilson have made way safely to st lawrence after undergoing considerable hardship in forest have be obliged to depend entirely on what game must shoot such fish a must catch in river whose course followed have however reached montreal without loss there found that general carleton have in about regular about volunteer who have recently be engaged be clear that if people of canada be a hostile to connection with england a be of other colony little force at disposal of english general must hing to defend colony against strong force american be collecting for invasion fortunately be not case although canadian be of french descent province have be wrested by arm from france for most part preferred being under english rule to joining insurgent colony have be in way oppressed by england property have be respected above thing attempt have ever be made to interfere with religion in new england province hard puritan spirit of early father have never ceased to prevail who have fled from england to obtain freedom of worship have be intolerant persecutor of religion different from own consequence be that priest of canada be wholly opposed to idea of union with insurgent colonist influence over people be great although still objected to english rule must have readily taken up arm against under other circumstance have too little sympathy with new englanders to join in movement if successful must have placed canada under rule of united state instead of of england upper class of canadian be almost to man loyal to english connection have be well treated enjoyed greater state of independence than have be case under french rule moreover be for most part descended from old french family sympathy be entirely opposed to popular insurrection thus when captain wilson party reached montreal found that in spite of paucity of english troop under command of general carleton position be not so bad a have be feared by general gage be possible indeed probable that upper canada might fall into hand of american that even quebec might be captured unless people joined american success of latter must be temporary with spring navigation of river must be open re enforcement must arrive from england invader must then be at disadvantage separated from home by wide tract of forest covered country must have greatest difficulty in transporting artillery ammunition store fighting a army in invasion must be placed in very different position to occupied by colonist fighting on own ground be probable that for time tide of invasion must succeed indian of five nation a dwelling near british frontier at point be called have volunteered service to general to cross frontier to recapture ticonderoga crown point have be seized by american to carry war into colony general carleton exceedingly humane kind hearted man shrank from horror that warfare must entail upon colonist accepted service of indian a far a absolute defense of canada from invasion refused to allow to cross frontier on arrival of captain wilson with little force be ordered to march at once to fort of st john be held by party of regular troop on arriving at place two scout have be sent down toward lake champlain to watch proceeding of enemy harold have obtained leave from father to accompany scout jake have be permitted to form one of party peter lambton have grumbled little at last addition to number knew jake affection for young master great strength of negro must have rendered useful in hand to hand fight be altogether unaccustomed to forest work habit of bursting into fit of laughter on smallest provocation a be manner of race enraged scout to last degree indeed have not left fort above hour when turned savagely on negro look ee here said if be way ye be going on sooner ye turn yer face tramp back to fort better when be at concord done harm to make a much noise a jackass braying whenever opened that mouth of yours wo do in forest must cost har wool ef yer be to make noise with enemy anywhere within fifteen mile of yer aint going if know to risk sculp on venture a still le aint going to see young chap life thrown away father hez put in charge aint going to see sacrificed in such way so ye have got to make up yer mind yer have got to keep mouth of yours shut tight yer have got to tramp back to fort jake gave many promise of silence although at first often raised voice to point far exceeding that considered by hunter safe in wood be time checked by such savage growl on part of peter by punch in rib from harold that quickly fell into way of others never spoke above loud whisper at short distance from fort be joined by two indian who be also out on scouting expedition on own account have previously be well known to peter ephraim be warrior of seneca tribe one of five nation have now be for two day on north shore of lake champlain be sitting round fire eating portion of deer have be shot by harold that morning so far have seen nothing of enemy knew that men under schuyler montgomery have marched to other end of lake colonist have be sending proclamation across frontier to inhabitant saying that be coming a friend to free from yoke of england calling upon to arise strike for freedom be also in negotiation with of chief of five nation with other indian tribe to induce to join with propose peter said when meal be finished have lighted pipe to go down lake see what be doing deer tail here tell that know where there be canoe harold will go reconnoiter bit other three have best wait here till come back with news in course chief continued to other indian after explaining to in own language what intended to do will be guided by circumstance can see long way down lake ef anything must lead to think that be in trouble can take such step a may seem best to be mighty little must think of crowd of colonist ef a say number of warrior of five nation indignant at rejection of offer by english general have gone down joined colonist will be different affair altogether elk a second seneca chief be called nodded assent in few word peter told harold what have be arranged jake looked downcast when heard that be not to accompany master a saw latter have since leaving fort obeyed without questioning suggestion of scout offered remonstrance quarter of hour later peter rose deer tail followed example harold at once took up rifle fell in in step there be little talk in wood matter having be settled did not enter mind of peter of indian to say word of adieu to comrade harold imitated example gave nod smile to jake a started hour tramp took to shore of lake here halted for minute while indian closely examined locality with wonderful power of making way straight through forest to required spot seems to be almost instinct among indian deer tail have struck lake within two hundred yard of point aimed at led way along shore until came to spot where great maple have fallen into lake here turned into forest again in fifty yard came to clump of bush pushed aside pointed to canoe be lying hidden among peter joined two lifted boat out placed on shoulder carried to lake there be three paddle in peter motioned harold to take place in stern steer while indian knelt forward put paddle in water keep along on right shore of lake about fifty yard from tree there be fear of anyone lurking about near end canoe be light well made darted quickly over water under stroke of two paddler be late in afternoon when started before have gone many mile darkness have fallen canoe be run in close to shore where lay in shadow of tree until morning just a sun rose redskin peter simultaneously dipped paddle in water sent canoe under arch of tree have at same instant caught sight of four canoe making way along lake be injun peter whispered be scouting to see if lake free if general must have got couple of gunboat up sorrel enemy must never have crossed lake must have given month work to take gun round be lucky be well under tree must have be seen what have best do deer tail for two three minute scout conversed together in indian tongue seneca agrees with peter said be like enough there be injun scouting along shore must lay up here till nightfall ef be seen 'd signal by smoke must have canoe back again in time by coming expect expedition be starting wo do to go back without being sure of canoe be paddled to spot where bush grew thickly by bank be pushed among three after eating cooked deer flesh have brought with prepared to pas day seneca will keep watch by turn scout said will wake if want ye harold be by time sufficiently accustomed to way of wood to obey order at once without offering to take turn at watching a inclination led to do be soon sound asleep be late in afternoon when be awoke by scout touching there be critter coming along bank said in whisper aint likely to see be best to be ready harold sat up in canoe rifle in hand listening intently heard slight sound such a must be produced by snapping of twig presently heard upon other side of bush few yard distant few low word in indian tongue looked at companion be sitting immovable with rifle directed toward sound harold thought must fare badly with of passer if happened to take fancy to peer through bush indian have however reason for supposing that there be enemy upon lake consequently passed on without examining more closely thicket by shore not until be perfectly dark did peter give sign for continuance of journey time instead of skirting lake canoe be steered out toward center for time paddled then several light be seen from ahead thought so scout said have crossed to isle la motte be making a many fire a if war having sort of picnic at home must wait till burn out for dare go near place with water lit up for two three hundred yard round wo be long for reckon must be past eleven o'clock now fire be soon seen to burn down paddle be dipped in water canoe approached island 'd give something peter said to know whether there be redskin there ef there be chance of landing without being seen aint worth talking of ef there aint might land hull fleet at rate must risk now harold chief will land find out how many men there be here ef can how long be likely to stop keep canoe about ten yard from shore in shadow of tree be ready to move close instant hear call will jest give croak of frog instant get in paddle off without word ef ye hears shout judge a how have be seen must jest act upon best of yer judgment boat glided noiselessly up to shore be still there encampment being at other side of island two scout red white stepped noiselessly on to land harold backed canoe few pace with quick stroke upon paddle seeing close to spot where long branch of tree dipped into water guided canoe among foliage there sat without movement listening almost breathlessly ere many minute have elapsed heard footstep coming along shore stopped when near three four minute passed without slightest sound then voice said in tone speaker have evidently tried to lower be distinctly audible in canoe tell yer redskin seems to a how have brought here on fool errand see sign of canoe aint likely that british must be along lake here seeing a how there be score of canoe with people in scouting ahead heard canoe voice said first at other end of island then coming along here ef yer did first speaker said likely enough be one of canoe of people indian answered if canoe come back with news must have come straight to fire well aint here anyway first speaker said believe yer ever heard canoe at be enough to make man swear to be called up jest a be making comfortable for night on account of injun fancy wonder at general listening to however have got order to go round island see ef there be canoe on shore so 'd better be moving else will not get to sleep before morning harold held breath a group passed opposite to fortunately trunk of tree grew from very edge of water there be several bush growing round so at point men have to make slight detour inland harold felt thankful indeed that have taken precaution of laying canoe among thick foliage for although night be dark must have be instantly seen have be lying on surface of lake even a be close inspection might have detected eye of party be fixed on shore a be there if at that expected to find empty canoe lying harold be uneasy at discovery that there be still redskin on island be possible of course that one have heard might be alone a scout be more likely that others of tribe be also there after landing peter seneca made way across island to side facing american shore creeping cautiously along found large number of flat bottomed boat in american have crossed from mainland be peter thought capable of carrying men now made way toward spot where force be encamped fire have burned low round few of men be still sitting talking motioning to seneca to remain quiet peter sauntered cautiously out on to clearing where camp be formed have little fear of detection for wore uniform hunter dress afforded index to party to be attached great portion of american be still in ordinary attire having be impossible to furnish uniform for so great number of men a have be suddenly called to arm throughout colony from arbor of bough have be erected in direction judged that force have be already day upon island large number of men be sleeping in open air picking way cautiously among threw down at short distance from one of fire by three four men be sitting for time talked of camp matter shortness of food want of provision be bad here one said presently will be worse when move forward schuyler will be here tomorrow with rest of army be to move down to isle aux noix at end of lake suppose will land at once march against st john there be only couple of hundred britisher there will make short work of sooner better say speaker remarked be ready enough to fight hate waiting about want to get back to farm again be in hurry be other said suppose be going to take canada in week time do even if canadian join by what hear aint so sartin after will have to march down to quebec be child play know country there be now september month winter will be upon canadian winter be joke can tell more reason for not wasting more time other one grumbled if montgomery have way must go at quickly enough schuyler be always delaying have kept waiting now since th of last month might have be halfway to quebec by time yes other said if britisher have run away a came have got st john fort chamblee to deal with may hold out time however sooner begin job sooner will be over be heartily glad that move tomorrow peter have now obtained information required rising to foot again with grumbling remark a to hardness of ground sauntered away toward spot where have left indian just a did so tall figure came out from arbor close by fire be burning just in front peter saw that be tall handsome man of about forty year of age guessed at once that be in presence of colonial leader be like newcomer said unable to sleep suppose yes general peter answered found must not get off so thought 'd stretch leg in wood bit be lying so tarnal thick down there by fire one ca move without treading on regiment do belong to connecticut peter replied for knew by report that regiment from province formed part of expedition a good men a have general said cordially only fault be that be in too great hurry to attack enemy agree with rest general peter said be dull work wasting time here when be wanted at home enlisted for six month sooner time up better say have heard nothing moving general asked one of chippewa told that heard canoe out in lake ah here be at moment five six men headed by indian issued from wood close by be too late for peter to try to withdraw stepped aside pace two a party approached well have found anything general asked find chippewa said shortly believe a there ever be canoe there man who followed said be jest fancy of injun fancy indian asserted angrily canoe there find might have be one of own canoe montgomery said in

paddle bark canoe sped rapidly over water when moon be fairly above edge of hill halted for moment looked back two column of fire still blazed brightly on island be now three mile astern two dark spot must be seen on water about halfway between can paddle lad peter lambton said to distant foe will never ketch must heed if be for other varmint ahead stood up in canoe looked anxiously over lake be clear a far a can see at present said ca land peter make way back on foot bless peter said there aint native along shore there have got eye on canoe might a well take straight back to island a try to land better for must get few hour before tried shot there while injun must not give minute must just keep to water now paddle on again take quietly be odds to let varmint behind gain on little need think about when danger come will want ounce of strength for hour paddled steadily on pursuing canoe be now le than mile behind 'd give good deal muttered scout for few black cloud over moon 'd make for shore then risk will be getting daylight before long ah exclaimed pausing suddenly a chief stopped rowing canoe on side be rowing out to cut off harold be now paddling forward while scout have place at stern former be surprised to feel canoe shooting off from former course at right angle toward shore then curving still more round began to paddle back along lake canoe have be pursuing be nearly abreast of other have embarked from opposite side of island have be gradually drawing together although still distance apart when peter turned canoe seeing maneuver turned to head off by so doing occupied entirely different position in relation to other one canoe being nearly mile nearer to than other take easy peter said varmint will cut off have got to fight can cripple one nearest to before other come up boat be now darting over water in line promised to bring leading canoe almost in collision with of peter when within two hundred yard of other peter ceased rowing now said harold see if can pick one of fellow off be easy matter traveling at pace be fire first harold took steady aim fired yell of derision told that have missed indian stopped paddling there be flash ball struck canoe at same moment peter fired there be one down exclaimed seneca fired without result three unwounded indian in canoe for have contained four men replied with volley harold felt burning sensation a if hot iron passed across arm hit boy peter asked anxiously a gave short exclamation nothing to speak of harold replied varmint be lying by waiting for ' other canoe paddle straight at indian at once turned boat paddled to meet companion who be fast approaching now peter exclaimed have got in line steady aim time three rifle spoke out one of indian fell into boat paddle of be struck from grasp now scout shouted paddle away have got fairly behind day broke just a be again abreast of island one canoe be following closely two others be mile half behind while one with have be engaged have made for shore what do mean to do harold asked peter mean to run a close a can round end of island then make for place where must have embarked on mainland may have seen signal fire there will not know what have be going on so now row best must leave others a far behind a possible for first time since started three paddler exerted to utmost have little fear that there be more canoe on island for have there be must have joined in chase be only necessary to keep so far from end of island a must take out of reach of fire several shot be discharged a passed fell short a canoe shot along at highest rate of speed stroke taking further from nearest pursuer at end of hour paddling canoe be mile half behind rower have apparently somewhat abated speed in order to allow other two boat to draw up to for result of encounter between comrade fugitive have not be of nature to encourage to undertake single handed contest with chapter vii in forest see peter harold exclaimed there be whole fleet of boat ahead see peter said have seed 'em for last quarter of hour be schuyler with rest of what call army steer little out of course must pas close by wo suspect nothing wrong will suppose be merely carrying message in hour be abreast of flotilla consisting of flatboat laden with troop with be two three indian canoe peter steered so a to pas at distance of hundred fifty yard rowed le strongly now still vigorously there be shout from boat well on island well peter shouted back waving hand without further word canoe passed on there do hear that peter exclaimed be firing shot from canoe to call attention chance be wo hear for rattle of oar talking row be making be enough to drown sound of cannon now put on again a hard a can hour will take to landing place must see when flotilla came up to pursuing boat that canoe accompanied turned head joined in pursuit be now near three mile ahead there be chance whatever of being overtaken slackened speed slightly a approached land rowed up to landing place without sign of extraordinary haste few men be loitering about what be news from island one asked a landed well there peter said did see anything of schuyler yes met about halfway across what have come for general montgomery say that spare flint have be sent over for firelock will swear that went one of men exclaimed for packed sack of in one of boat s'pose have be mislaid peter said perhaps of store have got heaped over ef be quite sartin have have journey for nothing a sartin a life man replied will swear to sackful of flint tarnation heavy be too well then need not trouble about further peter said will take rest paddle back in hour two be there mark on sack so a may tell general how to look for mark man repeated why have 'flints written on in big black letter six inch long must turn up anyhow will find when come to shift store then accompanied by two companion peter strolled quietly through little village stopping at small store purchased flour tea then followed road inland be soon out of sight of village stopped for moment then shook head be use trying to hide trail here said road inch thick in dust do what will will be able to see where turn off be leg a have got to trust to for bit have got good half hour start of canoe be long three mile behind when struck shore leaving road led way with long swinging stride across cultivated land twenty minute walk took into forest extended from shore of lake many mile inland take off boot harold said a entered wood heel will leave mark that redskin must pick up at run now tread a near a can in exact spot where seneca have trodden before will follow in track may be sure that will choose hardest bit of ground can come across there varmint be on shore a spoke angry yell rose from distant village at long steady pace taxed to utmost harold power a walker kept way through wood not pursuing straight course turning winding zigzagging few minute harold must not feel impatient at what seemed to loss of time especially when yell from edge of wood told that indian have traced thus far showed too that be far nearer than before a peter afterward explained to turning winding made necessary for indian to follow step a must animal to guess direction have taken weather have be dry ground be hard therefore most experienced trapper must be obliged to proceed very slowly on trail must frequently be for time at fault whereas have continued in straight line indian must have followed at run contenting with seeing trail here there came across two three little stream running down toward lake followed in case up in others down for considerable distance leaving bed where bush grew thick hid mark of foot a stepped out from water harold must gladly have gone at run peter never quickened pace knew that indian must not pick up trail at rate faster than at be going that great delay must be caused at of little stream a must be uncertain whether have passed up down a time passed indian yell have when first entered wood sounded so alarmingly near died away perfect stillness reigned in forest be late in afternoon before peter halted can rest now said will be hour before critter can be here now let have tea began to look for dried stick harold offered to assist sit down scout said nice sort of fire must get with stick of picking up why must have smoke must bring injun in wood on to stick a seneca will pick up wo give a much smoke a can put in teacup must risk even that if be nigh lake for might be seen by redskin out in canoe be mile back from lake there aint other open space where must get view over tree top harold watched indian scout collecting dry leaf stick took particular notice for future use of kind selected light be struck with flint steel soon bright blaze sprang up without so far a harold must see slightest smoke being given off then hunter produced food from wallet tin pot have at last spring passed filled skin hung on shoulder with water be soon boiling over fire handful of tea be thrown in pot removed flour mixed with water be placed on small iron plate be put on red hot ash few cake be baked with cold venison tea ample meal be made after nearly hour halt again proceeded on way consultation have taken place between peter seneca a to best course to be pursued must without much difficulty risk have continued way through wood beyond lake be important that must reach other side by evening of following day to give warning of intended attack by american there be knew other redskin in wood besides on trail nearer approached shore greater danger have determined that must at hazard endeavor to obtain canoe cross lake until continued course then knowing that trail must no longer be followed made down to lake be many mile distant from harold be completely worn out when at last saw gleam of water through tree be not yet to rest entering lake began wading through at few foot from edge after hour walking thus entered bush thickly covered shore made way through until came to spot sufficiently open for to lie down harold wrapping in blanket carried over shoulder be sound asleep in le than minute when woke sun be shining brightly get up youngster be in luck scout said here be canoe with two of varmint making toward shore by way be going will land not far off scout led way crawling on hand knee to water edge to where seneca be sitting watching canoe through cover of green leaf course that boat be taking must lead to point three hundred yard from where be sitting will have difficulty in managing harold said grasped rifle eagerly not too fast peter said chance be that varmint have friend on shore like enough have be out fishing shore formed slight sweep at point bush in be hidden occupied point at one extremity in center of little bay there be spot clear from bush to canoe be directed a approached shore two other indian appeared at water edge one of asked question in reply paddler held up large bunch of fish just a thought like enough there be dozen of there said peter on reaching shore men sprang out taking fish with canoe be fastened by head rope to bush indian moved short distance inland there be smoke peter said indicating point thirty foot from lake so slight be that even when be pointed out to harold must hardly make out light mist rising from among bush presently looked round for seneca indian have disappeared be gone scouting peter said in answer to harold question ef there be only four of must be easy job expect there be more of red varmint there in ten minute seneca returned a noiselessly a have gone opened hand finger twice third time showed only three finger thirteen peter said too many of even for sudden onslaught indian said few word to peter latter nodded deer tail again quietly stole away be going to steal boat peter said be risky job for where lie can be seen by a sit now must be ready with shooting iron to cover if need be ef be found out before get boat will take to wood lead away from ef be fairly in boat then must do best for ef wust come to wust reckon can hold bush agin for time in end disguise from ye youngster will beat harold now sat intently watching canoe seemed age to before saw hand emerge from bush take hold of head rope motion given to canoe be so slight a to be almost imperceptible seemed a if be only drifting gently before slight breeze be creeping over surface of lake half length have disappeared from open space when indian appeared by edge of water looked at canoe looked over lake withdrew again hand have disappeared in bush on approach movement of canoe slight a be have caught eye satisfied that be caused only by wind have returned to fire again hand appeared again through bush canoe be drawn along until hidden from sight of sitting by fire again watchful indian appeared boat be lying quietly by bush at full length of head rope stooped down to see that be securely fastened again retired harold held breath expecting moment presence of seneca must be discovered scarcely have indian disappeared than seneca crawled out from bush with sweep of knife cut rope of canoe noiselessly entered a did so gave shove with foot sent dancing along shore toward spot where harold companion be hidden then seized paddle in dozen stroke brought within reach of harold peter stepped into a did so there be sudden shout indian have again strolled down to look at canoe whose movement slight a have be have appeared suspicious to now to astonishment saw at point with two white men indian on board have left gun behind uttering war cry bounded back for round p'int quick peter exclaimed will riddle in open two stroke took canoe round projecting point of bush then darted along shore driven by greatest effort of three paddler be capable have shore be open indian must have gained upon be unable to force way through thick bush at anything like rate at canoe be flying over water first start be upward of hundred yard be increased by fifty before indian arriving at point opened distance be beyond anything like accurate range with indian gun several bullet struck water round canoe now steer out peter said a firing suddenly ceased be making detour among bush will come down ahead of if keep near shore two three more shot be fired without effect canoe soon left shore far behind now peter said think be safe be not likely have canoe anywhere near on side a most of must have gone with expedition ef firing have be heard will not attract much attention being on side see nothing in way of boat out in lake still redskin eye can see beost distance now chief went on to indian in native language young un will lie down at bottom of boat do paddle quietly easily a ef be fishing canoe with single indian in will excite suspicion even ef see other canoe have better keep on in way unless see that of 'em be intending to overhaul chief nodded assent peter harold stretched at full length in canoe indian paddled quietly steadily on for hour not word be spoken in canoe harold several time dozed off to sleep at last seneca spoke many boat out on water american army harold be about to raise head to look out when peter exclaimed lie close harold ef head be shown now must be wuss than ef have sat up time know there be injun canoe with flat may be watching now may be long way off there be saying how far redskin eye can carry can see where be going to chief asked seneca be heading for isle aux noix a heard say be going to do seneca nodded going to island then peter said sooner be across lake better seneca again spoke after consultation with peter laid in paddle what be doing now harold asked course lie pretty near same way a theirs peter said island be short distance from shore near mouth of sorrel so where be going must take right across line fooled yesterday be not likely to do again to day so chief have stopped paddling make a if be fishing doubt whether will succeed for must hardly be fishing so far out will soon see be better so than to turn paddle in other direction a must be sure to excite suspicion fleet of boat have already passed spot where canoe must have crossed have be going directly across lake when be first seen be therefore now ahead of great flotilla kept on a if canoe with single occupant in rear have not excited suspicion seneca however knew that sharp eye must be upon manner in canoe have baffled pursuit day before must have inflicted severe blow upon pride of indian although having driven off lake must have reason for suspecting foe must have obtained fresh canoe seneca knew that vigilance must not sleep for moment therefore although bending over side of canoe a if watching line eye be never off boat there be canoe making for shore way said at last be time that white brother must take paddle peter harold at once sat up in boat looked round lake at point be about ten mile wide canoe be four mile from eastern side flotilla be mile further up lake same distance nearer to western shore four five canoe be detaching from flotilla apparently rowing direct for shore must have be easy for canoe to have regained eastern side long before must have be cut off here might find chippewa indian whose boat have taken must assuredly follow along shore of lake in hope that something might occur to drive back besides have landed there must be unable to carry in time news of approaching attack upon st john for same reason be important to land up lake near canadian end peter rapidly took in situation saw that be possible only just possible to reach shore at point opposite to at now be before hostile canoe must cut off from if headed there must be obliged to run down to other end of lake before effecting landing while must not calculate on being able to beat canoe most of carried four paddler who must strain nerve to retrieve failure of previous day not word be spoken a boat darted through water harold unaccustomed to judge distance must form idea whether distant canoe must must not intercept at present seemed to to be running toward shore on nearly parallel course shorter distance that indian must have to row seemed to place far ahead course however be not parallel a indian be gradually turning canoe to intercept course of be pursuing a minute went by boat converged more more toward same point harold saw how close race must be after twenty minute hard paddling boat be within quarter of mile of other course be respectively taking seemed likely to bring together at about quarter of mile from shore there be three indian canoe kept well together so close did race appear that harold expected moment to see peter sweep head of canoe round make stern chase of by running down lake peter have intention of doing canoe saw traveled a fast a own must spare man to fire occasionally while companion must be obliged to continue paddling better accustomed to judge distance than harold be sure at speed at be going must be able to pas somewhat ahead of foe row know harold said now chief send along harold have be rowing to utmost of strength felt by way canoe quivered at stroke that companion be only now putting out extreme strength boat seemed to fly through water began to think for first time that canoe must pas ahead of pursuer latter be clearly also conscious of fact for now turned boat head more toward shore so that spot where line must meet must be close to shore canoe be now within two hundred yard of other indian be nearer to shore oblique line that be following must give about equal distance to row to point for be making harold must not see that there be slightest difference in rate at be traveling seemed to that four canoe must arrive precisely at same moment at land be now five six hundred yard distant two minute paddling when canoe be seventy eighty yard apart peter with sweep with paddle turned boat head nearly half round made obliquely for shore so throwing pursuer almost astern of shore be three hundred yard distant be fifty ahead of pursuer latter gave loud yell at seeing change in position in chase have of course foreseen possibility of such movement have be powerless to prevent be prepared for on instant one man in canoe dropped paddle standing up fired be difficult thing to take aim when standing in canoe dancing under vigorous stroke of three paddler be more difficult since canoe be at moment sweeping round to follow movement of chase three ball whistled closely round canoe one be hit loss of three paddler for even so short time checked pace of canoe indian saw that must not hope to overtake foe whose canoe be now few length from shore dropped paddle man seized rifle moment nine piece must have poured fire into canoe about fifty yard ahead of when from bush on shore three puff of smoke shot out three of indian fell one of upsetting boat in fall yell of surprise dismay broke from gun be thrown down paddle grasped again head of canoe turned from shore indian in overturned boat did not wait to right scrambled into other canoe be soon paddling at top of speed from shore not without further damage for gun in bush again spoke out peter seneca added fire instant leaped from boat to shore of indian be seen to fall harold be too breathless when reached bank to be able to fire raised gun hand trembled with exertion that have undergone beating of heart short panting breath rendered impossible for to take steady aim minute later jake burst way through bush ah massa harold exclaimed bress de lord dat be here what fright hab giben to be sure hab be watching for long time ephraim de redskin dey say dey saw little spot far out on lake behind dose boat den dey say other boat set off in chase for long time jake see nothing about dat at last see dem den hurry along de shore so a to get near de place to where de boat row ebery moment tink dat dey catch up ephraim say bery close thing tink come along first dat must shoot when dey come close stand watch for time den ephraim say dat able to get to dat point hab to turn along de shore so change place run along sure 'nough de boat head turn come along in front of den shoot redskin dey tumble over well jake be fortunate indeed that be on spot for must scarcely have missed of besides even if have got to shore safely must have followed odds against must have be heavy that ar war close shave peter ephraim said fired close shave call war ephraim mistake why did yer head down along lake because got news that colonist air going to attack st john to morrow want to get to fort in time to put on guard besides side of lake be sure to be full of hostile injun canoe paddled a fast a did in long run might have worn out did have fight on lake two night ago redskin thought heard firing have skirmish with 'em peter said pretty sharp shave war too managed to slip away from altogether have have mighty close work can tell yer thought more than once a be going to be wiped out while be speaking men have already started at steady pace through wood away from lake having first drawn up canoe carefully concealed be late at night when reached fort st john message be at once dispatched to party of seneca who be at village about sixteen mile away arrived in morning together with portion of garrison moved out took place in wooded marshy ground between fort river scout be sent along sorrel returned about one o'clock saying that large number of boat be coming down lake from isle aux noix have be determined to allow colonist to land without resistance a commander of fort felt doubt of ability with assistance of indian ally to repulse attack twelve hundred men be landed at once began to advance toward fort lead by two general schuyler montgomery scarcely have entered swamp when from bush fire be opened upon invader be staggered pushed forward in weak undecided way a far a creek intercepted path in vain general montgomery endeavored to encourage to advance wavered soon began to fall back in hour from time of landing be again gathered on bank of river here threw up breastwork a number be greatly inferior british officer in command thought unadvisable to attack after colonist took to boat returned to isle aux loss in first attempt at invasion of canada being nine men day two later indian again attempted to induce general carleton to permit to cross frontier carry war into american settlement upon general renewed refusal left camp in anger remained from time altogether aloof from contest st john be now left with only own small garrison captain wilson be ordered to fall back with company to montreal being considered that garrison of st john be sufficient to defend place for considerable time a soon a indian have marched away having sent word to colonist that must take further part in fight montgomery who be now in command schuyler having fallen sick landed whole of force invested fort american officer ethan allen have be sent with party to try to raise colonist in rebellion in neighborhood of chamblee have with american be joined by canadian dazzled by success have attended surprise of ticonderoga thought to repeat stroke by conquest of montreal crossed river in night about three mile below city peter other scout who have be watching movement crossed higher up brought news men of twenty sixth regiment captain wilson company loyal canadian whole under command of major campbell attacked ethan allen be speedily routed with of men taken prisoner siege of st john made little progress place be well provisioned american encamped in low swampy ground around suffered much from ill health men be mutinous insolent officer incapable disobedient so far invasion of canada of such great thing have be hoped by american appeared likely to turn out complete failure chapter viii quebec general carleton seeing that montgomery whole force be retained idle before st john began to hope that winter must come to assistance before invader have made serious progress unfortunately have not reckoned on utter incapacity of officer in command of fort chamblee major stopford of seventh regiment have men few artilleryman fort be strong well provided with provision american spy have found inhabitant around place favorable to american major brown be sent down by montgomery with small detachment being joined by inhabitant sat down before fort have only two six pounder must have effected nothing have fort be commanded by man of bravery resource such be not character of commander who after siege of only day half surrendered place with store be of inestimable value to invader who be upon edge of giving up siege of fort ammunition being entirely exhausted six ton of gunpowder seventeen cannon mortar musket fell into hand enabled to carry on siege of st john with renewed vigor there be excuse for conduct of major stopford in allowing store to fall into hand of american a even have not possessed courage to defend fort might before surrendering have thrown whole of ammunition into river upon there be safe sally port where must have carried on operation entirely unmolested by enemy color of seventh regiment be captured sent to congress a first trophy of war siege of st john be now pushed on by montgomery with vigor colonel maclean with indian canadian attempted to relieve crossing st lawrence in small boat on nearing other bank be received by so heavy fire by american posted there that be obliged to retire without effecting landing provision ammunition be now running short in st john there be hope whatever of relief from outside officer commanding be therefore obliged to surrender on november after gallant defense a there be only fifty sixty regular in montreal general carleton be unable to defend town upon news of fall of st john at once retired to quebec montreal be occupied by american in meantime expedition have be dispatched by american under arnold officer with men have started for quebec from point mile north of boston suffering enormous fatigue hardship force made way up river past rapid cataract through swamp dragged carried boat store followed bed of river up to source then crossing watershed descended chaudiere duloup river on to st lawrence within few mile of quebec be wonderful march one scarcely equaled in annals of military history crossing st lawrence in canoe arnold encamped with little force upon height of abraham such daring attempt must not have be undertaken have not american be aware of extreme weakness of garrison at quebec consisted only of men of seventh regiment of canadian militia battalion of seaman from ship of war under command of captain hamilton of lizard strong colonial volunteer under colonel maclean fortification be in ruinous condition be fortunate that colonel maclean who have come from sorrel upon surrender of st john by forced march arrived on very day on arnold appeared before city directly arrived arnold attacked city at gate of st louis be sharply repulsed then desisted from active operation awaited arrival of montgomery who be marching down from montreal flotilla in carleton be descending river be attacked by american who came down sorrel be captured with troop military store be bringing down general carleton escaped in small boat under cover of night reached quebec captain wilson company have be attached to command of colonel maclean with arrived in quebec in safety upon arrival of montgomery with army city be summoned to surrender strong party in town be favorable to invader general carleton treated summons with contempt turned inhabitant who refused to join in defense of city outside town winter have now set in in earnest difficulty of besieger be great arnold force have be much weakened by hardship that have undergone montgomery by desertion battery erected be overpowered by fire of defender siege made progress whatever men became more more disaffected mutinous many of have nearly served time for have enlisted montgomery feared that must leave when engagement came to end in vain tempted besieged to make sally carleton be so certain that success must come by waiting that refused to allow to hazard by sortie weather be fighting for besieger have before only alternative of taking place by storm abandoning siege altogether resolved upon storm be to take place at daybreak on december montgomery determined to make four attack two false two real one colonel james livingstone with canadian be to appear before st john gate party under colonel brown be to feign movement against upper town from high ground there be to send up rocket a signal for real attack to commence led by montgomery from south that under arnold from northwest against lower town false attack be made too soon rocket being fired hour before main column reached place of attack british be not deceived judging attack to be feint left small party to oppose marched bulk of force down toward lower town assistance however came too late for before arrived fate of attack be already decided american advanced under circumstance of great difficulty furious wind with cutting hail blew in face ground be slippery covered with snow hour before english support arrived on spot montgomery with leading company reached first barricade be undefended passing through pressed on toward next road leading to be only wide enough for five six person abreast on one side be river on other steep cliff in front be log hut with loop hole for musketry battery of two three pounder be held by party of canadian militiaman under john coffin with sailor under bairnsfeather captain of transport to work gun montgomery with men pushed on at run to carry battery when within fifty yard bairnsfeather discharged piece be loaded with grape shot with deadly aim montgomery aid de camp macpherson lieutenant cheeseman others fell dead at first discharge with soul of expedition fled remaining officer endeavored to get men to advance none must do so fell back without losing man so completely cowed be that must not even carry off body of general companion be brought into quebec next day buried with honor of war by garrison force under arnold be far stronger than under montgomery canadian guard appointed to defend first barrier fled at approach small body of sailor fought bravely be killed wounded arnold be shot through leg disabled morgan who commanded advanced company led men on carried second barrier after obstinate resistance be attacking third when maclean with men from upper town arrived british then took offensive drove enemy back party going round fell upon rear fifty be killed in arnold column taken prisoner rest retreated in extreme disorder thus ended assault upon assault be hopeless from first in american showed little valor determination in fact throughout war may be said that american when fighting on defensive behind tree intrenchment fought stubbornly that be feeble in attack wholly incapable of standing against british troop in open must now have be easy for carleton to have sallied out taken offensive preferred holding quebec quietly might have easily driven american from position before wall with handful of troop under order must have done nothing toward carrying on serious campaign in open until spring came river be opened re enforcement must reach from england while american must send number of troop into canada carleton therefore preferred to wait quietly within wall of quebec allowing winter hardship disunion to work natural effect upon invader arnold sent to washington to demand more troop with siege artillery several regiment be sent forward artillery must not be spared eight regiment entered canada found that instead of meeting a have expected enthusiastic reception from inhabitant population be now hostile to exaction of invading army have be great feeling in favor of english be now universal on may two frigate sloop of war made way up river to quebec american endeavored to embark sick artillery above town re enforced by marine garrison sallied out attacked enemy who fled with precipitation leaving provision cannon five hundred musket two hundred sick behind british pursued until reached mouth of sorrel arrival of fleet from england brought news of what have taken place since captain wilson company have marched from boston short time after battle of bunker hill immediately after battle colonist have sent two deputy penn lee with petition to parliament for restoration of peace petition be supported by strong body in parliament majority however argued that from conduct of american be clear that aimed at unconditional unqualified total independence in proceeding have behaved a if entirely separated from great britain profession petition breathed peace moderation action preparation denoted war defiance attempt must be made to soften hostility have be in obstinacy be inflexible more england have given in to wish more insolent overbearing have demand become stamp tax have be repealed ill will have grown rather than abated taxation on import have be entirely taken off save on one small item rather than pay have accumulated arm ammunition seized cannon belonging to king everywhere prepared for armed resistance only two alternative remained for british nation to adopt to coerce colonist to submission to grant entire independence argument be well founded concession have be made have encouraged colonist to demand more good must have come from entering into negotiation there remained two alternative must have be far better have parliament instead of deciding on coercion withdrawn altogether from colony for although american have shown no great fighting quality be clear that so small army a england must spare must not permanently keep down so vast country if people be determined upon independence might win battle might overpower considerable force gathered against must only enforce king authority over mere fractional portion of so great area england however be unaccustomed to defeat spirit in day be proud high by large majority parliament voted for continuance of war next step taken be one unworthy of country tended still further to embitter war added to strength of party in favor of colonist at home attempt be made by government to obtain service of large number of foreign troop negotiation be entered into with russia holland hesse other country most of proved ineffectual considerable number of troop be obtained from news of proceeding excited american to renewed effort force under washington be strengthened took possession of dorchester height commanding town of boston heavy cannonade be opened on city british gun answered american position gave immense advantage general howe who be in command at first thought of attempting to storm height tremendous loss sustained at battle of bunker hill deterred from undertaking supineness during past four month have virtually lost american colony to england have under command troop who must have routed with ease undisciplined levy of washington instead of leading men out against enemy have suffered to be cooped up for month in city have failed to take possession of various height commanding town have done boston might have resisted force many time a strong a advanced against there be now nothing left for english to storm height with enormous loss to evacuate city first be alternative have be chosen when american seized bunker hill second be that be now adopted having adopted resolution howe carried out in manner must in be sufficient to condemn a military leader nothing be done to destroy vast store of arm ammunition two hundred fifty piece of cannon be left for colonist to use against england step be taken to warn ship arriving from england of surrender of town consequence be that in addition to vast amount of store captured in town number of british storeships fell into hand of american among vessel in addition to carbine bayonet gun carriage other store have on board more than seventy ton of powder while washington whole stock be exhausted worse even than hurried unnecessary abandonment of vast munition of war be desertion of loyalist population boston be full of loyalist among whom be many of wealthier better born person in colony who from commencement of trouble have left home fortune family to rally round standard of sovereign very least that howe must have done for loyal men must have be to have entered into term of capitulation with washington whereby might have be permitted to depart to home to enjoyment of property nothing of sort be attempted only choice offered to loyalist be to remain in town exposed to certain insult ill treatment perhaps to death at hand of rebel to leave in transport for england halifax to be landed here penniless starving howe conduct in be on piece with behavior throughout campaign be little if at inferior to other general who vied with other in incapacity folly never in whole history of england be troop led by men so inefficient so sluggish so incapable a who commanded army in american revolutionary war first ship from england arrived at quebec be followed few day later by niger triton convoy transport with troop british now took offensive in earnest from west captain forster marched from detroit with men of eighth regiment canadian

fleet at disposal have placed couple of frigate in east river between long island new york escape must have be impossible general washington army of men must have be taken prisoner whether misfortune must have proved conclusive of war be now too late to speculate so splendid opportunity be never before let slip by english general negligence be more inexcusable inasmuch a fleet of boat must be seen

america latter have never declared independent until former have made war upon even if congress be willing to place america in former situation must not do so a declaration of independence have be made in consequence of congregated voice of whole people by whom alone must be abolished country be determined not to return under domination of england negotiation be therefore broken off lord howe published declaration to people of america giving answer of committee to offer of reconciliation acquainted with fact that parent country be willing to receive into bosom protection who might be willing to return to former obedience in taking step lord howe be convinced that majority of inhabitant of america be still willing to enter into accommodation of difference between two power

eighty four boat sailed up river landed on manhattan island at place called kipp bay occupied height of inclenberg enemy abandoning intrenchment at approach general washington rode toward kipp bay to take command of troop stationed there found men who have be posted at line running away brigade must have supported flying in direction heedless of exertion of general puttenham division of men be still in lower city must be cut off unless british advance must be checked washington therefore made greatest effort to rally fugitive to get to make stand to check advancing enemy in vain for a soon a even small body of redcoat be seen advancing broke fled in panic howe a usual delayed giving order for advance thus permitted whole of puttenham brigade who be cut off must have be taken prisoner to escape unharmed thus with comparatively little loss american drew off leaving behind only few heavy cannon bayonet store so rapid have be flight at approach of english that only fifteen be killed two men falling on english side chapter ix surprise of trenton american finding that be not pursued rallied from panic took up position at harlem kingsbridge so great be disorganization among have british advanced at once must have taken place with scarcely loss strong a be by nature by intrenchment washington have prepared great number deserted dispute broke out between troop of various state insubordination prevailed whole army be utterly disheartened by easy victory british have obtained over reported cowardice of troop to congress who passed law inflicting punishment of death for cowardice before leaving new york american have made preparation for burning whole town speediness of retreat prevented preparation being carried into effect fire be set to in several place third of town be destroyed position taken up by enemy be so strong that be determined to operate in rear redoubt be thrown up to cover new york during absence of main part of british force portion of british army be landed at point threatening retreat of american series of skirmish of great importance took place enemy fell back from most advanced work general move be undertaken although a number on side be about even superior fighting power of english have be amply demonstrated there must have be doubt a to result of general battle lord howe however wasted time in series of petty movement although generally successful have influence upon result served only to enable american to recover from utter depression have fallen upon after evacuation of long island loss of new york gradually american fell back across country so swampy difficult that be now no longer possible to bring on general action retreat have effect of isolating important position of kingsbridge fort washington latter post be of utmost importance inasmuch a secured american intercourse with jersey shore fortification be very strong stood upon rising open ground be garrisoned by of best american troop under command of colonel magaw washington be gradually withdrawing army have already given order fort washington must be evacuated general lee who be second in command so strongly urged that must be retained greatly against own judgment be obliged to consent to being defended especially a colonel magaw insisted that fort must stand siege on night of november british passed troop across creek lord howe summoned place to surrender on pain of garrison being put to sword magaw have upon previous day received large number of re enforcement replied that must defend fort soon after daybreak on th artillery opened on side five thousand hessian under command of general knyphausen moved up hill penetrated of advanced work of enemy took post within hundred yard of fort second division consisting of guard light infantry with two battalion of hessian thirty third regiment landed at island creek after stiff fighting forced enemy from rock tree up steep rugged mountain third fourth division fought way up through similar defense so steep be hill that assailant must only climb by grasping tree bush so obstinate be defense that troop be sometimes mixed up together bravery superior number of british troop bore down resistance whole of four division reached place round fort then summoned to surrender commander after hour consideration seeing impossibility of resisting assault be threatened opened gate upon english side about men be killed wounded of whom majority be hessian troop fought with extreme bravery american loss owing to superior position be about killed wounded prisoner taken amounted to over on th lord howe landed strong body on jersey shore under lord cornwallis who marched to fort lee surprised deserter have informed enemy of approach garrison have fled in disorder leaving tent provision military store behind lord cornwallis pushing forward with great energy drove american out of new jersey expedition occupied rhode island cold weather now set in english went into winter quarter success have be complete without single check have be led vigorously army of washington might on two occasion have be wholly destroyed in such case moderate portion of population of colony must have obtained hearing peace honorable to party might have be arrived at advantage gained by gallantry of british troop be however entirely neutralized by lethargy inactivity of general colonist have time given to recover from alarm defeat of troop have given to put army in field to prepare on great scale for following campaign conduct of general howe in allowing washington army to retire almost unmolested be to officer who served under unaccountable arrangement for winter be even more singularly defective instead of concentrating troop scattered over wide extent of country at distance too great to support other thus left open to enemy to crush in detail general howe now issued proclamation offering free pardon to who surrendered great number of colonist came in made submission even in longing for peace be so strong that general washington be obliged to send force there to prevent town from declaring for england during operation have taken place since landing of british troop on long island captain wilson company have taken little part in operation have be straightforward work conducted on principle of european warfare service of volunteer a scout have not therefore be called into requisition success at first attended expedition have encouraged captain wilson to hope for first time since outbreak of revolution that english might obtain such decisive success that colonist must be willing to accept proposition of peace such a indicated by lord howe repeal of obnoxious law freedom from taxation except imposed by recognition of british authority when saw that lord howe instead of actively utilizing splendid force at disposal frittered away in minor movement allowed washington to withdraw with beaten army unmolested hope again faded felt that colonist must in long run succeed in gaining that contended for when army went into winter quarter company be ordered to take post on delaware there be four frontier post at trenton bordentown white horse burlington trenton opposite to lay washington with main body of army be held by only hessian bordentown be also on delaware be like trenton garrisoned by troop worse choice must have be made hessian be brave soldier ignorance of language of country made peculiarly unsuitable troop for outpost work a be unable to obtain information a foreigner too be greatly disliked by country people nothing be done to strengthen frontier post be left wholly without redoubt intrenchment into garrison must withdraw in case of attack captain wilson little company be to act a scout along line of frontier headquarters be fixed at bordentown where captain wilson obtained large house for use most of men be at home at work of kind peter lambton ephraim other frontiersman be dispatched from time to time in different

with chance of adventure life of exercise activity have led for more than year have strengthened muscle widened frame be now able to keep up with peter however long tiresome day work might be jake too be of party have developed into active soldier although be of little use for scouting purpose even peter did not object to accompanying for negro unfailing good temper willingness to make useful have made favorite with scout weather be now setting in exceedingly cold three men have more than once crossed delaware in canoe scouted in very heart of enemy country be now sitting by bank watching drifting ice upon river there wo be many more passage of river by water peter remarked ten day will be frozen across then can cross on foot peter yes can do that scout said so can enemy ef general have got interprise with ef can get chap a call soldier to fight will be crossing over one of night capturing hull of hessian at trenton what general howe mean by leaving there be more can think might

be doing other side of river air more than mere machine what be wanted be two three battalion of light troop who must make friend with country people larn be doing opposite if american be sharp will give lot of trouble winter will find there wo be much sitting quiet for at bordentown fortunately bordentown trenton aint far apart one garrison ought to be able to arrive to assistance of other before be overpowered will see now propose that cross again to night try find out what enemy doing then can come back manage for to eat christmas dinner with yer father a seem to have bent yer mind upon though why matter about dinner one day more than be more can see night three scout crossed river in canoe avoiding house kept many mile straight on beyond river lay down for few hour before morning dawned then turned face other way walked up to first farmhouse saw can have drink of milk hunter asked can farmer replied breakfast if like to pay for at first be glad to give best have to who came along there have be such number going one way other marching to join army running away to return to home must be ruined if gave to comer be ready to pay peter said drawing money from pocket then come in sit down in few minute excellent breakfast be put before be on way to join army of course farmer asked jest that peter replied think be about time to do little shooting though suppose there will be much done till spring know farmer said must not be surprised if general wake up german when delaware get frozen heard talk about from men who came past yesterday time be expired said be going home hear too that be gathering force down near mount holly reckon that be going to attack bordentown be that so peter asked in case might a well tramp in direction matter corn shuck to where fight so a be soon have come to help lick british mean to do ah farmer said have heard that sentiment good many time have not seen much come of yet so far seems to a licking have be other way be so peter agreed everyone know that american be just bravest people on face of habitable arth reckon dander not fairly up yet when begin in arnest will see what will do farmer gave grunt might mean anything have strong sympathy way conduct of numerous deserter disbanded men who have passed through neighborhood have be far from impressing favorably pretend to be strong for congress king want to be taxed see why colonist must not pay something toward expense of government now that parliament seems willing to give ask for see what want to go on fighting for waal peter exclaimed in tone of disgust be one of half hearted one be like great majority of people of country be of english stock want to break with old country affair have got into hand of preacher newspaper men chap want to push forward make pile out of war a read be just civil war in england over again be united at first against what considered a tyranny on part of parliament now have gone setting up demand one dreamed of at first most of object to now only have longer control of own affair great heart of country beat for freedom peter lambton said pooh said farmer contemptuously great heart of country want to work farm do business quietly english general have made fair offer might well be accepted a for freedom there be tyranny greater than of new england state a long a managed own affair there be freedom of speech religion sir what call freedom be simply freedom to make everyone else do think like majority waal wo argue out peter said for be not good at argument came here to fight not to talk besides want to get to mount holly in time to jine in battle so guess will be moving paying for breakfast started at once in direction of mount holly lay twenty five mile away a approached place early in afternoon overtook several men going in same direction entered into conversation with must only learn that of militia from philadelphia county of gloucester salem have arrived on spot men whom have overtaken be armed countryman who be going to take share in fight on own account entering place with others peter found that information given be correct better be out of at once said to harold make for bordentown think that there be much importance in movement harold said a tramped along there aint importance whatever peter said be what want to tell be never thinking of attacking two thousand hessian at bordentown with ragged lot what can have assembled for within twelve mile of place harold asked seems to hunter replied that be jest trick to draw german out from bordentown so away from trenton at rate be well that true account of force here must be known thing get magnified may think that there be hull army here be getting dusk when entered bordentown harold be glad when saw little town for since sunset on evening before have tramped nearly sixty mile place seemed singularly quiet asked first person met what have become of troop be told that colonel donop who commanded have marched hour before with whole force of men toward mount holly leaving only men in garrison at bordentown be too late harold said have gone by road kept straight through wood so missed waal hope harm come of suppose mean to attack at daylight in course rabble will run without fighting hope when colonel see a how thar be enemy ther worth speaking of will march straight back again unfortunately be not case militia according to order at once dispersed when outpost told of approach of british german officer instead of returning instantly remained for two day near mount holly so gave time to washington to carry out plan captain wilson company have gone out with force peter companion have house to that night harold slept late being thoroughly fatigued by long march day before carrying rifle blanket provision peter woke at last now young un have have good sleep be eleven o'clock be off to trenton to see what be doing there will go with will stop here on chance of eating dinner with father oh be christmas day harold said stretching well what do think peter be likely to come back not ought to be back there be doubt about whether will not be different affair altogether have never seed hurry yet not since war began thing must have gone good deal better if have time never seems of consequence to marched twelve mile last night reckon be likely will halt to day wo be back till to morrow feel oneasy in mind about whole affair for ca see single reason for enemy sending that weak force to mount holly unless be to draw away troop from here only motive there must be for must be because intended to attack trenton very well peter will go with accompanied by jake set out at once for trenton on arriving there found particular sign of vigilance since hessian have reached trenton discipline have much relaxed broad river separated from enemy who be known to be extremely discontented disorganized have received instruction on account to cross river to attack colonial natural consequence of forced inactivity have manifested discipline be lax slight watch be kept on movement of enemy across stream ignorant of language of people be incapable of distinguishing between who be friendly who be hostile to crown behaved a if in conquered country taking such necessary a required without payment even sending party to considerable distance on plundering expedition peter on arrival proceeded to headquarters of colonel rhalle who be in command officer of great bravery energy one of officer be able to speak english to peter reported departure of force from bordentown of colonel rhalle be already aware weakness of american force at mount holly stated also own belief that be merely feint to draw off colonel donop preparatory to attack on trenton officer treated information lightly pointing to mass of ice floating down river asked whether must be possible for boat to cross when river freeze said there may be chance of attack till then be absolutely safe peter shaking head rejoined companion told of manner in advice have be received must be difficult to cross river harold said look at mass of ice on water must be difficult hunter admitted not by manner of mean impossible determined men must do waal have done duty can do more ef night pass off quietly will cross again before daybreak go right into yankee camp see what be up to now harold can take easy till nightfall there be naught to be learned till then a will be on foot night ye may a well sleep to day returning to spot on bank of river at short distance from town made fire on jake cooked steak of venison have procured after smoking pipe hunter set example by stretching on ground near fire going to sleep used a be to night march have acquired faculty of going to sleep at hour at will jake harold be time before followed example too be at last asleep at sunset be on foot again after taking supper proceeded along river night passed off quietly harold became convinced that companion fear be unfounded toward morning suggested that be time to be crossing river be not going yet hunter said before start will go down to trenton ferry mile below town ef come over at be likely enough to be there there will be time then to get back cross before be light be six o'clock now kept along road by river until be within quarter of mile of ferry presently saw dark mass ahead jerusalem peter exclaimed there be immediately discharged rifle ran back at full speed to outpost be quarter of mile from town american have also pressed forward at full speed outpost who have be alarmed by discharge of rifle be forced at once to abandon post to run into town whither have on hearing rifle already sent in one of number with news here be in confusion hessian leader be trying to collect troop who be hurrying in from quarter many of thought more of storing plunder away in wagon than of taking place in rank washington have crossed with men few field piece upon gaining jersey side have divided troop into two detachment one of marched by river side other by upper road hurrying forward surrounded town placing field piece in road opened fire on astonished hessian rhalle have by time succeeded in assembling greater part of force charged american with usual courage received however mortal wound a advanced troop immediately lost heart finding retreat cut off at once surrendered body of hessian light horse succeeded in making escape casualty be few on side prisoner be taken two other division of american have attempted to cross one at bordentown other at mackenzie ferry have failed owing to quantity of floating ice washington retired across delaware same afternoon consequence of success be great spirit of american have fallen to lowest ebb in consequence of uninterrupted series of defeat rose greatly found that british be not invincible that if unable to oppose in great battle might at least inflict heavy loss on weary out with skirmish surprise greatest joy reigned throughout various state fresh levy be ordered voice of moderate party have be gaining strength be silenced determination to continue war vigorously be in ascendency lesson given at trenton be wholly lost upon english commander in chief instead of at once ordering general leslie to advance from princeton to hold enemy in check by reoccupying fortifying trenton allowed colonel donop to abandon bordentown to fall back to princeton thus laying open to washington to cross delaware again carry war into new jersey washington after waiting eight day seeing indecision ineptitude of british general again crossed with men occupied trenton peter lambton two companion be not among prisoner taken at trenton on entering town harold be about to join hessian assembling under colonel rhalle peter gave violent tug to coat come along young un said darned fool have let be caught in trap will find there be way out of in ten minute american will be round place a wish to spend year two in yankee prison at present be going to make track at once fighting be no good now men who will let be caught in trap like will never be able to cut way out of come on much against will harold yielded to peter wish three kept straight on through town by river side issued into country beyond before american have surrounded minute two after leaving town light horse galloped past there be more out of hole reckon be about there do hear gun yank have brought artillery over reckon fight wo last long for two three minute there be roar of musketry then suddenly ceased thought a much peter said have surrendered if have only kept together fought well must have cut way through enemy lord what poor thing regular soldier be in dark frontiersman must just a soon fight in dark a in light here be men who climbed up hill to fort washington be child play no better pack of woman when be attacked half asleep half awake just a day be breaking three comrade walked to bordentown be relieved to find have not be attacked few mile beyond place met colonel donop marching back at full speed with corp having received news of disaster at trenton from horseman who have fled joined company marched to princeton fortnight later lord cornwallis with force at brunswick under general grant advanced to princeton then moved forward to attack army at trenton general washington on approach retired from town crossing rivulet at back of took post on high ground there with apparent intention of defending against attack be late in afternoon heavy cannonade be kept up till night time lord cornwallis determined to attack next morning at two in morning washington retired suddenly leaving fire burning quitting main road made long circuit through allentown marched with speed toward princeton place intended to surprise when lord cornwallis advanced have left seventeenth fortieth fifty fifth regiment there on arriving at trenton have sent word back for seventeenth fifty fifth to advance to maidenhead village halfway between princeton trenton colonel mawhood who commanded marched at daylight scarcely have started when met washington advancing with army morning be foggy be at first supposed that enemy be body of british troop marching back to princeton be soon found that force be hostile one strength must not be seen on account of fog determined to engage possessing of high ground sent wagon back to princeton ordered fortieth regiment to come out to assistance a american advanced artillery on side opened fire leading column of colonist soon showed sign of disorder seventeenth regiment fixed bayonet with great gallantry charged enemy in front of driving back with considerable slaughter so far did advance that be separated from other battalion cutting way through american force regiment pursued march to maidenhead fortieth fifty fifth fought stoutly be unable to make way through american force fell back to brunswick while american occupied princeton at daybreak lord cornwallis discovered retreat of american army being apprehensive for safety of brunswick where great store of army be accumulated marched with haste toward town brigadier matthew officer commanding there on hearing of approach of enemy at once dispatched store wagon toward rear drew up small command to defend place to last gallant resistance before princeton have delayed american so long that van of army of cornwallis be already close to rear a approached brunswick seeing washington abandoned design on town crossed millstone river breaking down bridge at kingston to stop pursuit washington now overran east west jersey penetrated into essex county making master of country opposite to staten island thus regained almost district english have taken from in autumn greatly heightened spirit courage of american while loyalist english troop be disheartened disgusted at seeing army of fine troop kept inactive while enemy with men who be wholly incapable of opposing equal number of english troop be allowed to wander unchecked to attack harass english picket to utilize whole of resource of country have general howe entertained fixed desire to see english authority overthrown in america must not have acted in manner more calculated to carry wish into effect chapter x treacherous planter must not be supposed that whole of time be spent in scouting fighting between army lay band of man land here a elsewhere people of country be divided in opinion generally made very little display of might be be true that a rule non combatant be little interfered with still warm open display of sympathy with one side other be likely to be attended by loss of cattle damage to crop when other party got upper hand in other state feeling ran much higher in carolina royalist be most cruelly persecuted property be destroyed be in many case shot down without mercy generally throughout colony considerable latitude of opinion be allowed be especially so in zone between army in jersey none must tell what position of army week hence might be persecution inflicted by one party might lead to retaliation upon shift of position few week later general toleration therefore reigned next to peter lambton harold greatest friend in corp be young man named harvey be of good family belonged to new york being strong loyalist have like many other gentleman enlisted for service under old flag have naturally many acquaintance among county family harold often accompanied in visit to one other of during winter when thing be quiet duty of scout be light be habit among one third must be on outpost duty at time rest being free to move about a liked scout have fixed order of position went out alone in two three a pleased duty simply being to watch everything be going on along enemy line of outpost to bring earliest news of intended movement to prevent dashing party of enemy horseman from making raid into behind british line be not of course expected to check body of cavalry starting on raid simply to obtain information of having left line of direction taken then to hurry back to british post whence force of cavalry must be sent out to intercept check invader many dashing exploit be performed by cavalry on side in way of getting behind opponent quarter cutting off provision train attacking small post carrying off straggling party one of house to harold used most frequently to accompany friend harvey be situated nearly halfway between rival army be about eight mile from owner mr jackson be man of considerable wealth house be large well appointed have before trouble began fine business a lawyer in new york a outbreak of hostility put stop to business of legal kind in city have retired to country house although born in england professed to be entirely neutral family be undisguisedly loyal consisted of wife two daughter girl of seventeen eighteen year old when english army advanced to neighborhood of property mr jackson be always ready to offer hospitality to officer of corp might be stationed near similarly opened house to american when in turn advanced a british turned back being a always made point of saying perfectly neutral in struggle be glad to meet gentleman irrespective of opinion held line taken by mr jackson be one be very largely pursued among inhabitant of country house farm scattered over what be throughout war debatable land so frequent be change of position of army that none must say who might be in possession in week time be therefore absolute necessity for who wished to live unmolested to abstain from stronger show of partisanship a be always case in struggle of kind female population be more enthusiastic in partisanship more pronounced in opinion than men although upon arrival of troop of cavalry detachment of foot belonging to other side master of house must impartially offer what hospitality be capable of be not difficult to perceive by warmth coldness of female welcome be private sentiment of family harold be not long in discovering from frequency with harvey proposed excursion to jackson from conduct there that isabelle eldest daughter be object mainly attracted family have long be friend harvey although now serving a simple scout be of position equal to own friend be always cordially received by mr jackson harold be soon a intimate there a comrade usually left quarter little before dusk started back late at night often a mr jackson pressed to stay never accepted invitation scout from activity ubiquitousness be betes noirs of american whose most secret plan be constantly detected foiled by sagacity watchfulness of men whose unerring rifle made frequent gap in rank of officer therefore spared pain whenever there be chance of killing capturing of most troublesome foe harvey harold knew that report of presence at jackson must suffice to bring party of horseman from american line visit therefore be always made after dark at irregular interval in spite of inclination to contrary made point of returning at night to quarter other visitor be often present at jackson son daughter of neighbor there be generally music singing sometimes young people stood up for dance scout wore regular uniform although there be general similarity in attire be that of ordinary backwoods hunter when off duty be allowed to dress a pleased at mr jackson two friend be attired in ordinary dress of colonist of position at little gathering political subject be never discussed stranger spending evening there must not have dreamed that house stood between two hostile army at moment party of horseman belonging to one side other might dash into courtyard that even laughing talking pleasantly together might be of opinion diametrically opposed harvey harold be introduced to visitor simply a friend from new york although suspicion a to character position might be strong one thought of asking question like fellow chermside harvey said one night a friend be returning to quarter be mounted for although when on duty scout worked on foot many of who be men of property kept horse used when not engaged harvey have two horse one of be always at harold service be not surprised like harold replied with laugh imagine dislike be mutual when two gentleman be paying attention to one young lady seldom appreciate other merit very cordially think be entirely that harvey laughed isabella understand other have fear of rivalry like think like harold said more seriously yet know why must not when have be there alone with family have frequently used expression showing strong leaning toward loyalist side put much faith in harvey said know how strongly mr jackson girl lean toward crown must say anything that thought must please isabelle have spoken to think that be sincere in fact have rather good opinion of however will see be rather curious that party of morgan cavalry must have ridden up other night searched house two hour after left see have agreed to sleep there that night only changed mind after others have left when remembered that be for duty early next morning might have be coincidence of course have ugly look think mr jackson thought so too for did not ask to stop to night anyhow wish chermside plantation be not so near that did not drop in so often week later paid visit when dinner be over harold be chatting with mr mr jackson harvey be sitting at piano where eldest girl be playing younger be looking out of window be going to have fall of snow said there be not star to be seen oh exclaimed suddenly what be dear mr jackson asked there be rocket gone up from wood rocket mr jackson repeated yes papa there be star falling now be curious thing mr jackson said while others went to window stood watching for minute nothing be to be seen like rocket mr jackson said a left window mean something can only be signal people let off rocket for amusement nowadays did meet anyone on road sir harvey said not soul like host repeated mean mischief of sort other wish to seem inhospitable advice to be get on horse at once ride to quarter be on duty to morrow told must pas near here on way toward enemy line might look in a go past hear whether anything came of if mistake not will have visit from morgan

chermside be that henceforth scout be again a successful a before often surprising enemy successfully now that ford nearest mr jackson be strongly guarded young men have apprehension of surprise although such event be just possible a cavalry on side often made great circuit in raid upon other country that chermside be somewhere in neighborhood believed having indeed strong reason for doing so

heard in forest once party of four american frontiersman be seen in wood party halted crouched in bush seneca turned toward peter a if asking if attack must be made latter shook head single shot must have be heard far away in wood further progress must have be arrested object now be not to fight to penetrate close to american intrenchment when enemy have passed on party continued way a neared fort caution observed increased several time halted while seneca with one of brave crawled forward to see that be clear at last stood on edge of great clearing before just within gunshot range stood fort of ticonderoga peter lambton be well acquainted with beyond fact that space around have be cleared of tree stockade earthwork repaired little change must be seen a be gazing indian touched shoulder pointed to high hill on opposite side of narrow strait have be cleared of tree on top strong fort have be erected many cannon be to be seen along crest roof of hut large number of men halfway up hill be battery third still lower down to sweep landing have be working hard hunter said army will have mighty tough job before do think of harold be very strong position harold said will cost tremendous number of men to take fort can not be attacked till hill have be carried for gun completely command clearing for time stood gazing at work standing well back among tree so a to be screened from observation at last harold said look at other hill behind be good bit higher than have fortified must be within easy range of fort see work there do peter seneca chief gazed long earnestly at hill agreed that must see fortification there wo do to have doubt about peter said must go round have look at will have to cross river harold remarked ay cross must peter said that hill got to be inspected withdrew into wood again made circuitous deviation till came down upon river two mile above ticonderoga must not reach water a road ran along parallel with forest be cleared away for distance number of men must be seen going backward forward on road having made observation scout retired again into thick part of forest waited till nightfall how be to get across harold asked peter be good long swim must not carry musket ammunition across easy enough scout said did notice down by road pile of plank suppose wagon have broke down there plank have be turned out nobody have thought anything more

of clothes fastened with rifle ammunition to plank to indian question of getting wet be one of entire indifference did not even take off hunting shirt entering water party swam noiselessly across to other side pushing plank before on getting out carried plank for distance a appearance by water edge might excite suspicion on part of american that work have be reconnoitered after hiding plank in bush made way to sugar hill a eminence be called ascent be made with great circumspection indian going on first sign of enemy be met with at last party stood on summit of hill be entirely unoccupied by american well fine fellow laughed scout reckon ye have be doing grist of work ye might jest a well have be sitting down quietly smoking yer pipe what on arth possessed ye to leave hill unguarded in point of fact general st clair who commanded american have perceived that position be commanded from spot have only men under considered number too small to hold ticonderoga mount independence sugar hill two former post must afford assistance to garrison of fort placed on sugar hill place must therefore fall if attacked by british on other hand hoped must attention of english not be called to importance of position by erection of work upon might be overlooked that general burgoyne on arrival might at once attack position have prepared with so much care having ascertained that hill be unoccupied peter proposed at once to continue march harold suggested to that must be better to wait until morning a from lofty position must be able to overlook whole of enemy line of defense might obtain information of vital importance to general peter saw advantage of suggestion two of indian be placed on watch rest of party lay down to sleep at daybreak saw that delay have be fully justified for have now view of water separated ticonderoga from mount independence perceived that american have made strong bridge of communication between post twenty two pier have be sunk at equal distance

a heard suspicious noise ahead behind be coming up although still at distance in rear must hear sound of breaking tree bush a pursuer followed in body ef be only fellow behind peter said must leave easy enough wood seems alive with varmint be evident alarm have spread through forest that band scattered here there be aware that enemy be in midst dropping fire pursuer kept up afforded indication a to direction in be making ringing war whoop of hostile indian conveyed intelligence still more surely presently there be shout short distance ahead followed by sound of rifle ball a whizzed close to harold head buried in tree that be passing in moment of party have sheltered behind tree be of use chief peter said will have hull pack from behind upon in five minute must run for take chance of being hit swerving somewhat from former line again ran on bullet whisked round did not pause to fire shot in return tarnation peter exclaimed a tree in front of opened found on edge of clearing be considerably larger than have lately left being three hundred yard across extending back from lake fully mile a in previous case log hut stood in center two hundred yard back from lake there be nothing for chief peter said must take to house fight out there there be hull gang of fellow in forest ahead will shoot down if cross clearing without moment hesitation party rushed across clearing to hut several shot be fired a dashed across open gained place of refuge in safety hut be deserted have probably belonged to royalist for rough furniture lay broken on ground box cupboard have be forced

else that ye can find against shutter keep yerselves well under cover throw away shot will want powder can tell ye quickly now there aint time to be lost while began carrying out instruction below others bounded upstairs scattered through upper room there be two window on side of house one at end disregarding latter peter harold took post at window looking toward forest from have just come chief indian posted to watch other side at first one be to be seen party who have fired at a ran across open have waited for coming up of strong band who be following before venturing to show arrival of pursuer be heralded by opening of heavy fire toward house a assailant kept behind tree reply be made defender occupied by piling bedding against shutter have hastily closed loop hole have be left in wall when hut be first built moss with be filled up be torn out man took post at one of a answering shot came from house assailant became bolder one two ventured to show from behind shelter in moment harold peter whose rifle must carry more truly much further than of indian fired two wiped out peter said a men fell shout of anger arose from wood will make careful proof of accuracy of aim of besieged checked assailant for time be very careful not to expose from side of forest steady fire be maintained occasionally answering shot flashed out from house when one of enemy incautiously showed arm part of body from behind tree be seldom rifle be fired in vain four five of american be shot through head a leaned forward to fire after hour exchange of bullet attack ceased what be going to do now harold asked expect be going to wait till peter said there be moon will be able to work up round house then will make rush at door lower window will shoot down good many on 'em then will burst way in set fire to hut there will be end of be what will happen think there be way of making way out harold asked be mighty poor chance if there be one at hunter replied must say by fire there must be nigh hundred of 'em now be likely that by there will be three time a many a soon a get dusk will creep out from wood form circle round house gradually work up to now let cook vittles have have nothing to eat morning yet must be nigh eleven o'clock see why must be starved even if have got to be killed to night one of party be left on watch on side of house others gathered in room below where fire be lit strip of dried deer flesh carried be soon frying over harold admired air of indifference with companion set about preparing meat everyone be aware of desperate nature of position allusion be made to negro have caught spirit of companion natural loquacity prevented imitating habitual silence dis bad affair massa harold said jess like so many coon up in tree wid whole pack ob dog round de hunter in de distance coming up wid de gun dis chile reckon dat ob dem hunter will get hit hard before dey get jake care one bit for massa bery sorry to see in fix ca be helped jake harold said a cheerfully a must be firing that shot got into yet can not blame must not stand by see ruffian murder woman child dat so massa harold dere be possinbility of seeing dat reckon dat when dose rascal come to climb de stair dey will find be bery hard work think will try jake be more likely to heap brushwood against door window set alight then shoot down a rush out hut be not like one have to defend against iroquois be built to repel indian attack be mere squatter hut after meal be over peter seneca chief went upstairs looked through loop hole talked long earnestly together then rejoined party below chief be of opinion peter said to harold that be of manner of use waiting to be attacked here 'd burn out to sartinty must have show of fight at anything better than now what propose be that directly get fairly dark will creep out make for lake even if have formed circle round aint likely to be a thick there a be on other side what will try to do in course be to prevent taking to forest there will be such grist of 'em believe one of must get through alive if tried now will not be so strong toward lake might break through to water say a there be much chance of getting away for tell fairly that believe that there be chance at chief here brave want sculps to hang in wigwam of chippewa ef have choice must rather be drownded than shot down make much difference of two have rather ef can reach lake can swim out of gunshot range know can swim like fish so can jake indian swim a matter of course ef dive at first may get off will be so dark wo see with sartainty beyond fifty yard when be once fairly out in lake can take chance be there chance peter although if there be none quite agree with must rather be drowned than shot down if one be sure of being killed by first shot must be easiest death if be only wounded must probably hang in morning be so hunter said waal can hardly say that there be chance yet ca say a how there aint in first place may have canoe come out after there be pretty safe to be along shore here settler must have have 'em for fishing what chance will give harold asked waal hunter replied reckon in case a chance be fair one ef dive come up close alongside may manage to upset one of 'em in case might get off be one chance then ef come out in canoe might swim three four mile down lake take to land must tell way to go must have to scatter over long line be just possible a might land without being seen once in wood 'd be safe so see have two chance in course must throw away rifle ammunition before come to water at rate harold said plan be hopeful one agree with that be thousand time better to try than be to stop here with certainty of being shot down before morning afternoon passed quietly few shot be fired occasionally from wood taunting shout be heard of fate awaited when night approached vigilant watch be kept from upper window peter thought that be certain enemy must make move until became perfectly dark although must establish strong cordon round clearing in case besieged must try break out harold trembled with impatience to be off a night grew darker darker seemed to that at moment assailant might be narrowing circle round house have be leader must have given word long before scout made move at last peter signaled that time have come be perfectly dark when bar be noiselessly removed from door party stole out everything seemed silent very stillness made danger appear more terrible peter have impressed upon harold jake necessity for moving without making slightest noise a soon a left house whole party dropped on hand knee peter seneca chief led way two of brave came next harold jake followed remaining indian crawled in rear peter have told comrade to keep a close a possible to indian in front of grasping rifle crept along ground a led way peter seneca carefully removed from before dried twig threw on one side distance to be traversed from hut to water be about two hundred yard half of be passed over before encountered obstacle then suddenly there be exclamation peter seneca sprang to foot a came in contact with two men crawling in opposite direction be too close to use rifle crushing blow from seneca tomahawk cleft down man in front of while peter drew long knife from sheath buried in body of opponent others have also leaped to foot a did so fired at dark figure rose around have advantage of surprise several scattered shot answered volley then with rifle clubbed rushed forward for moment there be hand to hand fight harold have just struck down man opposite to when sprang upon so sudden be attack that fell from shock in instant jake buried knife between opponent shoulder dragged harold to foot run for life massa harold de whole gang upon indeed instant first shot broke silence of wood babel of sound arose from whole circuit of clearing shout yell burst out from hundred of throat there be further use for concealment from side men who have be advancing to attack rushed in direction where conflict be taking place lasted few second a peter have expected line be thinner toward lake than upon other side rush of nine men have broken through shout be heard from wood on side extending down to water showing that precaution have be taken by assailant of leaving portion of force to guard line of forest must defender break through circle at headlong speed little band rushed down to water side dropped ammunition pouch by edge threw rifle few yard into water to be recovered perhaps on future occasion then dived in nearest of pursuer be thirty yard behind when neared water edge swimming a far under water a must hold breath came to surface for instant then again dived momentarily a showed heard rattle of musketry behind bullet splashed thickly on water night however be so dark that fire must only be random one until far out from shore continued diving then gathered together be pretty well out of range now peter said quite out of sight of varmint now can wait bit see what do next enemy be still keeping up heavy fire from shore hallooing shouting to other a fancied caught glimpse of enemy there must be two three hundred of 'em peter said have fooled nicely so far by crashing of bush fugitive must hear strong party making way along shore in direction hour passed during fugitive floated nearly opposite clearing hullo peter exclaimed presently there be canoe coming along lake expect got from cameron a spoke canoe appeared round point two men be standing up holding blazing torch two others paddled while two rifle in hand sat by almost at same moment canoe similarly manned pushed out from shore immediately opposite wish have known of canoe peter said must have saved lot of trouble have time for looking about suspected settler must have have one laid up somewhere now went on let make plan canoe be sure to keep pretty nigh other will most likely think a have gone down lake will not be looking very sharply after at present will never do to let pas now jake two of injun will take one canoe chief three of brave other must move round so a to get between shore then dive come up close to 'em now harold do swim out bit further then make splash so a to call attention do once twice till see that have got eye turned way then be very quiet so a to keep watching for sound that will be moment for attacking waited till two canoe joined other paddled slowly out from shore then eight swimmer started off to make detour while harold swam quietly further out into lake canoe be about three hundred yard from shore be paddling very slowly occupant keeping fixed look along lake there be perfect quiet on shore now when harold made slight splash with hand upon water saw that be heard canoe stopped rowing steerer in case giving steer so that lay broadside to land giving man view over lake sat a quiet a if carved in stone again harold made splash time very slight one so slight that must hardly reach ear of listener few word be exchanged by occupant of boat be further out on lake bill one said be not sure answered rather think sound be further down listen again again sat motionless harold swam with eye fixed upon face be turned way none be looking shoreward then almost at same instant there be shout from boat men with torch seemed to lose balance light described half circle through air be extinguished shout of astonishment broke from occupant mingled with wild seneca war yell knew that canoe be upset there be sound of desperate struggle going on oath wild cry rose from water heavy blow be struck while from shore arose loud shout of dismay rage in two minute be quiet on water then came peter shout way harold will have canoe righted bailed in minute varmin wiped out with lightened heart harold swam toward spot surprise have be complete success occupant of canoe intent only upon pursuit having fear of attack for knew that fugitive must have thrown away rifle be gazing intently out on lake when close to canoe on shore side four head rose from out of water in instant eight hand have seized gunwale before occupant be aware of danger canoe be upset taken wholly by surprise american be match for assailant knife of latter did work before frontiersman have thoroughly grasped what have happened two three indeed have made desperate fight be match for opponent struggle be quickly over on harold reaching canoe found already righted half emptied of water paddle be picked up in few minute with derisive shout of adieu to furious enemy on shore two canoe paddled out into lake when have attained distance of about mile from shore turned boat head paddled north in three hour saw light in wood there be troop peter said soldier be never content unless be making fire big enough to warn redskin within fifty mile that be

german troop under general reidesel to arrive immediately at once attacked breastwork american defended post with great resolution bravery re enforcement did not arrive so soon a be expected for time british made way general reidesel hearing fire in front pushed forward at full speed with small body of troop among be band ordered to play enemy hearing music supposing that whole of german troop

to effect junction with general burgoyne general burgoyne determined to advance at once army be already suffering from want of transportation decided to send body of troop to bennington twenty four mile to eastward of hudson river where american have large supply collected instead of sending light infantry dispatched six hundred german worst troop must have selected for purpose a be very heavily armed marched exceedingly slowly several of officer remonstrated with with usual infatuated obstinacy maintained disposition on approaching bennington colonel baum who commanded german found that very strong force be gathered there sent back for re enforcement five hundred more german under lieutenant colonel breyman be dispatched to assistance long however before slowly moving troop must arrive colonel baum be attacked by enemy in vastly superior number german fought with great bravery several time charged american drove back fresh troop continued to come up on enemy side german having lost large number of men including colonel be forced to retreat into wood enemy then advanced against colonel breyman who be ignorant of disaster have befallen baum with detachment have occupied twenty four hour in marching sixteen mile german again fought well after gallant resistance be obliged to fall back in two affair lost six hundred men in meantime colonel st leger have commenced attack upon fort stanwix be defended by seven hundred men american general herkimer advanced with one men to relief colonel st leger detached sir john johnson with party of regular number of indian who have

september general burgoyne having with immense labor collected thirty day provision on hudson crossed river by bridge of boat encamped on height of saratoga movement have be immensely hampered by vast train of artillery took with in open country powerful force of artillery be of greatest service to army in campaign in wooded roadless country be of little utility enormously hamper operation of army have general burgoyne after capture of ticonderoga pressed forward in light order without artillery must unquestionably have marched to new york without meeting with serious opposition six week delay have enabled american to collect great force to oppose on th a army be advancing to stillwater five thousand of enemy attacked british right be led by general arnold fought with great bravery determination brunt of battle fell on twentieth twenty fourth sixty second regiment for four hour fight continued without advantage on side at american drew off side having lost about six hundred men after battle of stillwater whole of indian with general burgoyne left returned to canada hampered with great train of artillery unprovided with transportation in face of powerful enemy posted in

joined english commander in chief have taken army down to philadelphia sir henry clinton who commanded at new york endeavored with small force at command to make diversion by operating against american post on hudson river be of utility burgoyne army be now reduced to little more than five thousand men determined to fall back upon lake before doing however must be necessary to dislodge american from post on left leaving camp under command of general hamilton burgoyne advanced with fifteen hundred men against scarcely have detachment started when enemy made furious attack on british left major ackland with grenadier be posted here for time defended with great bravery light infantry twenty fourth be sent to assistance overpowered by number left wing be forced to retreat into intrenchment enemy led by general arnold at once attacked with great impetuosity for long time result be doubtful be not until american leader be wounded that attack ceased in meantime intrenchment defended by german troop under colonel breyman have also be attacked here fight be obstinate german intrenchment be carried colonel breyman killed troop retreated with loss of baggage artillery two hundred prisoner fell into hand of american night british army be concentrated on height above hospital general gate who commanded american moved army so a to entirely inclose british latter on night of october retired to saratoga being obliged to leave sick wounded in hospital be treated with greatest kindness by american attempt be now made to retreat to fort george fort edward american have taken up position on road fortified with cannon only about thirty five hundred fighting men now remained of whom one half be british scarcely eight day provision be left enemy four time superior in point of number held line of retreat eluded attempt of british to force to general engagement position be hopeless on council of war be held be determined to open negotiation for surrender two day be spent in negotiation be finally agreed that army must lay down arm that must be marched to boston there allowed to sail for england on condition of not serving again in north america during contest canadian be to be allowed to return at once to own country on th army laid down arm consisted of thirty five hundred fighting men six hundred sick nearly two thousand boatman teamster other non effectives never did general behave with greater incompetence than manifested by general burgoyne from day of leaving ticonderoga disaster befell army be entirely result of mismanagement procrastination faulty generalship have harold remained with army until surrender share in war must have be at end for canadian a well a others who laid down arm gave word of honor not to serve again during war have however with peter lambton jake accompanied colonel baum detachment on march to bennington scouting in front of column have ascertained presence of large number of enemy have by hastening back with news enabled german colonel to make preparation for resistance before attack be made upon during fight ensued scout posted behind tree on german left have assisted to repel attack from quarter when german gave way effected escape into wood managed to rejoin army have continued with until moved to hospital height after disastrous attack by american on camp general burgoyne then sent for peter lambton who be knew one of most active intelligent scout must make way through enemy line down to ticonderoga asked must try general peter said party who work with must get through if anyone must more that ca say yank be swarming around pretty thick reckon if have luck might make shift to get through have hope general said that regiment for asked general carleton have arrived there here be letter to general powell who be in command to beg to march with available force fall upon enemy posted on line of communication unless new regiment have reached will not have sufficient force to attempt if have come up may be able to do so be to march in lightest order at full speed so a to take enemy by surprise twelve hour before start will bring back news of coming will move out to meet operation in rear will confuse enemy enable to operate with greater chance of success tell because if be surrounded in difficulty may have to destroy dispatch can then convey instruction by word of mouth to general powell if succeed in getting through upon leaving headquarters peter joined friend be risksome business went on after informing of instruction have received know a be much more risksome than stopping here seem to that army be like to get out of trap into general have led wanted to leave lake for be more can tell however generaling aint business must change place with old man to day not for big sum of money now chief what do say how 'ere business to be carried out seneca with five brave who have from first accompanied be now only indian with british army rest of redskin disgusted with dilatory progress of army foreseeing inevitable disaster have betaken to home be moreover angered at severity with english general have endeavored to suppress tendency to act of cruelty on defenseless settler redskin have idea of civilized warfare sole notion of fighting be to kill burn destroy prohibition of irregular operation of infliction of unnecessary suffering be in eye act of incomprehensible weakness seneca chief remained with army simply because old comrade did so saw that there be little chance of plunder brave have succeeded in fair fight in obtaining many scalp must at least be received with high honor on return to tribe long discussion took place between chief peter before finally decided upon best course to be pursued be ignorant of country of disposition of enemy force must only decide to act upon general principle thought probable that american must be most thickly posted upon line between british army lake best chance of success must therefore be to

to hear ye say so peter replied expected a much of ye jack know much of country having only hunted here for few week with party of delaware twenty year afore iroquois moved so far west know pretty nigh foot of jack pearson said when iroquois be quiet used to do deal of hunting in country be good country for game well will set out at once harold asked impatient to be off ca move to night pearson answered harold saw that peter indian agreed with why not asked hour be of importance be so peter said there be going out on lake to night in hour will have first snowstorm by morning will be two foot deep harold turned eye toward lake saw what companion have noticed long before sky be overcast thick bank of hidden cloud be rolling up across lake thick mist seemed to hang between cloud water be snow peter said be late year 'd give pension if be month later be so pearson said snow aint never pleasant in wood when be scouting round among injun be caution 'd best make shelter afore come on two canoe be lifted from water unloaded turned bottom upward few charred plank have formed part of roof of outhouse be brought put up to form sort of shelter fire be lit meal prepared by time snow have begun to fall after meal be over pipe be lit two hunter earnestly talked over plan seneca chief throwing in few word occasionally others listened quietly indian left matter in hand of chief while harold cameron knew that two frontiersman did not need suggestion from a to jake thought of asking question never entered mind be just at present le happy than usual for negro like most of race hated cold prospect of wandering through wood in deep snow made shudder a crouched close to great fire have built peter jack pearson be of opinion that be exceedingly probable that welches have be destroyed by very band have carried off little janet cameron body of indian who have be on war path with army have retired six week before be about time pearson said that attack on settlement have be made heard party of redskin who have be with british troop have passed through neighborhood there be report that be greatly onsatisfied with result of campaign a likely a not of band may have be consarned in attack on place three year ago passing nigh may have determined to wipe out that defeat injun never forgives many of brave fell here must scarcely bring more welcome trophy back to village than scalp of welch men now first thing to do peter said be to find out what particular chief took brave with to war then have got to find village there likely enough will find cameron daughter maybe girl from here how old be about fifteen pearson said fine girl pretty girl too dun know went on after pause of chief took part in war across lake suspect be war eagle there be three great chief other two be trading on frontier be war eagle who attacked place afore must be more likely to attack again if came anywheres near made mess of afore 'd be burning to wipe out failure if have chance where be place village be furthest of from here life up near fall of sault ste marie betwixt lake superior huron be village with nigh three hundred wigwam aint easy to see how be to be done must make to north shore of lake there will be working down here through wood be pesky difficult job about a hard one a ever took part in be that pearson said ca be denied to steal two white girl out of big injun village aint easy job at time with snow on ground come a nigh to impossibility a anything can do for hour two talked over route must take best mode of proceeding duncan cameron sat listened with intent face to word since have joined have spoken seldom whole soul be taken up with thought of little daughter be ever ready to do share more than share of work of paddling at portage never joined in conversation of evening when others sat round fire must move away pace backward forward in anxious thought until fire burned low party wrapped in blanket went off to sleep time conversation have be going on snow have fallen heavily before be concluded clearing be covered deep with white mantle there be little wind snow fell quietly noiselessly at night indian lay down round fire while white men crept under canoe be soon fast asleep in morning be still snowing about noon cleared up be freezing hard snow glistened a sun burst through cloud stillness of forest be broken now by sharp cracking sound a bough of tree gave way under weight of snow in open lay more than two foot deep now peter said sooner be off better will come in own canoe pearson said one of injun can come with will keep up with rest there be room for in other canoe harold said plenty of room hunter answered see harold more canoe better there aint saying how close may be chased by hiding up canoe at different place give so much more chance of being able to get to one other be large canoe at pinch one of might hold hull party with two gal throwed in added to harold in low voice build too much on gal harold must say so while poor fellow listening chance be desperate poor one think will be mighty lucky ef leave scalp in 'ere redskin village trap be soon placed in canoe just a sun burst out three boat started be long toilsome journey stormy weather set in be obliged to wait for day by lake till surface calmed on occasion devoted to hunting killed several deer knew that there be indian village near in such weather must be improbable that redskin must be in wood be enabled therefore to fire without fear of report betraying presence seneca took opportunity of fabricating snowshoe for whole party a must be absolutely necessary for walking in wood harold jake duncan cameron at once began to practice use negro be comical in extreme in first attempt shouted so loudly with laughter time that fell head foremost into snow that peter said to angrily look here jake be dangerous enough letting off rifle at deer in wood have to be done because must lay in supply of food musket shot be mere whisper to yer shouting thunder aint much louder than laughing shake hull place might be heard from here well nigh to montreal ef ca keep mouth of your'n shut ye must stop up idee of learning to use shoe must stop in canoe while be scouting on shore jake promised to amend from time when fell in soft snow wreath gave audible vent to amusement pair of great foot with snow shoe attached must be seen waving above surface until be picked up righted again harold soon learned cameron went at work with grim earnestness smile ever crossed face at own accident at wild vagary of jake excited silent amusement even among indian in short time fall be le frequent by time reached spot where be determined to cross lake at point where lake huron michigan join three novice be able to make fair progress in snow shoe spot fixed upon be about twelve mile from village of war eagle canoe be hidden at distance of three mile apart first pearson harold cameron disembarked jake peter one of indian alighted at next point seneca chief two of follower proceeded to spot nearer to indian village party a landed struck straight into wood to unite at point eight mile from lake a many from village hunter have agreed that must indian come across track suspicion must be excited than must have be case be found skirting river a might be thought that be made by indian out hunting harold wondered how other party must find spot to pearson have directed in due time arrived at rendezvous after search spot be found where underwood grew thickly there be open place in center of clump in camp be established be composed solely of low tent of about two foot high made of deer hide sewed together large enough to shelter snow be cleared away stick be driven into frozen ground strong pole laid across deerskin be then laid flat upon top be little higher than general level of snow inch two of snow be scattered over to anyone passing outside bush tent be completely invisible indian now went outside thicket with great care obliterated a far a possible mark upon snow must not be wholly done be so far complete that slightest wind must send drift over surface must wholly conceal trace of passage have before crossing lake cooked supply of food sufficient for day intense a be cold outside be perfectly warm in tent entrance a crept into be closed with blanket in center lamp composed of deer fat in calabash with cotton wick gave sufficient light what be next move harold asked chief will start when come dusk with pearson peter said when git close to village will go in alone will paint iroquois before go can not be near at hand to help in case of necessity harold asked peter said must be no good at ef come to fighting be fifty to one lot of must have more chance than two if be found out aint likely must run for can get over snow deal faster than must to say nothing of cameron jake must shift for will make straight for nearest canoe in forest must be run down sooner later for track must be plain must go alone when night came on seneca produced paint one of follower marked face arm with line flourish in use by iroquois then without word of adieu took rifle glided out from tent followed by pearson peter also put on snow shoe prepared to follow thought be going to stay here peter be going halfway with will be able to hear sound of gun then ef be trapped must make track for canoe at once for after following to lake be safe to take up back track to see where have come from so ef hear gun will make back here a quick a can come when three men have started silence fell on tent redskin at once lay down to sleep jake followed example harold lay quiet thinking over event have happened to in last three year while cameron lay with face turned toward lamp with set anxious look on face several time crawled to entrance listened when crack made by breaking bough came to ear hour passed at last harold dozed off cameron eye never closed until about midnight blanket at entrance moved peter entered hae ye seen ithers cameron exclaimed be not likely to peter answered be still to time came away afore moved be sure must have left village wo come straight back bless ye will go 'way in opposite direction make sweep mile round may not be here for hour yet not that there be much chance of track being traced have not snowed for over week snow round village must be trampled thick for mile more with squaw coming going for wood hunter going out on chase have crossed dozen track more on way back ef be for dare have gone at for ef snow be new fallen sight of fresh track must have set first injun that come along wondering when redskin begin to wonder set to to ease mind at once by finding out about ef take couple of day sarch to do so no can lie down now for hour wo be here till morning so saying scout set example by wrapping up going to sleep cameron eye never closed until blanket be drawn on one side again in gray light of winter morning seneca pearson crawled into tent what news harold asked for cameron be too agitated to speak gal be there pearson answered exclamation of thankfulness broke from harold sob of joy issued from heart of scotchman for few minute lip moved a poured forth silent thankfulness to god waal tell about peter said can ask chief question afterward went on straight enough to village hunter began be larger than when saw last war eagle influence in tribe must have increased did expect to find watch redskin having so far a knew enemy within five hundred mile of 'em there be lot of fire burning plenty of redskin moving about among kept on till got quite close then lay up for time below tree at edge of clearing there be sight too many of 'em about for seneca to go in yet awhile about hour arter got there saw two white gal come outen one of wigwam stand for while to warm theirselves by one of fire tallest of two well nigh woman be nelly welch knew in course other be three four year younger with yaller hair over shoulder nelly seemed quiet sad like other 'peared more at home laughed with of redskin gal even jined in play see said turning to cameron 'd be captured longer child spirit soon rise again arter while went back to wigwam when fire burned down crowd thinned there be only few left sitting in group round ember seneca started for long time saw nothing of once twice thought saw figure moving among wigwam presently fire burned quite down last injun went off have begun to wonder what chief be doing when stood beside made track at once have be tramping in long circle night chief can tell ye part of business hisself well chief what have found out peter asked indian answered in native tongue peter interpreted from time to time for benefit of white companion when deer tail left white hunter went into village be use going among men went round by wigwam listened to chattering of squaw tribe be well contented for band brought back great deal of plunder have picked up on way back from army have lost brave everyone be pleased destruction of settlement of white man who have repulsed before be special matter for rejoicing scalp of white man wife be in village war eagle son young elk be going to marry white girl there be several of brave whose head have be turned by white skin bright eye young elk be going to have there have be great feasting rejoicing since return of warrior be to be joined tomorrow by beaver band then will feast again when be quiet went to wigwam where white girl be confined old squaw two of war eagle daughter be with deer tail have listened while prepared for rest knew on side of wigwam tall white maiden slept thought that must be awake heart must be sad sleep must not come to soon so crept round there cut slit in skin close to where lay put head in at hole whispered ' let white girl be afraid be friend doe hear ' whispered 'yes 'friends be near ' said 'the young warrior harold whom know others be at hand to take away iroquois will be feasting to morrow night when hears cry of night owl let steal away with little white sister will find friend waiting ' then deer tail closed slit stole away to friend white hunter have spoken jest what expected of chief peter said warmly thought a how 'd manage to git speech with 'em somehow if there be feast to night be hard ef manage to get off suppose must lie still day peter must so hunter said not soul must show nose outside tent except one of redskin will keep watch to be sure that straggler have come across track followed up ef be to do that might bring hull gang down on 'd best get a much sleep a ye can for ye know when ye may get chance at whole party issued from tent started toward indian village arrangement have be made be agreed that pearson seneca must go up to village former being chosen because be known to nelly peter one of redskin be to take post hundred yard further back ready to give assistance in case of alarm while rest be to remain about mile distant cameron have asked that might go with advance party upon peter pointing out to that comparatively slow rate of progression in snow shoe must in case of discovery lead to recapture of girl at once agreed to decision if flight of girl be discovered soon after leaving camp be arranged that seneca peter must hurry at once with to main body while other two indian must draw off pursuer in direction in event of anything occurring to excite suspicion of indian before there be chance of girl being brought safely to main body be to be left to walk quietly back to camp a have nothing to fear from indian peter seneca be then to work round by circuitous route to boat where be to be joined by main body to draw off until opportunity offered for repeating attempt be eight o'clock in evening when pearson seneca approached village fire be burning high seated round be warrior of tribe party be engaged in dance representing pursuit defeat of enemy woman be standing in outer circle clapping hand raising voice in loud cry of applause excitement a dance became faster faster warrior bounded high brandishing tomahawk better time must not have be chosen for evasion of fugitive nelly welch stood close to number of indian girl slightly behind held hand of little janet cameron although appeared to share in interest of indian in dance close observer must have have difficulty in perceiving that nelly be preoccupied be indeed intently listening for signal be afraid to move from among others lest absence must be at once detected so long a noise be going on despaired of being able to hear signal agreed upon presently indian brave passed close to a did so whispered in ear in english behind wigwam friend there then passed on moved round circle a if intending to take seat at point excitement of dance be momentarily increasing attention of spectator be riveted to movement of performer holding janet hand nelly moved noiselessly away from place where have be standing movement be unnoticed a be no longer closely watched flight in depth of winter appearing impossible kept round circle till no longer visible from spot have left then leaving crowd made way toward nearest wigwam once behind girl stole rapidly along under shelter until stood behind usually inhabited two figure be standing there hesitated for moment one of advanced jack pearson nelly exclaimed with low cry of gladness jest same nelly right glad to see have time for greeting now hull tribe may be after in five minute come along pretty said turning to janet will find somebody ye know close at hand two minute later child be in father arm after moment rapturous greeting between father child very delighted one between nelly welch cousin harold flight be continued how long start do think may have hour maybe woman may be time afore miss will sarch for everywhere afore give alarm a will be greatly blamed for carelessness there have be pause in flight for few second when seneca pearson arrived with girl at point where peter other indian be posted two hundred yard from camp up to point snow be everywhere thickly trampled a camp be left further behind footprint must naturally become more scarce here pearson fastened to girl foot two pair of large moccasin inside wooden sol have be placed therefore acted to extent like snowshoe prevented girl foot from sinking deeply while print left bore resemblance to own be strapped on wrong way so that mark must seem to point toward village rather than away from girl protested that must not be able to get along fast in encumbrance one of men posted on side of assisted along a moccasin be very light even with wooden sol inside be soon able to move with at considerable pace once united whole party kept along at top of speed peter lambton assisted cameron with janet girl half lifted from ground skimmed over surface like bird only touching snow here there with moccasin nelly welch needed assistance from harold pearson during long winter have often practiced on snow shoe be consequently little encumbered with huge moccasin to extent served same purpose have be nearly hour on way when heard tremendous yell burst from village have missed peter said now be fair race have got good start will git more for will have to hunt up trace very carefully may be hour perhaps more before strike upon right one ef snow have be new fallen must have have 'em arter in five minute even redskin eye will be puzzled to find out at night one track among such hundred have one fear pearson said to harold what be be afeared that without waiting to find track may send off dozen party to lake will be sure that friend have taken gal away will know only chance of escape be by water on land must be hunted down to certainty redskin knowing that gal must not travel fast will not hurry in following up trail so think will at once send off party to watch lake will like enough make effort to take up trail till to morrow morning be said in low whisper for although be more than two mile from village be necessary to move a silently a possible have best tell others what think pearson may make difference in movement short halt be called seneca peter quite agreed with pearson idea 'd best make for canoe be furthest off when redskin find others be pretty sure to do for will hunt bush be likely to be satisfied to make sure will ketch at one other much decided upon continued flight now le rapidly in perfect silence speed be le object than concealment indian might spread party might come across by accident if must avoid be sure to reach canoe before morning unlikely to find indian there before be about twelve mile to spot where have hidden canoe although heard distant shout whoop ringing through forest sound be heard near chapter xv island refuge night be intensely cold still star shone brightly through bare bough overhead be sure be going right nelly asked harold be so dark here that seems impossible to know way be going can trust indian harold said even if there be not star to be seen must find way by mysterious instinct how be grown nelly voice doe not seem much changed be longing to see face expect be more changed than be girl answered have be going through so much since last met seem to have grown so tall big voice have changed very much too be voice of man how in world did find here pearson have gone on ahead to speak to seneca now joined again must talk said hope there be redskin within five mile of now there be never saying where may be there be harold thought certain sharpness in hunter voice told of greater anxiety than must be caused by very slight risk of quietly spoken word being heard by passing redskin wondered what must be be now calculated within mile of hiding place where have left boat have reason for believing that none of indian must be likely to have followed shore so far that must be pursued that in so heavily laden canoe must have great difficulty in escaping be well aware relied on craft of hunter seneca for throwing pursuer off trail at once tree seemed to open in front in few minute party reached river cry of astonishment of something akin to terror broke from harold a far a eye must reach lake be frozen escape be cut off be jest what have be expecting pearson said ice have begun to form at edge when landed three day night of such frost a have have since be enough to freeze ontario what on arth to be done one answered peter redskin have shared pearson anxiety to harold cameron disappointment be terrible one a to jake left thinking to be done by others harold stood gazing helplessly on expanse of ice covered water be not smooth sheet be rough broken a if while have be forming wind have broken ice up into cake again again while frost a often have bound together have struck river within few hundred yard of place where canoe be hidden after short consultation between seneca chief peter lambton pearson moved down toward spot what be thinking of doing harold asked when gathered round canoe be going to load with ammunition deer flesh peter said make for rocky island lie about mile off here noticed a landed there be nothing to do to fight out to last there be good place for defense for redskin wo like to come out across open even covered by dark night 'd show on white surface perhaps wo trace not trace trapper repeated scornfully why when daylight come will pick up track follow a easy a must that of wagon across snow be just starting when harold gave little exclamation what be lad flake of snow fell on face looked up star have disappeared flake fell on upturned face of party let thank great god peter said quietly there be chance for life yet hour snow trail will be lost faster faster snowflake came down again leader consulted must change plan now peter said turning to others so long a must easily follow track mattered nothing that 'd find canoe here now be altogether different must take along with weight of canoe be very small greater part of content have already be removed there be careful look round to see that nothing remained on bank then four of men lifted on shoulder whole party stepped out upon ice snow be now falling heavily to harold eye there be nothing to guide in direction be following even indian must have be at loss have not seneca instant snow began to fall sent on one of follower at full speed toward island harold wondered at time what object must be a indian darted off across ice now understood minute two low hoot of owl be heard toward sound party directed way through darkness snow so heavy be fall that island rose white before a reached be of great extent twenty thirty yard across perhaps twice that length rose steeply from water to height of from ten to fifteen foot ground be rough broken several tree much brushwood grew in crevice of rock seneca hunter made rapid examination of island soon fixed upon spot for camp toward one end island be split in two indentation ran distance up into here clear spot be found three four foot above level of water be completely hidden by thick bush from sight of anyone approaching by water there canoe be turned over girl who be suffering from intense cold be wrapped up in blanket placed under shelter camp be at lower end of island must therefore be entirely hidden from view of indian gathered upon shore in such snowstorm light must be invisible at very short distance peter did not hesitate to light fire in front of canoe for three hour snow continued to fall fire have be sheltered by blanket stretched at distance above long before snow ceased have sunk down to pile of red ember small tent have now be formed of blanket for use of girl brushwood have be heaped over upon brushwood snow have be thrown whole making shelter must be warm comfortable in bitterest weather pile of hot ember be placed in little tent until be thoroughly heated blanket be then spread girl be asked to leave shelter of canoe take place there canoe be now raised on four stick three foot from ground bush be laid round snow piled on thus forming wall of canoe be roof be finished long before snow have ceased falling added smooth white surface over so that to casual eye tent hut looked like two natural ridge of ground be cheerful party assembled in little hut remainder of ember of fire have be brought in intense a be cold outside be warm comfortable within tea be made pipe filled chatted time before going to sleep duncan cameron be like man transfigured joy thankfulness for recovery of daughter be unbounded harold pleasure too at rescue of cousin be very great others be gratified at success of expedition be true that indian have a yet gained scalp harold have promised before starting must expedition be successful must be handsomely rewarded must reckon a be safe yet peter said in answer to one of harold remark redskin aint going to let slip through finger so easy a that have lost trail have nothing sens to guide injun sens aint easily deceived in wood ef snow begin again keep on for two three day may be puzzled ef stop will cast circle round camp at distance beyond where must have got before snow ceased ef find new trail will know that must be within circle then a to boat when find a come down to two a have discovered that have not made off by land will guess a there be canoe hidden somewhere will sarch high low for waal wo find then will suppose that may have taken to ice will sarch that will git to open water to other side ef there be open water anywhere within few mile may conclude that have carried canoe launched there made off in case when have sarched everywhere may give up ef there aint such open water will sarch till find aint likely that island will escape with nine good rifle here can hold place against hull tribe a 'd show up against snow can no more attack by night than by day think food will hold out beyond seven eight day harold said jest about peter answered can cut hole in ice fish can hold out way if need be for week wust of be that ice aint likely to break up now until spring reckon only chance be to wait till git big snowstorm then to make off snow will cover trail a fast a make once across to other shore may git away from varmint disguise from harold that be in very awk'ard trouble that will need craft of chief here experience of pearson to get out of guid god have be vera merciful to sae far duncan cameron said will surely protect to end have na sent snow just when did savage must hae followed trail at once be miracle wrought in favor have aided to rescue twa bairn frae hand of indian may surely trust in protection to end daughter friend hae be very sure before lying down to sleep entreated protection let ' do same old soldier taking off cap prayed aloud to god to heed protect harold frontiersman also removed cap joined in prayer seneca looked on silent reverent at act of worship be rare among white companion a peter be of opinion that there be chance whatever of search on part of indian night therefore there be need to set watch whole party wrapped up in blanket be soon asleep when harold woke next morning be broad daylight seneca have already be out have brought news that strong party of indian must be seen moving along edge of forest evidently searching for canoe one of indian be placed on watch two three hour later reported that indian be now entirely out of sight be when last seen scouting along edge of forest now peter said sooner git snowstorm better ef 'd be alone must have pushed on last night gal be exhausted must soon have died of cold now with fresh start 'd do ef ca cross lake calculate that be about thirty mile from p'int on north shore below fall of ste marie must land there strike across through wood for settlement 'd be terrible long journey round north of huron must try ef ca get across must go off by night surely harold said even if there be fresh snow must do peter replied doubt of ef be to find track next day ay within three day 'd follow overtake afore got to settlement ef be alone 'd be one thing with gal 'd be altogether must stop here till snowstorm come even if have to stop for month there be saying how soon of injun may be loafing round dare leave trail for to take up have scarcely ceased speaking when low call from indian placed on watch summoned chief to side minute later latter rejoined group below said few word to peter jest a thought latter grumbled rising with rifle across arm here be of varmint coming out 'ere way likely enough be party of young brave jest scouting about on own account to try get honor by discovering when elder have failed must have be better for to have stopped at home party now crept up to top of rock keeping carefully below crest ef show a much a hair above top line peter said will see sartin must not be well harold asked for one of to show there be possibility of further concealment if go off without of being killed others might be le bitter against than must if have lost of tribe peter laughed scornfully ye have have much to do with injun lad must have thought 'd have have better sense have injun be murdering slaying along frontier summer falling on defenseless woman child marcy pity aint in natur fight fight scalp will dry in wigwam if get into power know that can shoot mean to will make 'em careful of attacking hour be important now said to others of cover man fire straight through sight when give word there be others watching may be sure ef whole five go down together will make 'em think twice afore attack again peering between loose rock so that must see without exposing head above line harold watched five indian approaching have evidently doubt a to wisdom of course be pursuing be well aware that ran terrible risk standing there in open before rifle of concealed must fugitive be really there nevertheless hope of gaining distinction fear of ridicule from watching on shore must turn back with mission unaccomplished inspired with resolution when within three hundred yard of island halted for long time stood gazing fixedly although sign of life must be perceived be too well versed in indian warfare to gain confidence from apparent stillness throwing flat on snow following other in single line by mean body be nearly concealed from sight in track leader made through light yielding snow made complete circuit of island paused for time opposite little forked entrance in camp be situated apparently saw nothing for kept round until completed circuit when reached point from have started there be apparently short consultation among then continued course in track that have before made until reached spot facing camp then changed order still prone in snow advanced abreast toward island varmint have guessed that if be here be place where 'd be hid peter whispered in harold ear a indian made circuit party in island have changed position so a always to keep out of sight be now on top of island be sort of rough plateau girl have be warned when left to remain perfectly quiet in shelter noise might hear peter seneca watched indian through hole have made with ramrod through bank of others remained flat in slight depression behind at distance of one hundred fifty yard indian stopped varmint see something peter said maybe can make out two snow heap through bush maybe can see of footstep in snow be going to fire exclaimed up lad may send bullet into hut whar gal be hid in instant line of men sprang to foot indian taken by surprise at sudden appearance of larger number of enemy than expected fired hasty volley then sprang to foot dashed toward shore be deadly rifle covered peter harold pearson must be trusted not to miss even rapidly moving object at distance men be good shot not in regular order a covered man rifle be discharged four out of five indian fell arm of fifth dropped useless by side however still kept on white reloaded rapidly harold be about to fire again when pearson put hand on shoulder fire have shown that can shoot straight be jest a well at present that must know how far rifle will carry four seneca dashed out across snow speedily returned with scalp hanging at belt loud yell of anger lamentation have risen from wood skirting shore a indian fell after died away deep silence reigned what will be next move cameron asked peter a gathered again in low hut having placed one of indian on watch will hear nothing of 'em till nightfall peter said first move now know a be here will be to send off to fetch up tribe who be in search of when come on dark will send scout outside of on ice to see a escape not that 'd much mind ef did for must track through snow come up with whenever chose may be sure will stay where be may be will attack to night maybe not 'd be thing more risksome than redskin often undertake to cross snow under fire of nine rifle aint doubt 'd try starve out for must know well enough that can have great store of provision know a well a do if snowstorm come on might slip away from without leaving foot mark behind be jest thought a may make attack well can beat off if do harold said confidently waal may may not scout answered anyhow can kill grist of afore turn out on 'ere island be sartin enough pearson put in be strong tribe ef can harden heart make rush be up with allow that be contrary to custom when see other way to do with may try suppose if do try rush harold said will do against end of island yes may bet money on that scout answered in other place rock go pretty nigh straight up from water here be easy landing being so close to 'em be sure to know about even if did chap got away must tell 'em much expect attack to night band wo be back yet will have grand palaver to night there will be big talk afore decide what be best to be done so think be safe for to night to morrow will set to work build shelter for pretty one up above where will be safe from stray shot then will throw up breastwork with loose rock on top of slope round cove so a to give to 'em hot when land have plenty of powder harold asked dollop peter replied more 'n must fire away if be besieged here for month then must spare twenty pound so must spare whole keg if like have got three full what be thinking of now young un be thinking harold answered of forming line of hole say three foot apart in ice across mouth of cove if be to charge with powder lay train between must when first dozen so have passed line fire train break up ice must prevent others following give bad scare that must probably make off must easily deal with who have passed line before fired be good idea of yours lad fust rate idea ice must be foot thick by time ef put in charge eight inch tamp well down will shiver ice for long way round idea be fust rate one pearson cameron assisted in work indian when peter have explained plan to gave deep gutteral exclamation of surprise approval process of blasting be one wholly unknown to will mak ' hole cameron said hae seen deal of blasting when be in army can heat end of ramrod in fire hammer into shape of borer better way than cameron harold said will be to heat end of ramrod white hot will melt hole in ice in time must take to bore be what be thinking of doing right be lad pearson said let set about at once large fire be now lighted outside hut for there be longer occasion for end of three four of ramrod be placed in fire two line of hole be bored in ice across mouth of little cove line be twelve foot apart calculated that ice between must be completely broken up even if fracture did not extend good way beyond line hole be of rather larger diameter than interior of gun barrel be found that ice be about fifteen inch thick hole be taken down ten inch three four charge of powder be placed in stick of quarter of inch in diameter be then placed in hole pounded ice be rammed tightly in around until hole be filled up few drop of water being poured in on top so a to freeze whole into solid mass there be fear of powder being wetted for frost be intense then stick be withdrawn hole left filled with powder with heated ramrod little trough be sunk inch deep connecting top of hole line of powder be placed in trench narrow strip of skin be laid over snow be then thrown on again two line of trench be connected at end at shore so that must be fired simultaneously while men be occupied with work girl have cooked venison steak made cake be just nightfall when have finished sat down enjoyed hearty meal peter one of seneca undertook watch for night when be to be relieved by pearson chief early part of night passed off quietly hour before morning party be aroused by sharp crack of two rifle seizing arm rushed out what be pearson two of scout pearson answered pointing to two dark body on snow at distance of about one hundred yard suppose wanted to see ef be on watch made out almost a soon a left shore let come on until be sartin of aim there aint more about a can see so ye can turn in again for hour two there be fresh alarm before morning when sun rose shone over wide expanse of snow unbroken save where lay body of two indian whose scalp already hung at belt of seneca of four comrade who have fallen in first attack day passed quietly toward afternoon two indian be seen approaching from shore be unarmed held hand aloft a sign of amity peter pearson at once laid down gun left island advanced to meet be indian chief of importance why have white brother stolen in at night upon village of war eagle slain young men be what have be doing last year chief pearson who spoke dialect better than peter replied injured one did kill woman child a warrior have done in white village only came to take what have stolen from ef young men have be killed be only because tried to attack white men must see chief said that can not get away water be hard canoe will not swim in snow be deep tender foot can not walk through warrior be very numerous white men can not fight way through white settlement be very far away friend can not reach will be many month before water softens long before that white men will have eaten moccasin waal chief pearson said be in tight hole grant be far from allowing that aint chance left to yet what do propose suppose have proposition to make let white men leave behind gun powder maiden have taken from war eagle camp then let go in peace will not be harmed pearson gave short laugh war eagle must think white men be foolish what be to prevent red warrior from taking scalp when arm be in hand word of great chief war eagle said war eagle never lie may not lie chief pearson said bluntly have known many treaty broken afore now people may not touch there be other redskin about must give beaver skin for sculps ef be to take back trail to settlement without arm in hand besides that have among father of gal who be stole far away off from lake champlain relative of hers whose parent have killed down on lake ef be to agree to give up arm stand to reason aint likely 'd agree to give up gal chief term be reasonable tell ye what will do ef will give word that tribe will molest in retreat will go back to settlement will engage that when get back there will send nine of best rifle money can buy with plenty of powder ball blanket such like chief waved hand in contemptuous refusal of term there be six of young men scalp at girdle place be empty war eagle have spoken very well chief pearson said ef nothing sculps will content to fighting must come warn that tribe will lose good many more afore get ours so saying without word separated party making way back to friend what on earth can have proposed such term a for harold asked when pearson have related what have taken place between chief must have known must not accept expect pearson said wanted to see who be to judge what sort of spirit have may be too that there be party among tribe who have stomach for job of attacking place so be obliged to make show of offering term to please never meant a must be accepted take will wait few day to see what hunger will do must be pretty sure that have not very large supply of food chapter xvi great storm let overhaul package harold said see what provision have left must be a well to know how stand be found that have sufficient supply of flour to last with care for fortnight meal be nearly exhausted of tea have abundance sugar be nearly out have three bottle of spirit must not make flour last more than fourteen day by putting ourselves on half ration harold asked might do peter said tell ration must be small even for fourteen day have calkilated according to how much eat when have plenty of meat without meat 'd be only starvation ration to fortunately have fish hook line by making hole in ice can get a many fish a like waal can live on alone if need be ounce two of flour made into cake will be enough to go with way flour must last pretty nigh two month say that if wust come to wust might not hold on right to spring on fish lake full of 'em of 'em have so much oil in that be nigh a good a meat do think peter that if indian make one great attack be beaten off will try again one can say peter answered injun natur ' ca never be calkilated on must say if got thundering beating aint likely to try again there be never saying sooner attack get o'er better cameron said hae na slept wink last twa night if doze off for moment wake up thinking hear yell be a ready to fight a ony o when time come thought o daughter here make nervous anxious what do say jake de same to jake massa cameron jake sleep bery sound like de tought ob eating nothing fish for five six month jake neber bery fond ob fish will like well enough when get used to jake pearson said be not bad eating on pinch only want to eat sight of to satisfy well let see how fish will bite four hole be cut in ice at short distance apart hook be attached to strong line baited with deer flesh soon fishing began girl took great interest in proceeding nelly be adept at sport having generally caught fish for consumption of household at home took charge of one of line harold of while jake one of seneca squatted by other hole there have be discussion a to whether fishing must take place on side of island facing shore behind rock former be decided upon be done because be anxious that expected attack must take place a soon a possible event be likely to be hastened when indian saw that be provided with line be thus able to procure food for considerable time be soon manifest that if must live upon fish need feel uneasiness a to supply scarcely have line be let down than fish be fast to harold other men soon have trout from three to six pound lying on ice beside nelly be obliged to call pearson to assistance fish when brought to surface be found to be over twenty pound in weight hour fishing procured sufficient supply for week consumption there be fear a to fish keeping for in very short time after being drawn from water be frozen stiff hard be hung up to bough near hut party be glad enough to get into shelter again for cold be intense a before early part of night passed quietly toward morning peter who be on watch ran down awakened others get shooting iron hurry up said varmint be coming time in arnest in minute everyone be at post assigned to number of dark figure must be seen coming over ice there be nigh two hundred of 'em peter said war eagle have brought whole strength of tribe contrary to usual practice indian did not attempt to crawl up to place be about to attack advanced at run across ice defender lost not moment in opening fire for of rifle must carry a far a shore shoot steady peter said throw away shot man loaded fired a quickly a must taking steady aim dark figure dotted ice behind advancing indian showed that fire be effectual one indian did not return shot chief have doubt impressed upon uselessness of firing against men lying in shelter have urged to hurry at top of speed to island crush white in hand to hand fight be three four minute from time first shot be fired before be close to island made a peter have expected toward little cove be indeed only place at landing must well be effected harold ran down hid in bush at spot where train terminated carrying with glowing brand from fire war eagle mean to have sculps time peter said to pearson never seed uglier rush white men must have done better indian have run in scattered order across ice closed up a neared cove a rushed toward four fell beneath shot of defender four few second later from volley by other section in wonderfully short time first be ready again indian wavered at slaughter opened fire upon breastwork behind defender be crouching behind pressed on with terrific yell mass of indian bounded forward harold have remained inactive crouching behind bush saw head of dark mass rush past then applied brand to train there be tremendous explosion yell scream rent air in instant dark line of water twenty foot wide stretched across mouth of cove in be piece of floating ice number of indian struggling yelling made only faint struggle before sank while others struck out for side furthest from island main body of indian appalled by explosion checked in course at once took to flight unable to check impetus fell into water upon wounded wretch who be struggling there who have crossed stood irresolute then turning leaped into water a struggled to get out on opposite side defender maintained deadly fire upon in two three minute last survivor have scrambled out be in full flight toward shore think have seen last of attack peter said a came down from breastwork joined harold in cove be first rate notion of yours lad ef have be for must have be rubbed out sure enough minute 'd have gone down be in arnest mistake 'd got steam up be determined to finish with at once whatever cost instant attack have ceased cameron have hastened to hut where girl be lying to assure that danger be over that indian be entirely defeated in hour fresh skim of ice have formed across streak of water a through clear surface many of body of indian must be seen men threw snow over to spare girl unpleasantness of such sight time went out from cove body of indian who have fallen near island be also covered with snow nearer shore be carried off by iroquois in retreat suppose peter harold said a sat round fire that evening have be in quite a awkward scrape a before have got out right why business aint nothing to affair have by lake champlain be a bad business when be surrounded in log hut a ever went through have be through good many pearson nigh got har raised more once in business of pontiac be great chief managed to get up biggest confederation agin be ever be known be well for that business did begin few year earlier when be fighting french see so long a be at war indian hoped a might pretty well exterminate other then intended to come in finish off got best of waal english drove french back finally treaty be made in europe by french agreed to clear out be jest about time a pontiac worked upon tribe to lay aside own quarrel jine french in fighting agin got seneca delaware shawnee wyandots lot of other tribe from lake hull country between niagara river mississippi jack pearson happened to be with miami when bloody belt pontiac be sending round a signal for war arrived at fort there jack knew redskin pretty well saw by manner a something unusual have happened went to commandant of fort told a much did think much of news soldier chap always despises redskin till see come yelling along with tomahawk then a often a not be other way howsumdever agreed at last to pay amount of trade good might promise to miami if news turned out worth finding out discovered that great palaver be to be held that evening at chief village be mile away from fort 'd seen

later trouble ruin will come upon now can promise in name of officer of fort good english rifle for yerself fifty gun for brave ten bale of blanket ef yer will make clean breast of first tell deviltry pontiac be up to next jine freely anyway hold aloof altogether from conspiracy till see how thing be going ' waal chief thought matter over said 'd do best at palaver night till be over knew what council decided on must tell what message be be pretty well satisfied for prairie dog be great chief in tribe felt pretty sartin 'd git council to go way wanted told 'd be at fort that governor must expect message after council be over be past midnight when chief came with four of brave told that tribe have received bloody belt from pontiac message that mingoes delaware wyandots shawnee be going to dig up hatchet against white calling upon people to massacre garrison of fort then march to jine pontiac who be about to fall upon detroit fort pitt be directed to send belt on to tribe on wabash

'd send news to english governor at new york at once ordered present promised to be delivered to chief for brave when 'd gone said 'you be right peter news be important indeed be clear that terrible storm about to bust upon frontier whether miami will keep true be doubtful now be on guard will find difficult to take fort great thing be to carry news of what be happened to detroit to put on guard will pearson start at once ' in course agreed though be clear that job be risksome one for must be easy matter to journey through wood with hull redskin tribe on war path commander wanted to carry belt with said ' might jest a well carry death warrant to first redskin a come across major gladwin who commanded at detroit knew did need to carry proof of story so afore miami have be gone hour jack took trail for detroit have got canoe hid on lake few mile away be soon on board next morning seed hull fleet of canoe coming down lake might have made race with 'em being fully manned chance be a 'd have cut off seeing at present war have not be declared judged best to seem a if be afeared so paddle up to 'em found a be lot of wyandots whose hunting ground lay up by lake superior in course did ask question a to whar be going jest mentioned a be on way down to detroit 'we be going way too ' chief said 'and will be glad to have white brother with ' so paddled along together until about noon landed nothing be said to a how be prisoner must see a how be jest a much captive a ef 'd be tied with buckskin rope jack talked over agreed a be manner o use trying to make escape that a long a chose to treat a guest 'd best seem perfectly contented make show of considering a be on war path although seeing a have woman child with baby must have known a be up to good next morning started again at daybreak after paddling hour landed hid away canoe started on foot nothing be said to saw a be expected to do a did went on till be within ten mile of detroit then halted thought be best to find out exactly how stood so jack go up to chief say that a be near detroit must jest say good by to tramp in 'why must white brother hurry ' said 'it be not good for to go on alone for wood be very full of indian 'but ' said 'the hatchet buried between white redskin so there be danger in wood chief waved hand white brother have joined wyandots will tarry with until go into detroit there be many redskin there there will be grand palaver wyandots will be present jack made sign of being dissatisfied position be pleasant one can tell here be redskin clustering like bee around detroit ready to fall upon garrison massacre 'em who be only men a knew of danger be prisoner among redskin be sartin too that though might take life till have attacked garrison be only keeping for pleasure of torturing quietly arterward situation be plain enough question be what be to be done there be about sixty of varmint around sitting by fire looking a ef did even know a be there knew a sharp eye be watching that afore 'd gone five yard hull lot must be on track jack did say much to other for knew how closely be watched did want to think a be planning escape so after few word sat down by one of fire till got time to lie down for night have be thinking saw when lay down that injun lay pretty well around while two on 'em with rifle ready to hand sat down by fire close by threw on log a if intended to watch night be goodish size clearing a 'd chose for camping ground must have have to run distance afore got to shelter of tree moon too be up be well nigh a light a day anxious a be to git away agreed that there be chance of sliding off that 'd be better to wait till next day when woke gun be gone complained to chief who said coldly that young men must carry gun give back to when got to detroit be use saying more for might at moment have ordered to be bound be better to keep use of leg a long a must for two day stayed there not seeing shadow of chance of gitting away several redskin runner come in spoke to chief got more more anxious to be off be still allowed to walk about provided did go near edge of clearing whenever went that way two injun who kept guard by turn over shouted to to go furder third morning after runner have come in chief gave word for move set out saw be taking direct line to detroit although still going in direction after two hour marching through wood got down on to detroit river here be big encampment three four hundred shawnee delaware be gathered here chief come up to a entered open gave order to wyandots in minute be bound hand foot carried to small wigwam chucked down inside like two log of wood after little talk jack agreed a after have better chance of escaping now than when be watched by hull tribe concluded that there be time to be lost wyandots have doubt be brought up in readiness to strike blow even if 'd known nothing about belt 'd have be sure that mischief be intended when three band of red varmint have gathered so close to fort be sartin must hing till night strained cord a much a possible to get to stretch bit give better chance of slipping out of one come near for time a must hear sound of voice guessed that great council be taking place agreed at once to loosen knot so a to be in readiness for work a like enough 'd put sentry over at night be risky thing to try for might be disturbed at minute still thought be only chance so jack set to work with teeth at knot in quarter of hour have loosened then undone unbound thong then fastened up again so that to eye looked jest same a before really with jerk 'd fall off must teach how to do harold time ye may find of use knot be tied up a tightly a before must have needed close examination to see that be not tied a tight a ever not word be spoken be a quiet a mouse for must hear two redskin talking outside may guess be pretty slick about know a ever felt so thankful a when laid down again jest a have be throwed without slit in tent having opened red face peered in quarter of hour later redskin come in looked at seeing a seemed to a have moved went out again jest before two on 'em came in together rolled over looked at knot found a be right then one sat down jest in door of tent other took place outside waited hour at last fire burned low camp got quiet knew be well nigh hopeless to wait for to be asleep for redskin natur ' be restless one especially when there be anything on hand will turn out two three time in night to smoke pipe by fire 'd be more restless since a 'd seen there be only four five wigwam must be sleeping on ground at last thought time be come gave jack nudge sat up be ticklish moment young un can tell ye for knew that be scarce possible to get off without alarm being raised ef wigwam have stood close to edge of forest must have be compar'tively easy for once among tree might have hoped to have outrun though moon be so pesky bright unfortunately be built not far from river must have to cross hull clearing to gain wood chance be good can tell be clear a have to try have purposely moved about pretty often so that movement must not attract attention of injun now did take minute to slip out of cord tight a looked really be not fastened at there being two loose double end between arm body must see outside sentry through open door waited till turned back looked out on river then suddenly gripped redskin sitting at entrance by neck with hand pretty tight a may reckon jack ketched knife from belt buried in body be soon over not sound made a must have startled mouse then standing up made spring on to sentry while jack used knife a before let drop softly down prepared to bolt when of sudden war whoop sounded not twenty foot away one of redskin finding ground hard suppose be strolling up to speak to sentry when saw tackle for moment be too much surprised to holler when did gave yell a brought hull tribe to foot jack have taken up sentry rifle 'ye 'd better have held yer tongue ' said a leveled on redskin before whoop be out of lip bullet hit went down like log did need to look round to see a there be chance of getting to tree for two hundred redskin be between must take to river jack ' said be thirty yard away expected moment a run to hear rifle bullet whistle round guess pontiac have given order that gun be to be fired lest might be heard at fort anyhow not shot be fired got down safe to bank chapter xvii scout story luckily enough there be canoe lying close at foot behove out jack ' say 'and then keep along bank gave shove with strength sent dancing out into river then dived in swum down close under bank there be bush growing along came up time under 'em redskin be little distance behind a reached river in course thought have throwed ourselves flat in canoe in minute two got paddled off to soon heard shout raised when found be empty by time be hundred yard below spot where have taken to water knowing a must be off along bank must find in time scrambled straight up made for tree be within fifty yard of edge of forest none of redskin be near a hull body have clustered down at spot where have jumped in have fairly set foot on bank afore saw with whoop sometimes wake even now in sleep make sit up with sweat on forehead started must run faster then than can now ye may guess went best plunged into tree went a hard a must foot redskin being fifty sixty yard behind hope be to find place with thickish underwood be darker deal under tree than in clearing still be not dark enough to hide from redskin eye run straight for knew must see arter about four hundred yard come upon place where undergrowth grew thick here began to dodge turning now one way now keeping always low in bush have lost by sight now there be so many of 'em that pretty nigh despaired of getting through of have tried to follow best part have run straight on for bit then when sure have headed scattered right left so that be ahead of now a well a on trace must hear shouting round so did only thing there be to be done made best of way back to clearing keeping low taking good care not to cross patch where moonlight through tree fell on ground be lucky for that be camp of brave have be ordinary redskin encampment there must have be squaw boy wuss still dog who must have seed moment got back being brave on war path hull gang have started arter not soul have remained in clearing did not rest there long may be sure made straight down to water there picked out canoe crossed river got into shade of tree other side then kept along down till got close to fort of detroit must see good many smoldering fire out afore guessed that strong body of redskin pretending to be friend have camped there made round 'em reached gate of fort safe sentry must let in when sergeant be fetched turned out a knew seeing that have be scouting out from thar in summer pretty thankful be when gate closed arter news must keep so waited till morning afore saw major then told whole history of matter how pontiac have raised tribe east of mississippi against found that pontiac have be into camp with fifty of warrior three day afore professing great friendship have said that in two three day must call again pay formal visit detroit then be trading post defended by stockade twenty foot high twelve hundred yard in circumference about fifty house of trader storekeeper stood within garrison be composed of men of eighteenth regiment officer have three gun two six pounder three pounder three mortar carriage be so old rotten that be of real service two vessel mounting small gun lay in river off fort governor be good soldier be naturally startled at hearing that there be something like thousand redskin in wood round said that now have warning be not afraid of messenger be sent off in canoe to carry tidings east to ask for re enforcement trader be told to get arm ready at eight o'clock in morning pontiac be seen coming with three hundred warrior there have be declaration of war redskin be supposed to be friendly so major did like to be first to commence hostility a folk who knew nothing of might likely enough have raised outcry about massacring poor injun howsumever called troop under arm disposed behind house trader too with rifle be drawn up ready gate be opened when pontiac arrived warrior entered have left rifle behind a pretended that mission be peaceful one have got tomahawk knife under blanket advanced in body toward where major gladwin officer be standing in front of quarter jack two three scout who happened to be in fort stood just behind careless like with rifle so that in case of sudden attack must keep back for moment two noticed that pontiac carried in hand wampum belt noticed because be green on one side white on other turned out arterward that when twisted that belt with two hand be to be signal for attack pontiac spoke soft for time be fine redskin ca be denied be catawba by birth have be adopted into tribe of ottawa have risen to be chief be great brave one of best speaker ever heard be wise chief a may guess by way got tribe to lay aside private quarrel make common cause against watched close kept eye on major spoke a cool a calm a if have nothing on mind must see warrior glancing about wondering doubt what have become of soldier presently chief changed tone began to pretend a be in rage at grievance other major jest put whistle to lip in moment from

of fortnight passed without further incident then sky became overcast peter indian agreed that snow must soon fall hand be at once set to work to make up store into package deerskin blanket be tied in bundle besides there be only two keg of powder about two hundred pound of frozen fish harold be in high glee at thought that imprisonment be to come to end although there be doubt that attempt must be hazardous one a backwoodsman be sure that instant snow began to fall indian must be out in great number round island to prevent defender taking advantage of storm several time harold observed two backwoodsman talking with seneca chief looking at sky thought that countenance expressed anxiety what be peter asked at length think will have snowstorm may have snow peter said think be more than snowstorm be coming cloud be flying past very fast seems to a ef be in for big gale of wind will drift snow cover footstep almost a well a snowstorm harold said yes will do that scout answered what be objection to peter in first place lad ef snow may stop where be for there 'd be chance of getting through injun unless snowed so thick must see five foot away will be difficult enough anyhow there will be four five hundred of varmint out for will bring even boy with 'em so a to form pretty close line round island only chance will be for seneca to go first to silence afore can give alarm might meet on line might be done in heavy snowstorm without snow must be impossible in next place even if got through 'd have to carry canoe why harold asked surprised what good must canoe be to with lake frozen hard see wind be on shore here lad when doe blow on lake blow fit to take har off head be a much a man can do to make way agin ' doubt whether gal must face even with help a to carrying canoe in teeth must be done why carry canoe at peter be what can not understand waal see lad force of wind acting on sech big sheet of ice will move like enough 'd see piled up in bank forty foot high on side of lake there will be strip of clear water mile wide on other be why must take canoe harold be silent in face of such probability be clear that must encumber with canoe prevision of scout proved well founded before evening wind be blowing with tremendous force small flake of snow be driven before inflicting stinging blow on face eye of who ventured out of shelter a became dark lookout announced that must see large number of indian starting from shore at distance to right left of showing that redskin be fully alive to possibility of garrison of island taking advantage of storm must hide trail to effect escape hour fury of gale increased be unanimously agreed that until diminished must be impossible for girl for men carrying canoe to face two men be placed on watch at mouth of cove where mine similar to first have be sunk in ice in semicircle little distance outside before exploded precaution have be taken on day succeeding great repulse of enemy although scout felt assured that attempt must not be repeated be thought possible that indian might toward morning if found white did not attempt to pas take advantage of storm to attempt surprise after became dark cameron harold a be custom went into girl hut to chat until be time to turn in deerskin blanket have again be unrolled covering of snow kept interior warm in spite of storm without what be noise nelly asked in pause of conversation know harold answered have heard for time be silent intent upon listening even above fury of gale dull grinding sound with occasional crash must be heard think must be ice harold said will go out see on issuing from hut be for time blinded by force of wind flying particle of snow din be tremendous made way with difficulty in teeth of storm to edge of rock then started in surprise great bank of cake fragment of ice be heaped up against wall of rock crashing grinding against other a be pressed onward by fresh addition from beyond already bank be nearly level with top of rock of vast block two foot in thickness have be thrust on to surface of lake beyond be longer brilliant white particle of snow have be swept away dull gray of rough ice lay unbroken made way at once to hut of men just a reached entrance peter who have also be out to reconnoiter came up before harold have turned to speak put head into hut turn out said tell ye be in fix aint common gale know a ever have be in worse one be use of turning out pearson asked ca hing be warmer here sight than be outside tell ye ye have got to go ice be breaking up fast be level with top of island already unless be mistaken there will be forty foot of ice piled over island afore hour be indeed alarming news in minute occupant of hut be in open air can call in scout seneca there aint fear of attack to night mortal soul not even injun must stand force of wind out on lake very short examination sufficed to show truth of peter anticipation already upper part of bank be sliding over rock be clear that in very short time whole must be covered what be to be done peter harold shouted must take to canoe there be clear water on other side harold crossed island saw that what peter said be correct broad strip of black water stretched away in darkness toward shore whole ice sheet be moving bodily before wind a island stood up in course ice to windward of be forced up over while under lee lake be clear not moment be lost canoe be got out carried over rock carefully lowered into water under shelter of island store provision be lowered into deerskin be spread on bottom girl having be helped down into boat be told to lie down be then covered with blanket men wrapped up in skin blanket took place in canoe four indian taking paddle quickly a preparation have be made there be few foot of island uncovered by ice a last man descended into boat pushed off after couple of stroke lay with boat head facing toward island at distance of fifty yard from although somewhat sheltered from wind indian be obliged to paddle hard to maintain position harold wondered at first that have not kept closer to island soon understood reason for keeping at distance massive block of ice pressed forward by irresistible force behind began to shoot from top of island into water gliding far on beneath surface with impetus of fall then shooting up again with force must have destroyed canoe at once have touched soon perfect cataract of ice be falling peter pearson took place on side of bow of canoe with pole to push off piece a drifted before gale toward shore work required utmost strength care one touch from sharp edged block must have ripped open side of bark canoe like knife in icy cold water encumbered by floating fragment of ice even best swimmer must not have gained solid ice peril be great needed strength activity of white men skill of paddler to avoid danger momentarily threatened so quickly did block float down upon that pearson thought might be impossible to avoid skin therefore be hung round boat dropping inch into water although must not have prevented boat from being stove in by larger fragment yet protected side from contact of smaller one for upward of hour struggle continued harold felt something like despair at thought of long night passed in such struggle presently sound like booming of cannon be heard above gale what be that shouted to seneca chief next to whom be sitting ice break up chief replied break up altogether proved to be case a ice be driven away from further side of lake full force of wind played upon water there a streak widened heavy sea soon got up force of swell extended under ice aiding effect of wind above vast sheet began to break up report redoubled in strength frequently ice be seen to heave swell then with sound like thunder broke great cake be forced one on top of soon instead of level plain of ice chaos of block be tossing about on wave harold watched change with anxiety no longer be channel on side marked by regular defined line floating piece encroached upon looking toward shore channel appeared to be altogether lost danger be overwhelming indian paddling with increased strength urged boat forward until within few yard of island few minute before such approach must have assured immediate destruction of boat harold saw with surprise almost simultaneously with breaking up of ice sheet fall of block from island have ceased moment reflection showed reason of phenomenon with break up of ice field pressure from behind have suddenly ceased no longer be block piled on island pushed forward by tremendous pressure of ice field torrent be stayed must approach island with safety a soon a be assured that be so canoe be brought close to rock pearson leaped ashore climbed rock ice piled twenty foot above with pole convinced that at point there be loose block likely to fall having satisfied on head descended again took place in boat be moored by rope few foot long to bush growing from fissure in rock close to water edge peter remained on watch with pole to fend off piece of ice might be brought round by wave while rest of crew wrapping up in blanket lay down at bottom of boat next morning storm still raged lake presented appearance of angry sea sheltered under lee of island party be protected from effect although light canoe rose fell on heavy swell ice have wholly disappeared from lake piece having be ground to atom against other in storm along line of shore there be great bank of ice a high a tree top way of lord be won'erful duncan cameron said storm threatened to be destruction have proved salvation when abates will be able to paddle down lake without fear of interruption yes peter said varmint be not likely to follow in first place unless thought of taking canoe into forest when storm first began aint likely a be thinking only of cutting off escape 'd have be smashed into tinder in second place must ketch if have canoe for a have eight paddle counting made out of seat when be on shore 'd be able to laugh at lastly have have taste of quality of rifle that even if have dozen canoe on hand doubt if 'd care to attack sir when storm over have nothing to do paddle down to settlement at other end of lake toward afternoon storm abated next morning sun be shining brilliantly wave have gone down sufficiently to enable canoe to start on voyage now boy pearson said cheerfully ef ye want to git froze up again 'd best be sharp for can tell ye about thirty six hour of weather lake will be solid again five minute later canoe with eight sturdy paddler started on way speeding like arrow from ice covered island have done such good service in greatest need now jake peter said more strength put into paddle of yourn sooner will have piece of meat atween jaw negro grinned talk ob massa peter say word about until see fish bery good when dere be noting else to eat jake never want to see again hab eat quite enough for rest ob life cameron who be not accustomed to use of paddle sat in stern with two girl others be used to exercise boat literally bounded along at stroke from sinewy arm by nightfall have reached opposite shore after hour work together two of have rested from time took by turn six paddle being kept constantly going without adventure arrived safely at end of lake clearing where nelly have lived so long where father mother have be killed be

in english being superior in number suffered severe defeat tarleton confident of victory led troop to attack without making proper preparation for infantry advanced bravely although american infantry held ground for time with great obstinacy drove back victory appeared to be theirs tarleton now sent order to cavalry to pursue a infantry be too exhausted having marched at rapid pace night to do so order be not obeyed major washington who commanded american cavalry advanced to cover infantry rallied behind shelter fell upon disordered british infantry thus suddenly attacked when believed that victory be in hand english gave way be driven back panic seized general rout ensued almost whole of be either killed taken prisoner tarleton in vain endeavored to induce german legion cavalry to charge stood aloof at last fled in body through wood commander officer remained with tarleton with men of seventeenth regiment of dragoon charged whole body of american cavalry drove back upon infantry partial advantage however brilliant must retrieve misfortune of day be already lost tarleton retreated with gallant little band to main army under lord cornwallis twenty five mile from scene of action british infantry be killed wounded taken prisoner with exception of small detachment have be left in rear who fell back hastily a soon a news of result of action reached legion cavalry returned to camp without loss of man defeat at cowpens have serious influence on campaign deprived lord cornwallis of greater portion of light infantry who be of greatest utility in campaign in such country while news of action have immense influence in raising spirit of colonist hitherto have uniformly met with ill success when opposed british with force even approaching equality of strength in spite of superior arm superior shooting be unable to stand charge of british infantry who have come almost to despise a foe in field unexpected success urged to fresh exertion brought to side vast number of waverer general morgan who be joined by general greene attempted to prevent cornwallis passing ford of catawba be not till february that river have fallen sufficiently to render passage possible colonel webster be sent with division to one of principal ford with order to open cannonade there make feint of crossing while general moved toward smaller le known ford general davidson with

have to support one to enable to withstand force ford took sharp turn in middle of river night being dark guard be not perceived until have reached point when enemy immediately opened fire upon guide at once fled without absence being noticed until be too late to stop colonel hall not knowing of bend in ford led men straight forward toward opposite bank although difficulty be much increased by greater depth of water through have to pas mistake be really mean of saving from much loss a american be assembled to meet at head of ford must have inflicted heavy loss upon a struggled in stream did not perceive change in direction of column march until too late guard on landing met a came on quickly routed dispersed british lost killed among whom be colonel hall wounded rest of division then crossed colonel tarleton with cavalry be sent against of american who have fallen back from various ford burning with desire to retrieve defeat of cowpens legion horse charged enemy with such fury that be completely routed of being killed morgan greene withdrew army through roanoke river hotly pursued by english for few day british army remained at hillsborough supply of food sufficient for maintenance must be found there so again fell back general greene being re enforced by considerable force now determined to fight accordingly advanced took up position near guilford court house illustration battle of guilford fought on th of march american force consisted of infantry irregular for most part backwoodsman from frontier while british force amounted to exclusive of cavalry who however took little part in fight about four mile from guilford advanced guard of army met sharp fight ensued american under colonel lee maintaining ground stanchly until twenty third regiment came up to assistance of tarleton who commanded advance main american force be posted in exceedingly strong position first line be on commanding ground with open field in front on flank be wood strong fence

forward in perfect steadiness at yard enemy opened english did not fire shot till within yard when poured in volley charged with bayonet first line of enemy at once fell back upon second here stout resistance be made posted in wood sheltering behind tree kept up for time galling fire did considerable execution general leslie brought up right wing of first battalion of guard into front line colonel webster called up second battalion enemy second line now fell back on third be composed of best troop struggle be very obstinate one american from vastly superior number occupied so long line of ground that english commander in order to face be obliged to leave large gap between different regiment thus happened that webster who with thirty third regiment light infantry second battalion of guard turned toward left found separated from rest of troop by enemy who pushed in between twenty third again be separated from guard ground be very hilly wood exceedingly thick english line became broken up into regiment separated from other fighting on own account ignorant of what be going on in other part of field second battalion of guard be first broke through wood into open ground of guilford court house immediately attacked considerable force drawn up there routed took two cannon with pursuing with too much ardor impetuosity toward wood in rear be thrown into confusion by heavy fire from body of troop placed there being instantly charged by washington dragoon be driven back with great slaughter cannon be retaken at moment british gun advancing along road through wood issued into open checked pursuit of american by well directed fire seventy first twenty third now came through wood second battalion of guard rallied again advanced enemy be quickly repulsed put to flight two gun be recaptured with two others colonel webster with thirty third returned across ravine through have driven enemy opposed to rejoined rest of force american drew off in good order twenty third twenty first pursued with cavalry for short distance be then recalled fight be now over on center left on right heavy firing be still going on here general leslie with first battalion of guard hessian regiment have be greatly impeded by excessive thickness of wood rendered impossible to charge with bayonet a struggled through thicket enemy swarmed around so that be at time engaged in front flank rear enemy be upon exceedingly steep rise lying along top of poured heavy fire into guard that suffered exceedingly nevertheless struggled up to top drove front line back found far more numerous drawn up behind a guard struggled up to crest be received by tremendous fire on front flank suffered so heavily that fell into confusion hessian regiment have suffered slightly advanced in compact order to left of guard wheeling to right took enemy in flank with very heavy fire under cover of guard re formed moved forward to join hessian complete repulse of enemy opposed to be again attacked in flank rear at last completely dispersed troop surrounding battle came to end battle be one of most obstinate well contested throughout war greatest credit be due to british who drove enemy three time own number from ground chosen by admirably adapted to mode of warfare loss a might have be expected be heavy amounting to killed wounded nearly third of force engaged between two three hundred of enemy dead be found on field of battle great portion of army be disbanded suffering of wounded on following night be great tremendous rain fell battle have extended over so large area that be impossible to find collect troop have have food during day have marched several mile before came into action nearly of wounded died during night decisive a victory be consequence be slight lord cornwallis be crippled by heavy loss following force have suffered at cowpens two battle have diminished strength of little force by fully half provision be difficult to obtain inhabitant of whom have suffered greatly upon previous occasion for loyal opinion seeing weakness of force improbability of being enabled to maintain be afraid to lend assistance to show sympathy a must be exposed on retreat to most cruel persecution by enemy three day after battle lord cornwallis retired leaving of wounded who be unable to move under protection of flag of truce from guilford court house moved troop to wilmington in north carolina seaport where hoped to obtain provision store especially clothing shoe general greene left unmolested after defeat reassembled army receiving re enforcement marched at full speed to attack lord rawdon at camden thinking that must with greatly superior force be able to destroy in isolated situation english commander fortified position american general drew back encamped on hobkirk hill two mile distant to await coming of heavy baggage cannon together with re enforcement lord rawdon determined to take initiative marching out with whole force of men advanced to attack hill be covered at foot by deep swamp english marched round stormed position american made obstinate resistance english climbed hill with such impetuosity in spite of musketry grape shot of enemy that be forced to give way several time returned to attack be finally driven off in confusion one hundred prisoner be taken lord rawdon estimated that of enemy be killed wounded american estimate be considerably lower a american fought with advantage of position while english be exposed during ascent to terrible fire be unable to return effectively be probable that american loss including wounded be inferior to of english whose casualty amounted to harold companion did not take part in battle of guilford court house in of hobkirk hill having be attached to fort known a ninety six because milestone with figure upon stood in village force here be under command of lieutenant colonel cruger who have with men of provincial corp known a delancey of second battalion of new jersey volunteer local loyalist post be far advanced so long a lord rawdon remained at camden position be not considered to be dangerous english general however after winning battle of hobkirk hill received news of retirement of lord cornwallis toward wilmington seeing that must thereby be exposed to whole of american force in south carolina must infallibly be cut off from charleston determined to retire upon port before falling back sent several messenger to colonel cruger acquainting of intention so well be road guarded by enemy that none of messenger reached ninety six colonel cruger being uneasy at length of time have elapsed since have received communication sent harold two scout out with instruction to make way toward enemy line if possible to bring in prisoner have not much difficulty in doing finding out position of two party of american placed on road between long time elapsed before american officer came along shot from peter rifle killed horse before officer must recover foot be seized by scout remained hidden in wood during day at night returned with prisoner to ninety six thirty mile distant avoiding village where resistance must be offered by hostile inhabitant from

determined to share fate of garrison in making offer colonel be influenced partly by motif of policy a stock of provision be exceedingly scanty feared that must not last if siege must be long one besides feared that a have already too often happened must place fall even solemn engagement of term of surrender must not be sufficient to protect loyalist against vengeance of countryman on may general greene with army appeared in sight of place encamped in wood within cannon shot of village lost time in course of night threw up two work within seventy pace of fortification english commander did not suffer so rash disdainful step to pas unpunished scout who be outside work brought in news of what be being done also that working party be protected by strong force three gun constituted

be completed formal summons be sent to british commander to surrender document be couched in most insolent language contained most unsoldierlike threat of consequence must befall garrison commander if offered further resistance colonel cruger sent back verbal answer that be not frightened by general greene menace that must defend post until last american battery now opened with heavy cross fire enfiladed several of work also pushed forward sap against star fort erected battery composed of gabions thirty six yard only from abattis raised forty foot high so a to overlook work of garrison rifleman posted on top did considerable execution prevented british gun being worked during day garrison tried to burn battery by firing heated shot into from want of proper furnace be unable to heat

notorious have post behind sand bag immediately facing battery be able completely to silence fire of rifleman a be certain death to show head above parapet enemy attempted to set fire to house of village by shooting blazing arrow into heavy musketry artillery fire being kept up to prevent defender from quenching flame succeeded however in preventing serious conflagration colonel cruger ordered
