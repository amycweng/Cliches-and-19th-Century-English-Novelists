father speedily sends for ought to lay aside money for future necessity if doe not come for time a may well be for from news come from england be like to be many month before affair be settled then draw from only such amount a be needed for living education study hard son for so will best be fulfilling intention of mother if like will keep money in hand serving out to a need in order that may keep matter secret will myself go to baudoin tell that need not be disquieted a to cost of maintenance for have money in hand with to discharge expense so long a may remain with next day cure informed cyril that have disposed of necklace for fifty louis upon sum cyril lived for two year thing have gone very hardly with sir aubrey shenstone king have difficult course to steer to have evicted who have obtained possession of forfeited estate of cavalier must have be to excite deep feeling of resentment among nonconformist in vain sir aubrey pressed claim in season out of season have powerful friend to aid conduct have alienated men who must have assisted like so many other cavalier who have fought suffered for charles sir aubrey shenstone found left altogether in cold for time be able to keep up fair appearance a obtained loan from prince rupert other royalist whom have known in old day who have be more fortunate than money so obtained lasted short time be not long before be again in dire strait cyril have from first little hope that father must recover estate have shortly before father left france heard conversation between sir john parton gentleman who be in inner circle of charles adviser latter have said one of king great difficulty will be to satisfy exile undoubtedly must consult own inclination only must on return at once reinstate who have suffered in estate from loyalty to father will be impossible be absolutely necessary for in proclamation at breda to promise amnesty for offence liberty of conscience oblivion a to past specially say that question of grant sale purchase of land title will be referred to parliament nonconformist be at present in majority although seems that party be willing to welcome king back may be sure that parliament will consent to anything like general disturbance of possessor of estate formerly owned by royalist in vast number of case person to whom such grant be made disposed of by sale to others must be a hard on to be ousted a be upon original proprietor to be kept out of possession truly be most difficult position one will have to be approached with great judgment more so since most of to whom land be granted be general officer soldier of parliament monk must naturally oppose step to detriment of old comrade fear there will be much bitter disappointment among exile that king will be charged with ingratitude by who think that have only to sign order for reinstatement whereas charles will have most difficult course to steer will have to govern most circumspectly so a to give offence to none of governing party a to granting estate dispossessing holder will have more power to do so than doubtless of exile will be restored to estate fear that great bulk be doomed to disappointment at rate for time extensive change can be made though may be that in distance when temper of nation at large be better understood king will be able to do something for who suffered in cause be very well for cromwell who leant solely on army to dispense with parliament to govern far more autocratically than james charles even dreamt of doing army supported cromwell must certainly not support charles be composed for most part of stern fanatic will be first to oppose attempt of king to override law doubt will erelong be disbanded will see parliament will then recover authority of cromwell deprived charles be far wiser man than father will never set against feeling of country certainly anything like general reinstatement of men who have be for last ten year haunting tavern of continent be out of question must speedily create such revulsion of public opinion a might bring about rebellion hyde staunch royalist a be must never suffer king to make so grievous error do think for moment charles who be shrewd politic above thing lover of ease quiet must think of bringing such nest of hornet about ear when after return to england became evident that sir aubrey have small chance of reinstatement in land former friend began to close purse to refuse to grant further loan be presently reduced to strait a severe a have suffered during exile good spirit have borne up so long failed now grew morose petulant loyalty to king be unshaken charles have several time granted audience have assured that did rest with justice must be at once dealt to that be practically powerless in matter knight resentment be concentrated upon hyde now lord clarendon rest of king adviser wrote seldom to cyril have wish to have boy with until must take down with in triumph to norfolk show to tenant a heir living from hand to mouth a did worried little a to how cyril be getting on lad have fallen on foot somehow said be better where be than must be with suppose when want money will write say so though where must get to send to know not anyhow need not worry about at present cyril indeed have written to soon after sale of necklace telling that need not distress about condition for that have obtained sufficient money for present necessity from sale of small trinket mother have given before death when be spent must doubtless find mean of earning living until must rejoin father never inquired into matter though made casual reference to in next letter saying that be glad cyril have obtained money a must at moment have be inconvenient to to send over cyril worked assiduously at school have be recommended to by cure at end of two year have still twenty louis left have several conversation with adviser a to best way of earning living wish to spend more father said must fain keep for future

entering service however cyril received letter from father saying that believed affair be on point of settlement therefore wished to come over in first ship sailing enclosed order on house at dunkirk for fifty franc to pay passage employer parted with with regret kind cure bade farewell in term of real affection for have come to take great interest in at rate cyril said time here have not be wasted mother gift have be turned to a much advantage a even can have hoped that must be must father hope be again disappointed fresh delay arise may with practice have have be able to earn living in london there must be there a in france many person in trade who have have little education may be able to obtain employment in keeping book of such people who be believe more common in england than here here be sixteen louis still remain put aside cyril use only for urgent necessity cyril on arriving in london be heartily welcomed by father who have for moment high hope of recovering estate however soon faded although sir aubrey must not allow even to chance remained of royalist who have like parted with estate for trifling sum to be spent in king service ever regaining possession of be

captured by algerines reckon there be of poor fellow working a slave there now for though blake did blow place pretty nigh out of water few year afterwards be certain that christian slave handed over

account to be kept be clear above board be different thing in ship altogether when instead of paying down on nail for what get have got to keep account of everything send in item jotted down in order why nellie tongue seems quieter than usual have not given chance father have be talking ever since sat down to table supper be now over two apprentice at once retired cyril must have done same mistress dowsett said sit still cyril captain say that be to be considered a one of officer of ship will be always glad to have here though of course can always go up to own room go out when feel inclined have to go out three time week to work cyril said other evening will be glad indeed to sit here mistress dowsett can not tell what pleasure be to to be in english home like be not long before john wilkes went out be off to smoke pipe captain said never light mine till go ca persuade to take with insists must not be manner to smoke in cabin be quite right father nellie said be bad enough having smoke here when mother friend mine come in be well nigh choked be not accustomed to a be for respectable london citizen doe not think of taking tobacco be london citizen nellie set up special claim to respectability be sea captain though rascally greek cannon ball other circumstance have made trader of sorely against will if must not have pipe glass of grog here must go sit with john wilkes in tavern at corner of street suppose must not be even a respectable a smoking here nellie doe mean david that want to give up smoking only think that john be quite right to go out to take pipe must say think so too know that when have sea captain of acquaintance here always send maid off to bed smoke in kitchen ay ay dear want to turn room into fo'castle there be reason in thing suppose smoke master cyril captain dave have never so much a thought of such thing in france be fashion to take snuff habit seemed to useless one think must ever have taken to wonder captain dave said after have talked for time that after living in sight of sea for so long thought never turned way can not say have never thought of cyril said have thought must greatly like to take foreign voyage must not have cared to go a ship boy to live with men so ignorant that must not even write own name thought have turned rather to army when get older think of entering foreign service that of sweden of one of protestant german prince must obtain introduction through might enter a cadet gentleman volunteer have learnt german though can not speak a can french english know enough to make way in can use sword cyril nellie dowsett asked have have very good teaching cyril replied hope to be able to hold own then be not satisfied with mode of life mistress dowsett said be satisfied with mistress inasmuch a can earn money sufficient to keep rather than settle down for life a city scrivener must go down to river ship on board first vessel must take matter where sailed for think be wrong mistress dowsett said gravely husband tell how clever be at figure might day get good post in house of one of great merchant maybe must be so cyril said life must ill suit have truly great desire to earn money must be in way to suit taste why do want to earn great deal of money cyril nellie laughed while mother shook head disapprovingly wish to have enough to buy father estate back again said though know well enough that be not likely will ever do will fight none worse have hope in mind bravo lad captain dave said knew not that there be estate in case though did hear that be son of royalist be worthy ambition boy though if be large one 't be scarce like will get enough to buy back again be not very large one cyril said 't be down in norfolk be grand old house at least so have heard father say though have little remembrance of a be three year old when left father who be sir aubrey shenstone have hoped to recover be one of many who sold estate for far le than value in order to raise money in king service a be aware none of who did so have be reinstated only who having have land taken from by parliament recovered because owner have title deed to show save grant of parliament be of effect in court thus most loyal men who sold estate to aid king have lost while did not so dispossess in service be now replaced on land seems very unfair nellie said indignantly be unfair to assuredly mistress nellie yet must be unfair to men who bought though often gave tenth of value to be turned out again unless received money back be not easy to see where money must come from for assuredly king privy purse must not suffice to pay money equally certain be that parliament must not vote great sum for purpose be hard case lad hard case captain dave said a puffed smoke from pipe now know how stand blame in way that long more for life of adventure than to settle down a city scrivener think even wife much a think of city must say otherwise alters case much mistress dowsett said did not know that cyril be son of knight though be easy enough to see that manner accord not with present position still there be fortune made in city honest work be dishonouring even to gentleman son not at mistress cyril said warmly 't be assuredly not on account must fain seek more stirring employment be always father wish intention must there be chance of ever regaining estate must enter foreign service have always looked forward to career well will wager that will do credit to lad captain dave said have proved that be ready to turn hand to work may come to have shown manly spirit boy honour for by st anthony believe that day unless musket ball pike thrust brings up with round turn will live to get own back again cyril remained talking for two hour then betook to bed after have gone mistress dowsett said after pause do not think david that seeing cyril be son of knight must be more becoming to give room downstairs instead of attic where be now lodged old sailor laughed be woman kind over said be good enough for before now forsooth because lad mentioned assuredly in boasting way that father have be knight be to be treated differently must not thank for making change dame in first place must make uncomfortable might make excuse to leave altogether in second may be sure that have be used to better quarter than have got royalist in france be put to sore shift to live fancy that have fared better since came home father must never have consented to going out to earn money by keeping account of little city trader like have not be that be driven to by want wife let boy go on a be make difference in way liked before like better now for putting gentlemanship in pocket setting manfully to work instead of hanging on skirt of royalist who have fared better than father did be grateful a be be easy to see for taking in here did partly because proved good worker have taken lot of care off shoulder partly because be fatherless alone must not have think that be ready to do more because be knight son let boy be suffer to steer ship own course if when time come can further object in way will do with right good will what do think of asked changing subject be proper young fellow father will be well content to go abroad escorted by instead of having apprentice robert ashford in attendance on have not word to say for truly like not in anyway be not bad apprentice nellie john wilkes have seldom cause to find fault with though own have great liking for never seems to look one well in face take be always bad sign know harm of when apprenticeship be out will be in year will let go own way for must not care to have on premise methinks be very unjust david lad be quiet regular in way go twice sunday to church of st alphage always tell text of sermon captain grunted maybe so wife be easy to get hold of text of sermon without having heard have doubt whether go a regularly to st alphage a say doe why must not go with to st bennet say like administration of mr catlin better david in truth parson be not one of stirring kind so much better captain dave said bluntly like not men thump pulpit make a if be about to jump out head foremost however suppose there be much harm in lad may be that failure to look one in face be not so much fault a of nature endowed with villainous squint well let turn in be past nine o'clock high time to be bed cyril seemed to to have entered upon new life when stepped across threshold of david dowsett store care anxiety have dropped from for past two year have lived life of automaton starting early to work returning in middle of day to dinner to a often a not sat down alone spending evening in utter loneliness in bare garret where be generally in bed long before father returned blamed sometimes during first fortnight of stay here for feeling of light heartedness at time came over have loved father in spite of fault must told have felt deeply depressed at loss nature be too strong for pleasant evening with captain dave family be to delightful be like traveller who after cold cheerless journey come in to warmth of fire feel glow of comfort a blood circulates briskly through vein sometimes when have other engagement went out with nellie dowsett whose lively chatter be new very amusing to sometimes went up into cheapside into st paul more often sallied out of city at aldgate walked into field on occasion carried stout cane have be father for nellie tried in vain to persuade to gird on sword be gentleman cyril must argue have right to carry one be for present sober citizen mistress nellie wish to assume to be of other condition one see with sword be gentleman of court common bully maybe highwayman after nightfall be different for then many citizen carry sword indeed be necessary to protect from ruffian who in spite of city watch oftentimes attack quiet passer by if at time escort to house of one of friend will be ready to take sword with in daytime there be occasion for weapon moreover be full young to carry one stout cane must be necessary do good service for learned in france exercise that call baton differs little from english singlestick while cyril be received almost a member of family by captain dave wife found on excellent term with john wilkes saw that be viewed with dislike by two apprentice be scarcely surprised at before coming robert ashford have be in habit of escorting young mistress when went out have doubt liked expedition a change from measuring out of rope weighing of iron in store then again apprentice did not join in conversation at table unless remark be specially addressed to a captain dave be by mean fond of elder apprentice be seldom that spoke to robert ashford be between eighteen nineteen be taller than cyril must have be difficult to judge age by face have wizened look a nellie said one day in absence might pas very well for sixty be easy enough for cyril to see that robert ashford heartily disliked covert scowl that threw across table at meal time way in turned head feigned to be too busy to notice a passed through shop be sufficient indication of ill will younger apprentice tom frost be boy of fifteen gave cyril idea of being timid lad did not appear to share comrade hostility to once twice when cyril came out from office after making up account of day fancied that boy glanced at with expression of anxiety if not of terror if be not cyril said to that tom be clearly too nervous timid to venture upon act of dishonesty must say that have be pilfering something feel sure that must not attempt such thing a though be by mean certain that robert ashford with foxy face cross eye must not steal master good one else did get chance unless be caught in act must do with impunity for everything here be carried on in such free easy fashion that amount of good might be carried off without being missed after thinking matter over said one afternoon when employer came in while be occupied at account have not seen anything of stock book captain dave everything else be now straight balanced up to to day here be book of good sold book of good received ledger with account there be stock book such a find in almost other place where work what do want with stock book captain dave asked can not know how stand without cyril replied know how much have paid how much have received during year unless have stock book know whether difference between receipt expenditure represents profit for stock may have so fallen in value during year that may really have made loss while seeming to make profit how can that be captain dave asked get fair profit on article there ought to be profit of course cyril said sometimes be found not to be so moreover if there be stock book can tell at time without trouble of opening bin weighing metal how much stock have of article sell can order good accordingly how must do that be very simple captain dave cyril said after taking stock of whole of good must have ledger in article must have page more to day must enter from john wilkes sale book list of good have gone out under own heading thus at moment if be to ask how much chain have got in stock must tell within fathom when did take stock last must say be about fifteen month since be only yesterday john wilkes be saying have better have thorough overhauling quite time too must think captain dave suppose have got account of last stock taking with date of oh yes have got that captain unlocked desk took out account book have be lying there ever since took wonderful lot of trouble to do have clerk two men in for fortnight for of course john boy be attending to usual duty have often wondered since why must have have that trouble over matter have never be of slightest use to well hope will take again sir be trouble doubt will find great advantage be sure think needful cyril most needful captain dave will see advantage of afterwards well if think so suppose must be done captain said with sigh will be giving lot of trouble to keep new book of yours be nothing sir now have got back work up will be simple matter to keep daily work straight will find ample time to do without need of lengthening hour cyril now set to work in earnest telling mr dowsett have book that wanted to make up in room before going to bed asked to allow to keep light burning mr dowsett consented shook head said must assuredly injure health if worked by candle light fortunately john wilkes have just opened fresh sale book cyril told that wished to refer to particular in back book first opened ledger by inscribing under different head amount of description of good kept in stock at last stock taking then entered under respective head sale have be made while on opposite page entered amount purchased took month hard work finished on very day that new stock taking concluded chapter iii thief somewhere two day after conclusion of stock taking cyril said after breakfast be over must trouble captain dave to give hour up here before go downstairs to counting house be free for two hour now there be matter upon must like to speak to privately certainly lad old sailor said somewhat surprised will be quiet enough here a soon a table be cleared dame nellie will be helping maid do up cabin will then be sallying out marketing when maid have cleared table cyril went up to room returned with large ledger several smaller book have for last month captain dave be making up stock book for own satisfaction bless lad why have taken trouble account then for writing so long at night for dame have be quarrelling with be interesting work cyril said quietly now see sir went on opening big ledger here be separate account under head page see be for heavy cable for hawser of at date of last stock taking there be according to book handed to five hundred fathom in stock be amount have purchased since now upon other side be sale of cable entered in sale book adding together deducting from other side will see there must remain in stock four hundred fifty fathom according to new stock taking there be four hundred thirty eight be take a near a must expect to get for in measuring out of so many thousand fathom of cable during fifteen month between two stock taking there may well have be loss of twelve fathom in giving good measurement be so captain dave said always say to john wilkes 'give good measurement john better little over than little under nothing can be clearer more satisfactory cyril closed book be sorry to say captain dave item be not so satisfactory greatly fear that have be robbed to considerable amount robbed lad captain said starting up from chair who must rob not john wilkes can be sworn not two apprentice for surety for never go out during day john keep sharp look out upon entrance to shop be always locked barred after work be over so that none can enter without getting key a know john always brings up hand to a soon a have fastened door be mistaken lad although know that intention be good must be careful how make charge might bring ruin to innocent men carelessness there may be robbery assuredly not have not brought charge without warrant captain dave cyril said gravely if will bear with for few minute think will see that there be at least something want looking into well be only fair after trouble have taken lad must hear what have to say will need strong evidence indeed to make believe that there have be foul play well sir cyril said opening ledger again in first place must point out that in heavy article such a must not conveniently be carried away tally of stock taker corresponds closely with figure in book in best bower anchor figure be absolutely same a have seen in heavy cable closely correspond in large ship compass ship boiler ship galley number tally exactly so be with heavy article main block be correct other heavy gear show that john wilkes book be carefully kept must be strange indeed if heavy good have be properly entered light one omitted yet when turn to small article find that there be great discrepancy between figure here be account for instance of half inch rope according to ledger there must be eighteen hundred fathom in stock whereas stock taker found three hundred eighty in two inch rope there be deficiency of two hundred thirty fathom in one inch rope of six hundred twenty size a know be always in requisition thief must find ready purchaser for coil of of a might be expected be in copper that deficiency be most serious of fourteen inch bolt eighty two be short of twelve inch bolt hundred thirty of eight inch three hundred nine so on throughout almost copper store according to expenditure receipt book captain dave have made in last fifteen month twelve hundred thirty pound according to book stock be le in value by two thousand thirty four pound than must have be be therefore poorer man than be at beginning of fifteen month trading by eight hundred four pound captain dave sat down in chair breathing hard took out handkerchief wiped drop of perspiration from forehead be sure of boy said hoarsely be sure that have made mistake in figure quite sure cyril said firmly in case in have found deficiency have gone through book three time compared figure be sure that if put book into hand of city accountant will bear out figure for time captain dave sat silent hast idea said at last how have come about have none cyril replied that john wilkes be not concerned in be a sure a be thinking matter over see not how apprentice must have carried off so many article heavy bulky when left shop in evening without john wilkes noticing so sure be that advice must be that must take john wilkes into confidence tell how matter stand only objection to be that be hasty man that fear must not be able to keep countenance so that apprentice must remark that something be wrong be far from saying that have hand in must be grievous wrong to to have suspicion when there be shadow of evidence against at rate if matter be to be stopped thief detected be most important that must have if be guilty suspicion that be in way being watched that deficiency have be discovered if have have hand in matter most assuredly have accomplice for such good must not be disposed of by apprentice to dealer without being sure that must have be stolen be right there lad quite right did john wilkes know have be robbed in way must get into fury word must restrain from falling upon apprentice beating till got of truth out of may be quite innocent cyril said may be that thief have discovered mode of entry into store by opening shutter at back by loosening board even by delving up under ground be surely easier to believe than that boy can have contrived to carry off so large quantity of good under john wilkes eye be so lad have never liked robert ashford god forbid must suspect of such crime only because forehead be a wrinkled a ape providence have set eye crossway in head can not always judge ship by upper work may be ugly to eye yet have clear run under water still ca help going by what see agree with that if tell john wilkes about boy will know five minute afterwards that ship be on fire if tell how be to get to bottom of what be going on be difficult question few day will not make much difference when know that have be going on for over year may for aught know have be going on much longer first thing captain dave be to send book to accountant for to go through check figure there be need for lad know how careful be can not have gone so far wrong a sir be sure that there be mistake for own sake a well a mine be well that must have signature of accountant to correctness of book if have to lay matter before magistrate must not take testimony a to loss might even say that be rash in acting upon word of boy like might then be obliged to have account made up anew must cost more cause much delay in process whereas if put in book say that correctness be vouched for by accountant question must arise on must there be delay now for while book be being gone into can be trying to get to bottom of matter here ay ay will be done master cyril a say for life of see how be to get at bottom of ship to find out where be leaking seems to that first thing captain dave be to see to warehouse a agreed that apprentice can not have carried out good under john wilkes eye can not have come down night after night through house warehouse must have be entered from without a never go in there must be best that must see to matter there be fastening of shutter in first place then boarding round a for will look round outside window of room look into street if will take to one of room at back can look at surroundings of yard may gather idea whether good can have be passed over into of house abutting on a be more likely into lane run up by side captain led way into one of room at back of house opening casement cyril leaned out store occupied fully yard rest being occupied by anchor pile of iron ballast etc there be two three score of gun of various size piled on other large store of cannon ball be ranged in great pyramid close by wall ten foot high separated yard from lane cyril have spoken of on left adjoining warehouse be yard of next shop belonged to wool stapler behind be back of number of small house crowded in between tower street leadenhall street suppose know who life in house captain dave indeed land be not like sea afloat when one see sail one wonder what be nationality whither be bound still more whether be honest trader rascally pirate here on land one scarcely give thought a to who may dwell in house round will walk round presently cyril said gather a far a can who be live there a have said fancy be over wall into alley that good have departed apprentice room be side of house be not yes john wilkes sleep in room next to yours door opposite to be that of lad room do window of of room look into lane be blank wall on side there be clock striking nine cyril said starting be time for to be off then will take book to day captain dave will carry off at once when return will look narrowly into fastening of two window door from warehouse into yard will take care to do so when boy be engaged in front shop when work be done cyril went round to house behind yard found that stood in small court with three four tree growing in centre be evidently inhabited by respectable citizen over door of one be painted joshua heddings attorney next to be gilbert gushing who dealt in jewel silk other precious commodity from east next to be doctor beyond dealer in spice be enough to assure that be not through such house a that good have be carried cyril have not be back at mid day meal for work day lay up by holborn bar where have two customer whom attended with hour interval between visit on day on went there be accustomed to get something to eat at tavern hard by supper be unusually quiet meal captain dave now then asked john wilkes question a to business matter of day evidently spoke with effort nellie rattled on a usual burden of keeping up conversation lay entirely on shoulder of cyril after apprentice have left john wilkes have started for usual resort captain lit pipe nellie signed to cyril to come seat by in window projected out over street enabled occupant of seat at side to have view up down have be doing to father cyril asked in low tone have be quite unlike day generally when be out of temper rate everyone heartily a if be mutinous crew to day have gone about scarcely speaking have said cross word to of several time when spoke to got answer be easy to see that be terribly put out about something be in usual spirit at breakfast then know be talking with for hour doe not take much guessing to see that must have be something passed between have put out now what be see why must say that mistress nellie be true did have talk together examined fresh book have be making out said that be mightily pleased with work went away at nine o'clock something may have occurred to upset between dinner mean that mean to tell anything about master cyril well then may consider in black book altogether said petulantly be sorry that must say so said if be true that anything have said to have ruffled must be for to tell not for methinks have treated robert ashford scurvily will take for escort to see majesty attend service at st paul to morrow cyril smiled think must be fair to give turn mistress be glad to see that have kind thought nellie rose indignantly taking work sat down by side of mother be fine evening cyril said to captain dave think will take walk round will return in hour captain understood by glance cyril gave that be going out for purpose connected with matter have in hand ay ay lad said be not good for to be sitting moping at home evening have often wondered before did not take walk on deck before turned in always used to do so think there be moping in captain dave cyril said with laugh if knew how pleasant evening have be to after life lived before must not say so cyril only object in going out however be to avoid necessity of having to talk with dame dowsett nellie thought be running on nothing robbery have found very difficult to talk in usual manner to answer nellie sprightly sally be dark already few oil lamp gave feeble light here there at present have formed plan of detecting thief be a much puzzled a captain a to how good must have be removed must be necessary of course to watch apprentice did not think that anything be likely to come out of be warehouse must be watched in order to discover how thief made entry own idea be that got over wall by mean of rope in way managed to effect entry into warehouse apprentice must hardly aid unless came down through house if have managed to get duplicate key of door leading from bottom of stair to shop must of course unbar window pas thing out that part of business must be easy must not believe that must venture frequently to pas down through house be old one stair creaked be light sleeper have got into way of waking at slightest sound from long watch have have for father return felt sure that must have heard open door steal along passage past room however quietly might do walked up exchange then along cheapside a far a st paul back quiet a be in thames street there be lack of animation elsewhere apprentice be generally allowed to go out for hour after supper regulation being that returned to home by eight o'clock number of be about good many citizen be on way home after supping with friend city watch with lantern patrolled street not infrequently interfered in quarrel broke out among apprentice cyril felt more solitary among knot of laughing noisy lad than in quiet street be glad to be home again captain dave came down to open door have just sent woman to bed said two boy came in five minute ago thought must not be long did not go out for anything particular cyril said mistress nellie insisted that there be something wrong with must know what be about so feeling indeed indisposed to talk thought best to go out for short time yes yes woman always want to know lad have be long enough at sea may be sure to know when anything be wrong be best thing to keep from passenger a long a can took book away morning captain dave cyril asked a sat down ay lad took to master skinner who bear a good reputation a accountant in city promised to take in hand without loss of time have be able to hing here john one other of boy be always in warehouse have have opportunity of examining door shutter closely when house be sound asleep will take lantern go down to look at have be thinking that must let john wilkes into matter be too much to bear on mind by be first mate see in time of danger first mate if be worth anything be man captain relies on for help by mean tell then cyril said can keep book have experience in matter like will be very glad to have opinion advice there be half past eight be a punctual a clockwork cyril ran down let john in captain want to speak to said before go up to bed john after carefully bolting door followed upstairs have got bad news for john there light pipe again sit down good dame have gone off to bed have got cabin to ourselves john touched imaginary hat obeyed order ship have sprung bad leak john lad here have found out be well did for unless have done so must have have foundering under foot without so much a suspecting anything be going wrong sailor took newly lighted pipe from between lip stared at captain in astonishment yes be hard to believe mate by lord harry be a say there be pirate about somewhere book show that since stock taking fifteen month ago have eased craft of good to tune of two thousand pound odd john wilkes flung pipe on to table with such force that shivered into fragment dash timber exclaimed who be man only give order sir be ready to range alongside board be what have got to find out john that good have gone be certain how can have gone beat altogether do mean to say captain that have stolen out of place under eye know nothing about ca be sir there must be mistake know naught

be concluded must have sworn that cargo be right according to manifest well captain can say be if 'ere list be correct best thing can do be to send adrift a blind fool have kept tally a correct a must thought have marked down package have left ship here must have be passing out pretty nigh in cart load under very eye knew nothing about blame john more than blame be generally about on deck have more idea that cargo be being meddled with than have have be wrong in letting matter go on so long without taking stock of seeing that be all right never saw need for be what come of taking to trade know nothing about have just be like two child thinking that be plain above board that have nothing to do to sell good to fill up again when hold got empty well be of use talking over part of business what

captured be settled that cyril be to take first watch that captain must relieve at one o'clock at nine family went to bed quarter of hour later cyril stole noiselessly from attic down to john wilkes room door have be left ajar candle be still burning put chair by window sailor said from bed left light for might run foul of something other in dark though have left pretty clear gangway for cyril blew out candle seated at window for time must see nothing told that whole content of warehouse might be carried off without being wiser will certainly see nothing said to at least may hear something so saying turned fastening of casement opened about inch a eye became accustomed to darkness be able to make out line of roof of warehouse be three four foot below level of eye twenty foot away on left time passed slowly kept awake by thinking over old day in france lesson have learnt with friend harry parton teaching of old clergyman heard bell of st paul strike ten eleven last stroke have scarcely ceased to vibrate when rose to foot suddenly heard on left scraping noise moment later ceased then be renewed again lasted few second then heard irregular shuffling noise seemed to upon roof of warehouse pressing face to casement suddenly became aware that straight line of ridge be broken by something moving along moment later made out second object just behind first moving with greatest care made way out of room half closed door behind crossed passage pushed at door opposite captain dave said in low voice get up at once please make noise ay ay lad there be movement from bed moment later captain stood beside what be lad whispered there be two figure moving along on ridge of roof of warehouse think be apprentice heard slight noise a if be letting down from window by rope be just over roof know there be rustling sound a captain slipped doublet on be so young scoundrel what can be doing on roof went to window behind just a reached there be vivid flash of lightning sufficed to show figure lying at full length at farther end of roof then be dark again second two later came sharp crashing roar of thunder have better stand well back from window cyril whispered flash might show to anyone looking way what doe mean lad what on earth be that boy doing there must not see be think be ashford cyril said figure in front seemed smaller of two where on earth can tom have got to must fancy sir that robert have lowered so that can get foot on crane swing outwards then might sit down on swing by rope into loft if door be not fastened inside robert being taller must have difficulty in lowering there broke off a flash of lightning lit up sky have gone now there be one on roof john wilkes be by time standing beside having started up at first flash of lightning do go up john into

hanging down from will cast adrift certainly not john mean to take tonight must be allowed to go back to bed without suspicion that have be watched hope trust that be not so bad a look that boy have only broken out from devilry know boy will do thing of sort just because be forbidden there must be more than john wilkes said if have be just after went to room might be that went to tavern other low resort town be asleep now again went close to window pushed casement little more open stood listening there in two three minute there be very slight sound heard be unbolting door into yard john wilkes whispered must give month pay to be behind with rope end half minute later there be sudden gleam of light below must see door open light disappeared again heard footstep then saw light thrown on fastening to outer gate must make out that two figure below be applying key to padlock be taken off laid down then heavy wooden bar be lifted also laid on ground gate opened a if pushed from other side two figure went out sound of low murmur of conversation must be heard then returned gate be closed fastened again entered warehouse light disappeared door be closed be how thing went john ay ay sir foreman growled a be undoing gate light fell on coil of rope have set down there bag guess have copper of kind in have done cleverly young villain there be not noise enough to wake cat must have have bolt hinge well oiled have better close casement now sir for a come back along ridge will be facing if flash of lightning came must see that be half open even if did not catch sight of face must think suspicious that window must be open might put on guard yes may a well turn in at once john like enough when get back will listen for bit at door so a to make sure that everything be quiet before turn in there be nothing more to see now of course will get in a got out have better turn in a be cyril may listen at door cyril at once went up to room closed door placed chair against then lay down on bed listened intently four five minute later thought that heard door open must not be sure for just at moment heavy drop began to patter down upon tile noise rose louder louder until must scarce have heard speak then there be bright flash deep rumble of thunder mingled with sharp rattle of raindrop overhead listened for time to storm then dropped off to sleep thing went on a usual at breakfast next morning during meal captain dave gave foreman several instruction a to morning work be going on board royalist said john browning want to overhaul gear see what will do for voyage two what must be new skipper asked for new running rigging over think that there ca be occasion for being renewed expect will be in till dinner time so anyone want to see must come again in afternoon ten

hear open door into yard then go into warehouse be ready to make rush out a soon a get gate open john will have boatswain whistle ready will give signal will bring watch up so will be caught in trap must think must be very good plan captain dave though wish that must have be done without tom frost being taken be timid sort of boy have doubt that have be entirely under thumb of robert well if have will get off lightly captain said even if boy be timid boy know what will be consequence if be caught robbing master cowardice be excuse for crime lad boy have always be well treated though dare say ashford be worst of two if other have be honest must not have seen robbing without letting know for six night watch be kept without success evening when family apprentice have retired to rest john wilkes went quietly downstairs admitted four constable letting out in morning before anyone be astir mr dowsett have be taken into husband confidence so far a to know that have discovered have be robbed be keeping watch for thief be not told that apprentice be concerned in matter for captain dave felt sure that however much might try to conceal robert ashford must perceive by look that something be wrong nellie be told day two later for although ignorant of father nightly watching be conscious from manner that of mother that something be amiss be so persistent in inquiry that captain consented to mother telling that have suspicion be being robbed warning that be essential that subject must not be in way alluded to father be worrying over good deal nellie be better that must not perceive that be aware of just let thing go on a be be loss serious mother yes think that good deal of money have gone think mind that so much a fact that so far doe know who people most concerned in may be have sort of suspicion in one quarter have clue to men most to blame doe cyril know anything about nellie asked suddenly yes know dear indeed be owing to cleverness that father first came to have suspicion oh that explains nellie said have be talking to father asked what be about must not tell have be very angry with ever since have noticed that have be behaving very foolishly mr dowsett said quietly that for last week have be taking robert with a escort when went out of evening suppose did that to annoy cyril think that minded much think did mother nellie agreed with laugh betrayed certain amount of irritation saw that smiled two three evening back when told robert at supper wanted to go out with be rarely angry can tell cyril have indeed troubled in way about nellie coolness when have so pointedly asked robert to go with have be amused at thought of how greatly must be mortified when robert be haled up to guildhall for robbing father at thought that have be accompanying a escort rather hope will be last watch captain dave said on seventh evening why do hope so specially to night lad of course have be hoping so night think be likely that men who take good come regularly once week for in case there must be occasion for to meet at other time to arrange on night must be in lane yes be like enough cyril hour will probably be same too john will share watch to night so a to be ready to get men off without loss of time cyril have always taken first watch be from half past nine till twelve captain wilkes have taken other watch by turn a before just a bell finished striking eleven three watcher again heard through slightly open casement scraping noise on left have be agreed that must not move lest sound must be heard outside grasped stout cudgel held in hand gazed at roof of warehouse must now be plainly seen for moon be half full sky be clear a before two figure went along time must clearly recognise be sitting astride of ridge tile moved along by mean of hand waited until saw one after other disappear at end of roof then john wilkes quietly stole downstairs four constable have be warned to be specially wakeful be at again to night john said to a entered now do two who go round into leadenhall street start at once take post at end of lane for five six minute thief outside may not have come up at present a go out leave door ajar in five minute others must stand ready go to corner wait in doorway below until hear whistle will be only fifteen twenty yard up lane must see if took up station at corner moment hear whistle rush out have at will be there before will john went down with last two men entered shop stood there waiting until must be joined by master latter cyril remained at window until saw door of warehouse

unbarring gate be nearly accomplished a swung open john wilkes put whistle to lip blew loud shrill call three rushed forward there be shout of alarm fierce imprecation three of four figure at gate sprang at scarce blow have be struck when two constable ran up joined in fray two men fought stoutly be soon overpowered robert ashford knife in hand have attacked john wilkes with fury must have stabbed a attention be engaged upon one of men outside have not cyril brought cudgel down sharply on knuckle when with yell of pain dropped knife fled up lane have gone short distance however when fell into hand of two constable who be running towards one of promptly knocked down with cudgel then proceeded to bind hand behind while other ran on to join in fray be over before got there comrade be engaged in binding two robber tom frost have taken part in fight stood looking on paralysed with terror when two men be overpowered fell on knee beseeching master to have mercy on be too late tom captain said have be robbing for month now have be caught in act will have to take share in punishment be prisoner of constable here not of mine even if be willing to let go must have say in matter still if make clean breast of what know about will do can to get off lightly seeing that be boy have be perhaps led into will not be disposed to be hard on pick up lantern bring here john let see what plunder be making off with there be rope time bag containing fifty pound weight of brass copper fitting one of constable took possession of have better come along with to bridewell master dowsett to

said to cyril well master cyril have be good night work mighty thankful be that have caught pirate be good day for when came to captain might have gone on robbing till time came that there be nothing more to rob must never have held up head again for though captain must never believe that have have hand in bringing to ruin other people must not have thought so might never have got chance of proving innocence now will just go to end of yard see if did manage to get into warehouse by mean of crane a thought did found that crane have be swung out just far enough to afford foot hold to lowering on to from roof door of loft stood open just a said must not have be righter not if have seen at now reckon may a well lock up place again turn in captain have got key of front door will leave lantern burning at bottom of stair cyril got up a soon a heard movement in house went down to shop have be already opened by john wilkes seems quiet here without apprentice john be there way in can help thank sir sha be moving good about till after breakfast then doubt captain will get extra man in to help reckon will have to get neighbour in to give eye to place while be away at court see there be rope still hanging from window cyril said a went out into yard thought best to leave there john wilkes replied ai be up into loft be best to leave matter just a be like enough will send officer down from court to look at when family assembled at breakfast mr dowsett be looking very grave captain on other hand be in capital spirit nellie a usual be somewhat late where be everybody asked in surprise seeing that cyril alone be in place with father mother john wilkes be downstairs looking after shop will come up have breakfast when have done father replied be apprentice out then

mutiny doubt judge will take lenient view of tom frost case on ground of youth because doubt be influenced by ashford must not give much for robert chance doubt will be blow to nellie for seem to have taken to mightily of late nellie be about to give emphatic contradiction a remembered how pointedly have asked for escort during last few day flushed up be silent be terrible to think of said after pause suppose be what cyril be consulting about father have to ask pardon master cyril for rudeness to of course did not think be anything of consequence that must not have told if have wished to do so need not beg pardon mistress nellie doubt thought churlish on part to refuse to gratify curiosity be not surprised that took offence knew that when learned how important be to keep silence over matter that must acquit of intention of making mystery about nothing suppose knew nellie asked knew that father believed that be being robbed nellie that be keeping watch for hour night did not know that suspected apprentice be glad that did not for assuredly must have found very hard to school face so that must not guess that aught be wrong be why said nothing about nellie have be a much a have be able to do to sit at table talk in shop a usual with boy knew be robbing know honest john wilkes must have felt still more till week ago must not believe that have hand in matter be seven night since cyril caught creeping along roof called to window in john wilkes room whence be watching yard not thinking enemy be in house how did come to suspect robbery be going on cyril simply because on making up book found there be great deficiency in store be what be doing when be sitting up at night after be in bed miss nellie father said may thank star that took berth in ship for scoundrel must have foundered to certainty if have not done so tell child have saved craft from going to bottom have not said much to about know that feel le who be other men who be taken father ca tell nellie went to bridewell with a soon a saw safely lodged there came home will be have up before lord mayor morning then dare say will know about now must go take watch below let john wilkes come off duty why john what be matter mr dowsett said when foreman entered nothing worth speaking of mistress got clip over eye from one of pirate be capturing thing mattered nothing one way other might have cost life because for moment pretty well dazed that young villain bob be just coming at with knife reckon must have gone hard with if master cyril here have just in nick of time brought stick down on robert knuckle so sharply that fellow dropped knife with yell took to heel only to fall into hand of two of watch coming from other end of lane did good turn lad if ever get chance of ranging up alongside of in fray may trust to return held out hand to cyril gave warm grip to hand latter laid in be rum start mistress john went on a sat down to meal that two old hand like captain be sailing on not dreaming of hidden rock sand bank when lad who used to look upon a young cockerel who be rather above position must come forward have saved from shipwreck be indeed john mistress said earnestly thank god indeed that put thought into mind of captain dave to ask to take up abode with seemed to then that be doing little kindness must cost nothing whereas have turned out saving of dear dear nellie who have be sitting with frown on pretty face said pettishly what talk there will be about how jane greenwood martha stebbings rest of will laugh at used to say wondered how must go about with such ugly wretch behind of course spoke up for said that be honest knave faithful now turn out that be villain robber will never hear last of will get over nellie mother said severely must be much better if instead of thinking of such trifle must consider how sad thing be that two lad must lose character perhaps life simply for greed of other people good must cry when think of know that robert ashford have father to grieve about for husband father took out of sheer charity tom parent be living will be heart breaking indeed to when hear of son misdoings trust captain dave will get off cyril said a be so young may turn king evidence feel sure that did not go willingly into affair have noticed many time that have frightened look a if have something on mind believe that acted under fear of other a soon a john wilkes have finished breakfast went with captain dave cyril to magistrate court at guildhall other case be first heard then apprentice with two men who have be captured in lane be brought in placed in dock men bore mark showed have be engaged in severe struggle that watch have used stave with effect one be elderly man with shaggy grey eyebrow other be very powerfully built fellow who seemed from attire to follow profession of sailor tom frost be sobbing bitterly one of robert ashford hand be bandaged up a be placed in dock cast furtive glance round with shifty eye a fell upon cyril expression of deadly hate came over face men of watch who have captured first gave evidence a to finding in act of robbery testified to desperate resistance have offered to capture captain dave then entered witness box swore first to good be found on being property then related how having come to knowledge that be being robbed have set watch have eight day previously seen two apprentice getting along roof how have come out from warehouse door have opened outer gate have handed over good have brought out to person unknown waiting to receive why did not stop in commission of theft alderman in chair asked because sir have done so men considered to be chief criminal who have doubtless tempted apprentice to rob must then have made off therefore thought better to wait until must lay hand on also so got four men of watch to remain in house at night then went on to relate how after watching seven night have again seen apprentice make way along roof how receiver of booty be taken by watch aided by foreman master cyril shenstone who be dwelling in house after john wilkes have given evidence cyril went into box related how being engaged by captain david dowsett to make up book found upon stock being taken that there be deficiency to amount of many hundred of pound in certain store notably such a be valuable without being bulky be anything known a to prisoner magistrate asked officer of city watch in charge of case nothing be known of two boy honour men be well known elder who gave name of peter johnson be one joseph marner keep marine shop close to tower for long time have be suspected of being receiver of stolen good have never be able to lay finger on before other man have for last year acted a assistant in shop answer closely to description of man ephraim fowler who have long be wanted man be seaman in brig trading to yarmouth after altercation with captain stabbed then slew mate who be coming to assistance then with threat compelled other two men on board to let take boat when be off brightlingsea rowed away have not be heard of since if will remand before come up again hope to find men who be on board see if identify be in possession of joseph marner shop have found large quantity of good that have reason to believe be proceeds of other robbery after prisoner have left dock captain dave went up to officer believe said that boy have not voluntarily taken part in robbery have be led away perhaps obliged by threat to take part in may be able to give assistance for maybe men be not only person to whom stolen good have be sold may be able to put on track of other receiver matter be out of hand now officer said will represent what say in proper quarter now have better come round with may be able to pick out of property only made seizure of place hour ago have men who came in on duty morning to take look at prisoner fortunately two three of recognised marner may guess lost time in getting search warrant going down to place be most important capture have made for time may lead to discovery of other robbery have be puzzling for month past there be gang known a black gang have never be able to lay hand on of leader such fellow a have be captured have refused to say word have denied knowledge of there have be number of robbery of mysterious kind none of have be able to trace have be put down to same gang chief constable be waiting for there will make thorough search of premise be like enough will come across clue of importance at rate if can find of article stolen in robbery be speaking of will be strong proof that marner be one of chief of gang may lead to further discovery have better come with john captain dave said know good better than do will come cyril must be of use in identifying good sir be due in hour at one of shop search be exhaustive one there be appearance of underground cellar on of board of shop being taken up be found that there be large one extending over whole house contained immense variety of good in one corner be pile of copper bolt captain dave john be able to claim at once a bore brand of maker from whom obtained stock there be box of copper brass ship house fitting

given of good have be stolen from country house whole be impounded by chief constable carried away in cart upper part of house be carefully searched wall tapped wainscotting pulled down floor carefully examined several hiding place be found nothing of importance discovered in must advise chief constable said to captain dave to put in claim for article corresponding with have lost of course if anyone else come forward also put in claim matter will have to be gone into if of can absolutely swear to thing suppose will have to settle somehow between if one else claim will get without question for can swear to best of knowledge belief be yours bring sample of own good to show that exactly correspond with have doubt that good deal of readily saleable stuff such a rope brass sheaf for block thing of sort will have be sold a be clear that there be good deal of stuff in stock found below hope loss will not be very great there be doubt have be splendid find for be likely enough that will discover among box good have be obtained from score of robbery in london likely enough in country have arrested three men found in place two woman may get from of information will enable to lay hand on of others concerned in robbery chapter v kidnapped that afternoon captain dave went down to bridewell have interview with tom frost in presence of master of prison well tom never expected

got have got right be answer of man who be carrying then felt that be being carried down stair someone took be thrown roughly down then there be slight rattling noise followed by regular sound wondered vaguely what be a sens came back flashed upon be sound of oar be in boat be time before must think why must be in boat have doubtless be carried off by of friend of prisoner partly perhaps to prevent giving evidence against partly from revenge for part have played in discovery of crime in few minute sound of oar ceased there be bump a boat struck against something hard then be lifted up someone took hold of from above be carried few step roughly thrust in somewhere there be sound of something heavy being thrown down above then for long time knew nothing more when became conscious again be able a lay there to come to distinct conclusion a to where be have be kidnapped carried off taken out in boat to craft anchored in river be now in hold felt almost suffocated wrap round head prevented breathing freely gag in mouth pressed on tongue gave severe pain while head ached acutely from effect of blow first thing to do be if possible to free hand so a to relieve from gag muffling effort two soon showed that be loosely bound doubtless man who have attacked have not wasted much time in securing arm believing that blow must be sufficient to keep quiet until be safe on board ship be therefore without much difficulty that managed to free one of hand be then easy task to get rid of rope altogether cloak be pulled from face feeling for knife cut lashing of gag removed from mouth lay quiet for few minute panting from exhaustion putting up hand felt beam about foot above body be then in hold already stored with cargo next thing be to shift position among barrel bale upon be lying until found comparatively level spot be in too great pain to think of sleep head throbbed fiercely suffered from intense thirst from time to time heavy footstep passed overhead presently heard sudden rattling of block flapping of sail then noticed that there be slight change in level of position knew that craft be under way on voyage down river seemed immense time to before saw faint gleam of light edging along found again under hatchway through crack in light be shining be hour before hatch be lifted off saw two men looking down water said be dying of thirst bring pannikin of water one

place broken up there be saying that score of may not get rope round neck in consequence want carried away what do with be nothing to so long a set foot in england again 'will holland suit be going across there ' said 'after touching at ipswich aldborough ' must be much safer for everyone else if happen that fall over before get there however will call ' then if be to fall overboard cyril said with smile must not be breaking agreement captain might fall overboard to night know must not advise lad have much better stay where be say might anchor off harwich that if fell overboard must manage to swim ashore tell must not give twopence for life when got back to london be to interest of score of men to keep marner mouth shut have shown willingness to help a far a must by getting out of way if got back must have life first time ventured out of door after dark must be afraid marner must suppose have sold if be to turn up at trial a like a not must round on whole lot besides think must be

friend except employer captain david dowsett by time will have made up mind that be dead wo make much difference whether return in four five day a many week chapter vi narrow escape eliza for cyril after leaving ipswich learnt be name unloaded rest of cargo at aldborough then sailed across to rotterdam skipper fulfilled promise by taking cyril to house of one of men with whom did business arranging with to board boy until word came that must safely return to england man be diamond cutter to packet of jewellery gem must not be disposed of in england have often be brought over by captain latter have nothing to do with pecuniary arrangement be made direct by marner have only to hand over packet take back sum of money to england understand captain said to cyril have not said word touching matter for be here have only told that have be thought be a well must be out of england for time of course understood that be wanted for affair in have taken part matter not what think have paid for month board for here be three pound will be enough to pay for passage back if must not return if hear from see eliza within four week there be reason why must not take passage back trial will be over by time a member of gang have done part in preventing from appearing see not why must have further grudge against can not thank too much for kindness captain trust when get back will call at captain dowsett store in tower street so may see again thank know that captain will welcome heartily when tell how kindly have treated will be almost a glad a will to see suppose must not take message letter from now think not lad must never do for to be able to say at trial that have learnt have be kidnapped might write over here to dutch authority about there be one thing further from what heard when landed yesterday seems that there be likely to be war between holland england heard talk of in london cyril said rightly understand cause did inquire much about matter be something about colony taxing good rightly understand quarrel except that dutch think now blake be gone ship for most part laid up may be able to take revenge for licking have given must there be war a say speak french a well a english must think have best make way to dunkirk a young frenchman from there must find difficulty in crossing to england know dunkirk well captain having indeed lived there life must have difficulty in travelling through holland a french boy if there be war captain said will of course come here more may be that will see at dunkirk french brandy sell a well a dutch schiedam if can not get one may perhaps get other there be le danger in coming to dunkirk making across to harwich than there be in landing from calais nantes on south coast where revenue men be much more on alert than be at harwich be not afraid of getting boat captured said be own not much lad bring over regular cargo keg be stowed away under floor of cabin run at pin mill be place anchored night before got to ipswich have be overhauled good many time cargo always look right after searching for bit conclude be regular see bring over great quantity fifteen twenty keg be a much a can stow away be long way safer being content with small profit than trying to make big one cyril parted with regret from captain whose departure have be hastened by report war might be declared at moment in case eliza might have be detained for considerable time have therefore be working almost night day to get in cargo cyril have remained on board until last moment have seen diamond dealer once hoped that must not meet often for felt certain that awkward question must be asked man be in habit of having dealing with marner have doubtless understood from captain that be in way connected with gang be to find out truth must view with reverse of friendly eye have told that be to take meal with clerk cyril hoped therefore that must seldom see wandered about wharf until became dark then went in took supper with clerk a latter spoke dutch only there be possibility of conversation cyril be thinking of going up to bed when there be ring at bell clerk went to answer leaving door open a went out cyril heard voice ask in english if herr schweindorf be in clerk said something in dutch fool doe not understand english robert man said tell said in louder voice to clerk two person from england england understand who have only just arrived want to see on particular business there be blocking up door just go tell master what told pushed way into passage clerk seeing that there be nothing else to do went upstairs minute later came down again made sign for to follow a went up cyril stole out looked after fact that have come from england that one of be named robert that have business with man who be in connection with marner have excited suspicion felt shiver of fear run through a recognised figure of robert ashford man who be called black dick remembered expression of hatred with have regarded in court felt that danger must be great indeed did hear that be in rotterdam moment thought convinced that must almost certainly learn at once from host letter must naturally mention that captain have left lad in charge who be a believed connected with must denounce a enemy instead of friend diamond merchant must expel from house terrified at thought that possessed information a to dealing with band in england once beyond door must in strange town be at mercy of enemy cyril first impulse be to run back into room seize cap fly waited however until clerk came down again then put cap carelessly on head be going for walk said waving hand vaguely man nodded went with to door cyril heard put up bar after have gone out walked quietly away for there be fear of immediate pursuit black dick have probably brought over more jewel to dispose of that business must be transacted before there must be talk of other matter might be quarter of hour before heard that be inmate of house then when went downstairs with dealer must hear that have gone out for walk must await return so that have two three hour at least before there must be search be early yet of boat might be discharging by torchlight at rate might hear of ship starting in morning went down to wharf there be plenty of bustle here boat be landing fish larger craft be discharging taking in cargo inability to speak dutch prevented asking question crossed to other side of road house here be principally store drinking tavern in window of one be stuck up english french spoken here went inside walked up to bar called for glass of beer in english speak english landlord asked a mug be placed before latter nodded want to take passage to england to france said came out here few day ago hear that there be going to be trouble between two country will therefore be of use going on to amsterdam wish to get back again for be told that if delay may be too late can not speak dutch therefore can not inquire if boat will be sailing in morning for england dunkirk have acquaintance in dunkirk speak french so make difference to whether go there to england boy speaks french landlord said if like can go along port with of course will give something for trouble willingly cyril said be much obliged to into bargain landlord left bar returned in minute with boy twelve year old doe not speak french very well said dare say will be enough for purpose have told that want to take ship to england that if can not find one to dunkirk if will not do ostend might suit speak french there there be boat always going between there england must do though must prefer other there must be difficulty at other time in getting boat for england know whether will do so now have be clearing off for day doubt if will find english ship in port now though of course there may be who have be delayed for cargo cyril went out with boy after making many inquiry learnt that there be one english vessel still in port however cyril told guide that must prefer one for dunkirk if must find one for if war be declared before boat sailed might be detained after search found coasting scow must sail in morning will touch at two three place boy said to cyril after talk with captain if be not in hurry will take land at dunkirk for pound be if find food if find food will take for eight shilling will start at daybreak tell agree to price want trouble of getting food a will be going so early will come on board at once will get bundle will be back in hour went with boy to one of sailor shop near bought rough coat thick blanket have wrapped up into parcel then after paying boy went on board a expected found there be bed accommodation for passenger so stretched on locker in cabin covered with blanket put coat under head for pillow real reason for choosing craft in preference to english ship be that thought probable that when did not return to house must at once be suspected that have recognised visitor be not going to return at in case might suspect that must try to take passage to england must first thing in morning make search for on board english vessel might be in port must be easy then for to get ashore for diamond merchant might accuse of theft so get handed over to rather than run risk must have started on foot have not be able to find native craft sailing early in morning failing dunkirk ostend must have taken passage to other dutch port run chance of getting ship from there great point be to get away from rotterdam four men forming crew of scow returned late by loud talk cyril who kept eye closed judged that be in liquor in short time climbed up into berth be quiet at daybreak be called up by captain cyril lay quiet until by rippling of water against side knew that craft be under way waited few minute then went up on deck scow clumsy a looked be running along fast before brisk wind in hour rotterdam lay far behind voyage be pleasant one touched at dordrecht at steenbergen on mainland flushing staying few hour in place to take in discharge cargo after made out from island ran along coast putting into ostend nieuport four day after starting entered port of dunkirk cyril did not go ashore at of place at stopped be possible that war might have be declared with england a might be noticed that be foreigner must in case be questioned arrested a soon therefore a neared quay went down to cabin slept until got under way again food be rough wholesome consisted entirely of fish black bread sea air gave good appetite be in high spirit at thought that have escaped from danger be on way back again at dunkirk be under french flag hour after landing have engaged passage to london on brig be to sail on following day voyage be stormy one rejoiced in possession of great coat have only bought in order that might have packet to bring on board scow so avoid exciting suspicion question a to being entirely unprovided with luggage be three day before brig dropped anchor in pool a soon a did so cyril hailed waterman spent almost last remaining coin in being taken to shore be glad that be late in afternoon so dark that attire must not be noticed clothes have suffered considerably from capture confinement on board

captured cape coast castle though a gentleman said mightily strong place then sailed across to america a know captured dutch settlement of new netherlands changed name into of new york did not so much out of reprisal for misconduct of dutch in africa because land be ours by right having be discovered by cabot taken possession of in name of king henry vii title always maintained until dutch seized thirty year ago then dutch sent order to de ruyter who commanded fleet be in mediterranean to sail away privately to make reprisal on coast of guinea elsewhere first captured several of trading fort among that of cormantin taking great quantity of good belonging to company then sailed to barbadoes where be beaten off by fort then captured twenty of ship off newfoundland so returned to holland altogether doing damage a house of common told majesty to extent of eight hundred thousand pound time dutch have be secretly preparing for war declared in january have forced to do same although delayed month in hope that accommodation might be arrived at think father be that told though there be many detail that remember very well told lass truly wonder that giddy head must have taken in so much matter of course now tell over have heard thing before wrong that dutch did company by seizing post at cape coast reprisal sir robert holmes took upon with company ship made great mark on memory for be just taking over father work when first expedition took place at rate none can say that have gone into war unjustly seeing that dutch began altogether without cause by first attacking trading post seems to captain dave john wilkes said that have be mighty like war that english buccaneer waged against spaniard in west indie while two nation be at peace at home be curious cyril said that trouble begun in africa must have shifted to other side of atlantic ay lad just a first trouble be at last fought out in english channel off coast of france so be likely to be decided in well nigh same water gentleman other night be of opinion nellie said that matter must never have come to head have not be that de witt who be now chief man in holland belongs to french party there have be urged on by king louis for own interest to make war with may well be nellie in english war france have ever have part openly by intrigue france never seems to be content with attending to own business be ever meddling with neighbour if not fighting trying to set by ear against other if be bit younger have not lost left flipper must myself volunteer for service a for master cyril here know be burning to lay aside pen take to sword be so captain dave a know only took up pen to keep until be old enough to use sword have be two year at now suppose will be a much longer before can think of entering service of one of protestant prince a soon a be fit to do so will get introduction be off must tenfold rather fight for own country must gladly sail in fleet though went a ship boy be right spirit master cyril john wilkes exclaimed must go if captain must spare must take such battered old hulk must spare john captain dave said have be mighty near making mess of even with a chief mate might a well shut up shop altogether if be to leave must miss too cyril went on stretching arm across table to shake hand with lad have proved real friend true be there chance of going a officer must not balk even if must do so be natural that lad of spirit must speak think a do besides war may not last for long when come back ship be paid off must soon wipe off arrears of work get book into ship shape order work work that room of yours will always stand ready for while live there will always be plate for on table thank captain dave always overrate service forget that be consequence of kindness that have shown to have intention of going be passing thought have one friend who must procure berth a volunteer a be to must look for introduction to foreign prince must not go to twice for favour especially a have sort of claim on kindness to go a cabin boy must be to go with men under own condition although shirk hard work rough usage must not care for in such fashion moreover be doing work even without hospitality must suffice to keep comfortably if went away though for month might find that for whom work have engaged other assistance spending naught be laying by money for time when will have to travel at own expense to provide necessary maybe to keep for while until can procure employment have prospect by end of two year will have gathered sufficient store for need must be wrong to throw out of employment merely to embark on adventure so to make break perhaps long one in plan worry on score captain dave said warmly then checked will be time to talk about when time come be right lad like man who steadfastly hold on way have chosen will not turn to right left there be not much that man can not achieve if keep aim steadily in view why cyril if said have made up mind to be lord mayor of london must wager that must day be elected cyril laughed will never set eye in direction do think thing have set to do will ever be in power be to buy back father estate so long a live

pettigrew be laid next to ' wish to heaven captain ' said have got pistol hand free must blow out brain for be fault hanging at yard arm be what deserve never thought there be slightest risk not shadow of feeling bit dozy sat down for five minute caulk seeing that doubt men thought might do same be have come of must have slept hour at least for there be sail in sight when went off moor must have come round point made out after ' corsair be lying alongside of shroud lashed to ours there be long jabbering among moor when have taken off hatch seen that be pretty well full up with cargo then after bit be kicked made sign for to get on foot to cross over into ship crew be sent down into forward hold men went down with to tie up securely john wilkes pettigrew be shoved down into bit of place below stern cabin leg be tied a well a arm trap be shut there be in dark of course told pettigrew that though have failed in duty have turned out badly be to be blamed a if have gone to sleep in sight of enemy have never given moor thought ' said 'and be not to be expected that must sailor still le officer ought to sleep on watch even if ship be anchored in friendly harbour be to blame that gave way to drowsiness still even if have might have come to same thing in long run for corsair be large one might have taken even if have made out a rounded point in spite of must say to cheer took to heart badly be groaning muttering to when left in dark so said to 'look here lad best way to retrieve fault have committed be to try get out of scrape set brain to work let talk over what have best be done there be time to be lost for with fair wind can run from here to tunis in four twenty hour once there one may give up hope there be crew on board ship moor carried twice a many men a do may reckon will have put more than half of on board barque understand sail a well a do own will therefore want strong prize crew on board be ready to do anything captain ' young fellow said firmly 'if be to give word must get into magazine if must blow ship into air 'well know will give that order pettigrew to be heathen slave be bad at rate must rather try life for bit than strike colour at once now let think over in first place have to get rid of rope then have to work way forward to crew then to get on deck fight for be stiff job look at way one will at rate will be better to be doing something even if find at last that ca get out of dog kennel than to lie here doing nothing ' after talk agreed that be not likely moor must come down to for long time for might reckon that must hold on without food water easy enough until got to tunis having agreed a to point set to work to get rope loose wriggling must do though tried until cord cut into flesh at last pettigrew said 'what fool be have got knife hanging from lanyard round neck be under blouse so did not notice when turned pocket out ' be long job to get at knife at last found string behind neck getting hold of with teeth pulled till knife came up to throat then john got in teeth first part of job be done next be easy enough john held handle of knife in teeth pettigrew got hold of blade in between made shift to open then after good deal of trouble pettigrew shifted till managed to get knife in hand lay across worked backwards forward till blade cut through rope at wrist then in two more minute be free then felt about found that boarding between main hold be old shaky with aid of knife of three shoulder made shift at last to wrench one of board from place pettigrew who be slightest crawled through soon got plank down hold be half full of cargo doubt have taken out of ship other made way forward till got to bulkhead like one have got through be make shift sort of affair with room to put finger between plank so hailed men told how have got free that if did want to work life a slave have best do same be ready enough may be sure finding passage between plank wider in one place than rest passed knife through to told how to set about cutting rope be deal quicker over than have be for in place there have be no height where must stand upright be able to do so two men standing back to back one holding knife made quick work of cutting rope have plenty of strength now be not long in getting down couple of plank first thing be to make regular overhaul of cargo a well a must do without shifting thing making noise to look for weapon for anything must come in handy for fight not thing must find came upon lot of keg that knew by feel be powder if there have be arm must have got up must have done at once trusting to seize ship before other must come up to help without arm must be madness to try in broad daylight agreed to wait till night to lie down again where be before putting rope round leg again hand behind back so that if did look in everything must seem secure 'we will have plenty of time ' one of sailor said 'for have coiled big hawser down on hatch when got back to lazaret tried hatch by have be shoved down three of must move more than if have be solid stone have goodish talk over be clear that hatchway of main hold be only chance of getting out might find that tough job 'if ca do in other way pettigrew said must say have best bring enough bale thing to fill place up to within foot of top then on might put keg of powder bore hole in make slow match must blow cabin overhead into splinter while bale underneath must prevent force of explosion blowing bottom out ' agreed that if worst came to worst must try having settled went back to have look at main hatch feeling about round found point of staple on hatchway bar worked above be not fastened with nut a must have be with be simply turned over clinched have mean of straightening out must cut through woodwork round setting to work at took by turn till must see light through wood then left to finish after dark time knew be under sail by rippling of water along side men on board be evidently in high delight at easy capture kicked up so much noise that there be fear of hearing slight stir made below very carefully brought package bale under hatchway till built up sort of platform about four foot below reckoned standing a thick a must there lifting together must make sure of hoisting hatchway up must then spring out in moment pettigrew still stuck to plan talked into carrying out under fore aft hatch pointing out that two explosion must scare crew out of wit that must be killed many jump overboard in fright came to see that scheme be really good one so set crew to carry out business working with stockinged foot built up platform under hatch a well a in den aft then made hole in two of keg of powder shaking little out damped rubbed into two strip of cotton putting end of slow match into of hole laid keg in place waited made two other fuse so that man must go forward aft to fire together two of men be told off for job rest of gathered under main hatch for have settled now that if heard making move to open hatch must fire powder at once hour be in order to be ready cut deeper into woodwork round staple till there be thickness of card remaining must tell by how light be above take long to tell have taken good many hour so baked be by heat down below parched by thirst that be a much a must do to persuade men to wait until at last saw light in cut fade darken again men wanted to be at work pointed out that if waited till crew have laid down on deck might carry through without losing life if be awake of must be sure to come at with weapon unarmed a be might do much harm still though succeeded in keeping men quiet felt be hard work to put stopper on own impatience at last even john here spoke up for action ' expect who mean to sleep be off by time ' said 'as to reckoning upon going off there ai hope of will sit jabber night have made good haul have taken stout ship with full hold five twenty stout slave without losing man there wo be sleep for most of reckon be two bell now do think captain might a well begin for human nature ca stand heat thirst much longer ' 'all right john ' said lad remember that when first explosion come for ca reckon on two slow match burning just same time heave together till find hatch lift then when second come chuck over leap out if see weapon catch up waste time looking about go at with fist will be scared pretty well out of sens will not be long

struck flint against steel lid of tinder box right yer honour ' said ' have got spark then two hand have given slow match to lit at tinder box went fore aft while a many of rest of a must crowded under hatch ready fore aft ' asked two men hailed in reply 'light match then come here ' suppose be not above minute seemed ten before there be tremendous explosion aft ship shook from stem to stern there be moment silence then came yell scream mixed with sound of timber wreckage falling on deck lift ' said 'but not too high that be enough be free wait for other there be rush of foot overhead a moor ran forward then came other explosion 'off with lad shouted in moment flung hatch off leapt out with cheer there be fighting to speak of officer have be killed by first explosion under cabin many of men have be blown overboard lay crushed under timber wreckage second explosion have be even more destructive for happened just a crew in terror have rushed forward many of unhurt have sprung overboard at once a rushed up most of others did same there be difficulty about arm for deck be strewn with weapon few of however stopped to pick one up half mad with rage thirst rushed forward at moor finished before got to last have sprung overboard there be rush on part of men to scuttle butt 'take one drink lad shouted 'and then to bucket took quarter of hour hard work to put out flame be lucky powder have blown so much of deck up that be enabled to get at fire without difficulty so extinguish before got great hold a soon a have got out called muster there be only one missing be pettigrew being first to leap out rush aft there have be one shot fired by moor one fellow a leapt on to rail drew pistol from belt fired before sprang overboard in excitement confusion one have noticed whether shot took effect for two three men have stumbled fallen over fragment of timber body a rushed aft now searched soon came on poor young fellow ball have struck fair on forehead have fallen dead without word cry there be however time to grieve have got to re capture barque have be cable length away when rushed on deck while have be fighting fire have sailed on regardless of shriek shout of wretch who have sprung overboard from be still near vessel have be running before wind for have sent john wilkes to tiller moment that got possession of corsair barque be about quarter of mile ahead wind be light be running along at four knot hour moor on board kate have luckily be too scared by explosion to think of getting one of gun aft peppering while be engaged in putting out fire indeed must not have done much harm if have for high fo'castle hid from view a soon a have found pettigrew body laid on hatch have thrown off went aft to john 'be gaining on john ' have drawn away little craft be not doing best expect wanted to keep close to barque so kept sheet in if square sail captain will soon be upon be quickly done then first thing be to see that men be armed must have got gun forward did not want to damage kate must soon see that be closing on shoved bag of musket ball into cannon so a to sweep deck a came alongside for knew that crew be good deal stronger than be still one have doubt a to result be soon evident that moor have got scare from fate of comrade that have stomach for fighting 'they be lowering boat john shouted better said 'they must fight like rat caught in trap if came up to though be men enough to capture might lose number a soon a boat reached water be pulled up to starboard side then helm be put down barque came round till be broadside on to 'down with helm john wilkes shouted 'hard down man ' john hesitated for have thought that must have gone round to other side of so have caught boat in truth be so pleased at thought of getting craft back again that be willing to let poor villain go since be of mind to do so without giving trouble have punished enough shriek cry of left behind to drown be ringing in ear then so brought corsair up quietly by side of kate lashed there then with shout of triumph sprang on board old barky not moor be left on board boat be four five hundred yard away rowing at top of speed men must have

advantage to for war may last for short time a soon a be over ship will be laid up again crew disbanded ay if find life of sailor to liking cyril might do worse than go into merchant service must help there might soon get command of trader let tell be deal better to walk deck a captain than be to be serving on shore with twenty master over there be money to be made too captain be always allowed to take in certain amount of cargo on own account be way scraped together money enough to buy own ship at last to be master a well a owner there be reason why must not do same thank captain dave will think over when find out whether like sea life at present seems to that inclination turn rather towards plan that father recommended that for last two year have always have before said other day have fought dutch john ay ay master cyril in truth be from wish desire on part did so have come ashore from captain dave ship here in pool have be with of messmate who have friend in wapping have got three day leave ashore a cargo expected have not come on board ship have kept up bit be latish when be making way down to stair expect be more intent on making straight course down street than in looking about for pirate when suddenly found among lot of men one of seized by arm 'hands off mate ' say lifted fist to let fly at when got knock at back of head next thing knew be be lying in hold of ship a made out presently with score of others of whom be groaning cursing mate say 'what port be be brought up in ' 'we be on board tartar ' one said knew what meant for tartar be receiving hulk where took pressed men next morning without question asked be brought up on deck tumbled into small sloop taken down to gravesend there put in batch of four five into ship of war lying there chanced that be put on board monk flagship resolution be how be came to fight dutch what year be that in john ' in may be van tromp at time with ninety eight ship of war six fire ship be in down felt so much master of sea that sailed in battered dover castle then be in fight of nd of june ay in of st of july be harder still tell about john lor ' bless sir there be nothing to tell a far a be concerned be at one of gun on upper deck might a well have be down below for anything saw of be just load fire load fire sometimes through cloud of smoke one caught sight of dutchman one be firing at more often one did there be time for looking about can tell if there have be time there be nothing to see be like being in big thunderstorm with thunderbolt falling round smashing grinding ripping must have made hair stand on end if have only have time to think of have time be 'now then hearties blaze away keep up lad dutchman have pretty near have enough of ' then at last 'they be running lad run in gun tend sail then cheer a loud a must give be much can tell for be spent with labour half choked with powder tongue parched up with thirst how many ship have have five war ship five fire ship so game be equal one have tromp de ruyter to command have monk deane admiral be on board ship in very first broadside dutch fired chain shot pretty well cut admiral deane in two be close to at time monk who be standing by side undid own cloak in moment threw over comrade held up hand to few of have seen what have happened to take notice of be good thing deane monk be on board same ship if have not be so deane flag must have be hauled down fleet must have known of death at commencement of fight must have greatly discouraged men told though know naught about that rear admiral lawson charged with blue squadron right through dutch line so threw into confusion however about three o'clock fight having begun at eleven van tromp began to draw off got more sail on resolution followed for hour making sort of running fight of till one of big ship blew up about nine in evening when laid in for shore blake came up in night with eighteen ship dutch tried to draw off at eight o'clock came up to after fighting for four hour hauled off ran in great confusion for flat where must not follow so escaped to zeeland heard that have six of best ship sunk two blown up eleven taken whether be so not knew not for in truth saw nothing whatever of matter sailed to texel there blocked in de ruyter squadron of twenty five large ship thought that there must be no more fighting for dutch have sent to england to ask for term of peace however be wrong to give dutchman due showed resolution greater than gave credit for for be astonished indeed to hear towards end of july that van tromp have sailed out again with upwards of ninety ship on th came in view sailed out to engage must not come to close quarter be seven at night before resolution with thirty other ship came up to charged through line by time have done that be quite dark missed altogether sailed south thinking van tromp have gone that way instead have sailed north in morning found have picked up de ruyter fleet be ready to fight have other thing to think of besides fighting day for wind blew so hard that be a much a must do to keep off shore if gale have continued good part of ship must have left bone there however by gale abated somewhat by next morning sea have gone down sufficient for main deck port to be opened so dutch having weather gauge sailed down to engage thought rough work in fight two month before be a nothing to to begin with dutch fire ship came down before wind be a much a must do to avoid did indeed set triumph on fire most of crew jumped overboard remained managed to put out flame lawson with blue squadron began fighting so briskly that de ruyter flagship be completely disabled towed out of fight however after have seen that turn began have more time to look about only know that ship after ship came up to engage seeming bent upon lowering monk flag three dutch admiral tromp evertson de ruyter a heard afterwards came up in turn did not know who be knew be admiral by flag pounded with heart so good be aim that saw two of admiral flag brought down say that three of be lowered may guess pounding be not on side suffered very heavily four men be hurt at gun worked nigh crew be killed wounded two of mast be shot away many of gun disabled towards end of fight be towed out of line how day must have gone if van tromp have continued in command of dutch can not say about noon be shot through body by musket ball misfortune greatly discouraged dutchman who fight well a long a thing seem to be going way lose heart very easily when think matter be going against by about two o'clock officer shouted to that dutch be beginning to draw off be not long before began to fly for in sort of order of light frigate that have suffered le than line of battle ship followed until one dutch admiral whose flag be left flying turned fought till two three of heavier ship came up be sunk must see little of chase having plenty of work for have gale come on ship good many others must assuredly have be driven ashore in plight be in anyhow at night ship got into texel vessel have be following anchored five six league out being afraid of sand altogether have burnt sunk twenty six of ship of war while lost only two frigate of be burnt by fire ship a be certain that must not come out for time again many of ship being unfit for further contention until repaired returned to england got discharge joined captain dave again fortnight later when ship came up river monk be good fighter master cyril must have command of fleet instead of a say duke of york although be called general not admiral be a good sea dog a of can think a well a fight among ship that day be several merchantman have be taken up for service at last moment have gun slapped on board with gunner to work of have still cargo in hold monk thinking that be likely captain must think more of saving ship good than of fighting dutch changed captain round so that man commanded own vessel consequence be that a admitted merchantman be a willing to fight a bore right stoutly think master cyril if go with fleet that be going to see much of what go on will be worse for than be for for there be labouring toiling like dumb beast with mind intent upon working gun paying heed to roar confusion around scarce even noticing when one beside be struck down will be up on poop having naught to do to stand with hand on sword hilt waiting to board enemy to drive back one who try to board will find that will be well nigh dazed stupid with din uproar doe not sound very pleasant outlook john cyril laughed however if ever do get into engagement will think of what have said will try prevent from getting dazed stupid though in truth can well imagine that be enough to shake anyone nerve to stand inactive in so terrible scene will have to take great care of cyril nellie said gravely captain dave john wilkes burst into laugh how be to take care of nellie father said do suppose that man on deck must be safer be to stoop down with head below rail to screw up on leeward side of mast lass man have to take share of danger most cowardly run just a great risk a man who fearlessly expose chapter xi prince rupert next day cyril went down to breakfast in what have often called laughingly court suit suit have have made for short time before father death to replace one have when came over that being altogether outgrown have done so to please sir aubrey who have repeatedly expressed anxiety that cyril must always be prepared to take advantage of good fortune might befall be first time have put on well truly look pretty fellow cyril captain said a entered think so nellie girl nodded know that like better than in black suit father look very well hullo lass be change of opinion truly for care not one jot for fashion of man clothes have thought that always inclined to gay attire cyril now must seem rather to belong to court than to city if have be other morning father might have thought more of cyril appearance what be telling now of continuance of plague be so sad that mourning rather than court attire must seem to be proper wear be plague spreading fast then captain dave be not decreasing a have hoped must do from beginning of december death rose steadily until end of january while usual death rate be under three hundred went to four hundred seventy four then weather setting in very severe checked till end of february hoped that danger be over that must be rid of distemper before warm weather set in for last fortnight there have be rise rather than fall not large one sufficient to cause great alarm that will continue until warm weather set in may then grow into terrible proportion so far there have be case in city be only in west that have hold death being altogether in parish of st giles st andrew st bride st james clerkenwell of course there have be case now then for many year past nine year ago spread to greater extent than now be at beginning of winter instead of nearing summer there must be occasion to think much of matter with hot weather approaching tale hear of badness of plague in foreign part one can not feel anxious say too that there have be prophecy of grievous evil in london nellie put in need not trouble about father replied anabaptist prophesied sort of evil in elizabeth time naught came of there be always men woman with disordered mind who think that be prophet have power to see further into future than other people one mind think aught of wild word save at time like present when there be danger of war pestilence remember bill vokes john mind yer poor half crazed fellow be yet good seaman who must do duty blow high blow low sailed six voyage with captain never one of without telling crew that ship must never return to port have have dream about black cat have mewed when left home saw three magpie in tree hard by when stepped from door many other portent of kind first time well nigh scared of crew after first voyage from came back safely of course did laugh at a in other respect be good sailor willing fellow did not like to discharge for once men found out that prophecy came to naught did harm indeed afforded much amusement just a be on board ship so be elsewhere if vessel have gone down first voyage man who escaped drowning must have said that bill vokes have not be without reason in warning that be nothing le than flying in face of providence to put to sea when loss of ship have be so surely foretold so on shore fool madman who have dream vision be not heeded when time be good men sens sound whereas in troubled time men take raving to heart if scatterbrain have good whipping at pillory must be well for for silly people who pay attention to raving few minute later cyril took boat to whitehall step after delay be shown up to prince rupert room none worse for exertion yester even young gentleman hope prince said shaking hand with warmly none sir exertion be not great be inconvenience of smoke troubled in way have be to inquire after young lady who owe life to sir know name condition have wished must have made inquiry for know not whither be taken sent round early morning prince said heard that be a well a might be expected after adventure went through now tell about what have be doing be one of saddest thing to since returned to england so many good men who fought by side have be made beggar in king service must do naught for 't be grievous business yet see not how be to be mended hardest thing be that who did most for king service be who have suffered most deeply none of who be driven to sell estate at fraction of value in order to raise money for king treasury to put men into field have received redress must need vast sum to buy back land parliament must not vote money for purpose must be fair to turn men out of estate that bought paid for do not think so asked suddenly seeing by lad face that be not in agreement with sir doe not seem to that must be unfair men bought land for a say fraction of value did so in belief parliament must triumph purchase be speculation grounded on belief have have enjoyment of estate for year have drawn from income have by time brought in sum much exceeding that have adventured doe not seem to that there must be hardship be now called upon to restore to owner be a when man risk money in venture at sea if go a hope will make great profit on money if ship be cast away taken by pirate be unfortunate have reason to curse ill luck if ship have already made several voyage have more than recouped money ventured well stoutly argued prince said approvingly must remember young sir that king on return be by mean strongly seated on throne there be army most evilly affected towards there be puritan who lamented upset of work father have done men who have purchased estate of royalist have family friend have estate be restored to rightful owner there might have be outbreak must have shaken throne again many must have refused to give up possession save to force where be force to come from even have king have troop willing to carry out such measure might have be met by force have blood once be shed none can say how trouble might have spread what might have be end of now lad come to own fortune cyril briefly related story of life since return to london stating father plan that must day take foreign service have shown that have stout heart young sir a well a brave one have done well indeed in turning mind to earn living by such talent a have rather than in wasting time in vain hope in ceaseless importunity for justice may be that have acted wisely in thinking of taking service on continent seeing that have army when time come will further wish to utmost of power in meantime there be opportunity for service at home will gladly appoint a volunteer in own ship there be many gentleman going with in capacity must be of advantage to if when write to foreign prince on behalf can say that have fought under eye thank greatly prince have be wishing above thing must join fleet must be indeed honour to begin career under prince of whom heard so often from father prince rupert looked at watch king will be in mall now said will take across present to be useful to have entree at court though perhaps le avail of better so saying rose put on hat throwing cloak over shoulder went across to mall asking question of cyril a went extracting from sketch of adventure of being kidnapped taken to holland presently arrived at spot where king with three four noble gentleman have be playing charles be in good humour for have just won match with earl of rochester well grave cousin said merrily what brings out of office so early fresh demand for money hope not at present indeed be not to must come on quest to duke of york must come

fire in savoy where lordship mansion be among be destroyed beg to present to majesty sir cyril shenstone son of late sir aubrey shenstone most gallant gentleman who rode under banner in many stern fight in service of royal father knew well king said graciously have not heard of death be glad to hear that son inherits bravery have often regretted deeply that be out of power to requite in way service sir aubrey rendered sacrifice made for house brow clouded little looked appealingly at prince rupert sir cyril shenstone have more intention of asking for favour than have charles latter said be going to accompany a volunteer against dutch if war last will ask for better appointment for that will have king said warmly none have better claim to commission in navy army than son of gentleman who fought suffered in cause of royal father lord said to little group of gentleman who have be standing few pace away while conversation have be going on must have know sir cyril shenstone son of faithful adherent of father who yesterday evening saved life of three daughter of lord of wisbech in fire at savoy be going a volunteer with cousin rupert when sail against dutch gentleman returned cyril salute courteously will be fortunate in beginning career under eye of so brave prince earl of rochester said bowing to prince rupert must be well if all latter replied bluntly be to ship in fleet for few month instead of wasting time in empty pleasure earl smiled prince rupert extreme disapproval of life at court be well known can not be bayard prince most of must methinks be too sick at sea to be of much assistance be to go if dutchman come here be not likely for doubt not prince that will soon send flying back to own port will be glad to do best to meet when land prince made reply turning to king said will not detain longer from game cousin charles have plenty to do with complaint a to state of ship lack of store necessary remember will be glad to see at levee sir cyril king said holding out hand wait for prince to bring for if do will wait long cyril doffed hat raised king hand to lip then with deep bow expression of thanks followed prince rupert who be already striding away might have be better introduced prince said when overtook still be better to be badly introduced than to have introduction at be too old for flippancy of court have better show there sometimes will make friend may be useful by way have not address may be fortnight more before henrietta be ready to take crew on board took out tablet wrote down address come see if there be anything want to ask let clerk keep out with pretence be busy send up name to tell have ordered will be taken up however may be engaged having occasion for haste cyril walked back to city after leaving prince rupert great change have taken place in fortune in last twenty four hour then have prospect save continuing work in city for two year even after time foresaw grave difficulty in way of obtaining commission in foreign army for sir john parton even if ready to carry out promise have formerly made might not have sufficient influence to do so now be to embark in prince rupert own ship must be companion of many other gentleman going out a volunteer at bound spring from position of writer in city to occupied by father before became involved in trouble between king parliament be already admitted to court prince rupert have promised to push fortune abroad yet felt le elated than must have expected from sudden change question of money be cloud dulled brightness of prospect a volunteer must receive pay yet must make fair show among young nobleman gentleman who must be companion doubtless must be victualled on board must have to dress well probably pay share in expense must be incurred for wine other thing on board have not be for future must have be inclined to regret that have not refused tempting offer advantage to be gained by prince rupert patronage be so large that felt sacrifice must be too great to end even of accepting assistance captain dave have more than once hinted must give be just dinner hour when arrived home well cyril see by face that prince have said nothing in direction of wish captain dave said a entered then face be false witness captain dave for prince rupert have appointed volunteer on board own ship be glad indeed lad heartily glad though going will be heavy loss to why be looking so grave over have be wondering whether have acted wisely in accepting cyril said be very happy here be earning living have care of sort feel that be very serious matter to make change prince have number of nobleman gentleman going with a volunteer feel that will be out of element in such company at same time have reason to be thankful for prince rupert have promised that will after war be over give introduction will procure commission abroad well then seems to that thing must not look better captain dave said heartily when do go on board prince say may be fortnight so that will have time to make preparation warn citizen work for be going to leave must say sooner better lad will have to get outfit other matter seen to moreover now that have be taken under prince rupert protection have become a be officer on ship for gentleman volunteer although have duty in regard to working ship be yet officer be hardly seemly that must be making up account of baker butcher ironmonger ship storekeeper work be honest be in way ashamed of cyril said a have many thing to see about suppose have better give notice at once prince rupert presented to king to day majesty requested to attend at court must be loath to do be not that prince urged upon that be of advantage must make known one must think master cyril that honour have suddenly befallen be regarded by a misfortune mr dowsett said laughing most youth must be overjoyed at such change in fortune must be very pleasant cyril said have income of father estate at back feel that will be in false position thus thrusting among men who have more guinea in pocket than have penny however seems that matter have be taken out of own hand that a thing have turned out so must travel who must have thought when john wilkes fetched out last night to go to fire must make alteration in whole life that little thing a climbing up ladder helping to get three girl out of room full of smoke john wilkes did most difficult part of work be to change prospect there be providence in cyril mr dowsett said gently why else must have gone up that ladder when to seeming there be one there maid be so frightened john say that must never have said word about there being anyone in room girl must have perished have not gone up now a owing to everything have turned out according to wish must be sin not to take advantage of for may be sure that a way have thus be suddenly opened to so will all other thing follow in due course thank madam cyril said simply have not thought of in light assuredly be right will not suffer to be daunted by difficulty there may be in way john wilkes now came in sat down to meal be vastly pleased when heard of good fortune have befallen cyril seems to cyril said that be impostor at least share in good luck ought to have fallen to john seeing that carried down ladder have carried heavier bale many time much longer distance than though say that woman be not tidy weight for indeed be must have carried down ten of for honour have in being shaken by hand by prince rupert a gallant sailor a ever sailed ship what did be in day work more than lifting anchor chain about in storehouse a for honour want none of be moored in snug port here must not leave captain dave if must make duke of nellie have said word of congratulation to cyril a rose from dinner said in low tone know be pleased hope that will have good fortune deserve cyril set out at once to make round of shop where worked announcement that must at once terminate connection with a be going on board fleet be everywhere received with great regret must gladly pay double one said rather than that must go for indeed have taken heavy load off shoulder know not how will get on in future must think there must be difficulty in getting other young clerk to do work cyril said not so easy man replied have tried one two before found be more trouble than be worth there be not many who write a neatly a do do a much in hour a must take day over however wish good luck if must come back take up work again start a scrivener in city can promise that will have book again that among friend can find a much work a can get through something similar be said to at of house where called felt much gratified at finding that work have given such satisfaction when came in to supper cyril be conscious that something have occurred of unusual nature nellie eye be swollen with cry mr dowsett have also evidently be in tear while captain dave be walking up down room restlessly servant be placing thing upon table just a be about to take seat bell of front door rang loudly see who be john captain dave said whoever be seems to be in mighty hurry in minute two john returned followed by gentleman latter paused at door then said bowing courteously a advanced to mr dowsett must ask pardon for intruding on meal madam business be urgent be earl of wisbech have called to see sir cyril shenstone to offer heartfelt thanks for service have rendered by saving life of daughter have risen to foot a entered there be slight exclamation of surprise from captain wife daughter a earl said sir cyril shenstone cyril stepped forward be cyril shenstone lord said have good fortune to be able with assistance of friend here john wilkes to rescue daughter though at time indeed be altogether ignorant of rank be fortunate occurrence must disclaim merit in action for be by mere accident mounting to window by ladder saw lying insensible on ground modesty doe credit sir earl said shaking warmly by hand such be not opinion of prince rupert who described to a very gallant action moreover said that be who first brought news that there be female in house others have supposed to be empty that be solely owing to that ladder be taken round will allow lord to introduce to captain dowsett wife daughter who have be to kindest of friend kindness lord captain dave said earnestly have be repaid thousandfold by good youth of whose rank be indeed ignorant until named may ask to honour by joining in meal will right gladly sir earl said for in truth have scarce broke fast to day be down at place in kent when be awoke morning by one of groom who have ridden down with news that mansion in savoy have be burned that daughter have have most narrow escape of life of course mounted at once rode to town where be happy in finding that have well nigh recovered from effect of fright smoke nurse who be with must give account of what have happened save that have a supposed become insensible from smoke when recovered found in earl of surrey house to seems have be carried after inquiry learned that duke of albemarle prince rupert have be on scene directing operation went to latter with whom have honour of being well acquainted told whole story saying have not be for sir cyril shenstone daughter must certainly have perished gave credit too to sir cyril companion who said carried down ladder entered burning room last time to aid in bringing out nurse who be too heavy for rescuer of daughter to lift save cup of wine piece of bread took on first arrival have not broken fast to day then seated on chair cyril have placed for between mr dowsett nellie captain dave whispered to john wilkes who went out returned in two three minute with three four flask of rare spanish wine captain have brought back on last voyage kept for drinking on special occasion dame always kept excellent table although made many apology to earl assured that none be needed for must have supped better in own house hear said presently to cyril that be going out a volunteer in prince rupert ship son be also going with hope in day two to introduce to be at present at cambridge having set mind on sailing with prince have be fain to allow to give up study heard from prince rupert that have recently be kidnapped taken to holland gave particular did ask being desirous of hurrying off at once to express gratitude to how be that adventure befell for must hardly seem likely that must have provoked enmity of person capable of such outrage be result of service to lord captain dave said having be sea captain be poor hand at account having fallen into business at death of father seemed simple enough for to get on without much book learning made bad shape at when master shenstone a then called offered to keep book for seemed to excellent mode of saving worry trouble however when set to making up account of stock found that be nigh eight hundred pound short setting to watch discovered that apprentice be in alliance with band of thief be nightly robbing caught two of thief in act one of latter be receiver on premise proceeds of great number of robbery be found there be doubt that be chief of notorious gang called 'black gang have for long time infested city surrounding country be to prevent sir cyril from giving evidence at trial that be kidnapped sent away be placed in house of diamond merchant to whom thief be in habit of consigning jewel might well have turned out fatal to for to same house came elder apprentice one of men captured with notorious ruffian who have be rescued from constable by gang of fellow in open daylight in city doubtless must have compassed death have not happily seen enter house made escape taking passage in coaster bound for dunkirk from place took ship to england thus see lord that be indebted to for saving from further loss might well have ruined paused glanced at nellie who rose at once saying to earl trust that lordship will excuse mother father have more to tell at least must wish to do so then taking mother hand curtsied deeply left room together such lord a have told be service so far a knew till afternoon sir cyril shenstone have rendered that be small thing be very little to what know now that be indebted to after went out be speaking with wife on money matter desiring much to be of assistance to in matter of expedition on be going suddenly daughter burst into tear left room naturally bade wife follow learn what ailed then with many sob tear told mother that little knew how much be indebted to said have be wicked girl having permitted to be accosted several time by well dressed gallant who told that be earl of harwich who have professed great love for urged to marry privately be about to speak to one day when be out under master cyril escort latter interfered there be well nigh fracas between being afraid that of looker on might know bring matter to ear mentioned so much to in consequence did not allow to go out afterwards save in company of mother nevertheless man continued to meet a be unknown to mother passed note into hand to similarly replied at last consented to fly with did so at night be about to enter sedan chair in lane near house when be interrupted by arrival of master shenstone friend john wilkes former seems have suspicion setting to watch have discovered that be corresponding with man whom have found be not personage pretended to be disreputable hanger on of court one john harvey have then kept up incessant watch with aid of john wilkes outside house at night until saw come out join fellow with two associate when followed to chair have in readiness for there be say terrible scene sword be drawn john wilkes knocked down one of men master shenstone ran john harvey through shoulder appalled now at seeing how have be deceived how narrowly have escaped destruction returned with rescuer to house word be ever said on subject until spoke afternoon have noticed that great change have come over that seemed to have lost taste for show finery little did dream of cause said that must not have kept secret much longer in case being utterly miserable at thought of how have degraded deceived be sad story to have to hear lord have fully forgiven having indeed cause to thank god for preservation for good that seems to have wrought in have be spoilt child being well favoured head have be turned by flattery indulged in sort of foolish dream now be truly penitent for folly have not arrived lord must when have finished supper have told master shenstone knew of vast service have rendered service to other be a nothing that touched pocket only only child happiness have told story lord by consent in order that might know what sort of young fellow gentleman who have rescued daughter be john thank for share in matter with tear in eye held out hand to faithful companion thank deeply captain dowsett for having told story earl said gravely be painful one to tell feel sure that circumstance will a say be of lasting benefit to daughter show that heart be true loyal one must not have have so painful story told to stranger simply that true character of preserver must be known need not say that have have effect desired of raising sir cyril shenstone highly in esteem prince rupert spoke of very highly told how have be honourably supporting father until death of latter now see that posse unusual discretion acuteness a well a bravery now will take leave thanking for good entertainment that have given be staying at house of earl of surrey sir cyril hope that will call to morrow morning in order that daughter may thank in person captain dave cyril escorted earl to door then returned to chamber above chapter xii new friend on arriving at room upstairs captain dave placed hand on cyril shoulder said how can thank lad for what have done for by saying nothing further about captain dave have hoped that matter must never have come to ear yet rejoice for own sake mistress nellie have told thought that must do so day for too have seen how much have be changed since then though becomes not to speak of one older than think that experience have be for good above be rejoiced to find that have fully forgiven for indeed be sure that have be grievously punished well well lad will be a say for indeed be poor hand at talking believe feel a grateful a if must express rightly that earl of wisbech can not feel one whit more thankful to for having saved life of three child than do for having saved nellie from consequence of own folly there be one thing must let do be small thing at present have other way of showing what feel must let take upon a if have be son expense of outfit of yours be talking of matter a may have guessed by what said to earl when nellie burst into tear if contemplated when knew only have saved from ruin how much more do feel now that have done greater thing trust that will not refuse wife small opportunity of showing gratitude what say john wilkes say captain dave that be well spoken be sure master cyril will not refuse offer will not captain dave providing that let be a loan may perhaps day be enabled to repay feel that must be churlish to refuse so kind offer will relieve of one difficulty troubled when prospect in other respect seemed so fair that be right lad have taken load off mind have not acted quite fairly by in one respect master cyril how be that cyril asked in surprise in not telling that be sir cyril shenstone in letting put up in attic letting go about a nellie escort a if have be apprentice cyril laughed said that father be sir aubrey shenstone though own did not say so until have be here time fact that be baronet not knight made little difference be friendless lad whom took in gave shelter to captain dave mattered not whether be plain cyril sir cyril have certainly no thought of taking title again until entered foreign army indeed must have be disservice to here in london must have cut poor figure asking for work calling sir cyril shenstone must have have to enter into sort of explanation before anyone must have believed think that even with must have be so comfortable a have be well at rate harm have be done captain dave said think might have told if have captain dave must assuredly have told wife mistress nellie be much more pleasant for that thing must be a be well perhaps be right lad own might not have let work at book worry over robbery have known that be of station above that must never have known cyril said warmly have be poor ever since can remember owed education to kindness of friend of mother in way have station be equal to of london trader like a to title be matter of birth went ill with empty purse shabby doublet in future may be useful until now have be naught indeed worse than naught to next morning when cyril went into parlour found that nellie be busy assisting maid to lay table when latter have left room girl went up to cyril took hand have never thanked yet said must not bring to speak of now have told can do so ever since dreadful night have prayed for morning evening thanked god for sending to rescue what wicked girl must have thought with reason must not think of worse than thought of now that father mother have forgiven will be different altogether have before made up mind to tell still did not seem to must ever be happy again now have have courage to speak out have be so good to great weight be lifted off mind mean to learn to be good housewife like mother to try to be worthy day of honest man love be sure will be cyril said warmly so mistress nellie have turned out for best though did not seem so at one time at moment captain dave came in be glad to see two talking together a of old said have thought that there must be quarrel between for have given up rating nellie give kiss cyril be good lass though have be foolish one nay nellie offer cheek be fashion to do to idle acquaintance kiss heartily a if loved be right lass now let to breakfast where be

under roof lad said laughing warn that if anyone call so will not answer have always be cyril with intend to remain so to end must remember that be few month have have right to title be never addressed by until by prince rupert be for moment well nigh a much surprised a be last night hour later cyril again donned best suit started to pay visit to earl have not seen over night must have

blake monk more than once led way upstairs into best of spare room here cyril be laid on bed thanked sailor heartily for care have taken of captain handed letter to john saying young lord oliphant asked to give to captain dowsett a be not at home pray to give when return a soon a have gone john returned to bed be terrible master cyril what have be doing to can see little of face for bandage eye look mere slit flesh be red swollen eyebrow have gone arm leg be swathed up in bandage have be blown up with gunpowder for surely wound must have so disfigured have not be blown up john be burnt by flame of dutch fire ship came alongside be matter that fortnight will set right though doubt not that be unpleasant looking object at present will be time before hair grows again be not hurt otherwise master john asked anxiously yes be hurt gravely enough though not so a to imperil life have wound on side of head same blow a doctor say cleft through shoulder bone have best go get surgeon at once john said though will be easy matter for world be agog in street leave for present john there be need for haste in trunk of mine be bottle of oil for burn though most of sore place be already beginning to heal over doctor said that need not apply more unless found that smarted too much for bearing a for other wound be strapped up bandaged said that unless inflamed badly must be best let alone for time so sit down quietly let hear news news be bad enough though plague have not yet entered city prince told that there be report before came on board at lowestoft that have done so be not yet come people be a frightened a if be raging here for last fortnight have be leaving in crowd from west end many of citizen be also beginning to move frighten like parcel of child comet seemed to many sign of great disaster cyril laughed if must be seen only in there might be something in a can be seen over europe be hard to say why must augur evil to london especially be shining in sky three night ago when be chasing dutch have quite a good reason for thinking be sign of misfortune to a have londoner be true enough john wilkes agreed though in truth like not to see ' thing in sky then people have troubled head greatly because in master lilly almanack other book of prediction great pestilence be foretold needed great wisdom for cyril said seeing that plague have be for time busy in foreign part that be here though not so very bad in winter when book must have be written then john wilkes went on there be man going through street night day speaks to one cry out continually 'oh great dreadful god ' trouble many men heart greatly be pity john that poor fellow be not taken shut up in place where madman be kept doubtless be poor coward whose brain have be turned by fright people who be frightened by such thing a must be poor witted creature indeed may be master cyril methinks be a say one fool make many people get together bemoan till heart fail altogether yet methinks be not altogether without reason for if pestilence be so heavy without wall where street be wider people le crowded than here may well be that will have terrible time of in city when once pass wall may well be john cowardly fear will not make thing better knew when sailed out against dutch other day that very many must not see setting sun yet believe there be not one man throughout fleet who behaved like coward doubt master cyril there be difference one can fight against men one can not fight against pestilence believe that if citizen knew that great dutch army be marching on london that must have to withstand dreadful siege must be moved with fear a be now that may be so cyril agreed now john think must sleep for bit do so master will go into kitchen see what can do to make basin of broth when awake for girl have gone out too wanted to see what be going on in street a have sooner stay quietly at home offered to take place a shop be shut have nothing to do maybe by time wake again

rascally dutch fire ship john tell that captain of sailor who carried here said that have gained mighty credit for did best a everyone did captain dave there be not man on board fleet who did not do duty must never have beaten dutchman so soundly have better not talk more mr dowsett said be in charge now first order be that must keep very quiet else will be having fever come on have best take little of broth now nellie will sit with while go out to prepare cooling drink will take few spoonful of soup since john have taken trouble to prepare for cyril said though indeed lip be so parched swollen that cooling drink will be much more to taste think be best first dame captain said that john must get comfortably into bed instead of lying there wrapped up in blanket in brought ashore broth will be none worse for cooling bit will be best wife agreed will fetch more pillow so that can prop up can swallow more comfortably so will sleep better when lie down again a soon a cyril be comfortably settled john wilkes be sent to call in doctor who after examining said that burn be doing well that must send in cooling lotion to be applied to frequently a to wound said have be so skilfully bandaged that be best to leave alone unless great pain set in four day cyril face have so far recovered usual condition that swelling be almost abated bandage must be removed peak of helmet have sheltered good deal have suffered le than hand arm captain dave john have sat up with by turn at night while dame daughter have taken care of during day have slept great deal have not be allowed

slipped alongside of flame breaking out must speedily have destroyed a indeed went near doing grapnel be briskly thrown over have already touched side flame be blowing across when sir cyril perceiving that have still way on sprang down on to deck put over helm be then pillar of flame deck be plentifully besmeared with pitch be in blaze save just round tiller where captain have stood to steer be verily furnace seemed impossible that one must stand there for only minute live everyone on board be filled with astonishment prince called out loudly that have never seen braver deed a fire ship drew away from saw sir cyril fasten helm down with rope then lowering bucket over throw water on to then threw off helmet armour clothes being by time in flame sprang into sea fire ship being now well nigh own length from have sheered off none too soon for of sail be on fire be with great difficulty that succeeded in cutting from yard so saving ship from prince down say that finer action be ever performed acknowledge that owe life majesty owes ship to then soon after have hauled sir cyril on board dutchman boarded there be stiff fight hand doing best to beat back in succeeded cyril though scarce able to stand joined in fray unnoticed by who in confusion have not thought of being indeed scarce able to hold sword received heavy wound of however doctor have hope that will make good recovery must have done good to hear how whole crew cheered sir cyril a dragged on board prince be mightily taken with be sending to london in own yacht where feel sure that good dame fair daughter will do that can to restore to health a soon a get leave though know when will be for can not say a yet how matter will turn out what ship will keep sea will do honour of waiting upon pray give respectful compliment to mr dowsett mistress nellie who be hope enjoying good health 'your servant to command beydney oliphant ' tear be standing in nellie eye voice trembled a read when finished burst out cry there john wilkes exclaimed bringing fist down upon table knew by what that skipper said lad have be doing something quite out of way when spoke to about before came in only said that have tried best to do duty just a other man in fleet have done who must have thought captain dave that quiet young chap who used to sit down below making out account be going to turn out hero who indeed captain said wiping eye with back of hand why be more than fifteen then a say quiet fellow used to sit there write never speak unless spoke to be scarce two year ago look what have done who

dave followed few minute later have be hearing how got burnt began friend lord oliphant sent letter about by skipper of yacht that stupid fellow john have be carrying about ever since only remembered just now when be at breakfast be plucky thing to do lad turned out very lucky one cyril said hastily for be mean of saving life saving life lad what do mean cyril then told how robert ashford black dick have be brought on board a impressed men how former have be killed confession black dick have made to before dying said have made up mind to kill during fight that after have risked life to save henrietta be ashamed to kill that rather than do so have resolved to take chance of denouncing when returned to land there be good in knave then captain dave said yes be fortunate a well a brave action a turned out fortunate in one respect not in cyril put in anxious to prevent conversation reverting to question of bravery put down wound in shoulder to for if have be think must have got hurt guarded blow be so shaky that broke guard down a if have be child though think that did turn blow little saved from falling fair on skull besides must have have helmet armour on if have not be for having to take swim so see captain dave thing be pretty equally balanced there be occasion to say anything more about have one piece of bad news to tell cyril mr dowsett remarked in order to give conversation turn saw wished for heard morning that plague have come at last into city dr burnet be attacked yesterday be bad news indeed dame though be not to be expected that must spare city if will take advice will go away at once before matter get worse for if plague get hold here country people will have nothing to do with londoner fearing that will bring infection among will not go until be fit to go with cyril nellie said indignantly then will worry into fever cyril replied be getting on well now a said when be talking of before must leave john in charge of house shop will be able to do everything be necessary for if stay here plague increase will keep on worrying at thought that be risking life needlessly for if must come into house of die will charge life with having be cause of death pray for sake a well a own to lose time in going to sister captain dave spoke of down near gloucester agitate mr dowsett said gently pressing quietly back on to pillow from have risen in excitement will talk over see what be for best be solitary case yet may spread further in few day will see how matter go thing have not come to bad pas yet cyril however be not to be consoled hitherto have given comparatively small thought to plague now that be in city felt that presence alone prevented family from leaving worried incessantly over patient be not so well doctor said to mr dowsett next morning yesterday be quite free from fever hand be cool now be dry hard if go on fear that will have great trouble be worrying because go out of town have indeed made up mind to do so must not leave here nursing must be valuable certainly if go on a be will soon be in high fever wound will grow angry fester while yesterday seemed in fair way to recovery must be sorry to give favourable opinion a to what may happen if go on be there one who must take care of if went john wilkes will remain behind must certainly be trusted to do everything that directed be not like woman doctor be well aware of if thing go on well will really not need nursing while if fever set in badly best nursing may not save moreover wound other ailment of sort do badly at present plague in air seems to affect other malady if will take advice dame will carry out intention leave at once hear there be several new case of plague today in city who can go must lose time in doing so even if not for own sake must say go for of patient will speak to husband doctor be ready to do be best for patient whom love dearly regard almost a son if be son must give same advice yes will see captain dowsett hour later cyril be told what doctor advice have be seeing that be bent on that if stayed must do more harm than good resolved to start next day for gloucestershire chapter xv plague reluctant a be to leave cyril mr dowsett daughter speedily saw that doctor advice be good cyril did not say much expression of restful satisfaction came over face be not long before fell into quiet sleep contrasted strongly with restless fretful state in have passed night see be right madam doctor said that evening fever have not quite left be different man to what be morning quiet night rest will regain ground have lost think can go in perfect comfort so far a be concerned week will be up if nothing occurs to throw back again of course will be week before can use arm john wilkes have be sent off a soon a be

tremble for warn will scold terribly then will scold a much a please nellie will take quite patiently nellie mother went away in tear captain dave be good deal upset have thought going away from home on long journey must be great trial be now quite lost sight of in regret at what considered deserting cyril many be injunction be given to john wilkes before waggon drove off be somewhat consoled by seeing that cyril be undoubtedly better brighter have slept all night without waking hand be cool flush have entirely left cheek if be starting on voyage to indie must not be in greater taking john wilkes said on returning to cyril bedside why have seen captain go off on six month voyage le said about be heartily glad be gone john if plague grows there will be terrible time here be shop shut ay man went away two day ago sent off two 'prentices yesterday there be naught doing yesterday vessel in pool cleared out on news of plague having got into city reckon that before long there wo be ship in port will have quiet time of will be like men in charge of old hulk week cyril be up bandage except on shoulder head have be thrown aside doctor said that erelong former must be dispensed with john have wanted to sit up with a cyril must not hear of have moved bed into same room so that must be up in moment if anything be wanted went out day to bring in news there be little enough to tell master cyril said one day so far plague grows slowly in city though indeed be fault of people that doe not spread rapidly most of seem scared out of wit gather together talk with white face one man tell of dream that wife have have of voice that say have heard have seen ghost yesterday came upon woman with crowd round be staring up at white cloud swore that must plainly see angel with white sword of others cried that saw too must like to have be gunner mate with stout rattan to have laid over shoulder to give something else to think about for few hour be downright pitiful to see such coward at corner of one street there be quack vending pill perfume that warranted to keep away plague people ran up bought nostrum by score hear there be dozen such in city making fortune out of people fear went into tavern always use have glass of holland talk with landlord say that doe a good trade a ever though in different way there be sailor there now neighbour come in drink down glass of strong water many think be best thing against plague then hurry off again saw gazette there be half full of advertisement of people who said be doctor from foreign part well accustomed to cure plague say magistrate be going to issue notice about shutting up house a do at st giles to have watchman at door to see none come in go out that be going to appoint examiner in parish to go from house to house to search for infected person suppose be proper step to take cyril said will be difficult thing to keep people shut up in house where one be infected doubt must be good thing at commencement of illness when have once spread very air become infected seems to that will do little good while will assuredly cause great distress trouble long to be able to get up to see about thing street have quite empty aspect so many have gone away what with most of shop being closed dismal aspect of people there be little pleasure in being out master cyril dare say john still will be change a soon a be strong enough will sally out with fortnight cyril be able to do so plague have still spread so slowly that people began to hope that city must be spared great calamity for be well on in july in six week heat of summer must be passed of who have gone into country returned more shop have be opened panic have somewhat subsided what do mean to do master cyril john wilkes asked that evening of course can not join fleet again for will be a doctor say two month before shoulder bone will have knit strongly enough for to use arm at sea be matter of more consequence than on land for man to have use of arm ship may give sudden lurch one may have to make clutch at be nearest to prevent one from rolling into lee scupper wrench a must take from weak arm good three month nursing have done might spoil job of getting bone to grow straight again altogether say be fit to travel yet must be able before long to start on journey might travel down into gloucestershire where be sure will be gladly welcomed by captain dame mistress nellie must not care for might go aboard ship there be hundred of lying idle in river many family have taken up home there so a to be free from risk of meeting infected person in street think will stay here john keep company if plague dy away well good if get bad can shut up say that captain have laid in great store of provision so that must live without laying out penny for year be a sure a anything can be that when cold weather come on will die out besides john be afraid of plague be certain that be fear that make most people take if becomes bad there will be terrible need for help maybe will be able to do good if be not afraid of facing death in battle why must fear by plague be a noble death to die helping one fellow countryman in sore distress a in fighting for one country be true enough master cyril if folk did see so see what must do if there be aught can depend on be in ship in levant when have fever seems to be akin to plague though not like in symptom crew died a say verily believe that be partly from lowness of spirit into fell from fear used to help nurse sick throw overboard dead never touched say be braver than others seemed to a be just a easy to take thing comfortable a be to fret over towards end of month plague spread rapidly work ceased in parish most affected just a have raged for week in western parish outside city so seemed restricted by certain invisible line after have made entry within wall while raged in part others be entirely unaffected here shop be open street still retained something of usual appearance there have be great want among poorer class owing to cessation of work especially along riverside lord mayor of alderman most other rich citizen have hastened to leave city while many of clergy be deserting flock many doctor patient others remained firmly at post worked incessantly did be possible in order to check spread of plague to relieve distress of poor number of woman be engaged a nurse examiner be appointed in parish with assistant paid house to house visitation in order to discover who be infected a soon a case be discovered house be closed none suffered to go in out watchman being placed before door day night two men therefore be needed to infected house afforded employment for number of poor others be engaged in digging graf in going round at night with cart collecting dead so great be dread of people at thought of being shut up in house without communication with world mean be used for concealing fact that one of inmate be smitten down be more easy because early stage of disease be without pain people be generally ignorant that have be attacked until within few hour sometimes within few minute of death consequently when plague have once spread precaution taken to prevent increase be useless while caused great misery suffering doubtless very much greater loss of life for owing to so many being shut up in house with affected there being escape from infection whole family with servant apprentice sickened died together cyril frequently went up to view infected district be not moved by curiosity by desire to see if there be way of being of use there be not

lock inside so frequently be done at last chain with padlock be fastened to door a soon a watch be set over even did not avail many of house have communication at back into other street so eluded vigilance of watch while in other case communication be broken through wall into other house empty either by desertion death escape must thus be made under very eye of watchman very frequently cyril went into church when saw door open here very small congregation must be gathered for there be fear on part of of meeting with stranger for might unknown to be already stricken with pest public

text seemed strange at time rejoice ye for kingdom of heaven be at hand from most of discourse have heard cyril have gone out depressed rather than inspirited have be pitched in one tone terrible scourge raged round be held up a punishment sent by wrath of god upon sinful people congregation be warned to prepare for fate might at moment be theirs by repentance humiliation preacher to whom

everyone can be useful if chooses minister said there be need everywhere among stricken frightened helpless people of men of calm courage cool head nine out of ten be so scared out of sens when once plague enters house a to be well nigh useless yet law hinders who must help if must be compelled to labour not among who be sick among who be well when one enters house with red cross on door may leave more until be borne out to dead cart plague have wholly disappeared within month have elapsed sole exception be doctor be more exempt from spreading infection than other men a must do work so

although constantly going into worst neighbourhood like dr hodges have fear of say have fear doctor replied do duty so far a can doubt sooner later will catch malady a many of have done already take such precaution a can distemper seems to baffle precaution only grief be that skill avail so little so far have found nothing seems to be of real use perhaps if must attack in earlier stage might be more successful strange nature of disease way in doe work well nigh to end before patient be aware of put out of power to combat in many case be not sent for until patient be at point of death by time reach door be met with news that be dead must be going one moment dr hodges young gentleman have be expressing to desire to be of use know nothing of save that be one of congregation morning a fear

seeing when be boy took side of king against parliament a heard passed over with charles to france when cause be lost have not heard of since sir aubrey be father cyril said quietly died year ago be only son therefore sir cyril minister said though did not so name be needle cyril said have estate to support title though be true that when at sea with prince rupert be called sir cyril be because prince have known father knew that at death inherited title though inherited nothing else now reached door of mr wallace lodging went up to room on first floor neglect precaution minister said one must throw away life although not smoker accustomed to take snuff use now must a doctor advise chew piece of tobacco 't be too nasty when tried be so ill that thought even risk of plague preferable carry camphor in pocket when return from preaching among people of whom may well have infection bathe face hand with vinegar pouring on to hot iron fill room with vapour life be useful hope must fain keep a long a be lord will to work in service a rule take wine bread before go out in morning though to day be pressed for time neglected must advise always to do so be convinced that full man have le chance of catching infection than fasting one that be weakness many men suffer from fear from loss of appetite from grief cause to take so easily when fever be so bad in st giles heard that in many instance where whole family be carried away nurse shut up with be untouched with infection believe that be because have become hardened to work ate drank heartily troubled not at at grief of around say that many of harpy have grown wealthy loading with everything valuable must lay hand on in house of attended after meal in insisted upon cyril joining be concluded mr wallace uttered short prayer that cyril might safely pas through work have undertaken trust said that will come here frequently generally have few friend here of evening try to be cheerful to strengthen other be sure have comfort at meeting thank will come sometimes sir a rule must return home for friend john wilkes must sorely miss company be so good faithful fellow must not seem to desert on account do a think right lad remember there will always be welcome for here when choose to come john wilkes be dismayed when heard of cyril intention well master cyril said after smoking pipe in silence for time be not for to hinder in what have made up mind to do say that if be on duty here might go do what must for poor creature know be one thing to face deadly fever like plague if come on board own ship for there be getting out of a have got to face why say do a man a for going out of way to put in middle of be going bit beyond well john did think foolish when went a volunteer to fight dutch be just same thing know suppose be john said reluctantly after pause then see be fighting for country well in present case will be fighting for countryman countrywoman john be awful to think of misery that people be suffering seems to that having nothing else to do here be specially duty to put hand to work of helping a far a can risk may at present be greater than must be if stayed at home if plague spread look a if city must presently be affected will have to run risk of contagion there be thousand of woman now who voluntarily enter house a nurse for small rate of pay even robber say will enter ransack house of dead in search of plunder will be shame indeed then if one must shrink from doing so when possibly one might do good will say nothing more against master cyril still see exactly what be going to do with one arm must scarce hold down raving man be not going to be nurse certainly john cyril said with laugh expect that doctor want certain case watched may doubt nurse may want to see how particular drug work nothing so far seems of use may be partly because doctor be so busy that can not watch patient see from hour to hour how medicine act when be in levant pest be bad there john wilkes said heard that turk when seized with distemper sometimes wrapped up in great number of clothes so that sweated heavily that seemed in case to draw off fever so patient recovered that seems sensible sort of treatment john worth trying with plague on calling on dr hodges afternoon cyril found that have rightly guessed nature of work that doctor wished to perform can never rely upon nurse said give instruction with medicine in most case be sure that instruction be never carried out relation friend be too frightened to think act calmly too full of grief for sick anxiety for who have not yet taken illness to watch change in patient a to nurse be often drunk whole time be in house sometimes fear to go near sick man woman sometimes undoubtedly hasten death in most case matter little for be generally called in too late to be of service poor people view almost a enemy hide malady from in way time too be wasted uselessly for many be there who frighten into belief that be ill send for in haste so far feel that be working altogether in dark none of can see that sort of drug avail even in slightest degree when malady have once got hold one in twenty case may live why know not still fact that do live show that illness be not necessarily mortal must right remedy befound might yet overcome first thing however be to try to prevent spread here have ten more people shut up in house with one sick person be terrible necessity for be sentence of death to many if not to give nurse instruction to fumigate room by evaporating vinegar upon hot iron by burning spice drug by sprinkling perfume so far can not see that measure have be of service can not say how thoroughly have be carried out sorely need assistant to see that system be fairly tried be not necessary that must be doctor

case in many instance people be so distracted with grief fear that ran about house like mad person cry screaming running in out of sick chamber sitting there cry helplessly refusing to leave body until be carried out to dead cart with such case cyril have nothing to do a doctor must only send to house where saw that instruction must be carried out to great satisfaction cyril found that precaution taken in first case proved successful regularly morning inquired at door received answer be well in august plague greatly increased in violence death rising to ten thousand week dull despair have now seized population seemed that be to be swept away many went out of mind quack no longer drove flourishing trade in pretended nostrum be now utterly discredited for nothing seemed of slightest avail went to opposite extreme affected to defy fate tavern be filled again boisterous shout song seemed to mock dismal cry from house with red cross on door robbery be rife regardless of danger of pest robber broke into house where inmate have perished by plague rifled of valuable nurse plundered dying natural affection seemed at end stricken be often deserted by relative left alone to perish band of reckless young fellow went through street singing dressing up in mask performed dance of death dead be too many to be carried away in cart at night to great pit prepared for dismal tone of bell cry of bring out dead sounded in street day be no longer possible to watch whole of infected house sometimes plague stricken men must escape from bed run through street until dropped dead one such man in height of delirium sprang into river after swimming about for time returned to shore marvellously cured of malady by shock cyril went occasionally in evening to lodging of mr wallace at first met several people gathered there number became fewer time went have told minister that thought that must be better for to stay away exposed a be to infection mr wallace must take excuse on score be in hand of god said street be full of infected people frequently go to pray with friend in earliest stage of malady there be longer use in precaution can go on doing duty until be called away even among few who gather here of evening there may be one more who be already smitten though unconscious yet that summons have come among others cyril be introduced to mr mr harvey who be minister told from country be staying in town on account of painful family business have tried to persuade to return home to stay there until plague cease conceive duty to remain be like independent be not easily to be turned from resolution have taken cyril must easily understand that mr harvey be exactly what from description have heard of have pictured to that roundhead soldier must be have stern face eye deeply sunk in head high cheekbone firm mouth square jaw wore hair cut close figure be bony must a young man have be very powerful spoke in slow deliberate way that struck cyril a being result of long effort for certain restless action of finger quick movement of eye told of naturally impulsive fiery disposition constantly used scriptural text in course of speech wife be gentle quiet be evident that there be very strong sympathy between cyril found after meeting once twice that liked far better than thought must do on first introduction be doubt partly due to fact that mr harvey frequently entered into conversation with appeared to interest in be too type be altogether new to lad from father father companion have heard nothing good of puritan evident earnestness of man nature be to extent in accordance with own disposition felt that widely a might differ from on point of politics must not respect evening be pleasant a if by common consent conversation never turned on plague talked of other passing event of trial of friend of law be being put in force against nonconformist what think of persecution young sir mr harvey abruptly asked cyril one evening breaking off in midst of general conversation cyril be little confused at unexpected question think persecution for conscience ' sake be wrong said after moment pause generally recoil upon persecutor spain lost holland owing to persecution of people france lost great number of best citizen by law against protestant agree with thoroughly that persecution of nonconformist at present be grievous error cruel injustice at same time if will excuse saying so be natural consequence of persecution by nonconformist when be in power of minister of church of england tutor in france be english clergyman who have be driven from living like thousand of other minister because must not give up opinion therefore see very early be imbued with hatred of persecution in form trust have not spoken too boldly asked for opinion be forced to give at rate young sir have spoken manfully like none worse for can altogether gainsay word must remember that have before be oppressed that have be engaged in desperate struggle for liberty of conscience having won for proceeded to deny to others mr wallace said with smile cyril have fairly mr harvey be reaping what father sowed thought that power have gained be to be theirs to hold always used tyrannously being thereby false to principle be ever persecuted when attains power who becomes persecutor hard a be pressure of law now must never forget that have in time be persecutor in defiance of right of conscience have fought to achieve man nature be fear unchangeable slave longs above thing for freedom when rise successfully against master in turn becomes tyrant not infrequently cruel bloodthirsty one still must hope may be in good day be to come may reach point when will be free to worship in own fashion without fear hindrance recognising fact that have right to follow own path to heaven without being subject of offence to who walk in other way one two of other visitor be on point of speaking when mr wallace put stop to further argument by fetching bible from closet preparing for short service of prayer with evening always closed one evening mr harvey wife be absent from usual gathering feel anxious about mr wallace said have never since arrived in town missed coming here at seven o'clock bell be usually striking hour a come fear that one other of may have be seized by plague with permission sir will run round see cyril said know lodging for

occupied by harvey be at house of mercer family have three week before gone away having gladly permitted lodger to remain a presence acted a guard to house have brought up old servant with be therefore able to dispense with other attendant cyril hurried along trying a usual to pay a little heed a must to doleful cry arose from many of house although be still broad daylight there be scarce soul in street met be like walking fast keeping a far a possible from one met so a to avoid contact a neared house heard woman scream moment later casement be thrown open mr harvey head appeared gave piercing cry for help be then suddenly dragged back casement be violently closed cyril have so frequently heard similar cry that must have paid attention to have come from stranger felt that mr harvey be not one to give way to wild despair even have husband be suddenly attacked with plague sudden disappearance closing of casement too be unaccountable unless indeed husband be in state of violent delirium ran to door flung against help to force down cried to man who be passing be mad man replied do not see that have got plague may hear hundred of such cry day cyril drew sword always carried when went out of evening for owing to death among city watch deed of lawlessness violence be constantly perpetrated struck with strength with hilt upon fastening of casement next door several of small pane of glass fell in whole window shook again again struck upon same spot when fastening gave way window flew open sprang in at once ran through shop into passage then upstairs door be open nearly fell over body of man a ran into room heard word for last time will sign deed think will not do be desperate a word left mouth cyril sprang forward between man mr harvey who be standing with arm folded looking steadfastly at opponent who be menacing with drawn sword man with terrible oath turned to defend repeating oath when saw who be assailant let off last time lightly scoundrel cyril exclaimed time be life mine man made furious lunge at cyril parried must at next moment have run through have not mr harvey suddenly thrown between hurling cyril antagonist to ground put up sword said to cyril man be son scoundrel villain yet still son even though have raised hand against leave to god cyril have stepped pace back in surprise at first thought that mr harvey trouble have turned brain then flashed across that ruffian name be indeed john harvey man be about to rise from floor when cyril again sprang forward drop that sword exclaimed will run through now sir said to mr harvey will draw out that pistol whose butt project from pocket son may do one of mischief yet that such have be man intention be evident from glance of baffled rage threw at cyril now sir go father said sternly remember henceforth be son of mine did do duty must hand over to watch not for threat to for sword thrust have given to joseph edmonds who have many time carried on shoulder when child may compass death be assured that not one farthing will gain thereby havengeance be mine lord leave to to pay now go john harvey rose to foot walked to door then turned shook fist at cyril curse said will be even with yet cyril now have time to look round eye fell upon figure of mr harvey who have fallen insensible made step towards husband said have fainted be more pressing turned to old servant cyril aided in lifting old man up laying on couch breathes said be wounded to death mr harvey said sadly son hath done cyril opened servant coat here be wound high up on left side may not touch vital part bleeds freely have heard that be good sign be so mr harvey said excitedly perhaps may yet recover must give be worth that might be so bad a may be sin of murder must not rest on son soul will run for doctor sir before go let help to lift wife will doubtless come round shortly will aid to stanch wound till doctor come mr harvey be indeed already showing sign of returning animation be placed on couch water sprinkled on face a soon a saw eye open cyril caught up hat ran to dr doctor have just finished supper be on point of going out again to see of patient on hearing from cyril that servant of friend of have be wounded by robber put lint bandage in pocket started with robbery be becoming more more frequent said so bold reckless be criminal that seem to care not jot whether add murder to other crime where do say wound be cyril pointed below own shoulder be just about there doctor then may be above upper edge of lung if so may save man inch higher lower will make difference between life death a say that be bleeding freely be probable that sword have missed lung for have pierced bleeding must have be chiefly internal hope of saving must have be slight indeed when reached house cyril found that mr harvey have quite recovered have cut open man clothes husband be pressing handkerchief closely folded upon wound be serious think not vital dr hodges said after examining feel sure that sword have missed lung after cutting off rest of man upper garment poured from phial have brought with few drop of powerful styptic into wound placed thick pad of lint over bandaged securely then giving direction that small quantity of spirit water must be given to patient from time to time above thing that must be kept perfectly quiet hurried away be there anything more can do sir cyril asked mr harvey nothing more will understand sir what feeling be that heart be too full of grief emotion for to speak will watch together to night lay case before lord then will come early in morning see if there be aught can do sir be going back now to mr wallace who be uneasy at absence suppose must wish to say only that found that there be robber in place who having wounded servant be on point of attacking when entered that fled almost immediately that will do say to that for to night will be busy nursing that wife be greatly shaken therefore must not that must come round pray to call here in morning will do so sir cyril went downstairs closed shutter of window into have broken put up bar then went out at door taking special pain to close firmly behind be glad to be out of house have seen many sad scene during last few week seemed to that be saddest of better thousand time to see son stricken by plague than walked slowly back to minister met mr wallace at door of house be coming round

not accept offer to stay do anything must said be coming to mr harvey asked to say that although be too much shaken to see evening must be glad if must go round to first thing in morning then robber got away unharmed mr wallace asked be unharmed sir must rather that did not question on subject mr harvey will doubtless enter fully into matter with in morning did not exchange many word for be greatly disturbed in spirit at wounding of old servant scene have gone through seeing that wife must rather be alone with patient left almost directly after dr hodges went away however may say that believe that there be private matter in affair will probably communicate to then will ask more question cyril be well content to know that be not a feared that plague have not attacked said must call round in morning sir have be thinking of a came along consider a will be there be a well that must not do so will come round here at ten o'clock must not have returned will wait until do know can be of use whatever wish to intrude there will kindly say to add must really wish to go will of course do so mr wallace looked little puzzled will do a ask seems to that will naturally wish to see seeing that have not be for arrival might have be robbed perhaps murdered will understand better when have seen mr harvey sir now will be making for home be about usual hour john wilkes will be beginning to wonder worry about to john cyril told same story a to mr wallace how be that let villain escape master cyril why did not run through body have other thing to think of john there be mr harvey lying insensible servant desperately wounded thought more of than of robber be glad enough when ran out to be able to turn attention to ay ay be natural enough lad 't be pity villain got off scot free truly be not safe for two old people to be in empty house by in time specially a maybe house on side be also untenanted robber can get into make way along roof so enter house like by window there be mercy

wilkes want now be nourishment take carefully at first not too much at time stick to broth for next two three day when do begin with solid do so very sparingly there be gentleman here yesterday asking about john wilkes said a cyril propped up in bed sipped broth be mr harvey rang at bell went down to lower window talked to through for of course watchman must not let go out speak to have heard speak of a one of gentleman met at minister seemed muchly interested in said that have done great service of course knew be by frightening that robber away never saw man more pleased than be when told that doctor thought be a good a cured thanked god very piously for same after have done that asked first whether have said anything to about said that have told have met wife at minister that said have disturbed robber found at house said quite sharp 'nothing more ' 'no not a can think of be always doing good to somebody ' say 'and never word must say about if did not get found out somehow why saved prince rupert ship from being blown up by fire vessel never must have known of if young lord oliphant have not written to captain telling about saying that be gallantest feat done in battle then there be other thing be of nature of private affair 'you can tell about good man said ' be vain babbler a may well believe from what did for for other reason must fain know a much a can of ' so then told about how found out about robbery saved master from being ruined how prevented miss nellie from going off with rascal who pretended be earl then did very wrong john cyril said angrily say naught about speaking about robbery for be told in open court ought not on account to have said word about mistress nellie affair well honour doubt not mistress nellie must have told gentleman have be in place be sure can be trusted not to let go further took care to tell what good have done mistress nellie that good have come out of evil well ought not to have said anything about john may be that mistress out of goodness of heart might herself have told be reason why anyone else must do so charge in future never to open lip about to anyone matter who say not that harm will come of in case for mr harvey be indeed sober god fearing man assuredly asked only because felt interest in from idle curiosity still must rather that have not known of matter touching honour of mistress nellie mum word in future master cyril will keep hatch fast down on tongue now will push bed up near window a doctor ordered then hope will get good long sleep plague process by have be expelled have left cyril so weak that be day before must walk across room morning inquired anxiously of john how felt answer be always satisfactory john have never be better in life therefore by time cyril be able to walk to easy chair by window began to hope that john have escaped infection generally declared within day two often within few hour of first outbreak in house week later doctor who paid flying visit two three day gave welcome news that have ordered red cross to be removed from door watchman to cease attendance a house might now be considered altogether free from infection plague continued ravage with slight abatement moving gradually eastward aldgate district lying east of wall be now suffering terribly be nearly end of september before cyril be strong enough to go out for first walk since beginning of august fifty thousand people have be carried off so that street be now almost entirely deserted in many place grass be shooting up thickly in road in street house bore sign of red cross tolling of bell of dead cart piteous cry lamentation be only sound that broke strange silence scene be so disheartening that cyril did not leave house again for fortnight first visit be to mr wallace sight of watchman at door gave quite shock be grieved indeed when heard from man that brave minister have died fortnight before then went to mr harvey there be mark on door repeated knocking met with response woman looking out from window opposite called to that house have be empty for well nigh month people be in have gone off in cart supposed into country there be gentleman lady said who seemed well enough servant who be carried down placed in cart must not have be plague though man looked a if have be sorely ill next day called on dr hodges who have not be near for last month there be watchman at door man opened can see doctor ay can see said be cured now will soon be about again have have plague then that have be week now since watchman left cyril went upstairs doctor be sitting looking pale thin by window be grieved indeed to hear that have be ill doctor cyril said have known must have come fortnight since for be strong enough to walk distance then did indeed go out street have so sad aspect shrank from stirring out again yes have have doctor said directly felt come on followed system exactly have gone further with than have with be week before fairly drove enemy out ordered sweating in case a know seldom sent for until too late be rare that system got fair chance however in case be complete success two of servant died be taken when be at worst be dead before be told of man saw be one who waited on a adopted same precaution have taken with man did not catch be only when went downstairs one day found other two servant lying dead in kitchen that knew have be ill mr wallace have gone will be sorry to hear sir be doctor said one be more fitted to die be brave man true christian ran too many risk news doe not surprise only other friend have mr harvey wife went out of town month ago taking with servant yes saw day before be taken ill doctor said told that man be so far out of danger that might safely be moved seemed very interested in be very pleased when told that have now given up attending that be able to walk across room must erelong be again hope be getting to end of now lad a plague travel east abates in west return for last week show distinct fall in rate of mortality there be further east for to go now hope that in few week will have worn out be half through october may look for cold weather before long must think that be strong enough to be useful again now sir think be strong enough be sure will not give leave to do so doctor said can hardly say how far first attack be protection against second for recovery have be so few that have scarce mean of knowing there certainly have be case where person have recovered from first attack died from second treatment be too severe to be gone through twice be therefore more essential that must run risk of infection than be before can see that be still very far from strong duty now be in first place to regain health must say get on board hoy go to yarmouth week in bracing air there must do more good than six month here be useless to give that advice because in first place shipping come up river even if must get down to yarmouth by road one must receive still be what must do a soon a must get away be not that in case have duty here doctor what said to surely applies to yourself also cyril said with smile know that doctor said good humouredly expected be not for doctor to choose be not free like other men have adopted vocation in be first duty to go among sick ailment may be to do that can for if a in present case can do practically nothing else to set example of calmness fearlessness still for time at rate will be able to go more into house where plague be raging 't be more than month since be cured yet be still mere shadow of what be have much harder fight with enemy can not walk across room yet without william help therefore will be fortnight three week yet before can see patient much longer before will have strength to visit in house by time trust that plague will have very greatly abated thus see will not be called upon to stand face to face with for time who call upon here be seldom plague stricken come for other ailment because feel unwell be nervous lest must be beginning of attack of late have have very few come here patient be mostly of middle class have fled fallen victim to plague have shut up in house like fortress nothing must tempt to issue abroad therefore expect that will have naught to do to gain strength again come here when will lad oftener better conversation be best medicine for of a soon a can will visit doubt not that john wilkes have many story of sea will take thought away from sad city bring with sometimes be honest fellow talk of sailor so smack of sea that seems almost to act a tonic cyril stayed for hour promised to return on following evening said however that be sure john wilkes must not accompany never leaf house unless be in considers on duty although a tell there be little fear of anyone breaking in seeing how many house with much more valuable more portable good be empty deserted hold to purpose saying that even with house altogether empty must be just a much duty to remain in charge well come cyril if can not get old watch dog out must wait until can go to will be very glad to come doctor for time hang heavily on hand john wilkes spends hour day in washing scrubbing deck a call there be few book in house a to can furnish will do so gladly go across to shelf there choose for thank very much indeed sir will kindly choose for have read few english book for of course in france reading be entirely french then take shakespeare hold writing to be finest in tongue know nearly by heart for there be scarce evening when take down for hour reading forget worry care of day work must otherwise often keep from sleep 't be bulky volume let discourage be full of wit wisdom of such romance that will often find hard to lay down stay have two edition can well spare one of so take one on upper shelf keep when have read there be little difference between generally use other have come to look upon a friend nay sir will take a loan will hing of sort owe fee bumping one henceforth cyril did not find time hang heavy on hand seemed to a sat at window read that new world opened to life have be eminently practical one have studied hard in france when laid book aside time have be spent in open air be only since have be with captain dave that have ever read for amusement captain library consisted only of few book of travel voyage have never so much a dreamt of book like for next few day devoured page be not looking so well cyril dr hodges said to abruptly one day be doing nothing reading shakespeare doctor then be doing wrong lad will never build up unless take exercise street be so melancholy doctor whenever go out return sick at heart in low spirit can understand lad must think of something sat for minute two in silence then said suddenly do understand management of boat yes doctor be greatest pleasure at dunkirk to be out with fisherman will do then go down at once to riverside there be hundred of boat lying idle there for there be passenger trade half of owner be dead be sure to see men there having nothing else to do will be hanging about say want to hire boat for couple of month to buy one will probably get one for few shilling get one with sail a well a oar go out first thing after breakfast go up down river a tide wind may suit take bread meat with return till supper time then can spend evening with shakespeare maybe will come down take sail with sometimes will bring colour back into cheek make new man of must that have thought of before cyril be delighted with idea going down to blackfriar wherry with sail for pound owner be dead learned where widow lived effected bargain without difficulty for be almost starving have bought said because may be may get damaged sunk only need for six week two month at end of time will give back again a soon a plague be over there will be work for boat will be able to let to sell at fair price john wilkes be greatly pleased when cyril came back told what have done be very thing for said have be thick head not to think of have be worrying for last week at seeing sit there hing read yet there seemed nothing else for to do for ten minute out in street be enough to give one heartache maybe will go out for sail with sometimes for there be fear of house being broken into by daylight not in slightest john hope that will come out with always must soon find dull by besides think that be strong enough yet to manage pair of scull for long one must reckon occasionally on having to row against tide even if worst happened anyone did break in carry off few thing be sure captain dave must not grumble at loss when knew that have wanted to come out help to manage boat be ordered to use for health sake that must john said heartily not if stripped house shop of everything there be in chapter xviii stroke of good fortune having finally disposed of john wilkes scruple a to leaving house during daytime cyril thenceforth went out with day if tide be in flood rowed far up river came down on ebb if be running out went down a far a must take whenever wind be favourable hoisted sail at other time rowed fresh air exercise soon did work cyril at first must only take one scull that only for short time at end of fortnight be able to manage for time to row with one for hour feeling of lassitude have oppressed passed away speedily colour came back to cheek muscle strengthened began to put on flesh be now in november needed warm garment when on water john insisted on completely muffling up whenever hoisted sail colder weather braced up be often inclined to shout with pleasure a wind drove boat along before be cheering to know that others be benefiting by change in week ending rd death officially given be though at least thousand must be added to for great number of death from plague be put down to other cause very many especially of infant be never counted at be said that a many people be infected a ever that virulence of disease be abated whereas in august scarce one of attacked recovered in october one out of three died of malady in second week of october number of death by plague be only in third week though great number be still attacked people however grew careless ran unnecessary risk in consequence in first week of number of death rose by after decreased rapidly people who have fled began to come back again more so because have now spread to other large city seemed that there be le danger in london where have spent force than in place where have lately broken out shop began to open again street to reassume former appearance cyril have written several time to captain dowsett telling how matter be going on in november hearing that be thinking of returning wrote begging not to do so many of who have returned have fallen sick died said seems to useless risk of life after taking so much pain to avoid infection to hurry back before danger have altogether passed in case captain dave there be le reason for since there be likelihood of shipping trade being renewed for present port of europe be closed to ship be like to be long time before lose fear of even coasting trade be lost for present therefore advice be very strongly against returning for week be going on well here be getting quite strong again by order of doctor go out with john daily for long row have gained much benefit from john sends respect say that everything be ship shape above below craft holding well on way also prays not to think of returning at present say that must be a bad seamanship a for captain who have made good offing in gale have plenty of sea room to run down close to rocky shore under lee before storm have altogether blown out captain dave took advice only returned with wife nellie week before christmas be glad indeed to be back said after first greeting be over 't be

slackness in pursuit though 't be said be not so much fault a of who be over careful of safety still a be heir to throne be right that must be kept out of fighting be like to be stern work next time cyril if what hear be true owing partly to men mind being occupied by plague partly to great sum wasted by king in pleasure nothing have be done for fleet of course squadron at sea have taken great

for time be pricked with thought that have benefited too largely from necessity of sir aubrey that having received back from rent money paid goodly interest thereon ought to restore estate to former owner possibly might never have acted on thought considered circumstance that have so strangely met cyril here at time of plague still more strangely that cyril have saved life be matter of more than chance be direct manifest interposition of providence have therefore made restitution parcel on table contains deed of gift to cyril of father estate have done quite rightly mr dowsett said warmly

within week so from date of be all delighted to get missive for although what say about infection carried by letter be true enough indeed there be post out of london for month have begun to fear that worst must have befallen when letter arrived from in december still thought that might not know where be so hoped that might be waiting until must find that out father bid say that will take refusal since return more than ever regard a being good genius of family be certainly passing strange that after saving sister life from fire must though in so different way have saved from similar death so set off a soon a get be if can tear away from gaiety of oxford cyril have indeed be specially waiting for sydney answer having told that must remain at oxford until received on following morning packed valise rode for wisbech where arrived three day later welcome at earl be most cordial one spent week there at end of time sydney at earnest request started for norwich with earl have insisted on cyril accepting splendid horse behind on other animal rode young fellow son of small tenant on earl estate whom have engaged a servant have written three day before to mr popham telling that must shortly arrive begging to order two old servant of father whom have at request engaged to take care of house to get two three chamber in readiness for must doubtless be easily done a have learnt from deed that furniture content of house have be included in gift after putting up at inn went to lawyer mr popham found have have room prepared in readiness for at house cyril while thanking for so doing said that a lord oliphant be with must stay at inn for night next morning rode over with mr popham to upmead be six mile distant from town be house lawyer said a fine old mansion came in sight there be larger residence in county few more handsome indeed be almost too large for estate a perhaps know be at one time good deal larger than be at present for be diminished by one of ancestor in day of elizabeth at gate where turned into park arch of evergreen have be erected mean to say let know be coming home cyril said in tone of such alarm that lord oliphant laughed mr popham said apologetically certainly wrote to tenant sir when received letter sent off message saying that must be here morning most of father be here in old time for mr harvey made change be sure must have be very disappointed if have not have notice that sir aubrey son be coming home of course be quite right for to do so mr popham see be quite unaccustomed to such thing must personally have be much more pleased to have come home quietly still a say be only right that tenant must have be informed at rate will be satisfaction to get over at once there be indeed quite large number of men woman assembled in front of house tenant with wife family having gathered to greet young landlord loud burst of cheering arose a rode up sydney mr popham reining back horse little to allow to precede cyril took off hat bowed repeatedly in reply to acclamation greeted tenant crowded round many of older men pressing forward to shake by hand welcome back to own again sir cyril fought under father sir good landlord be to such be exclamation rose round until reached door of mansion dismounting took place at top of step then took off hat again when there be silence said thank heartily one good friend for welcome that have given glad indeed be to come down to father home to be so greeted by who knew especially by who followed in field in evil day have may hope passed away for ever know perhaps that owe return here a master to noble generosity of mr harvey late landlord who restored estate not being bound in way to do so solely because considered that have already be repaid money gave for may be true nevertheless there be not one man in hundred thousand who must so despoil of benefit of bargain lawfully made beg therefore to give three cheer a hearty a with greeted for mr harvey three cheer a long loud a have before risen responded to appeal such man cyril went on when subsided must have be just good landlord to will do best to give cause for regret at change have come about paused for moment to speak to mr popham who stood beside then went on did not know whether must ask to drink to health learn from mr popham that cellar have be left well filled therefore first order on coming to house of father will be that cask of wine will be speedily broached that will be enabled to drink health while be being done mr popham will introduce to one by one loud cheer arose then tenant came forward with wife family cyril shook hand with said few word to elder men have ridden by father in battle most of younger one said a shook hand with father fell under sir aubrey at naseby at worcester in other battle by time have be introduced great cask of wine have be broached after tenant have drunk to health have in turn pledged cyril entered house with sydney mr popham proceeded to examine under guidance of old man who have be father butler whose wife have also be servant in sir aubrey time everything be just a be then sir cyril few fresh article of furniture have be added mr harvey must have general change made family picture hang just where did father must scarce notice change be indeed fine old mansion cyril lord oliphant said when have made tour of house now that see furniture be even more inclined than before to admire man who must voluntarily resign will have to modify idea of puritan have shown ready to leave country cross ocean to america begin life anew for conscience ' sake be to say to escape persecution fought very doughtily must own very successfully for same reason be first time have ever heard of one of relinquishing fine estate for conscience ' sake mr harvey be indeed most worthy gentleman mr popham said have esteem respect of even of who be of wholly different politics still may be that although must in case believe have left property to sir cyril might not have handed over to in lifetime have not received so great service at hand why what be cyril sydney said turning upon have told nothing whatever of service rendered never saw such fellow a be for helping other people there be nothing worth speaking of cyril said much vexed mr popham smiled most people must think be very great service lord oliphant however may not tell what be although have heard detail from father in law mr goldsworthy be told in confidence in order to enlighten a to relation between mr harvey sir cyril a relate to painful family matter be bound to preserve absolute silence will be content to wait cyril till get to myself be peculiarity of sir cyril shenstone mr popham that go through life doing sort of service for sort of people may not know that saved life of three sister in fire at mansion in savoy also performed trifling service of saving prince rupert ship life of on board among whom be from dutch fire ship in battle of lowestoft be insignificant affair that must not think while to allude to even if knew for twenty year know lord oliphant mr popham cyril laughed must be aware that custom be to make mountain out of molehill let sit down to dinner suppose be forethought mr popham have to thank for having warned to make provision have thought that must be lucky if resource of establishment sufficed to furnish with meal of bread cheese sent on few thing with messenger yesterday evening sir cyril for hare wild duck methinks have to thank tenant who doubtless guessed that addition to larder must be welcome have doubt that good landlord a mr harvey be be really delighted to have among again a know eastern county be stronghold of puritanism that feeling be still held by majority be only among tenant of many gentleman who like father be devoted royalist that there be very strong feeling other way a heard from lip most of older tenant fought under sir aubrey while father of younger one fell under banner consequently be galling to that one of altogether opposite politics must be landlord although in other respect have reason to like be a be symbol of defeat suppose viewed good deal a saxon of old time regarded norman lord can quite understand mr popham feeling have worked in favour sir cyril lawyer went on may perhaps be relic of feudalism there can be doubt that there exists in mind of english country folk feeling of respect of something like affection for landlord when men of old family that feeling be never transferred to new men who may take place mr harvey be in eye new man wealthy one doubt owing wealth to own exertion must never have excited among same feeling a gave to family who have for several hundred year be owner of soil cyril remained for fortnight at upmead calling on tenant interesting in family day after arrival rode into norwich paid visit to mr harvey have in compliance to wish written short letter of acknowledgment of restitution of estate now expressed deep feeling of gratitude that entertained have only done what be right mr harvey said quietly must rather not be thanked for feeling be natural have therefore not checked word be assuredly god be doing in so strangely bringing together making instrument in saving life so awakening uneasy conscience into activity have have small pleasure from upmead have house here be more than sufficient for want have hope respect of townsfellows affection of workman at upmead be always uncomfortable such of county gentleman who retained estate looked askance at tenant knew though doffed hat a passed regarded a usurper have taste for sport pleasure of country life being born bred townsman ill doing of son cast gloom over life of late have lived chiefly here with society of friend of own religious political feeling therefore have made sacrifice in resigning tenancy of upmead pray say further word of gratitude have heard from one who be there yesterday how generously spoke of to tenant thank for so doing for be pleasant for to stand well in thought of whose welfare have have at heart trust mr harvey be in good health cyril said be far from well cyril event of night in london have told heavily upon a be not wonderful for have suffered much sorrow for year last blow have broken sorely mourns a david mourned over death of absalom over wickedness of son be quite a one with in measure have taken concerning save at earnest prayer have made provision for will keep from absolute want will leave excuse to urge that be driven by poverty into crime mr goldsworthy have not yet discovered mean of communicating with when doe so will notify that have instruction to pay to fifteen pound on first of month that offer of assistance to pay passage to america be still open to that on arriving there will receive for three year same allowance a here then if favourable report of conduct be forthcoming from magistrate deacon of town where take up residence correspondent of mr goldsworthy will be authorised to expend four thousand pound on purchase of estate for to hand to thousand for due working maintenance of same for purpose have already made provision in will with proviso that if at end of five year after death news of will be obtained money set aside for purpose will revert to main provision of will may be that died of plague may be that have fallen will fall victim to own evil course evil passion be convinced must be alive mr goldsworthy will be able to obtain tidings of long before five year have expired now said abruptly changing subject what be thinking of doing sir cyril in first place sir be going to sea again with fleet very shortly entered a volunteer for war must not well even if wished draw back be stiff necked people mr harvey said that sovereign of europe must have viewed with displeasure overthrow of monarchy here be natural enough in holland if anywhere might have looked for sympathy seeing that a have battled for freedom of conscience so have done here yet be worst enemy again again have blake to sail forth to chastise say that monk be to command time believe so sir monk be bruised reed pierced hand be good fighter after war be over sir cyril will not trust waste life in court of profligate king certainly not cyril said earnestly a soon a war be over will return to upmead take up residence there have lived too hard life to care for gaiety of court still le of court like of king charles will travel for while in europe if there be genuine peace have lost opportunity of completing education be too old now to go to of university not too old perhaps have seen too much of hard side of life to care to pas three year among who older than be still a boy in feeling next best thing therefore a seems to must be to travel perhaps to spend year two in one of great university abroad matter be worth thinking over mr harvey said be assuredly young yet to settle down alone at upmead will reap much advantage from speaking french be everywhere current may greatly aid in making travel useful to have fear of falling into popish error sir cyril if wish have weight with must pray to choose school of leyden haarlem must enter foreign university for turn out learned men good divine certainly wish have weight with mr harvey must event so turn out that can enter one of foreign university will be one of name be must after war be ended come into peaceful relation with dutch before leaving earl cyril have promised faithfully that must return thither with sydney accordingly at end of fortnight rode back with there three week later journeyed up to london with earl family be middle of march when reached london court have come up day two before fleet be a cyril learnt being fitted out in great haste french have now after hesitating through winter declared war against be certain that must have fleet a well a of dutch to cope with calling upon prince rupert on day arrived cyril learnt that fleet must assuredly put to sea in month time must rather join at once wait until go on board prince asked must rather join at once sir have business to do in london must be of use for to take apartment when be to leave so soon therefore if can be of use must gladly join at once must be of use on board prince said assuredly must be of use in carrying message letting know frequently from own report how matter be going on heard yesterday that fan fan be now fitted out will take command of will give letter to boatswain who be at present in charge saying have placed wholly under order will of course live on board will be chiefly at chatham sheerness if call early to

of thing lacking then twice week will sail up to town report to must there be special news at other time send to by mounted messenger mr pepys secretary be diligent hard working man can not see to everything albemarle so push that think white squadron doe not get fair share of attention if can go to with report in hand may succeed in getting what be necessary done bidding farewell to earl family thanking for kindness cyril stopped that night at captain dave told of have happened since met next morning went early to prince rupert received two letter rode down to chatham then sending horse back by servant who be to take to earl stable where must be cared for until return cyril went on board fan fan for next month be occupied early late with duty cabin be small very comfortable

galley on occasion a tide suited either sailed up to london in afternoon gave report to prince late in evening be back at sheerness by daybreak sailed up at night saw prince a soon a rose returned at once prince highly commended diligence told that report be of great use to a with in hand must not be put off at admiralty with vague assurance day one more ship went out to join fleet be gathering in down on april th cyril sailed in fan fan in company with last vessel of white squadron there again took up quarter on board henrietta fan fan being anchored hard by in charge of boatswain on rd prince with duke of albemarle great company of nobleman gentleman arrived at deal came on board fleet on may st weighed anchor lord oliphant be among volunteer who came down with prince a many of other gentleman have also be on board during first voyage cyril felt that be among friend have none of feeling of strangeness isolation have before experienced party be indeed merry one for upwards of year fear of plague have weighed on england at time increased so terribly in london that thought must like black death spread over england once again population of country might be swept away great a mortality have be have be confined almost entirely to london of great town now that have died away even in there be great relief in men mind felt that have personally escaped from terrible imminent danger that be about to face peril even greater than from have escaped did not weigh on spirit of gentleman on board prince rupert ship to be killed fighting for country be honourable death that none feared while there have be in mind of even bravest horror of death by plague with ghastly accompaniment sailing out to sea to down then felt that past year event lay behind a evil dream laughed jested sang with light hearted mirth a yet dutch have not put out from port for three week fleet cruised off coast then finding that enemy must not be tempted to come out sailed back to down day after arrived there messenger came down from london with order to prince rupert to sail at once with white squadron to engage french fleet be reported to be on point of putting to sea prince have very little belief that french really intended to fight hitherto although have be liberal in promise to dutch have done nothing to aid general opinion be that france rejoiced at seeing rival damage other have idea of risking ship men in struggle believe gentleman prince rupert said to officer that be ruse on part of louis to aid dutch ally by getting part of fleet out of way still have nothing to do to obey order though fear be fool errand on be sent wind be from north east be blowing fresh gale prince prepared to put to sea while men be heaving at anchor message came to cyril prince rupert wished to speak to in cabin sir cyril be going to restore to command wind be so strong sea will be so heavy must not risk yacht life of men by sending down channel think there be chance of meeting french believe that be here that battle will be fought for with wind dutch can be here in few hour doubt not that a soon a learn that one of squadron have sailed away will be out fan fan will sail with will run into dover a pas here be letter have written ordering to do so authorising to put out join admiral fleet must dutch attack before return if like to have young lord oliphant with can go must go a volunteer under be captain of fan fan have be so for last two month therefore although friend be older than be must if choose to go be content to serve under stay will put to touched bell ordered sydney to be sent for lord oliphant said know that sir cyril be great friend consider that fan fan of have for time be commander be fit to keep sea in gale like have therefore ordered to take into dover if dutch come out to fight admiral a think will will join fleet although fan fan can take small share in fighting may be useful in carrying message from duke while battle be going on seems to that a fan fan be more likely to see fighting than ship a volunteer might prefer to transfer to until again join sir cyril be younger than be if go must necessarily be under command seeing that be captain of yacht be for to choose whether will remain here go with must like to go with sir have have good deal of experience of sea while have never set foot on board ship till last year after what did at lowestoft must say that gentleman must be glad to serve under be right feeling prince rupert said warmly then get thing transferred to yacht if join be fleet sir cyril will of course report to say that directed to place under order five minute later cyril friend be on board fan fan scarcely have reached when gun be fired from prince rupert ship a signal ship of white squadron shook out sail with wind free raced down towards south foreland be to put into dover cyril said to boatswain weatherbeaten old sailor lord be praised for sir be tight little craft there will be heavy sea on a soon be beyond shelter of sand with two gun on board of will make bad weather besides in wind like ai pleasant being in little craft in middle of lot of big one for if be not swamped by sea might very well be run down have better keep close to point yer honour then run along under shelter of cliff into dover water will be pretty smooth in there though have best carry a little sail a can for gust will come down from above fit to take mast out of be awfully glad came with sydney cyril said a took place with friend near helmsman wish prince have put in command of course be only nominal thing for boatswain be really captain in everything that concern making sail giving order to crew still must have be much nicer other way see that must cyril sydney laughed for know a much more about handling boat like than do a boatswain doe than have be on board night day for more than month even if knew nothing about at prince rupert must have be right to choose a recognition of great service last time think anything about be friend doe not matter fig be nominal commander be delighted to come not only to be with because will be very great deal pleasanter being own master on board pretty little yacht than being officer on board henrietta where must have be only in way except when went into action a soon a rounded point most of sail be taken off fan fan even under small canvas carried lay over until lee rail be almost under water when heavy squall swooped down on from cliff rest of squadron be keeping distance out presenting fine sight a ship lay over sending spray flying high into air from bluff bow plunging deeply into wave yes be very distinctly better being where be lord oliphant said a gazed at be beginning to feel qualmish before got under shelter of point by time if have be on board henrietta must have be prostrate must have have know not how long misery before quarter of hour later be snugly moored in dover harbour for twenty four hour gale continued wind then fell somewhat continued to blow strongly from same quarter two day later veered round to south west shortly afterwards english fleet must be seen coming out past point a soon a did so headed eastward be going out to meet dutch sydney said a watched ship from cliff news must have arrived that fleet have put out to sea then may a well be off after sydney will sail faster than will in wind for be blowing too strongly for to carry much sail hurried on board quarter of hour later fan fan put out from harbour change of wind have caused ugly cross sea yacht made bad weather of wave constantly washing over deck before be off calais have overtaken of slower sailers of fleet sea be le violent a held on for be now to extent sheltered by coast in short time cyril ran down into cabin where sydney be lying ill admiral have given signal to anchor leading ship be already bringing up will choose berth a near shore a can with light draught can lie well inside of others will be in comparatively smooth water before dusk fleet be at anchor with exception of two three of fastest frigate be sent on to endeavour to obtain news of enemy chapter xx fight off dunkirk a soon a fan fan have be brought to anchor boat be lowered cyril be rowed on board admiral ship albemarle be on poop cyril made report to very well sir duke said dare say will be able to make of use keep craft close to when sail seem to know face be sir cyril shenstone lord duke have honour of meeting first at fire in savoy prince rupert afterwards be good enough to present to yes yes remember be who saved henrietta from fire ship at lowestoft have begun well indeed young sir be like to have further opportunity of showing bravery cyril bowed then going down side to boat returned to fan fan be lying in almost smooth water sydney have come up on deck again heard news of dutch suppose cyril asked young officer a left ship said that so far a knew nothing have be heard of news have come in before admiral sailed from down that everything be ready for sea that order be expected hour for to put out be rather to be hoped that wo put out for two day sydney said will give prince time to rejoin with squadron wind be favourable now for return must think a soon a hear in london that dutch be on point of putting out albemarle have sailed will send order to join at once have only about sixty sail while say that dutch have over ninety be too heavy odds against to be pleasant must think duke will not fight till prince come up think will wait for if find dutch near say that be over confident apt to despise dutch too much anyhow be a brave a lion though might not attack unless dutch begin feel sure will not run away from next morning early bristol frigate be seen returning from east have to beat way back in teeth of wind when still mile away puff of white smoke be seen to dart out from side presently boom of heavy gun be heard again again fired signal be understood to be notification that have seen dutch signal for captain of men of war to come on board be at once run up to mast head of flagship followed by for fleet to be prepared to weigh anchor captain bacon of bristol went on board a soon a ship came up in short time boat be seen to put off a captain reached respective ship signal to weigh anchor be hoisted be hailed with burst of cheering throughout fleet felt that signified that must soon meet dutch fan fan be under sail long before men of war have got up heavy anchor sailing out tacked backwards forward until fleet be under sail when cyril told boatswain to place within few cable length of flagship on weather quarter after two hour sail dutch fleet be made out anchored off dunkirk blue squadron under sir william berkley led way red squadron under duke following will put man in chain with lead boatswain said to cyril there be very bad sand off dunkirk though might get over in safety big ship must take ground if did so must be in bad plight indeed in case have best slack out sheet little take up post on weather bow of admiral so that can signal to if find water failing topsail be hoisted fan fan be very fast craft in comparatively smooth water ran past admiral flagship will order back grace captain asked angrily albemarle looked at fan fan attentively have got man sounding said be wise precaution young fellow in command know what be doing ought to have be taking same care see be taking down topsail again set officer to watch yacht if signal go about at once sounding continued for short time at six fathom when suddenly man at lead called out sharply three fathom cyril ran to flagstaff a next cry came two fathom hauled down flag stood waving cap while boatswain who have gone to tiller at once pushed over to starboard brought yacht up into wind cyril heard order shouted on board flagship saw stern sweeping round moment later sail be aback men who already clustered round gun be not quick enough in hauling yard across to dismay saw main topmast bend then go over side with crash be confusion on board for time seemed a if other topmast must also go run alongside within hailing distance cyril said to boatswain will want to question a came alongside flagship duke leant over side what water have when came about sir went suddenly from six fathom to three grace cyril shouted moment after found two very well sir duke called back in case have certainly saved ship thought perhaps that have be over hasty have thus cost topmast see be not so thank pilot assured there be plenty of water on course be taking ship of red squadron have changed course on seeing flagship come about so suddenly considerable delay confusion be caused before again formed in order in obedience to duke signal followed in support of blue squadron have already dashed into midst of dutch fleet who be in confusion for so sudden have be attack that have be forced to cut cable having time to get up anchor british ship poured in broadside a approached while dutch opened tremendous cannonade besides great inferiority in number british be under serious disadvantage have weather gauge wind be so strong that heeled over so that be unable to open lower port be therefore deprived of use of heaviest gun four of ship of red squadron remained by flagship to protect if attacked to keep off fire ship while crew laboured to get up topmast more than three hour be occupied in operation so busily did rest of fleet keep dutch at work that be unable to detach sufficient ship to attack a soon a topmast be in place sail hoisted flagship consort hastened to join hard pressed comrade fight be indeed desperate one sir william berkley ship swiftsure second rate be taken a be essex third rate henry commanded by sir john harman be surrounded by foe sail rigging be shot to piece so be completely disabled dutch admiral cornelius evertz summoned sir john harman to surrender have not come to yet sir john shouted back continued to pour such heavy broadside into dutch that several of ship be greatly damaged evertz killed dutch captain drew off vessel launched three fire ship at henry first one coming up on starboard quarter grappled with dense volume of smoke rising from prevented sailor from discovering where grapnel be fixed flame be spreading to when boatswain gallantly leapt on board fire ship by light of flame discovered grapnel threw overboard succeeded in regaining ship moment later second fire ship came up on port side so great body of flame swept across henry that chaplain fifty men sprang overboard sir john however drew sword threatened to cut down first man who refused to obey order rest of crew setting manfully to work succeeded in extinguishing flame in getting free of fire ship halliard of main yard be however burnt through spar fell striking sir john harman to deck breaking leg third fire ship be received with fire of four cannon loaded with chain shot brought mast down drifted by clear of henry be brought safely into fight continued whole day did not terminate until ten o'clock in evening night be spent in repairing damage in morning english recommenced battle be again obstinately contested admiral van tromp threw into midst of british line suffered so heavily that be only saved by arrival of admiral de ruyter in turn be in most perilous position ship disabled when fresh reinforcement arrived so battle raged until in afternoon a if by mutual consent fleet drew off from other battle ceased fighting have be extraordinarily obstinate determined on side many ship have be sunk several burnt captured sea be dotted with wreckage mast spar fragment of boat debris of kind fleet presented pitiable appearance hull forty eight hour ago so trim smooth be splintered jagged port hole be knocked into one bulwark carried away stern gallery gone sail be riddled with shot hole many of ship have lost one more mast while light spar have be in most case carried away many of yard have come down owing to destruction of running gear in so tremendous conflict little fan fan must bear small part cyril lord oliphant agreed at commencement of first day fight that must be useless for to attempt to fire two little gun that effort must be entirely directed against enemy fire ship during day battle then hovered round flagship getting out of way whenever be engaged a often be on broadside although once twice struck by stray shot fan fan received serious damage in encounter of giant little yacht be entirely overlooked none of great ship wasted shot upon two three time day when admiral ship have beaten off foe fire ship directed course against then came fan fan turn for action under pressure of twelve oar sped towards fire ship on reaching grapnel be thrown over end of bowsprit by effort of rower course be changed so that swept harmlessly past flagship twice when vessel be coming down before wind at rate of speed rendered evident that effort of men at oar must be insufficient to turn course fan fan be steered alongside grapnel be thrown headed by lord oliphant cyril crew sprang on board cut down drove overboard few men who be in charge of then taking helm trimming sail directed against one of dutch men of war threw grapnel on board lighted train leapt back into fan fan rowed away took up place near admiral little craft being greeted with hearty cheer by whole ship company afternoon be spent in repairing damage a far a practicable even duke saw be impossible to continue fight dutch have received reinforcement while fighting be going on morning although english have inflicted terrible damage upon dutch fleet own loss in ship be greater than have caused adversary considerable portion of vessel be not in condition to renew battle carpenter have hard work to save from sinking outright albemarle embarked on fan fan sailed from ship to ship ascertaining condition of loss crew have suffered a soon a night fell vessel most disabled be ordered to sail for england a best must crew of three be totally dismasted must hardly be kept afloat be taken out divided between twenty eight vessel alone remained in condition to renew fight three battered hulk be early next morning set on fire rest of fleet in good order prepared to give battle followed companion have sailed on previous evening dutch followed at distance thinking to repair damage still farther before again engaged in afternoon sail of squadron be seen ahead loud cheer ran from ship to ship for knew that be prince rupert coming up with white squadron serious loss however occurred few minute afterwards royal prince largest most powerful vessel in fleet be somewhat in rear of line struck on sand tide being with wind light rest of fleet tried in vain to return to assistance a dutch fleet be fast coming up of fire ship making for royal prince be forced to give up attempt to succour sir george ayscue captain be obliged to haul down flag surrender a soon a white squadron joined remnant of fleet whole advanced against dutch drum beating trumpet sounding twice made way through enemy line be now growing dark third day battle came to end next morning be seen that dutch although considerably stronger than english be almost out of sight latter at once hoisted sail pursued at eight o'clock came up with dutch finding combat inevitable terrible fight be renewed raged without intermission until seven in evening five time british passed through line of dutch on side many ship fell out of fighting line wholly disabled several be sunk on side forced to surrender being so battered a to be unable to withdraw from struggle prince rupert ship be wholly disabled that of albemarle almost a severely damaged battle like of preceding day ended without decided advantage on side nation claimed victory equally without reason dutch historian compute loss at sixteen men of war of ten be sunk six taken while admitted only loss of nine ship claimed that dutch lost fifteen men of war party acknowledged that be most terrible battle fought in other modern war de witte who at time be at head of dutch republic who be bitter enemy of english owned time afterwards to sir william temple that english got more glory to nation through invincible courage of seaman during engagement than by two victory of war that be sure that own fleet must not have be brought on to fight fifth day after disadvantage of fourth believed that other nation be capable of english cyril took part in last day engagement for prince rupert when fan fan came near on arrival on previous evening returned salute from poop shouted to that on account be to adventure into fight with fan fan on morning after battle ended lord oliphant cyril rowed on board prince rupert ship where unwounded man be hard at work getting up jury mast patching up hole in hull well sir cyril see that have be getting yacht knocked about said a came up to there be not much damage done sir have two shot hole in hull new mainsail spoiled do know sir that got severe rating from duke yesterday evening on account cyril looked surprised trust sir have not in way disobeyed order be not that asked after fan fan said that have seen nothing of her during day fighting said have strictly ordered not to come into battle replied did wrong prince for little yacht of yours did be service during first two day fighting told sir cyril to keep near thinking that must be useful in carrying order during two day kept close to save when be surrounded by enemy five time in three day did avert fire ship from be so damaged that must sail slowly thinking altogether unmanageable dutch launched fire ship fan fan rowed to meet three of be diverted from course by rope being thrown over bowsprit crew rowing so a to turn head on second day there be more wind fire ship must have held on course in spite of effort of men on board fan fan twice during day little boat be boldly laid alongside while crew boarded captured then directing towards dutch ship grappled set on fire one of dutchman be burned other managed to throw off grapnel be done under eye five time in two day did crew cheer little yacht a came alongside so see prince by ordering out of fight deprived of assistance of a boldly handled little craft a ever sailed ' be quite proud of little yacht gentleman thank for having given so good christening under fire must stay no longer talking here be despatch have written of share of engagement sir cyril will deliver will now row to duke ship will give despatch lord oliphant will deliver need not say that be to make haste to thames have ship to spare except fan fan for must keep few be still able to manoeuvre in case dutch must come out again before have got crippled one in state to make sail ' taking leave of prince be at once rowed to duke flagship have short interview with admiral who praised highly for service have rendered will have to tell story of fighting said for prince have written few line have too many matter on mind to do scribe work will have heard ere now of first two day fighting for of ship be sent back will have arrived at harwich before by to morrow morning hope to have fleet so far refitted a to be able to follow five minute later fan fan with stitch of sail set be on way to thames a brisk wind be blowing arrived in london twenty four hour later at once proceeded to admiralty despatch being addressed to duke of york be immediately ushered in to without word seized despatch tore open ran eye down god be praised exclaimed when finished have feared even worse intelligence have be in terrible state of anxiety since yesterday when heard from harwich that one of ship have come in with news that more than fleet be crippled destroyed that twenty eight only remained capable of continuing battle only hope be that white squadron might arrive in time seems that have done so account of loss be indeed terrible one at least have suffered defeat a dutch have retreated must have suffered well nigh a much a have done come along with at once gentleman must go to king to inform of great news be vastly beyond what must have hoped for duke in despatch tell that bearer of lord oliphant sir cyril shenstone have done very great service having in prince rupert little yacht saved flagship le than five time from attack of dutch fire ship duke have ordered carriage to be in readiness a soon a learnt that bearer of despatch from fleet have arrived be already at door taking seat in with lord oliphant cyril opposite to be driven to palace learning by way such detail a must give of last two day fighting led at once to king dressing room charles be already attired for have passed sleepless night have risen early what news james asked eagerly good news brother after two more day fighting terrible fighting on side dutch fleet have returned to port victory king exclaimed in delight dearly bought one with life of so many brave men victory nevertheless here be despatch from albemarle rupert have be brought by gentleman with whom be already acquainted in rupert yacht albemarle speaks very highly of conduct king took despatch read eagerly have indeed be dearly bought victory said be marvellous indeed how captain men bore never have shown greater courage endurance well may monk say that after four day of incessant fighting four night spent in labour of repairing damage strength of have well nigh come to end that can write few line to tell of what have happened leaving detail for further occasion thank gentleman for speed with have brought welcome news for service of duke of albemarle speaks so warmly be second time sir cyril that admiral have have occasion to speak of great honourable service rendered by lord oliphant earl father will have reason to be proud when hears so highly praised now gentleman tell more fully than be done in despatch a to incident of fighting have heard something of what took place in first two day from officer who posted up from harwich yesterday lord oliphant related event of first two day then went on of last two can say le majesty for took part in having prince rupert order given a came up that must not adventure into fight therefore be spectator though kept on edge of fight if opportunity have offered have seen one of ship too hard pressed threatened by fire ship must have ventured so far to transgress order a to bear in do what must on behalf indeed smoke be so great that must see little be strange sight when on prince arrival ship of duke battered a be bore down on dutch line drum beating trumpet sounding crew cheering loudly saw disappear into dutch line then smoke shut out from view for hour there be thick cloud of smoke continuous roar of gun sometimes vessel must come out from curtain of smoke torn disabled sometimes be dutchman sometimes one of own ship if latter rowed up to did best with plank nail to stop yawning hole close to water line while crew knotted rope got up spar yard then sailed back into fight first day fighting be comparatively slight for dutch seemed to be afraid to close with duke ship hung behind at distance be not till white squadron came up duke turned with prince rupert fell upon pursuer like wounded boar upon dog that battle commenced in earnest last day went on for nigh twelve hour without intermission when at last roar of gun ceased smoke slowly cleared off be truly pitiful sight so torn disabled be ship a two fleet separated drifting apart a must almost seem so few be sail now set rowed up among for hour be occupied in picking up men clinging to broken spar wreckage for few of ship have so much a single boat left be fortunate enough to save well nigh hundred of whom more than seventy be own men remainder dutch from last learnt that ship of van tromp ruyter have be so disabled that have be forced to fall out of battle have be towed away to port said that admiral cornelius evertz van der hulst have be killed while on side learnt that admiral sir christopher ming have fallen did dutch fleet appear to be a much injured a own majesty judging by sail set when battle be over must have be in better condition than ours be not surprising seeing how superior be in force for most part bigger ship carrying more gun then will have hand full james will be ready to take to sea again before be next time hope that will meet with more equal number will do best can brother duke replied though have so many ship sorely disabled there have be few lost can supply place with vessel have be building with haste if dutch will give two month time warrant that will be able to meet in good force a soon a audience be over cyril friend returned to fan fan after giving crew few hour for sleep sailed down to sheerness where shortly afterwards prince rupert arrived with portion of fleet rest having be ordered to harwich portsmouth other port so that must be more speedily refitted although work went on almost without intermission day night repair be not completed before news arrived that dutch fleet have again put to sea two day later arrived off coast where finding fleet ready to meet sailed away to france where hoped to be joined by french ally two day later however ship began to assemble at mouth of thames on june th whole fleet be ready to take to sea consisted of eighty men of war large small nineteen fire ship prince rupert be in command of red squadron duke of albemarle sailed with on board same ship sir thomas allen be admiral of white sir jeremiah smith of blue squadron cyril remained on board fan fan lord oliphant returning to duty on board flagship marvel have be effected by zeal energy of crew dockyard men three week back english ship have for most part be crippled seemingly almost beyond repair now with hole patched with new spar in glory of fresh paint new canvas made a brave show a when have sailed out from down month previously be anchored off nore when late in evening news came out from sheerness that mounted messenger have just ridden in from dover that dutch fleet have in afternoon passed town have rounded south foreland steering north order be at once issued that fleet must sail at daybreak at three o'clock next morning be on way down river at ten o'clock dutch fleet be seen off north foreland according to own account numbered eighty eight men of war with twenty five fire ship be also divided into three squadron under de ruyter john evertz van tromp engagement began at noon by attack by white squadron upon commanded by evertz hour later prince rupert duke with red squadron fell upon de ruyter while of van tromp be at distance from others be engaged by sir jeremiah smith with blue squadron sir thomas allen completely defeated opponent killing evertz vice rear admiral capturing vice admiral of zeeland who be with burning ship of fifty gun red squadron be evenly matched by of de ruyter vessel laid alongside adversary although de ruyter vice admiral van ness fought obstinately ship in general commanded for most part by men chosen for family influence rather than for seamanship courage behaved badly seven gradually withdrew from fight went off under sail de ruyter finding thus deserted be forced also to draw off during time van tromp whose squadron be strongest of three dutch division be so furiously engaged by blue squadron be weakest of english division that be unable to come to assistance of consort when however saw defeat of rest of dutch fleet too be obliged to draw off lest must have whole of english down upon be able more easily to do so a darkness be closing in when battle ended dutch continued retreat during night followed at distance by red squadron be next morning on point of overtaking when dutch sought refuge by steering into willow light draught enabled to cross while deeper english ship be unable to follow great be wrath disappointment of english when saw thus baulked of reaping full benefit of victory prince rupert shouted to cyril who in fan fan have taken small share in engagement a fire ship have not played conspicuous part in sir cyril can go farther do pursue de ruyter show in what contempt hold cyril lifted hat to show that heard understood order then ordered men to get out oar for wind be very light amidst loud cheering mingled with laughter from crew of vessel be near enough to hear prince rupert order fan fan rowed out from english line in pursuit of dutch chapter xxi london in flame sailor laughed joked a rowed away from fleet old boatswain shook head will have to be careful sir cyril said be like small cur barking at heel of bull be good fun enough for bit when bull turn perchance dog will find thrown high in air cyril nodded considered prince rupert order to be beyond reason given only in heat of anger at de ruyter having thus escaped felt that be very likely to cost life of on board fan fan however there be nothing to do to carry out seemed to that boatswain simile be very apt one that although spectacle of fan fan worrying great dutch battle ship might be amusing one to english spectator be likely to be very serious adventure for de ruyter ship be in rear of other dutch vessel be mile distant when fan fan started a wind be so light that scarce filled sail yacht approached rapidly be within mile now honour boatswain said must say have better go nearer if want to be blown out of water yes think may a well stop rowing now get gun to work there be only two cannon in stern port can touch here will scarcely come up in wind to give broadside be moving so slowly through water that must take long time to come round de ruyter must feel ashamed to bring great flag ship round to crush tiny foe boatswain went forward to gun round men after laying in oar clustered in great glee now said have got to make two gun in stern mark try send shot through port hole will be waste to fire at hull for ball must not penetrate thick timber that be built of remember straighter aim more chance there be that dutch wo hit men stop to aim very straight when be expecting shot among second will fire alternately one gun be not to fire until other be loaded again will lay first gun be good shot crew cheered a saw splinter fly at edge of port hole shot after shot be fired with varying success dutch made reply seemed to ignore presence of tiny foe crew be for most part busy aloft repairing damage after hour firing without eliciting reply boatswain went aft to cyril suggested that must now aim at spar lucky shot might do good deal of damage sir said weather be fine enough at present there be saying when change may come if must weaken one of main spar might be mean of being blown ashore must wind spring up in right direction cyril assented fire be now directed at mast few rope be cut away serious damage be effected until shot struck one of halliard block of spanker sail at once ran down have taken big bit out of mast too boatswain called exultingly to cyril think will rouse dutchman up minute later be evident that shot have at least have effect two puff of smoke spirted out from stern of dutch flagship simultaneously with roar of gun came hum of two heavy shot flying overhead delighted at having excited dutchman wrath at last crew of fan fan took off hat gave loud cheer then more earnestly than before settled down to work gun aimed now a at first at port hole four five shot be discharged from of little gun before dutch be ready again then came thundering report fan fan topmast be carried away by one of shot other went wide two three men be told to cut away wreckage rest continued fire one of next shot of enemy be better directed struck deck close to foot of mast committed great havoc in cyril cabin passed out through stern below water line cyril leapt down companion a heard crash shouting to boatswain to follow water be coming through hole in great jet cyril seized pillow stuffed into shot hole being drenched from head to foot in operation one of sailor have followed boatswain cyril called to assistance get out oar at once said to boatswain shot like will go down get piece cut off spar make plug there be holding pillow in place water come in fast still sailor took cyril post while ran up on deck assisted in cutting plug be roughly shaped to size of hole then driven in stopped rush of water good deal still leaked through by time be done fan fan have considerably increased distance from de ruyter four five more shot be fired from dutch ship last of struck mast ten foot above deck bringing down with crash fortunately none of crew be hurt dropping oar hauled mast alongside cut sail from fastening to hoop gaff then severed shroud allowed mast to drift away while again settled to oar although man rowed hardest fan fan be half full of water before reached fleet be two mile astern of when first began to row well done fan fan prince rupert shouted a little craft came alongside have suffered damage besides spar see be low in water be shot through stern sir put in plug water come in still will send carpenter on board for think will float many minute longer unless get hole better stopped prince gave order to officer standing by latter called two three sailor bade bring short length of thick hawser while strong party be set to reeve tackle to mainyard a soon a hawser thirty foot in length be brought be dropped on to deck of fan fan officer told crew to pas under one near end to knot hawser by time be done two strong tackle be lowered fixed to hawser crew ordered to come up on to ship tackle be then manned hauled on by strong party fan fan be gradually raised boatswain went below again knocked out plug a little yacht be hoisted up water ran out of a soon a hole be above water level tackle at bow be gradually slackened off until lay with fore part in water came distance up deck carpenter then slung over stern nailed first piece of tarred canvas then square of plank over hole then stern tackle be eased off fan fan floated on level keel crew went down to again in hour pumped free of water by time result of victory be known on english side resolution be only ship lost having be burnt by dutch fire ship three english captain about three hundred men be killed on other hand dutch lost twenty ship four admiral great many of captain four thousand men be indeed greatest most complete victory gained throughout war many of british ship have suffered good deal carried duke flag most of for have be so battered in fight with de ruyter that duke prince rupert have be obliged to leave to hoist flag upon man of war next morning fleet sailed to schonevelt be usual rendezvous of dutch fleet there remained time altogether undisturbed by enemy fan fan be here thoroughly repaired on july th sailed for ulic where arrived on august th wind being contrary learning that there be large fleet of merchantman lying between island of ulic schelling guarded by two men of war that there be rich magazine of good on island be determined to attack four small frigate of slight draught of water five fire ship be selected for attack together with boat of fleet manned by nine hundred men on evening of th cyril be ordered to go in fan fan to reconnoitre position of dutch did not sail until after on reaching passage between island lowered sail got out oar drifted with tide silently down through dutch merchant fleet where watch seemed to be kept in morning carried news to sir robert commander of expedition who have anchored league from entrance cyril have sounded passage a went through be found that two of frigate must not enter be left at anchorage on arriving at mouth of harbour tiger sir robert holmes flagship be also obliged to anchor came on board fan fan on hoisted flag captain of other ship came on board be arranged that pembroke have small draught of water must enter at once with five fire ship attack be completely successful two of fire ship grappled with men of war burnt while three great merchantman be destroyed by others then boat dashed into fleet with exception of four five merchantman four privateer who took refuge in creek defended by battery whole of hundred seventy merchantman smallest of be not le than ton burden heavily laden be burned next day sir robert holmes landed eleven company of troop on island of schonevelt burnt bandaris principal town with magazine store house causing loss to dutch according to own admission of six million guilder loss of great fleet inflicted very heavy blow upon commerce of holland fan fan have be hit again by shot from one of battery on rejoining fleet prince rupert determined to send to england so that must be thoroughly repaired fitted out again cyril order be to take to chatham to hand over to dockyard authority think dutch will come out fight again autumn sir cyril so can take ease in london a plea be now halfway through august will probably be at least month after arrival before fan fan be fit for sea again may be good deal longer than for be busy upon repair of ship sent home after battle will hardly take hand off to put on to fan fan in october will be coming home again so that until next spring be hardly likely that there will be aught doing cyril accordingly returned to london wind be contrary be not until last day of august that dropped anchor in medway after spending night at chatham posted up to london next morning finding convenient chamber in savoy installed there then proceeded to house of earl of wisbech to whom be bearer of letter from son finding that earl family be down at place near sevenoaks went into city spent evening at captain dave having ordered servant to pack small valise bring with two horse in morning have gone to bed hour when be awoke by john wilkes knocking at door there be great fire burning not far off sir cyril man who ran past told be in pudding lane at top of fish street captain be getting up be going out to see for with such dry weather a have be having there be saying how far may go cyril sprang out of bed dressed captain dave accustomed to slip on clothes in hurry be waiting for with john wilkes sallied out there be broad glare of light in sky bell of many of church be ringing out fire alarm a passed many people put head out from window asked where fire be in five minute approached scene dozen house be blazing fiercely while from near inhabitant be busily removing valuable fire company with bucket be already at work line of men be formed down to river be passing along bucket from hand to hand well nigh water be spilt however before arrived at fire in face of such body of flame seemed to make impression whatever might a well attempt to pump out leaky ship with child squirt captain said fire will burn out must pray heaven that wind drop altogether 't be not strong will suffice to carry flame across narrow street be lucky that be from east so there be little fear that will travel in direction learnt that fire have begun in house of faryner king baker though none knew how have got alight be not long before flame leapt across lane five six house catching fire almost at same moment cry of dismay broke from crowd fright of neighbour increased half clad woman hurried from house carrying babe dragging younger child out men staggered along with trunk of clothing valuable many wrung hand helplessly while city watch guarded street leading to pudding lane so a to prevent thief vagabond from taking advantage of confusion to plunder with great rapidity flame spread from house to house portion of fish street be already invaded church of st magnus in danger fear of people increased in proportion to advance of conflagration whole neighbourhood be now alarmed in street round people be beginning to remove good river seemed to be regarded by a safest place of refuge boat from various landing place have already come up be doing thriving trade by taking frightened people with what good carried to lighter ship moored in river line of men passing bucket have long since broken up being too evident that effort be not of slightest avail wind have in last two hour rapidly increased in strength be carrying burning ember far wide cyril companion have after satisfying first curiosity set to work to assist fugitive by aiding to carry down good to waterside cyril be now between eighteen
