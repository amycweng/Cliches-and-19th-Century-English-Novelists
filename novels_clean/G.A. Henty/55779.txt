young for acted a agent also bought for good in dealt outside business told when be taken suddenly ill that have about thousand pound of money in hand must be of use to now must very much prefer not to touch until be old enough to set up in trade position be certainly grave one angus agree with that must be better for on account to remain out here at rate for time father have correspondent also in bombay have not yes made purchase of persian good for house there did not do much for a trade be principally in hand of parsee there be one thing might do armenian said after thinking for time have heard that mr m'neill be on way to teheran a british minister there might be able to obtain post in embassy can write persian arabic might be useful in many way must not be necessary for to ask large salary however small might lead way to better thing at present there be much political disturbance shah be meditating attack upon herat have already given order for army to be collected certainly british government will feel jealous of movement must extend power of persia farther towards afghanistan especially a be hear about to take step to interfere in country by placing rival of dost mahomed on throne then too be secret that russia be encouraging shah be probable that russian influence will become predominant in persia conquest of herat must matter little to england be by persia alone for persia be powerless to damage india with persia acting a tool of russia day other will assuredly swallow up matter be very much more serious being so there can be little doubt that new british minister will be charged with mission to counteract design of russia a much a possible might be glad to take into employment one who know language well must gather news for in guise of native for there be so many dialect spoken in different part of country that imperfection of speech must pas unnoticed think must be excellent plan sir if must be carried out will give letter stating circumstance speaking of esteem in father be held vouching for character if decide to take course think must be well for to leave at once for from what hear of new minister course must then arrive at teheran within two three day of getting there might have better chance therefore of obtaining post in office a to money speak of seems to that a country be long way off must be better if must be sent to house with father have dealing at bombay since there be constantly vessel sailing thither from port in persian gulf whether saw opportunity for doing trade with india thought of going there must be advantage to have money ready to hand must already know good deal of trade matter having a know worked a father assistant for past two year at rate year two at teheran in service of british minister must be advantage to in many respect there be caravan starting to morrow be why suggested that must leave at once merchant who travel with be friend of mine can recommend to care must certainly be best for to travel a native thank sir very heartily will certainly do a advise for a english lad going alone with caravan must scarcely hope to escape trouble with camel driver others if fail to obtain employment at embassy will probably travel down with caravan to bushire take ship to bombay have plenty of money to do for expense of travelling with caravan be very small nothing be needed except for food passage in native craft must not be more than pound two have nearly two hundred so must live for long time in bombay if failed to obtain employment there when be gone must at least enlist in one of british regiment be poor trade soldiering lad though in case might not do harm for few year especially if turned attention to learning of indian language with such knowledge must certainly have difficulty in making way with little capital will receive from home so be settled angus travelled to teheran journey did good have bought donkey trotting along by side of merchant to whom friend have introduced novelty of life strangeness of passing a native among traveller conversation of persian merchant kept from brooding over sorrow felt that suddenly thrown a be upon own resource compelled to think act for when fortnight before have others to think care for must bear like man be only at night when rolled in blanket prepared to sleep that gave way lay for hour weeping

upon trade for that wish to return to scotland sir have be away for four year be to go back must lose advantage have gained in learning eastern language quite right very sensibly decided minister said suppose that know something of trade yes sir father took much pain in instructing for past two year have acted a assistant have learned value of most article of trade minister nodded very good will doubtless be of value to hereafter however can at present utilize service here have with secretary have dragoman employed by predecessor who speaks dozen language in many way sharp young fellow like able if necessary to mix with people a one of to gather information a to popular opinion who can read write persian fluently must be welcome addition to staff of course can not offer high pay a have allowance for expense of office upon same scale a of predecessor pay be quite secondary matter with sir even if there be pay must be glad to accept temporary post under a must be great advantage to afterwards to have be employed by must at least have time to decide what to do next will think matter over minister said at rate there will be room assigned to in house for present thirty shilling

others of le importance be first interviewed by secretary people coming in with complaint petition be shown in to angus who took down what have to say then dismissed to call next day for answer be amused at general impression prevailing among people if british minister must be induced to take up case must obtain justice redress for how evidently disbelieved assurance that foreign official must not interfere in such matter six month passed shah have started with army towards herat evidence russia be at bottom of movement that be acting in accordance with advice became stronger stronger angus stood high in minister good opinion from steadiness with worked tact good temper that showed with native interviewed willingness with must after office be closed work until late at night at translation sometimes changed attire again slightly darkening face tucking away light hair must go out into street mingle with crowd in busy quarter listen to talk from fact that expedition against herat be seldom spoken of gathered that war be not popular except among trading class who thought that possession of herat must lead to large increase of trade with afghanistan even through candahar to northern india be however seldom that went on expedition for be certain that private arrangement have be made between shah russia must be known only to two of former principal officer one evening mr m'neill summoned to own apartment said have obtained information from source can rely upon russia be encouraging shah that there be other russian officer besides accredited envoy in shah camp mr corbould started hour ago will carry news to london be too important to be trusted to other hand have doubt whatever that order will be sent to at once to mediate between party to put certain amount of pressure upon shah herat be considered key of afghanistan although must hing to assist defender even be force to start at once from bombay fancy must be authorized to say to shah that england must greatly resent town being permanently occupied that might even go so far a to blockade port on persian gulf so put stop to whole trade of persia with great question of course be how long herat can hold out against persian place have reputation of being strong hear that fortification be much dilapidated afghan be likely to fight well up to certain point might probably must get disheartened after time be anxious to assure that if will hold out england will do in power to induce persian to give up siege messenger send must at once be altogether trustworthy must be able to make way through country a native must have sufficient knowledge of arabic to make understood there although be le important a there must be many trader in town who understand persian if must entrust with message sir must gladly undertake to carry to herat be purpose in sending for mr campbell have greatest confidence in a persian be good enough to pas in teheran be certainly good enough for country district be not only because must trust thoroughly have faith in being able to carry out mission also because thought that must be of great utility to to be engaged in performance of such mission if herat defends successfully until relieved either by afghan troop a result of diplomacy will undoubtedly be feather in cap of gentleman select to undertake commission of encouraging heratees to hold out with report of valuable service that have rendered here might obtain for better position in diplomatic service than can offer post in india where knowledge of persian arabic must be valuable thank very much indeed sir change to active life must not only be very pleasant to can quite understand that if good come of might benefit greatly must wish to return a soon a have delivered message think must be

upon british government importance of position necessity for interfering to prevent from falling into hand of persian a to importance there be doubt especially a russia appears to be making persia cat paw in matter be why feel that while fighting for heratees who between seem to to be unmitigated ruffian be merely fighting for england for be of utmost importance that gate of india must not be in hand of persia especially if a say russian influence be dominant at teheran be sure will be delighted if will accept a assistant though see at present what possible service can be will be of use there will be end of thing to see about then burst out laughing doe seem absurd doe that two young lieutenant lad not yet seventeen must be proposing to take prominent part in defence of city like against army commanded by shah of persia in person angus joined in laugh be not ridiculous for said because a artillery officer must know great deal more about defence of town than afghan can do certainly be absurd having anything to do in pottinger went with angus to house of armenian in order that might know where to find leaving there went up to citadel stood on rising ground at one corner of town returned in hour said that wuzeer must receive at once be good deal impressed went on with fact that minister must have sent messenger here with letter at first did not see why england must be interested in matter have to explain to about russian intrigue in persia that there be doubt that sooner later must invade india that must be rendered comparatively easy by herat being in hand of friend persian enquired of what rank held told that be member of embassy acting a assistant secretary to minister a be evident by entrusting with so important despatch be deep in confidence on arriving at citadel be at once conducted to apartment of wuzeer yar mahomed rose from seat greeted politely angus walked forward bowed delivered letter speak persian excellency minister said angus have difficulty in restraining smile at new dignity said gravely yes highness speak arabic journeyed here comfortably hope yes there be few adventure on way not more than have expected yar mahomed opened read letter be aware of content asked yes learned by heart before left teheran in case must be robbed of letter on way wuzeer sat in thought for minute how said doubtfully can country be a hear very far distant exercise influence with shah surely must not send army distance not from england highness must send fleet must shut up port in persian gulf must send troop from india to occupy place so destroy trade moreover must put stop to trade passing by land through town to scinde send great army by sea invade persia a soldier be much better than persian might even take tabriz teheran shah know that have done great thing in india will see how might bring ruin on persia yes what minister say be true will do at once can not say angus replied at first doubt government of england must say 'herat be very far off will fall before can do anything ' if find that hold out bravely will say must help people who be fighting so well there be thing be said that there be already russian officer with shah army english be very jealous of russian when come to understand that be russia who have sent shah to capture anger will speedily be roused will bid minister say to shah continue to fight against herat will send ship army against ' shah know that have conquered in india people far more warlike than persian will say to must run risk of losing kingdom merely to please russian who be really much more dangerous neighbour than english word of excellency be wuzeer said will see that will hold out for month even for year if necessary can understand now why british minister have confidence in though look so young how many year have excellency be not yet thirty angus said calmly wuzeer looked surprised be because face be smooth that look so young afghan wear beard see that for even brave officer who have come to fight for have hair on face have told that will stay here assist with advice so far a be able to do so will be not greatly skilled in such matter still will assist so far a can be good afghan said must be better highness that must not be known that be agent of british minister though of course can if find necessary cheer soldier by telling if fight bravely well british minister will try mediate between shah to persuade to draw off army be shah to know that british minister have agent here must be wroth with might not listen so willingly to representation let then beg be supposed that like mr pottinger be english traveller who chancing to be here be willing to do that can to aid in defence of town against persian word be good so let be where be dwelling now at house of armenian carpet kajar time being bad loom be at stand still be glad to let apartment be good man wuzeer said good man honest not rich angus felt that last word be rather question than assertion said surely room be very simple be clean if traveller can find clean lodging care not how poor be will be sending message to minister will endeavour to do so by servant lad have brought with will tell that mind may be at ease for herat can hold out persian be coward wuzeer said angrily horseman have be round for many day give chance keep together like flock of sheep with gun infantry instead of riding out bravely to bring in plunder fight with enemy when meet then turning to pottinger went on have sent out a advised to cut down tree within mile of town so that persian will have shelter from gun a granary be emptied for mile round will have long way to go to get food number of men be also at work at place where a showed wall be rotten others be clearing out ditch making bank steeper where have slipped down so that if must be so mad a to rush forward try to cross moat will not be able to climb up be important wuzeer still more so be that little wall at foot of mount of earth surround city wall must be repaired be of greatest importance may manage to fill up moat cross a long a lower wall stand can not climb up even if breach be made in main wall will go round now with wuzeer said will see where worst place be angus accompanied found that pottinger statement a to weakness of fortification be well founded from distance wall have looked imposing for be of considerable height great thickness be entirely constructed of dried mud heavy gun must effect breach anywhere in course of day two be evident that if place be to hold out must depend upon bravery of troop not upon strength of wall for next week work went on incessantly able bodied man in town be employed in repair of wall in cutting down tree while work of destroying grain kind of necessary must not be brought into town be performed by troop be afghan be in regular pay formed fighting army of ruler of discipline be at time very lax permission to destroy burn naturally included looting everything of value for own benefit rendered even le amenable to discipline than before eldred pottinger a far a must venture tried to induce wuzeer to have work executed in more regular manner under strict supervision by officer told off for purpose yar mahomed viewed matter with indifference what doe matter said whether soldier take thing not must be same to owner whether have whether be destroyed fall into hand of persian in few day enemy will be here must be foolish to cause dissatisfaction among soldier over matter of consequence whatever country indeed be now deserted by inhabitant immense store of food have be brought into city unoccupied piece of ground between city wall be crowded with cattle sheep horse there be fear that famine must for very long period be serious trouble to besieged eldred pottinger time be principally occupied in seeing to repair of gun carriage without definite rank having be given to be understood that order have support of wuzeer be to be obeyed a if came directly from that young man with be also englishman of importance possessed similar power while pottinger looked chiefly after military work performed by afghan who have come into town angus superintended that upon sheeahs be engaged persian speaking people carried out instruction cheerfully because be given in own language be not accompanied by contemptuous haughtiness animosity must have characterized order of afghan hostility between two great religious sect of islam being even greater than entertained by against infidel pottinger have now taken up abode at house of kajar where there be several apartment unoccupied a did not speak armenian knew little persian angus arranged to have mess of own engaging man recommended to by armenian a good cook have be rendered more necessary a trader with whom angus have first spoken have also moved with wife to brother house have taken step because foresaw that a siege went on position of sheeahs must become more more unbearable that protection presence of two englishman must afford must be most valuable indeed kajar a soon a saw that angus have be favourably received by wuzeer have suggested that pottinger might also be offered accommodation at house there need be further talk of payment effendi between presence here will be of vastly greater importance than money must give one can say what will happen here be not only property life will be at stake with a inmate here one must dare interfere with regard fact that must almost accidentally have be brought here a special blessing have be sent from heaven to young englishman thus strangely thrown together soon became fast friend be pleasant indeed to to enjoy evening together after have be engaged during whole day at duty have undertaken couple of hour however be always spent by in own room pottinger engaged service of mollah priest of sheeah sect to give lesson in persian while angus worked at pushtoo with kajar who spoke afghan language perfectly chapter iii siege of herat on nd of november fortnight after angus arrived at persian army took up position on plain to north west of city inhabitant crowded wall to watch advancing host afghan portion of population with scowling face muttered imprecation sheeahs prudently abstaining from demonstration of feeling filled with hope of deliverance from tyrant pottinger learned that afghan horse be going to make sortie angus went together to north west angle of wall good deal will depend upon first fight pottinger said if persian easily repulse assault will cause deep depression among afghan if on other hand heratees obtain fair amount of success will so encourage that will not fear time to encounter enemy will fight strongly when wall be attacked in short time afghan horse be seen pouring out of western gate there be small attempt at anything like military order be mob of horseman individually splendid rider for skirmishing purpose unsurpassed a pottinger remarked to companion quite unfit to stand against charge of regular cavalry equally endowed with courage keeping near city wall until facing persian position where regiment of cavalry be hastily mounting wheeled round rode against enemy with loud shout persian rode to meet be unable to withstand impetuosity of charge amidst exulting shout of afghan on wall wheeled round fled in disorder afghan then turning flung upon strong body of infantry be advancing against in good order however stood firm emptying many saddle by heavy volley poured in when afghan be close presenting so steady line of bayonet that horseman recoiled a did so persian artillery opened upon afghan who retired until near wall then dismounted opened fire with long matchlock upon persian gunner pottinger ran at once to couple of gun close to where be standing under direction afghan in charge of at once replied to persian gun number of afghan footman ran out from gate on side joining dismounted men kept up hot fire while on wall also joined in conflict a persian gun must effect little against infantry lying in shelter be now directed against wall causing rapid dispersal of peaceable portion of spectator effect of fire showed at once rottenness of fortification although light gun knocked down portion of parapet crumbled a if have be made of rotten timber pottinger shook head a angus walked along to watch effect of fire if six pound shot can effect such damage a be clear that when get siege gun to work few hour will effect breach in wall on side persian also sent out skirmisher pushed forward to point where must take afghan in flank cause to retire nearer to wall fighting be continued until dark when persian drew off afghan retired into city material advantage have be gained by side heratees be well content with result have shown superior to persian cavalry have maintained against infantry persian lost time during night pushed forward occupied garden enclosure on west of city placed strong force among ruin of village there in morning began to advance against wall afghan sallied out horse foot cavalry unable to act in such broken ground moved round hanging on flank of persian camp continually threatened attack infantry taking advantage of wall bush maintained heavy fire upon enemy artillery on side opened fire at end of day party have gained advantage afghan brought in head of several whom have killed few prisoner head be placed on pike exhibited on wall prisoner be bartered a slave in exchange for horse to turkoman of whom considerable party be encamped at short distance from wall be horrible disgusting pottinger said to companion evening a sat together custom of cutting off head a be believe universal in east must be worse than useless to protest against be custom always to reward soldier for bringing in head a proof of valour though in fact be proof a may simply a advance cut from body of man shot by someone else putting aside brutality operates badly for instead of following up advantage hotly men stop to collect miserable trophy so give time to enemy to escape rally have read in account of campaign of turkish conqueror that head be always brought in to general piled before tent that soldier be rewarded according to number brought in fancy be same thing with mohammedan conqueror in india well be afraid that will see number of thing will disgust before siege be over if be fighting solely for heratees must certainly retire if continue barbarity have interest whatever in in fact see that greater portion of population must be benefited by living under persian rule go into matter solely because be one consider of vital interest to england therefore a englishman be willing to do utmost to keep not persian russian from seizing place angus have now completely caught enthusiasm of young artilleryman be perhaps le horrified than companion for have seen so much of eastern mode of punishment that have learned to regard with le horror than felt by european unaccustomed to oriental method have be accustomed to look on at act of brutality said for from time when first came out father always impressed upon that be stranger in part of world must be very cautious not to show aversion to custom must lead into endless trouble if be to show in way that what to seems only natural be to revolting though have often be tempted to interfere when have seen act of brutality have always followed father instruction walked away without showing anger disgust agree with that be horrid be not like seeing living men tortured at least when one be dead can make great difference if one be buried with head without one pottinger laughed be certainly one way of looking at can understand that a custom have prevailed among people for century can scarcely understand feeling of abhorrence indignation however be determined that do feel will keep mouth shut not say word must anger wuzeer shake influence with at present be well disposed towards have be of real assistance to when thing become critical may be of vital service from what kajar say there be strong suspicion that be not personally brave can quite believe a very few thorough paced brute be now old shah kamran be must own exception absolutely greater scoundrel than have proved to be probably never existed be known to have be in earlier day a brave a lion if have be twenty year younger must have stronger hope of eventual success than have now personal bravery in general be of extraordinary advantage in european army where be not expected to lead men into battle with irregular troop like heratees be of vital importance will follow leader anywhere if sends into danger while remains at distance lose enthusiasm directly be half thrashed before battle begin do not think that kamran will be able at important moment to come forward show among defender of breach hear that only month so ago returned from campaign be afraid not have seen twice although can not be said that be imbecile be next door to understands what be going on nerve be utterly shattered by drink be in what may be termed lachrymose condition of drunkenness work into state of childish passion sometimes raf then whimper certainly appearance must have inspiring effect upon rough afghan soldier want man who must rush sword in hand at head call upon to follow then dash into middle of foe miserable old man must scarcely hold sword in shaking hand well at rate afghan have fought bravely yesterday to day excellently be work be accustomed to afghan battle consists of two set of men snugly hidden away among rock firing away at other until one side loses few men then retires so be quite at home at skirmishing work certainly more than match for same number of persian what will do when attack on breach be made by column remains to be seen night day heratees worked at defence while persian raised battery fortified camp against sudden attack after four five day of comparative quiet heavy cannonade broke out artillery played upon wall mortar threw shell into town rocket whizzed overhead for time consternation in city be prodigious rocket especially be altogether new to appalled inhabitant who a night came on gathered on roof of house watched with sharp train of light shuddered at sound of fiery missile sound of lamentation cry of fear prayer to allah resounded over city panic abated somewhat when be found that comparatively little injury be effected while peaceful inhabitant wailed prayed troop men who have come in from afghan village laboured steadily silently at work of repairing damage effected by fire of persian battery little must be done to face of wall crumbling parapet earth dug up from open space be used to construct fresh wall behind old one at point against persian gun played most fiercely so that when breach be formed assailant must find unlooked for obstacle to entrance into town work be directed by pottinger who took little rest remaining constantly at post only snatching hour sleep now then angus assisted to best of power always taking place when comrade must no longer battle against sleep seeing that everything went on well afghan yielded willing obedience to order of young stranger saw utility of work upon be engaged laboured well steadily persian artillery be fortunately for besieged badly commanded instead of concentrating fire upon one spot in case breach must have be effected in few hour gunner directed aim a thought best shot if poured upon single point must have brought down crumbling wall effected material damage scattered a be over face mile in length be le effective inasmuch a artilleryman generally aimed at parapet of wall instead of solid portion below be delight to to see portion of parapet knocked down by shot whereas when wall be hit comparatively small show be made many of shot flew high passed over town into field beyond at end of four day almost continuous firing herat be stronger more capable of resistance than be when persian first appeared before wall absence of tangible result evidently lowered spirit of besieger while proportionately raised of defender moreover immense expenditure of projectile by persian showed shah general large a be store of ammunition have brought with might prove insufficient labour time must be entailed in renewing supply from magazine at capital must be enormous consequently fire became irregular sometimes for hour two battery must play while at other time only few gun must be discharged in course of hour shell be thrown into city did much more damage than round shot of battery many house be almost destroyed by whole family killed however be for most part peaceable sheeahs matter in way affected defender of wall whose spirit rose daily a perceived that persian artillery be by mean so formidable a have anticipated persian made attempt to blockade city evidently fearing sortie defender made confined operation to side of city before be encamped be great advantage to besieged three out of five gate of city stood open communication be maintained with surrounding country cattle other animal went out to graze firewood other commodity passed freely into town throughout december persian be harassed by nightly attack working party in entrenchment be driven out tool carried off workman killed work performed during day destroyed assailant retiring before heavy mass of infantry must be brought up to repel upon many day scarce shot be fired then for few hour there must be lively cannonade of same scattered wasteful fashion a before on december th persian prisoner who have be captured in sortie be sent off for sale to frontier of turkoman country shah retaliated by putting to death in various cruel manner afghan prisoner who have fallen into hand two day later mine be sprung breach effected in wall persian advanced to storm be met with greatest resolution by heratees who repulsed with considerable loss leader being severely wounded deserter from herat man of high military reputation among afghan killed fact caused almost a much joy to defender a repulse of assault success however of mine knowledge that persian be engaged in driving several tunnel towards wall caused considerable feeling of uneasiness nevertheless th be day of termination of long mohammedan fast be celebrated with usual rejoicing besieged be enabled to take part in without fear of attack a day be being celebrated with similar festivity in persian camp shah kamran went with family in procession to principal mosque after conclusion of prayer usual to occasion observed custom of scattering sweetmeat to be scrambled for by priest to disappointment however did not follow up by inviting to banquet sent extra provision to troop worker on wall there be now pause in active operation for more than three week persian laboured at mine from ignorance of work on account of water flowing from moat into gallery damage resulted heratees countermined under advice of pottinger beyond proving that persian gallery be not being driven where expected nothing came of on th of january afghan determined to give battle to persian in open again whole population gathered on wall two young englishman be also there wuzeer asked morning whether must go out with pottinger said to angus replied that although acquainted with artillery siege operation did not know enough of afghan way of fighting to accept even small command in field be useful here went on must be of use outside afghan have own idea a to when to advance when to retreat besides might offend of leader be stranger to interfere in way there be jealousy of at present at least think not know nothing of siege there be one who hold special post in connection with fortification one therefore feel superseded in next place work be for most part carried out by labourer who get paid for service not by troop be nothing to whether get order from englishman afghan in attack on breach must certainly fight in first place because consider duty in second because if persian get inside wall may be sure that there will be something like general massacre afghan cavalry infantry poured out from gate spread over open country to east of persian camp men on foot took possession of village established in house garden surrounding from wall view must be obtained of movement in enemy camp vedettes have fallen back a soon a afghan issued out drum be beaten horn sounded troop ran hastily together general mahomed khan must be seen galloping about issuing order presently strong column moved out be headed by cavalry a soon a made appearance afghan horse galloped across plain while crowd on wall burst into shout of encouragement although troop be too far off to hear be pretty sight angus about a unlike modern warfare a must well be european cavalry seeing mob of horseman coming down upon in such disorder must ride at irregular horse must withstand impact of well disciplined compact cavalry charge there persian be forming line there be smartness about be done in half hearted sort of way a if did not like business before there be off be too slow wo be fairly in gallop before afghan be upon for minute two contending body be mixed in confused mass then shout of spectator rose high a persian must be seen flying towards infantry hotly pursued by afghan then came rattle of musketry quick report of cannon a infantry artillery covered retreat of cavalry presently heratee horse be seen retiring from village in struggle have taken place body have not yet be engaged instead of riding forward to support also turned for time rode off while persian cavalry be reinforced from camp pursued heratees soon recovered again charged again leading squadron be badly supported by behind be under leader who be probably influenced by jealousy by tribal hostility persian horse well supported by infantry gradually gained advantage own infantry coming to support afghan footman also advanced fight be maintained during whole day be like playing at war pottinger said irritably except in first charge have never really come to blow be skirmishing rather than fighting here there be ten twelve thousand men taking side cavalry infantry few gun think that when men come in again will be found that have lost hundred suppose persian have lost much more be fair field for fighting between two european force of same strength long day battle must probably have caused three four thousand casualty one must think that party be in earnest certainly heratees be though suppose persian soldier have particular personal interest in matter action be altogether indecisive at end of day persian held ground beyond village where infantry first opened fire while heratees have gained nothing by sortie when afghan re entered wall be found that pottinger estimate a to amount of loss be very near truth there be between twenty five thirty killed four time a many wounded more le seriously of course claimed victory be highly satisfied with own doings operation only tended to show that party have eagerness for real fighting on th of february pottinger said have received permission to go into persian camp to morrow kamran have given message on part to persian king be appeal to to retire say that when khorassan be in rebellion refused entreaty of chief to aid although at time must have raised ten thousand horseman might with rebel of khorassan have marched to teheran have sent one of highest officer to congratulate shah on succession now latter be without provocation marching against prays therefore to retire to aid with gun men to recover dominion have lost in afghanistan if be successful will hand over herat to yar mahomed have also given message to persian minister just sort of message must have expected from declares that be devoted to shah to that be bound to stand by master that might be own wish afghan must never surrender city that dare not propose such thing to that will ever remain faithful servant of shah of minister whom regard a father will take with if wish must be matter for own consideration must of course like to go angus said know that must be wise for to do so mr m'neill may be in persian camp be not probable must be recognized still there must be many official there who came frequently to see at embassy who must know must one of declare be member of mission might create very bad impression against m'neill a must seem that be in secret communication with kamran be just what be thinking pottinger said must say that agree with certainly must be awkward for if be known that one of suite be in herat yes think must be better that must not go will certainly be centre of curiosity while be in camp there must be possibility of private communication between m'neill must see have message for think have agreed that when business be over will be much better for to go with back to india than to return to teheran yes have quite settled that angus said with kind offer have made to present to uncle must think that prospect of obtaining advancement there be very much greater than be in persia where might be left altogether in lurch if m'neill be recalled will be obliged therefore if will tell of intention thank for very heartily for kindness will be sure approve of step for have several time told that be sorry must see chance of obtaining more than clerkship at mission advised on account to think of remaining there if must see way to doing better for myself will be sure to give m'neill message if see expect to be long in camp be charged with such ridiculous message that there be likelihood of discussion taking place minister will of course scoff at yar mahomed declaration of respect for shah affection for shah after taking trouble to collect army come here be not likely to retire at request of kamran real hope in going be may find british officer with persian there be almost certain to be one a russian have be said several through may send message to friend at home to uncle in scinde must begin to feel anxious about angus saw companion ride out next morning with anxiety a to reception with particular regret that did not accompany have often be in encampment of persian troop before army left teheran there must therefore be nothing new to in scene pottinger a usual wore dress of afghan of standing be accompanied only by one mounted attendant runner to hold horse small party of afghan rode with for distance beyond wall then shouting good wish for return in safety left angus continued to watch men at work for two three hour then took place on wall again watched for comrade return be not however till th that came back to herat on previous day be prevented from returning by violent storm raged from morning till night considerable anxiety be felt in town that have gone on mission from kamran be generally known none save shah wuzeer be aware of nature angus be much alarmed a thought too probable that friend have be shot by persian outpost a soon a arrived among for there be nothing to show that came a envoy be therefore greatly relieved when native brought news to that englishman be returning a news spread caused great excitement when pottinger rode in at gate great crowd have assembled there thronged round asking for information replied that must enquire of wuzeer who alone must deliver a saw angus in crowd shouted to a expected nothing have come of meet at house hour later pottinger arrived there be getting very anxious about angus said be beginning to fear that have be shot by persian outpost be little uncomfortable myself kept good look out a may suppose road led through ruined village at moment might have bullet whizzing about ear presently saw persian soldier running towards road told man to take off turban wave to show that intention be peaceable when perceived came straggling up told be english officer bearer of message to shah minister seemed delighted chiefly perhaps from fact of being englishman also because hoped that have come with offer of surrender however shouted 'welcome welcome english be always friend of shah ' officer who commanded picket turned out to be major who have served under major hart who knew english officer who have of late year be in persia took to major general commanding attack who turned out to be russian in persian service commanding corp of russian men who have left own country for doubtless good reason at rate received courteously have tea smoked pipe together then sent on with escort to persian camp illustration afghanistan north west frontier of india news that someone have come in from herat to arrange term for submission having preceded almost whole camp came out to see if escort have not used iron ramrod most vigorously upon head shoulder of crowd must never have got through when reached minister tent received graciously did not enter into business be necessary that shah must first decide whether must receive have learned from russian general that colonel stoddart be in camp a be known before left india that must accompany persian have letter for received permission to go to tent to deliver astonishment at finding be british officer be a may imagine great however have little time to talk for in few minute message came be to go back at once to minister a be called there a well a here wuzeer stoddart accompanied persian asked be message a have be informed kamran yar mahomed have sent to shah told must only deliver kamran message to shah that thought own message have better be given privately wuzeer who be bilious excitable little man sent everyone out from tent stoddart then delivered message have long discussion wuzeer declared that english have put down herat a forming part of persian dominion in map that burnes have made said that thought not produced map to convince to little man intense disgust found that be altogether wrong then appealed to stoddart latter a military representative at shah court replied diplomatically that have instruction on subject must refer case to envoy at teheran m'neill by by have not yet reached camp stoddart said that be not aware that persian government have annexed herat a ruler have with british government late shah be acknowledged a sovereign in afghanistan so a expected nothing came of interview went back to stoddart tent shortly afterwards be sent for by shah received with courtesy delivered kamran message shah replied speaking with dignity calmness stating complaint against kamran that have permitted soldier constantly to make incursion into persian dominion robbing slaying carrying off persian subject to sell a slave then gradually warming up a recited number of such foray depredation denounced kamran a treacherous liar said that must not rest satisfied until have planted persian garrison in city of herat of course there be nothing more to be said be formally though courteously dismissed went back with stoddart to tent where remained till morning be by mean sorry that tremendous storm yesterday afforded excuse for stopping enjoyed day of quiet talk with stoddart immensely think that if persian do make attack with strength town must be taken in entirely agree with said however that a slackness of fire for time past have shown persian be heartily sick of business if shah have really good excuse for retiring must gladly do so said that best excuse must be strong action on part of government replied that have urged upon m'neill that envoy have already written urgently home in sense of course told of being there have already heard from m'neill that have sent here to encourage kamran to hold out asked good deal about quite agreed with that with knowledge of language told that in three month during have be here have already learned enough pushtoo to converse in freely must be sure to get appointment in india a be extremely probable that army must shortly be sent into afghanistan to support shah soojah against dost mahomed especially a latter have received vickovich aide de camp to governor of orenburg a envoy at cabul of course have heard about intention of supporting dost mahomed before started know that uncle mr burnes who be agent at cabul be strongly opposed to dost mahomed have always defeated shah soojah be firmly established on throne burnes belief that be very well disposed towards however be not affair if there must be such expedition much increase chance of obtaining official post took opportunity to write to uncle to send report to indian government in case stated that have received most valuable assistance from young gentleman who be temporarily attached to mission at teheran who speaking a did persian pushtoo arabic must considered be of great service must difficulty arise with afghanistan said that have seized opportunity of recommending a be possible that might fall in defence of herat be awfully kind of pottinger be extremely obliged to felt be acting in interest of indian government a well a of siege may last for month yet by end of time will be able to pas a easily a afghan a now can a persian may be invaluable for a have a yet have very little contact with afghanistan there be not must say dozen officer in service who can speak pushtoo probably not one who must do so well enough to pas a native knew little of when started so disguise be that of cutch horse dealer passed through afghanistan a native of india even now speak pushtoo a well a do having devoted to persian while have be working at afghan for sake hope that siege may last for time yet a may be great advantage to when apply for official post to be able to say that can pas anywhere a native chapter iv sturdy defence pottinger belief that shah be anxious to bring war to conclusion be confirmed by arrival of major have met when going into persian camp with instruction from russian general endorsed by minister to endeavour to persuade afghan to consent to term offered by shah be better urged for to settle difference among than to employ mediation warned that a english have come to india under pretence of trading have finally conquered whole country must on account be trusted assured that shah have desire to interfere in internal administration of present movement be not expedition against herat against hindostan that true mohammedan must join shah army that must lead to conquest plunder of india turkestan pottinger be sent for privately consulted by kamran wuzeer a to what answer must be sent advice be taken next day envoy returned to camp with vague assurance of regard suggestion that if persian be really inclined for peace best proof that must give of sincerity of inclination must be retirement of besieging force there be much excitement in city when proposal brought by persian officer became known many of older men began to argue that did not matter much whether kamran be called prince king whether supremacy of persian shah be be not acknowledged in herat a long a persian garrison be placed in city wuzeer however remained firm declared that have confidence in persian that desired to be guided by advice be aided by mediation of english that if shah must place conduct of negotiation in hand of colonel stoddart on part must trust everything to lieutenant pottinger must accept be decided upon by two english officer be own decision not mine pottinger said when returned from interview with wuzeer there be doubt ruffian a be in many respect be clever man see shift responsibility for continuance of war off shoulder on to of persian for refusal to accept decision of british officer in camp will convince afghan that persian will be satisfied with nothing destruction two day later persian officer returned to herat with letter stating that shah have desire to posse of town only claimed that sovereignty must be acknowledged answer be same a before kamran be willing to do be required if persian army must retire negotiation be carried on for day two longer though party desired peace one must not surrender other must not retire acknowledge failure hostility therefore continued without intermission fortnight later persian gained possession of fortified place three hundred yard from north east angle of wall afghan stationed there have made poor resistance upon entering town face be smeared with mud be sent through city accompanied by crier who proclaimed cowardice month passed without incident of importance at end of time m'neill arrived at persian camp effort have be made to hinder on way from teheran be at first coldly received week later have audience with shah stated to that attack upon herat be obvious violation of treaty between great britain herat british government must therefore be justified in taking active measure to enforce term shah upon consented to accept british mediation three day later however persian made serious attack new battery opened against rampart near great mosque fire be time concentrated wall crumbled so rapidly that by evening practicable breach have be made afghan however did not lose heart declaring that trusted to not to wall to defend city have indeed gained advantage in middle of day blew in mine have be carried almost up to wall taking advantage of alarm caused by explosion rushed out furiously attacked besieger carrying trench for distance before strong persian force came up drove back again so heavy fire be then opened from trench on musketeer on wall that be completely overpowered be unable to show head above parapet a evening came on persian shouted that english officer wished to enter town wuzeer shouted back that one must be allowed to enter at hour next day major todd who be attached to embassy entered town be in full regimentals appearance excited most lively admiration of populace announced that shah be ready to accept mediation of british government be received with greatest courtesy by shah kamran who after interview took cloak from own shoulder sent by wuzeer to major todd who returned to persian camp with assurance of kamran desire to accept mediation of

almost at same time a pottinger angus for before coming here have seen that be going well at other point attacked have observed a came along men leaving breach by two three under pretence of assisting wounded comrade pottinger saw to dismay that men be losing heart a came to breach found other soldier coming up wuzeer be sitting down close by pottinger ran up to must encourage men wuzeer go forward join will be lost afghan scarcely seemed to hear what said must come pottinger repeated loudly there be time to be lost then turned to angus do what can said must rouse wuzeer evidently nerve have suddenly given way glad at last to be free to join in struggle angus drew sword ran down thrusting back who be mounting pushed way forward to front shouting in pushtoo fight men fight for faith wife child everything be going on well elsewhere be alone going to fail bearded afghan astonished at seeing young englishman rushing forward in advance of followed again persian be beaten back although afghan in front have be animated by lad example behind be still dropping off wuzeer aroused by vigorous exhortation of pottinger have risen up neared breach persian be renewing attack wuzeer called upon men to fight fugitive paused irresolute wuzeer heart failed again turned back action still further discouraging men pottinger in most vehement language exhorted to set example again turned advanced again shrank back pottinger now instead of entreating reviled threatened called opprobrious name at last seizing by arm dragged forward to breach astounding treatment maddened afghan shouted to soldier to fight a continued to fall back seized large staff rushing like madman upon soldier drove forward again with shower of heavy blow while pottinger sword in hand seconded cooped up a be seeing other outlet of escape many of leapt wildly down over parapet rushed down slope fell upon persian stormers believing that great reinforcement must have arrived be seized by panic abandoned position fled herat be saved entirely by energy courage of young english lieutenant pottinger first question be a to companion have while urging wuzeer to advance caught sight of fighting desperately in midst of persian at once made way down to spot be not long in discovering angus who be lying insensible bleeding from number of sabre wound calling four afghan ordered to be carried on to wall there bandaged wound then have placed on stretcher carried to lodging taking on to send order to wuzeer own medical attendant to go there at once attend to wound then turned attention to wuzeer mind of minister have be almost unhinged by terrible event be still wandering about in confused bewildered way several of other chief be similarly affected be unable for day afterwards to perform usual duty soldier instead of being excited over victory be a gloomy depressed a if have suffered defeat peril have be so great city have be so nearly lost that there be general feeling that such attack must be successful confidence hitherto have rested upon wuzeer on conviction that courage be infinitely greater than of persian have found that persian must now fight a well stoutly a be humiliated by knowing that be to young english officer owed that persian have failed in object that young englishman scarce more than boy have led best bravest into thick of fray have penetrated beyond into midst of persian have fallen there none appreciate bravery more than do afghan be not so much that pottinger have exposed recklessly to shower of bullet with persian in trench swept spot where be standing with wuzeer that must have ventured to abuse revile even forcibly drag dreaded leader forward astounded herat felt that be who have saved city fame of deed spread through country round men when came in sought out kissed hand with enthusiasm deep gloom however hung over city even work of repairing damaged fortification be carried on apathetically have repulsed persian be felt that nothing miracle must enable to withstand such assault food be exhausted treasury be empty inhabitant must not be fed soldier must not be paid equal amount of depression be felt in persian camp five assault have failed eighteen hundred of best troop have fallen loss of officer have be enormous russian general berowski have be killed two of principal persian general russian general sampson two pasha have be wounded almost field officer of regiment engaged in attack be hors de combat pottinger position be very painful one need for money to pay troop be absolute wuzeer when have recovered from effect of scare instituted reign of terror even more terrible than anything wretched inhabitant have ever before felt soldier went from house to house suspected of possessing money be seized tortured even lady of rank be so treated very inmate of kamran zenana be threatened have to contribute jewel pottinger felt that be solely owing to influence that city have so long held out a went through street starving men reproached a author of suffering did that must be little men of rank came to imploring aid protection be able to save for others must hing never be young soldier placed in so terrible dilemma a man be agonized by suffering saw round suffering must at once bring to end by advising wuzeer to surrender a soldier englishman felt that be duty to hold out to bitter end position became still more difficult when fortnight after assault persian again opened negotiation demanding however a first step that must be expelled from city pottinger declared that thought of personal safety must persuade to stand in way of arrangement conducive to safety of herat welfare of country that if must be gained by departure must willingly leave town yar mahomed be undecided felt that dismissal of man who have saved herat must be stain on character moreover that persian having obtained dismissal must become still more exorbitant in demand have long expected arrival of relieving force of turkoman pottinger be convinced that ere long intervention of england must compel persian to fall back bombardment of city have not be renewed since repulse of attack persian relied now solely upon famine to reduce maintained strict blockade in order to mitigate horror saw around pottinger undertook that who voluntarily brought in money must be reimbursed at recommendation by british government brought money in though slowly july passed then deserter from persian camp brought in news that there be report that great british army have landed in persian gulf have taken bushire be advancing report have fortunately enormously magnified strength of british expedition news gave fresh life to defender of herat persian again opened negotiation waiving question of expulsion of pottinger wuzeer be le inclined than before to yield to persian demand m'neill be on way to frontier when be informed of arrival of british expedition to persian gulf at same time received instruction from foreign office in anticipation of refusal of shah to retire from before herat fortified by instruction despatched colonel stoddart to persian camp with message to shah arrived there on th of august on next day have interview with shah who welcomed with cordiality listened to message from british government mean then said that if leave herat there will be war depends upon majesty answer stoddart replied two day later stoddart be again summoned to royal presence consent shah said to whole of demand from british government will not go to war be not for sake of friendship must not return from before herat have known that by coming here must risk loss of friendship certainly must not have come at in reply colonel stoddart said thanked god that majesty have taken so wise view of real interest of persia a left audience hinted to persian minister although shah answer be very satisfactory must be more satisfactory still to see at once reduced to practice although rumour reached city that persian be about to leave be not for week that rumour became certainty effort be made to induce wuzeer to make concession must give better grace to withdrawal of shah of condition suggested be refused by pottinger advice on th of september persian prisoner in town be sent into camp on th persian army began march back to teheran be time indeed that did so for have three four day supply of forage remaining flour grain be almost exhausted failure to capture so weakly fortified place be in pottinger opinion due to fact that there be union of effort commander of various section of army acted independently except when under command of russian made simultaneous attack never acted in concert with other be opinion that shah might have carried city by assault very first day that reached herat declared that persian be equally a brave a far better soldier than afghan that have ample supply of artillery to capture strong fortress if properly employed for week after struggle of th of june angus campbell lay between life death have lost great quantity of blood when first carried to room armenian friend believed to be dead pottinger who have hurried back a soon a saw that there be chance of renewal of assault went to kamran obtained spirit with aid of action of heart have before be so slight that pulse must not be felt be stimulated respiration grew stronger kamran doctor have already declared that none of wound be in dangerous that despaired of patient recovering pottinger however by mean despaired procured fresh meat ordered servant to make strongest broth possible to pour spoonful between patient lip few minute angus be wrapped in warm blanket large bottle of hot water placed against foot wound have already be carefully dressed bandaged by surgeon for although almost entirely ignorant a to use of drug afghan doctor have abundant practice in treatment of wound pottinger remained two three hour then seeing that angus be breathing regularly though feebly that pulse must now be felt at wrist hurried off to see that work of repairing breach have be taken in hand kajar wife undertaking to look after patient for week issue of struggle be doubtful then improvement although slow be distinct day by day slight advance be made lady of kamran zenana be much interested in young englishman frequently sent down present of fruit perfume be welcome air of herat be very unfavourable to wound little scent sprinkled on muslin curtain drawn across window to extent neutralized terrible stench of town handkerchief steeped in water to little of perfume have be added be laid lightly over bandage in three week angus be able to sit up for time week later walked across room progress be now more rapid by end of july be able to sit on donkey a far a city wall where must breathe purer air than of city by end of august must walk freely about town be listless without energy be now certain that in very short time persian must draw off must be out of a soon a can angus pottinger said to one evening what want be mountain air will never get better a long a remain in pestilential atmosphere be enough to kill healthy dog only wonder that whole population have not be swept away when m'neill be here told that if people interfered herat be saved must appoint officially a british resident envoy said that be sure british government must send money do be possible to alleviate misery have be suffered by inhabitant although must infinitely rather have other employment seems to that be clearly duty to stay here be largely owing to that poor people have suffered for ten month horror of siege least can do be to help now for if did not may be sure that money sent by england must simply remain in coffer of kamran wuzeer be said quite believe that large proportion of money wrung by torture from wretched people have be retained by yar mahomed be therefore absolutely necessary if people be to be fed house rebuilt matter tided over till trade recovers that british officer be here to receive superintend distribution of british money very day gate be open have better be off speak afghan now perfectly be glad to see azim have picked up too be capital fellow have watched over since have be ill a if have be father question be do feel strong enough to travel through mountain if not there be nothing for for to return to teheran stay there till strength be restored angus shook head think must stand journey across plain said must pick up much at teheran while believe that in hill must soon get braced up there be nothing really matter with now except feel lazy if there have be fighting going on there be something must do must soon shake off what with sight of misery of people here stink heat feel that be making progress believe will be different man a soon a be once out of place on way to hill will soon be getting cold up there in fortnight will be fit for anything think be right angus must give good deal for few hour in fresh mountain air do think that be strong enough to travel quietly of course will have to do so a did in disguise indeed will be much more necessary now than be year ago be well known that chief at candahar have be long negotiating with persia have offered to place under shah protection that encouraged pushed on by russia have meditated invasion of india news of failure here will doubt moderate ardour from have be learned from afghan who have come into town during siege there be throughout whole country feeling of deep excitement at prospect of mohammedan invasion of india conviction that whole country must rise join persian be to advance to candahar afghan consider russian influence really mean persian influence whereas know that be just other way that russia only us persia a cat paw a for persian know now what be worth that british division must be sufficient to smash up afghan know that believe that persia be persia of old that with aid must assuredly drive british out of india being state of feeling chance of getting through be discovered that be british must be small indeed must pas a persian who having long traded with herat have learnt afghan language must be natural story that finding herat be ruined that there can be trade between persia for long time be travelling south with intention of fixing at candahar of trading between town india on one side persia on other can account for not having merchandise with by saying that owing to presence of persian army marauder from herat general disturbance of country must not have be safe to travel with merchandise will certainly carry out plan angus said think there will be difficulty in getting through do wish that be coming with hope will not be very long before follow for think there will be stirring work there soon angus be well provided with money have received from mr m'neill sum must not only cover expense of journey to herat must enable to return to teheran proceed to india a circumstance might determine in addition to have received year salary in recognition of risk incurred have sum still in possession money have brought from tabriz have left at embassy mr m'neill promising to send order for amount must write for from india chapter v in candahar on th of september angus started after tearful farewell from armenian friend gratitude to pottinger be unbounded presence influence of two english guest have preserved from rapacity cruelty of wuzeer while other merchant trader in town have be maltreated robbed in many case have died under torture inflicted to wring from treasure be believed possessed kajar brother family alone enjoyed immunity from persecution have determined that must leave herat taking with workman establish at teheran tabriz where profit of work might be le must at least be able to enjoy in security such a must never be hoped for a long a yar mahomed be virtual ruler of period have elapsed since angus left teheran have changed much be no longer boy for have be doing man work be now nearly eighteen year old have attained full height of nearly six foot illness have pulled down much sharpened feature except for lighter colour really more closely resembled afghan than persian trader be dressed to represent pallor caused by illness have be succeeded by deep tan caused by passing so many hour daily in sun during convalescence be glad to be out of herat azim said a looked back at wall so be azim thought at one time be never coming out at be very bad place master in persia governor squeeze people bit sometimes there be much grumbling worst of be very much better than yar mahomed who be son of sheitan whom may allah confound be scoundrel angus agreed heartily wonder that people of herat have not long since risen torn to piece know that if have be merchant there must have tried to stir up to do azim shook head can not trust other effendi there be many who must like to do a have said there be many who can not trust own neighbour then must do look how many old men be tortured to death of must have have son have father be so tortured must have lain in wait for wuzeer day after day in empty house there be plenty of in one of street by usually went from palace to wall a rode past must have put bullet in head must then have escaped from back of house if possible one must have seen who have fired shot must have be safe if once away if be overtaken must put pistol to head so a to avoid being tortured to death can not understand thirty forty thousand people continuing to support rule of tyrant when one bold man must put end to once on way angus felt new life in vein in week have entirely shaken off feeling of lassitude have oppressed in poisoned air of herat felt equal to ordinary exertion a have expected met with difficulty on way for on road between herat candahar afghan be accustomed to see persian trader passing suspicion be felt that angus attendant be other than represented to be journey be long one angus did not hurry be pleasant to after being for year cooped up in besieged city to travel quietly in fresh mountain air scenery be new to though azim felt cold good deal angus enjoyed immensely made short stage never exceeded twenty mile day often when arrived at village offered fair accommodation be content to stay when only fourteen fifteen have be traversed a be great high road of trade there be khan in almost village there be difficulty in purchasing necessary of life everywhere talk be of war once beyond territory over shah mahomed ruled news that persian have failed to take herat have retired have excited regret have be regarded a certain that place must fall have anticipated march of persian russian army to candahar to be followed by grand invasion of india mountaineer have felt sure that army must gladly pay be demanded for permission to pas unmolested that must be ready to pay high price for provision hire of transport animal so that must enrich in first place then have chance of sharing in plunder of india destruction of infidel angus be appealed to by with whom conversed to explain how be that shah with great army have failed to take herat be eagerly questioned too with regard to russia country of have heard many strange rumour be very strong be really in alliance with persia be infidel if so how be that shah be friendly with to first of question angus must only reply that not having be in persian camp be unable to give information there be certainly russian general officer leading persian at siege of herat be infidel neighbour of persian for thought that while doubt shah wished to be at peace with such powerful neighbour must be wise not to trust very far must not really wish for to become more powerful if aided must only be for own object a peaceful man only desired to trade left matter to wiser head at same time knew that russia be constantly extending dominion at expense of neighbour that a be christian country certainly must not be thinking of invading india for benefit of mohammedan of country of afghanistan certainly not of persia whatever shah military officer might think trading class be uneasy at influence that russia be gaining apprehensive of growing power proximity of neighbour possessed of such immense force of ambitious view two month after leaving herat angus entered candahar journey have be wholly without incident of importance appearance of candahar somewhat resembled that of herat situated in fertile plain with range of craggy hill at great distance surrounded by wall be incapable of offering prolonged resistance to attack of european force provided with siege artillery town be comparatively modern one being founded in on site of ancient city be built on regular plan street crossing other at right angle like herat have four principal street meeting in centre of foot wide lined with shop stream of water ran down almost street town made very favourable impression on angus after ruin dirt of herat a persian felt at home here for persian inscription name met eye everywhere a throughout afghanistan whole of trade be carried on by persian by native of india afghan deeming profession of arm only one honourable upper class among habitually spoke persian language be generally employed in writing in official communication angus put up at khan learned be frequented by trader passing through city soon made acquaintance of several merchant lodging there from learned much more of state of affair than have gathered in afghan village have passed through on journey english be be said gathering great army in scinde with intention of placing shah soojah on throne of afghanistan instead of dost mahomed of blunder have be committed from time of first arrival in india none be comparable in point of injustice hopeless blundering misfortune to policy thus inaugurated in afghanistan shah soojah be head of dooranee tribe have be overthrown by barukzyes who have gradually attained power dooranee monarch be unable to withstand four prince of tribe divided kingdom between after waging many war against other dost mahomed youngest of four brother became ruler of cabul during war peshawur have be captured by great sikh ruler runjeet sing in shah soojah made effort to recover kingdom be defeated again became fugitive in british india dost mahomed alarmed at preparation made by sikh for still further dismembering country by fact that two brother who be lord of candahar might at moment take advantage of trouble with sikh to throw off authority altogether be anxious to enter into alliance with british more so a have learned of ever increasing influence of russia in persia lord auckland sent captain burnes to cabul nominally purpose be to arrange for larger commercial intercourse between two country be received with great honour in cabul have come altogether unprovided with customary present dost mahomed reasonably felt a studied slight nevertheless exerted to utmost to obtain alliance of british burnes have authority to treat with must give assurance aid must be forthcoming if on fall of herat be considered certain persian russian aided by candahar chief who be known to be in correspondence with be to invade territory must obtain promise that british must use influence with runjeet sing to restore peshawur burnes saw how sincere be desire of ameer for close friendship with england wrote strongly to lord auckland in favour of alliance with pointed out that dost mahomed be firmly seated at cabul where have reigned for ten year shah soojah have adherent even if placed on throne must not maintain there colonel pottinger resident in scinde also gave same advice lord auckland paid attention to representation weak man be guided chiefly by mr macnaghten secretary comparatively young man with great ambition unbounded belief in a event proved with few of quality required in man placed in highly responsible difficult position in india burnes be instructed to insist upon ameer binding to make alliance without consent of england at same time be to refuse to give pledge in return for concession more preposterous demand be never made upon independent sovereign for long time ameer strove in vain to obtain sort of condition at length finding hopeless threw into arm of russian agent whom have hitherto treated with great coldness burnes position became intolerable be recalled lord auckland at once prepared to place shah soojah on throne by force runjeet sing be asked to join in undertaking at great durbar held in punjaub condition be arranged under shah soojah be to pay large amount to runjeet a well a to british for aid be to give a if be not enough to have united afghanistan against people of scinde who have hitherto be on good term with be treated a if be enemy be ordered to furnish provision carriage for army to pay large sum of money although have by term of treaty with be guaranteed against claim whatever for money service must seem indeed that lord auckland mr macnaghten have neglected no step whatever must ensure failure of enterprise when after war paper relating to policy have occasioned be published in form of blue book be significant that passage in letter of burnes pottinger remonstrating against course proposed by lord auckland be suppressed dishonesty being thus added to terrible blunder of weakest most obstinate of governor general of india blunder caused not only utter destruction of british army led to almost equally unjust war for conquest of scinde a far a angus must learn candahar prince be making preparation to take part in war general idea be that must gladly see dost mahomed overthrown shah soojah placed on throne feeling certain that latter must not be able to retain position that must have far better chance of becoming master of whole of afghanistan then than must have so long a brother remained on throne three day after arrival officer from palace called upon angus requested to accompany there a prince wished to question a to reason for persian retiring from before herat on arriving at palace be shown into small chamber where kihur el khan with two of brother be sitting have heard that have arrived here that passed by herat just a shah have left with army be so prince angus said bowing deeply have come hither for purpose of trade from what city do come from tabriz represent one of largest merchant there mentioned name of well known trader when left be considered certain that herat must speedily be captured that shah must move forward here having be said entered into alliance with 'therefore ' patron said to 'go to candahar doubtless in future trade with northern india will go by route instead of by sea candahar will be mighty centre of trade therefore go see for be prospect price at good can be carried from present frontier to city thence into scinde find out for whether there be hindrance to trade along road be charge for permission to travel through pass held by various tribe disposition of people towards trader how be that did not turn back when found that army be retiring without having captured herat thought best still to go on a have come so far angus replied shah be true be retiring might return in spring must not doubt that with powerful friendship must next time succeed information must gain must enable patron to send off without delay large caravan of merchandise if found expedient to do so be in persian camp highness army when be retiring be best avoided by peaceful men when go well camp officer see that trader be not meddled with by soldier when thing be not going favourably there be discontent in camp discipline be relaxed be useless for who be robbed maltreated to make complaint be doubt true doubtless heard good deal from who have be in camp how did men say be that failed to capture herat be weak town say one thing highness declare have not be for british officer who happened to be there place must have fallen in very short time others say that must have be taken easily have persian general be of one mind that acted for that only once did attack at same time prince nodded have seen very many time evil of divided counsel knew how necessary be that there must be strong leader who must make obeyed by what do people say about russian know that have officer there hear that be great people be good friend with persian opinion be divided prince there be who believe that friendship will indeed be great advantage to persia there be others especially among trading class who think otherwise believe russia be too strong to be real friend that must be far better to maintain close alliance with england must support against russia lie so far away across sea that must gain nothing by meddling in affair taking territory be reported that be english who have now interfered have saved herat be sending fleet army to compel persia to desist be what be reported generally believed prince can not say how truly merely heard common talk on way why must england have interfered what doe matter to whether herat belongs to persia to suddozye prince kamran according to opinion of trader in tabriz england must not have cared at have persia be strong be fighting only for conquest of herat be known that england regard with great jealousy approach of russia to india considers that a persia be certainly acting under influence of russia be latter who must be real master of herat not persian then too be said though know that rumour often lie that russia persia have many friend in afghanistan that conquest of herat must only be first step to further advance south kihur el khan frowned undertaking have certainly be made by brother retreat of persian from herat at dictation of english fact that latter be now gathering army with avowed purpose of placing shah soojah on throne of afghanistan gravely altered position have love for brother have british force advanced through khyber pass to cabul placed shah soojah on throne must certainly have rendered assistance to dost mahomed for felt sure that soojah must not be able to maintain saw that there be good chance that in confusion must prevail might obtain mastery of cabul a english army be evidently intending to advance through bolan pas must probably in first place march on candahar must in consequence of intrigue with persia russia be regarded a enemy be therefore silent for minute two then said if shah have retired because be afraid of english will not venture to send army to aid against think that must do so army suffered very heavily hear that speak language of country how be that afghan asked suddenly speak well highness replied angus who have thought be possible that question might be asked having known for time must make journey hither studied for time with slave who have be bought by merchant of employer acquaintance who have bought from turkoman in journey that made in country speak only well enough to make way through country to obtain such necessary a may be required on journey to converse in fashion with such traveller a might meet on road in khan be reported to that spoke so that must understand said be seemed strange to that persian must speak pushtoo will speak to further day a angus returned to khan felt that be object of suspicion up to point when prince have sharply suddenly asked how came to speak pushtoo bland manner have led to believe that have be simply desirous of obtaining last news from frontier showed unmistakably that prince have learned something have excited suspicion that be there either a emissary from kamran of russia persia desirous of ascertaining position of affair at candahar force at disposal of prince feeling among people in general with reference to protectorate occupation by one other of power angus knew naturally suspicious character of eastern prince in persia one ever ventured to discus public affair openly in herat hated a kamran yar mahomed be one dared breathe word of aught adulation for slightest suspicion of disloyalty sufficed to bring about ruin death of unfortunate man on whom fell last word of prince be in fact sentence of imprisonment to city for indefinite time prince might not send for again for month mere intimation that must do so be sufficient must not continue journey without running risk of being pursued brought back again in case might first be tortured to extract secret might posse then be put to death might for aught knew be already spied upon everything that said did reported consequently when reached khan took care to evince appearance of thoughtfulness uneasiness chatted with trader there upon commercial matter respecting advantage of cabul candahar a trading centre amount of tax laid upon good in two city other topic must naturally be of interest to merchant intending to establish in afghanistan be under uneasiness a to azim have instructed carefully in account must give of city from came merchant whose agent be route have followed other similar matter so story must correspond in respect when have lain down for night angus be able to think over quietly what be to be done a to remaining where be be clearly out of question for aught knew british force said to be gathering to advance on cabul might be month before be put in motion expedition might be abandoned altogether even if advance be made might not pas through candahar might be detained in city for indefinite time be evident therefore that must somehow escape question be how must be managed what disguise must adopt how must evade vigilance of who be watching matter be rendered more difficult by fact that there be practically two road open to that through kojak pas to quettah to north east through kelat ghilzye ghuznee to cabul if moved off of regular line of traffic must be unable to give reason for divergence in case must be subject to plunder even on road be only a travelling merchant must be respected a travelling merchant must be quickly overtaken by prince follower think a must plan occurred to at last went to sleep determining to consult azim in whose sharpness have much faith in morning accordingly a soon a be up sauntered across yard to where boy be watching horse feed preventing other le fortunate animal from robbing azim said prince have suspicion of have a much a ordered not to leave town try think over manner in may get away if overtaken may not be recognized wish to talk with now because for aught know spy may be at present watching at mid day will come out speak to again in meantime think over now when horse have done feeding take basket go into bazaar buy food for dinner so that anyone who may be watching may suppose have merely be giving order what to purchase then went out into town spent morning looking into shop asking question a to price of good so that might appear to be ascertaining what profit must be made also went to several shop happened to be untenanted asked rent made enquiry about accommodation at dinner time went over to where azim be squatting attending to two earthenware pot be simmering over small charcoal fire be fanning to keep going can think of nothing master then to night azim after everyone be asleep get up quietly go round to back of khan will join there will talk over together be surprised if keep waiting time of people may sit up late talking can not move till be asleep be quite possible that someone who be lodging at khan may be watching be indeed late before talk ceased lay down to sleep angus waited for hour then got up quietly went out two minute later joined azim well lad have thought of plan yet nothing master unless leave animal good behind that must do angus said can get rid of good to morrow why leave animal because sir will be looking for man with fair complexion boy mounted on horse be so if left horse behind walked must be just a bad did not think of walking master thought that perhaps might buy camel go on must be better certainly azim might darken face in afghan dress might make way easily enough if be not that must be hotly pursued then man boy however be dressed however be travelling must be sure to be closely examined have said after pause might go a woman well wrapped up little more than eye must be seen might ride on camel might lead in way might pas a native of village among hill first difficulty however be how to buy camel have afghan dress if be sure be not watched must get to quiet spot change persian dress for go boldly into shop buy woman clothes for must then go down into quarter where tribesman encamp buy camel if be caught doing so must be almost proof positive be going to try to leave city in case must doubt be arrested thrown into prison at once might steal one azim suggested there be many always grazing outside wall while master be here doing business yes have not saddle however will think over azim idea about having camel have certainly shown way in can get away if be managed well ought to be able to find plan by can carry out be of use talking longer over there be hurry for day two longer appear to be really engaged in looking for place of business more careless watch may become angus did not go to sleep night thinking situation over in way decided that first step to be taken be to ascertain for certain whether be watched if be not matter must be comparatively easy if movement be followed must see way out of difficulty when paid usual visit to azim in morning said want to find out if be followed will walk straight along street towards southern gate when get to last turning to left will turn up then will be out of crowd do keep good long way behind will go on for distance then mount wall walk along there looking over country want to observe if man follows must be so far off even if look round will not recognize want to find out time who be can do later on only want to know if be followed time turn corner be likely to look round before turn so when see getting near corner have turned hide if can understand master accordingly when hour later angus came out lad waited for time then followed master be out of sight azim walked quickly till saw looking a usual into one of shop then dropped behind again followed slowly until angus turned off street that have named azim walked still more slowly on reaching corner saw considerable distance ahead there be few people about for beyond four principal street be many large open space dotted here there with ruined wall of house have stood there at time when city be far more populous than be at present angus be walking at steady pace a if have definite object in view of various people in sight only one who be about half way between azim be walking at anything like same rate hundred yard farther angus turned to right azim kept on until saw man be watching be close to point then stepped aside into empty piece of ground between two house minute later looked out man be no longer visible walked on fast until reached corner saw man again turn off after angus be near wall now boy went forward with greater caution than before when got to where have last seen master caught sight of on wall fifty yard away man who have be following have stopped at low wall over be watching angus furtively that settled point azim at once returned to khan be hour later before angus came in did not pay attention to azim went in engaged in talk a usual with of occupant be hour before came out to yard well lad asked be watched master man followed way hid behind wall to watch when went on wall thought at time might have crept up to stabbed if have wanted to of course must not without order must not have done at till be ready to go like stabbing anyhow still will think over come round again to same meeting place to night by time will have decided what to do chapter vi escape think azim angus said when met that night must buy clothes for may be pretty sure that one be watching must not get at shop in main street because there be always passer by who stop listen to bargain made there be by street where there be few shop of course will go into persian if give fair price not too high know so a to seem too anxious to buy suppose will trouble much what may want for must make out likely story say for example that master keep sharp look out over that want to be able to go out sometimes in such dress that must not know if met know that be good excuse be unable to think of better one will want will be long white robe coming over head down to eyebrow falling to foot white cloth coming across face below eye falling down over throat there be occasion to buy other garment rug torn asunder wrapped round waist falling to foot so a to fill up outside robe be will be required more think of azim greater appears difficulty about camel indeed now that have ascertained about spy seems to hardly possible to make start without being pursued at once azim nodded approvingly be just what think master must put knife into then trouble must be over like idea of killing man azim killed many men at herat be in battle be very different thing from stabbing man to enable to get away azim shook head be quite beyond be fighting against now master if prince find out that be english will put in dungeon most likely kill kill too so a to shut mouth man be paid to act a spy on why not kill thousand of people be killed died at herat can not understand why one man must not be killed when can perhaps get free away if be dead if found escaping attacked must kill azim be not englishman way to kill men except in fight azim shook head to mind be very foolish perhaps might make prisoner azim where must put in prison azim enquired with eye wide open in surprise mean in prison azim mean in empty house out of way place might tie arm leg gag be eye twinkled see master like to use knife good can bind hide perhaps one must come for long time may be year finding only skeleton must not bother about must just say be fellow killed by robber azim angus said in tone of horror never thought of such thing doubt someone must come along let out someone might come master might come few minute after have gone then must catch at once if someone did not come in hour why must come in week month angus be silent azim quite understand meant that must be gagged bound after dark then be left in place little distance from road where must not be seen till morning then first person who came along must turn aside look at must be loosed must have got twelve hour start must be good plan master how must get camel in case must make start without for might ride fifty mile perhaps good deal more than before must be discovered that have gone must do in present dress then must put on afghan clothes go into village off road say that horse be tired that wanted to go on so buy camel azim shook head anyone who wanted to go on fast master must not buy camel angus uttered exclamation of disgust azim struck blow at plan by saying how must get horse out master gate be shut at dark must not tie up spy till after gate be shut in morning might be found must be caught a went out be getting altogether stupid angus said of course be right horse must not be sent out beforehand for if spy saw going out must at once inform employer must be arrested ah have idea trader from scinde who arrived here yesterday be saying that a intended to stay here for time must sell horse if must get fair price for might say must buy two of a be better than mine a wanted to travel fast must give two money for dare say must be willing to do a horse must sell more easily than one can always sell poor horse while one might have to wait time before finding purchaser for good one suppose really there be much difference in value between mine must think be making good bargain must say that for certain reason must not be necessary to explain to must be part of bargain that must deliver outside city that one of men must take out during day wait for at spot must agree upon must be capital plan master then will carry out azim will get woman dress yes may a well do that may want sort of disguise before get down need not talk longer now at rate certainly will not try plan to morrow must not appear in hurry with trader there be several thing will have to talk over when have struck bargain with next night angus be able to inform follower that have made arrangement with scinde trader be to buy horse said will deliver in way want without saying evidently understood that wanted to get quietly out of city to escape trouble asked very reasonable price must have nothing to do with horse said that if there must be trouble about leaving change of horse might be noticed if said have bought of sold two of might get into trouble too however afterwards talked to one of other merchant who be going away in day two told that might be kept here for considerable time must therefore be glad to get rid of horse said must be glad to buy a be taking down number of heratee carpet other thing so struck bargain at once paid money gave receipt said that must continue to look after horse a usual until started so that matter be quite arranged scinde man will keep horse have bought with others till sends out through gate when doe so will put saddle on now for plan to morrow will go out a usual in morning spy will of course follow while be away make up rug disguise fasten upon saddle take to new horse so that trader servant will put on with saddle take out with horse before sunset be to stop at three palm tree that grow by roadside quarter of mile out of town even if spy be looking on a go out of yard will have idea have anything to do with horse when have seen to will buy twenty yard of rope for to get down over wall will start at about four o'clock will go exactly same way a did last time followed be very lonely part there be sure to watch very closely a will wonder why choose way for walk will stay there for bit will lean over wall a if be calculating depth intended to make escape there be sure to be intent on watching movement will get up a close a can then be time to steal up do think that can do without hearing if not must think that better plan will be for to hide close to way will come back will not return till be beginning to get dark will probably keep closer to than must going so a to better watch movement when come along will spring out knock down will a shout run back to assistance will not want assistance master azim said confidently be sure be quite a strong a be a will take by surprise will have difficulty in managing use sword azim master will get thick stick of course will bring rope with azim twenty yard will be ample to spare length to tie up with to reach to ground from top of wall may a well put enough food for couple of day in saddle bag supply of grain for horse then will not have to stop to buy anything day passed quietly azim bought heaviest staff that must find brought back stowed away during master absence a did not think that latter must approve of weight considered master objection to stabbing spy to be weakness be quite unable to understand at four o'clock angus started few minute later trader servant led two horse have bought through street out at southern gate azim waited till saw go a there be occasion for to follow spy closely indeed have be arranged that must not do so lest spy must time notice perhaps take alarm therefore strolled leisurely along until neared spot where angus be standing on wall spy have taken up post nearer to than before be evidently watching narrowly what be doing a might turn round suddenly azim seated behind ruined hut within couple of yard of road there patiently waited until a darkness fell angus came along be here master azim said take care of angus replied without stopping will probably have pistol certainly knife right master azim stood up now grasping heavy staff firmly in hand listening intently heard minute later soft footstep spy passed keeping eye fixedly on figure ahead of azim sprang out swinging staff round head brought with strength against back of man head just below turban fell without sound be down master lad cried angus who have be listening for sound of struggle have heard blow came running back why be almost like sound of pistol said a saw motionless figure yes master be obliged to hit hard because a said might have pistol have stunned angus went on going up to prostrate figure now cut off length of rope will tie up securely tied man leg then turned over inertness of body struck placed ear over heart be dead said be not breathing heart be not beating have hit too hard well did hit hard master be misfortune perhaps be for best undoubtedly be allah will that must die well can not be helped angus said undoubtedly will make safer for well let move on do go on master will take clothes off drag into hut may lie there for month before anyone come along look in very well will walk on to wall be long five minute later azim rejoined carrying bundle want to be bothered with clothes angus said master if left there might be found to morrow morning someone might recognize man by so thought must be better to carry away with for few mile then throw in bush have got pistol knife be well paid master have ten gold piece in sash here be put in own pocket azim want to have anything to do with be spoil azim who have compunction in matter at once put little bag into sash rope be now fastened to battlement slid down wall be about forty foot high unprovided with moat started at once for place where horse be to be waiting for quarter of hour brisk walk took there angus made present to man in charge of who while be tightening girth at once wrapped in blanket have brought out lay down to sleep till morning illustration azim surprise spy need not press horse angus said a rode off will certainly have twelve hour start hope twenty four depends on how often man report to employer who be doubt official at palace probably go once day though a there have be nothing suspicious about movement sign of intention of leaving may have be ordered to go only two three day unless have news to give of course in case be right if report evening how long start will get depends entirely upon what sort of man official be in case must hardly give thought to spy not coming in evening must suppose have be out till late when doe not appear in morning if official be of suspicious nature will enquire for man when be not found will send down to khan to see if be there to ascertain if thing be going on a usual when news be brought that man be not there that have be out night will become alarmed will go question trader there will doubtless ascertain have sold horse suppose will hear that have bought others trader will see that there be going to be trouble about be likely to hold tongue tell servant to be silent on subject a official must have reason for imagining that must sell horse buy others will conclude that have made escape over wall on foot be report will probably make to prince may safely calculate that will be afternoon before party of horse be sent off in pursuit by herat ghuznee quettah road will probably be instructed to enquire for two young persian on foot will lose time by stopping at village to make enquiry after going forty fifty mile will begin to feel sure that have not come along road have gone by one of others perhaps hidden up in village at distance from road may have instruction to go a far a quettah suppose get thirty mile before sunset certainly wo get farther than a will have to make enquiry will probably halt a soon a get dark will have start of nearly sixty mile before morning will hide up go on a soon a be dark will be thirty forty before start next day so will then be sixty mile ahead of within from twenty to thirty from quettah will skirt round town without going into then make down bolan pas think there be least chance of pursuit being kept up beyond quettah can travel at own pace down pas will have to lay in good stock of provision at last village pas before beginning to descend must travel at night for otherwise may be plundered by tribesman who have worst possible reputation how long be pas master fifty five mile long mr pottinger told say that be frightful place river run through in wet season anyone caught in must be drowned for in place side be perpendicular channel be only sixty seventy foot wide there be cave along there in tribesman hide rush out plunder often kill traveller must get through in two night must be extremely careful where stop for day choosing place where can hide horse well master azim said after pause if be will of allah that be to get through will if not not that be azim think that there be much fear of life know that traveller do use that pas believe generally pay so much to one of chief of tribesman will do same if on arriving at top of pas find that can arrange will want money to take from dadur across plain to indus be barren desolate country will have to buy supply at dadur coming down without merchandise tribesman will make sure that have money a must naturally have sold good brought from persia at candahar must intend buying fresh stock in india therefore may be sure that if captured must be stripped of penny have about rode for eight hour reckoned that have made fifty mile gave horse good feed lay down until daylight for be now at foot of kojuk gorge so steep difficult that must not be passed at night just a be starting three tribesman rode up in name of local chief demanded two gold tomauns one for horse rider a tribute for free passage a money be paid without question rode off without giving further trouble passage be long difficult in many case have to lead horse once through allowed animal hour rest feed then mounting rode on briskly again few mile farther on halted in clump of tree slept until then rode twenty mile a speed be of le consequence than keeping horse in fair condition turned off at little stream followed for mile up then halted in dip through ran here there be good grass for horse remained for rest of day until within three hour of daybreak next morning a angus have calculated saw at sunrise mud fort town of quettah standing on rocky eminence made detour came down upon road again round town then rode briskly down shawl valley country round be rich fertile dotted with village orchard vineyard stopped late in afternoon at village near entrance to pas two armed men came out from hut a drew up leader said chief be master of pas traveller find wise to pay for right of passage that be ready to do angus said doe chief guarantee that will go unmolested down to dadur chief can not guarantee that can only guarantee from hurt damage from people be lord of eastern side of pas there be others men of account who own chief among mountain to west sometimes waylay traveller chief punishes when can do so be seldom that be able to catch doe that can for wish well to trader others who pas along for when ill happens to others be afraid to pas loses tribute when large caravan come up be able to pay handsomely furnishes escort of twenty men more will not send le than twenty for smaller party might not be able to defend caravan must suffer loss of honour from failing to give protection to to whom guaranteed can not afford to pay for escort of twenty men have little to be robbed of for see carry merchandise having disposed of what bought at herat candahar sent proceeds by sure hand back to persia a attire gave sign of being men of substance tribesman said in case will only have to pay one tomaun be price for man horse same for camel horse load of good be regular toll that can pay a to brigand speak of must take chance handed money to man who in return gave little white red flag be to show must encounter of tribesman stopped here day purchased food for journey must think must be very good thing azim angus said in afternoon if must engage guide might break neck making way down here in dark will speak to two fellow suppose be on duty here can not go there may be others of tribe in village if not of people here may be accustomed to going down pas with caravan angus went to hut occupied by two tribesman called out be intending to travel at night said after offering packet of tobacco in way may escape being seen by brigand will be almost impossible for to go at night quite impossible without guide be what came to about be there of tribe who must act a guide for how long must take must take four night journey must do in two stage if horse be sure footed travelled in day at night must take four at least how much must be willing to pay how much must be charged angus said quietly must have two men man answered two men who know pas well yakoob must go with have be here six day two others will come to take place collect toll to morrow so will be free know foot of pas having travelled up down score of time can not guarantee safety must have better chance with than with others will take into dadur promise to fight when twenty attack four fighting be foolish have horse there be part where pas open out bottom be level well how much must charge two men talked together in undertone then one who have before spoken turned again to angus must take for three gold piece be large sum angus said a hear in village that be not safe to go unless with large caravan that might be three week month before sufficiently large number of traveller arrive will pay that be bargain then man said have best start at four o'clock descent here be very steep be not overlooked from hill to west therefore can go down there by daylight then rest horse for hour move forward again when be quite dark have better buy four black blanket to cut up tie round horse foot so that when be passing bad point where brigand generally lurk noise will be made in climbing over boulder slipping on smooth rock will be necessary of course to get food for for horse will buy that to morrow angus said suppose must be of use taking torch might take man said in place rock be so steep that one must look down from above at point there be cave where thief must be hiding must certainly get on good deal faster with torch will take then have ever be through by night before man shook head have not be seldom attempted be because be willing to travel so that be ready to accompany for brigand must expect one at time will most likely be asleep then if be attacked must be taken prisoner man said there be many place where hill can be ascended by men who know must be attacked near one of spot must leave horse fly be what must do what must advise to do also man life be worth more than horse saddle of course in daytime there must be escape in way for must bring down with matchlock at night must elude if did follow must defend taking shelter shooting a came up well be satisfaction anyhow angus said that there must be chance for horse be good beast value life more think be honest fellow went on after telling substance of conversation with tribesman say that afghan have treacherous disposition believe men can be trusted to keep engagement did not exaggerate difficulty of journey a must have done did pretend that must join in hopeless fight in fact although of course actual difficulty of journey must be very much greater in dark than in daylight evidently considered that danger from other tribesman must be by mean great be however terrible journey angus felt that without guidance of tribesman must have be impossible one knew exactly where river be fordable on side pas be most free from great boulder obstruction where torch must be safely used at time progress be terribly slow horse having to pick way among rock boulder taking more than hour to cover mile at other time be able to go at brisk walk even break into trot whenever neared spot where cave frequented by robber be situated horse foot be muffled be led with greatest care be indeed comparatively seldom that rider mounted where be dangerous to have torch walked along by side of horse allowing animal to pick own way be able to do better than must have done if led horse angus have bought having made ascent of pas be to extent accustomed to work not having to carry weight of rider be able save in exceptional place to get along more easily than angus azim be able to do of have many fall must have have many more have not guide at such time stood close beside rendered assistance often warning of obstacle of be unable to make out faintest outline several time saw glow of fire burning in cavern at such point strictest silence be observed have purchased afghan shoe at village round have wound strip of thick woollen stuff like felt so that step be a noiseless a of horse stirrup be fastened over animal back so a to avoid contact with rock slight sound might be made be to great extent drowned by murmur rattle of rapid stream long halt during daytime be made at point carefully chosen by guide at foot of precipitous rock fragment have fallen from above formed bank at short distance from foot greater part of rock having bounded outwards with impetus of fall between bank cliff there be depression partly filled with splinter of rock be however considerably lower than bank men horse stationed in be hid alike from observation from above from eye of passing along valley here slept on bed composed of saddle rug laid on rough stone guide by turn keeping watch a whole got on faster than guide have anticipated be fairly down at mouth of pas at daybreak on fourth morning after start here tribesman received pay angus adding pound to amount agreed on for care assistance given waited two day at dadur to allow horse rest here be fortunate in finding two men well acquainted with road have so far guided party who be proceeding up pas to quettah a be now returning be glad enough to accept offer of couple of pound to act a guide across desert in accordance with advice two rough pony be bought to carry water skin provision while smaller skin be to be taken on own horse a country to be traversed be for considerable distance waterless desert even part of journey must not be accomplished without danger for belooches of district be to man plunderer cared nothing for authority of khan of khelat distance from dadur to shikarpore be nearly hundred fifty mile across flat dreary country almost unpopulated a be unencumbered by baggage carried sufficient water for want of horse be performed in seven day at rojhan came upon captain thompson who be in command of party have gone forward to examine state of water supply if necessary to sink more well be surprised when young persian trader addressed in english informed that have just come through from herat be quite enough to assure warm welcome officer put up for night in own tent made in respect comfortable after hearing something of siege of herat of journey asked anxiously a to water supply in village on way to dadur on hearing that few of be much better supplied than rojhan threw up hand in despair two three thousand native ought to have be engaged said couple of hundred set to work to dig deep well in village hundred well must be little enough for army horse baggage animal native follower even when be dug water run into slowly have sent down report from here there be only three well one of sir alexander burnes sank when be here week ago others contain such bad water a to be quite unfit for human use be really frightened at thought of what will take place before army get to dadur however hear that will not advance for month that very energetic step will be made to secure water supply before come along on following day angus passed several working party who be engaged under superintendence of major leech assistant to sir alexander burnes for captain burnes have be knighted a reward for service in cabul with exception of party scarcely encountered human being on way down except in miserable little village be situated where soil permitted cultivation of scanty crop be for most part cut when green sold to passing traveller angus be heartily glad when shikarpore came in sight have learned from captain thompson shah soojah have arrived there with native army have raised that bengal army under general cotton have marched down by indus be expected to arrive there in day two that bombay army under sir john keane be few day behind upon entering town be glad to see british uniform in street addressing in english first officer met found that division of general cotton have arrived two day before have just come from herat angus said left there after siege be raised have despatch from lieutenant pottinger must be given to colonel pottinger to sir alexander burnes burnes be here think that colonel pottinger be at sukkar be there few day ago will find burnes at head quarter be political officer so forth of army macnaghten be envoy commissioner to soojah generally at head of political business army be encamped round town angus have difficulty in finding quarter of sir alexander burnes dismounting short distance away left azim to look after horse went towards tent be stopped by sentry who on learning that wished to see sir alexander called attendant latter coming up took angus name in reappearing at entrance almost immediately signed to to enter chapter vii in service be glad to see mr campbell sir alexander burnes said a lad entered tent colonel pottinger be asking only three four day ago to keep look out for have received letter from nephew saying that be going to travel down via candahar that be afraid that must not manage to get through received letter from lieutenant pottinger speaking very highly of service that have rendered understand that mr m'neill minister in persia spoke very favourably of in despatch to governor general how have got through have very little difficulty sir except be detained at candahar have to effect escape secretly gave short account of journey manner in have escaped from candahar avoided recapture managed very cleverly mr campbell will take in at once to macnaghten who be supreme here for shah soojah be at present little more than puppet have doubt that will be very glad to learn what be feeling throughout country a to shah soojah may tell in confidence that be convinced that terrible blunder have be made in taking up cause be a doubt know several month at cabul be convinced that dost mahomed be sincere in desire for friendship that can support against brother at candahar who have a know be intriguing with persia russia have along urged indian government to give warm support to enter into firm alliance with however governor general adviser have taken other view have only to do best to carry out order although have strongly represented own opinion think that government have idea of difficulty to be encountered so far a fighting go there be doubt that afghan can not stand against operation of feeding troop animal will be troublesome one indeed heat will increase day even march up to quettah will present enormous difficulty a who have just descended pas will readily understand great problem will not be how to place shah soojah on throne how to maintain there tell because macnaghten who really know nothing of matter be extremely sanguine warn that will be a well that must not express strong opinion against enterprise be determined upon will be carried out without in way shaking opinion must only set against might seriously injure own prospect a be have much to irritate there have already be serious trouble with ameer of scinde who have be treated in very high handed manner instead of being conciliated in possible way alone have vastly added to difficulty by rendering almost impossible to obtain carriage provision then differs greatly from general cotton who since arrival here two day ago have shown officer who have immense opinion of own dignity a general in command decline to take order indeed to listen to advice from macnaghten be certainly not macnaghten fault who although a consider mistaken in opinion be very conciliating in manner must willingly avoid friction can be disadvantageous to enterprise on have set heart cotton transport be really insufficient for own army shah soojah have hardly transport at cotton care not in slightest about shah shah army to say truth be of great value macnaghten however attache reasonably from point of view great importance to fact that shah soojah must appear a arriving to claim throne a independent prince with own army supported by ally british not a mere puppet forced upon afghan by british bayonet be therefore most anxious that force must occupy a prominent position a possible be a well for to give hint a to situation before see macnaghten to warn against speaking to strongly of hostile opinion a to shah soojah chance that may have gathered on journey when man have open mind be well to give side of case when have pledged reputation thrown heart soul into one side of case be worse than useless to endeavour to turn especially when die be cast day for drawing back be past if opinion gathered from nine month residence in cabul almost daily interview with dost mahomed have be altogether unheeded certainly yours gathered in passing trip through country must have effect beyond setting against thank sir will be careful indeed opinion must in case be of little value certainly conversed good deal with native on way from herat to candahar at city spoke only to persian merchant have intercourse whatever on way down except with guide in bolan pass well will call on now sir alexander burnes said taking cap mr macnaghten tent be next to own at once took angus in with have come mr macnaghten to introduce to mr angus campbell who have just come down through candahar from herat name be know very favourably mentioned by lieutenant pottinger mr m'neill have brought down letter of introduction to colonel pottinger know name well sir macnaghten said mr m'neill told that have be in service have gone to herat on mission to induce shah kamran to hold out to last that when siege be raised have started from there with intention of journeying down through afghanistan into scinde in hope of obtaining employment in capacity where knowledge of persian arabic must be of service also understand by lieutenant pottinger last despatch that have learned pushtoo governor general be very favourably impressed with report authorized to employ at once a one of junior assistant must think sir alexander that can employ mr campbell to greater advantage than can a work of making arrangement for advance of army be in hand will be very glad of addition to staff for a get on foresee that three officer who now assist will be altogether insufficient high term in mr m'neill lieutenant pottinger have written about fact that have be able to travel about country unsuspected show fitness for such work must understand mr campbell macnaghten said can not guarantee that position will be permanent one a such appointment in service must be confirmed by court of director will at once acquaint lord auckland of arrival here of nomination have doubt that will confirm so far a expedition continues will strongly recommend court of director that appointment to service will be permanent one in view of exceptional knowledge of persian pushtoo thank very much indeed sir will do best to merit good opinion a angus left tent with sir alexander burnes said be indeed obliged to sir have hoped that might obtain appointment of sort never hoped for one like be work too of others must like may rely on to carry out order to full extent of power have doubt will mr campbell be glad to have one of officer speak pushtoo for although in scinde afghanistan persian be language most spoken by upper class be of use with peasant in work of digging well bargaining for fodder for horse so forth pushtoo will be very useful for although differs from language of belooches be near enough for to understand of course when be once through bolan be language of countryman may ask what dress will be proper for to wear a be civil appointment will not wear uniform ordinary civilian dress if like dress of oriental character generally dress so certainly have advantage favourably predisposes chief may have to visit british uniform understand purely civilian dress be too simple for doe not convey sense of importance very well sir be glad that have decided so have civilian clothes with must find very difficult if not impossible to get here appointment will be thousand rupee month so long a campaign last after that must of course depend upon future employment might have if must like to draw month pay in advance can do so no thank sir be fairly provided with money have four officer employed on similar duty mr campbell will introduce to at once will of course mess with party major leech chief assistant be away on duty other three officer be at once sent for captain jones captain arbuthnot lieutenant macgregor wish to introduce to mr campbell whom have just appointed a one of political assistant have distinguished greatly under lieutenant pottinger throughout siege of herat be previously assistant to mr m'neill ambassador at court of persia speaks persian arabic pushtoo have be specially recommended to governor general by mr m'neill pottinger have now made way from herat through candahar fact that have done so safely show that know how to use language to advantage a lieutenant pottinger gallant defence of herat be theme of general admiration throughout india angus must not have have better introduction be warmly received by three officer who at once took away with will share tent with lieutenant macgregor said be alone at present have horse of course servant suppose have very fair horse excellent servant who be young fellow persian son of door keeper at embassy be with through siege found invaluable be strong fellow have plenty of courage shrewdness must never have got away out of candahar have not be for assistance sir alexander have advised to get eastern dress a can not wear uniform must see about at once for persian dress must in case have be out of place journey down bolan have ruined altogether in first place will be obliged if will tell where two horse be to be put up horse will be picketed

herat picked up language must converse in a fluently a angus be able to do although have pleasant recollection of journey from candahar felt sure that must be very different affair when accompanying british army expressed a much to master who said must not make so sure of azim have great difficulty in obtaining provision for ourselves will be very different thing with army of thousand of men with even larger number of camp follower five six thousand camel except just round one of little village did not see blade of grass from time left shawl valley how animal will exist till get up to quettah have idea once there doubt will do fairly well will have very bad time on journey unless be mistaken if have management of affair must send off at once whole of camel with sufficient escort a far a dadur there must leave provision forage took up return here to accompany army with further supply doubt must cause month delay must be better to do than to lose baggage animal to risk famine for troop believe captain arbuthnot said when angus joined others ten day supply be ready at dadur twenty day supply at quettah certainly there be supply at dadur when came through know nothing about quettah angus said still think that if supply of consequence have be collected there must have heard about from men who guided through pas there be troop there then not slightest sign of did pas on march down from candahar of course khan of khelat may have collected great force of belooches if did so must naturally keep at khelat until heard that army be approaching a must be immense deal of trouble to victual in pas know that mr macnaghten received news induced to believe that large force must be likely to march down from candahar that attitude of prince be altogether hostile be on account of news that be going to advance in two three day time instead of waiting for three week for larger stock of supply to be collected be ten day ago that commissary general sent off four thousand camel to bring up supply from rear however will be useful for bombay column be coming up a be arranged that will collect transport supply for therefore decision have be taken to march at once so that can ascend pas before enemy send sufficient force to hold against doubt report that be not going to leave here for three week have be sent up to candahar prince be sure to have agent spy here ought to be at foot of bolan before be known in candahar that have started a to khelat khan have sent in assurance of friendship expect will make safe by assuming neutrality belooches be warlike people born plunderer authority be very slight except in khelat district near be sure to have trouble with mountaineer beyond having to protect convoy strongly suppose will have serious fighting with expect that will be sent off to morrow next day to khelat quettah perhaps one of may even go to candahar know mr macnaghten think that possibly prince may not take active part on dost mahomed side everyone know that have great love for brother be not surprising for who be youngest of family have managed to secure sovereignty besides must see that if took up arm in favour whole brunt of fighting must fall upon for cabul must render real assistance be very shifty gentleman though may make show of force at first must probably be only for purpose of securing advantageous term for saw when be at candahar angus said at least one of questioned closely supposing to be persian just arrived from herat naturally said nothing about british invasion great anxiety be to know what intention power of russia persia be doubt plan be formed be entirely disconcerted by shah retreat from before herat saw sign of gathering of afghan be subject ever alluded to in conversation have with trader at place where lodged at moment native officer came in said that sir alexander desired to see captain arbuthnot jones a buckled on sword latter said have told about herat mr campbell evening hope will tell about journey down when officer returned angus found that arbuthnot be not mistaken a to probable work must have to perform for be to accompany major todd next morning with escort of cavalry for khelat be to see khan arrange with for supply to be sent to dadur captain jones be to remain there to see that promise be carried out arbuthnot unless learned that force from candahar have arrived at quettah be to go on there see to collection of grain cattle squadron of cavalry be going forward to morrow morning campbell four hundred labourer be going with be to be in special charge of half of of course will have eight ten headman will want looking after same be to dig well at burshoree other half under macgregor be to do same thing at meerpoor be thousand pity be not done before for army be to begin advance day after to morrow however will gain couple of day on be something if meet major leech who be at work improving road will of course report to will doubtless be able to advise a to best place for well angus news with much satisfaction in first place meant active work in second must save from slow toilsome march of army must felt sure be accompanied with enormous hardship four officer dined together sir burnes be not present a be dining with general cotton mr macnaghten after dinner angus related adventure at candahar how evaded pursuit passage through pas have hardly finished when be sent for to general tent have just be telling general cotton mr campbell said mr macnaghten that arrived morning from candahar wish to learn a much a can tell of state of pas at present of country between dadur place told that have not be able to find time to question on point in first place general said what be state of bolan a only travelled during night can not tell very much about river be not high there be difficulty whatever on score ground be generally extremely rough covered not only with rounded boulder by rock will prove very trying to foot of animal bandaged very thickly hoof of horse to deaden sound so saved from being lamed otherwise must certainly have be bandage be of felt be completely cut to piece first night after cut up one of water skin have with covered felt with leather even be cut to piece have to be renewed next night although be general character of pas there be place at by skirting foot of hill at point where pas open out hill be not precipitous although everywhere steep be possible for mounted men to go along at fast walk stone being much smaller like must think what have heard of sea beach though never saw one at least can remember still there be insurmountable difficulty mr campbell sir though there be place where certainly not more than two laden camel must pas abreast well next a to country between place dadur know about a far a edge of beloochee desert what be beyond did suffer from want of water sir at village where stopped there be always water there be a far a saw few small well must seem to very insufficient for supply of army train well be going to dig more well mr macnaghten said rather impatiently if water will run into three four well must run into fifty now about forage there be small patch of cultivation round of village at bhag more than elsewhere a lie nearer to foot of hill at meerpoor burshoree rojhan must not say there be more than twenty thirty acre of cultivated land at bhag be strongly advised to take road at foot of hill to dundeaver down to larkhanna from there to follow indus up to sukkar guide said must be more likely to be troubled by beloochees along route a be also twice a far took straight way here thank will not detain longer mr campbell be obliged for information that have given angus bowed retired felt that mr macnaghten be vexed that must not report better upon chance of obtaining sufficient supply of forage water felt that be clearly better that must give in plainest term true state of affair for when a be sure must be case there be immense suffering of men animal blame must fall upon if have given more hopeful account than fact warranted burnes sent for on leaving general tent did quite right in not giving rose coloured description of state of thing along line of march mr campbell of course mr macnaghten general cotton liked of in fact have slightest idea of trouble ahead of be inclined to view a pessimist however will not matter to very greatly whether macnaghten be pleased with not because report will be sent in to sort of work will not last very long have only undertaken because major garden general cotton quarter master general have be taken ill major craikie adjutant general will go forward with day after to morrow to superintend matter generally hope by time to have thousand more men for well digging major leech have gone to sebee to cut dam there on river naree be hoped will fill small water course greatly assist have more fear about forage than water can dig well cut dam ca get crop to grow at day notice however must hope for best next morning at three o'clock angus lieutenant macgregor started with labourer escort of fifty native cavalry be very glad to be off campbell macgregor said have be disheartening work for time somehow other nothing have gone smoothly since started of course be only sub certainly seems to that so far there have be enormous amount of unnecessary friction that chief have not gone right way to work believe in shah whom be going to force upon afghan dost mahomed be worth dozen of one who know anything of affair of afghanistan be able to understand why lord auckland macnaghten rest of must ever have conceived idea of supplanting man who have shown really desirous of alliance friendship who undoubtedly posse support of majority of countryman by one who have never shown talent who have party whatever in afghanistan be member of discredited fallen family still be affair matter have be complicated by manner in emir of scinde have be treated instead of regarding a have always shown a friendly to have gone out of way to render hostile by manner in have in absolute contradiction of term of treaty with compelled to furnish carriage provision money have be conquered country must not have carried matter with higher hand will be sure to lead to trouble day certainly add immensely to difficulty now very fact that in day when be for short time ruler in afghanistan soojah advanced sort of preposterous claim of suzerainty over large portion of scinde be in reason why if took absurd step of placing on throne of cabul must have advanced from peshawur through jellalabad direct instead of taking roundabout journey through scinde of course there must have be great difficulty in khyber must have have to encounter fierce opposition from hill tribesman will have to be met in case after installing soojah at cabul must have gradually extended power ours for of course must be puppet in hand through ghuznee to candahar of course wo hear talk like among officer of bombay bengal army know care nothing about matter be just among men who have be employed here in north who know something about that there be doubt a to wisdom of affair know burnes considers that whole thing be mistake colonel pottinger who a resident in scinde know great deal about afghan say little know that disapproves of so think do of junior who have worked under with burnes up in punjaub have of course always taken interest in affair of afghanistan especially since russian influence have become so preponderant in persia well can only hope for best do best in own little way thank goodness come of have responsibility in affair really know very little about angus said do know that will be terrible business getting army to quettah directly be determined to come way arrangement must have be made to dig sufficient well to ensure supply of water at watering place to collect store of forage grain really see how be to be done now from must hear a came down there will be lot of trouble with beloochees difficulty of advance have already be felt great number of camel have died between sukkar shikarpore accompanied party of well digger be enfeebled looked a if have accomplished long forced march instead of strong fresh animal one must expect to see setting out on enterprise first halting place be jagan next day started at same early hour proceeded to janeedera here have passed beyond boundary of scinde ameer have entered territory over khan of khelat held nominal authority at place there be small mud fort outside of straw have be collected for use of cavalry to guard small party of shah soojah troop have be posted however have be attacked driven off by beloochee band straw carried away however there be sufficient water in well for men animal next day march be long one at rojhan certain amount of forage have be collected there be fair supply of water country so far have be barren with occasional bush beyond rojhan have nothing absolutely flat surface of sand without blade of grass bush to break level expanse across desert party toiled on for twenty seven mile little water be carried by camel supply be soon exhausted with parched lip throat men plodded on knowing that until end of journey water must be obtained word be spoken during painful journey passing over ground a came down at canter angus have thought little of have done in le than four hour there be trouble from dust be very different now be fourteen hour from time of starting before reached burshoree mounted men having to accommodate pace to of labourer dust rose in dense cloud part of cavalry rode ahead rest mile behind main body of footman before journey be done began to straggle dust have time to settle before horseman came along fully labourer indeed threw down on sand incapable of going farther lay there until cool evening air revived be long after midnight before many of reached burshoree here considerable number of well have already be dug by party under major leech water be muddy trickled in slowly still be water men horse drank eagerly a fast a must be brought up in bucket emptied into trough have be erected although village mere collection of native hut surrounded by wall a protection against plundering beloochees offered most uninviting prospect angus be well pleased that have arrived at end of journey have not like macgregor day march to perform latter started a usual at three o'clock hour later angus with difficulty roused two hundred weary men set to work promising that if laboured hard must allow to rest during heat of day cheered by promise labourer set to work under headman of have charge of twenty workman be divided into two gang worked well close together angus have nothing to do save to exercise sort of general superintendence soil became much more firm few foot below surface a side stood satisfactorily be not necessary to make well of great depth be found that four men only must be employed on two working in bottom others bringing up earth with bucket rope consequently number of well be largely increased after three day of prodigious toil water be reached in majority of well by end of fourth day fifty have be added to already dug liquid however oozed in slowly when well be emptied be two three hour before water must again be drawn from thus although amount must be obtained altogether be considerable be still wholly insufficient for supply of army five twenty of native cavalry be kept constantly on alert for party of plundering beloochees hovered round several of well digger who in spite of order ventured to wander distance away be robbed killed next morning general thackwell with body of cavalry small force of infantry irregular horse rode into place brought with order from sir burnes for angus to accompany well digger be to remain there continue work general have intended to stop there for two three day finding that forage must be procured started next morning early rode through meerpoor to oostar distance of twenty seven mile where a have be reported by major leech there be small reservoir of water store of straw grass have be collected angus stopped for hour at meerpoor have talk with macgregor whose men have also accomplished great deal of work who bewailed fate at having to remain there instead of going forward with general thackwell chapter viii advance cutting of dam of naree did not afford so much aid a have be hoped for for thirsty soil absorbed water almost a fast a poured out be not until many day later that began to fill little irrigation canal at village through army passed after resting two day at oostar force proceeded to bhag town of size here water be found in abundance grain in considerable quantity also supply of carrot be eagerly purchased by officer for use of horse at various place where halted angus acted a interpreter rode out with small body of cavalry to village at learned certain amount of forage must be obtained at bhag to great satisfaction sir alexander burnes joined party have paid visit to khan of khelat obtained from stringent order to headman of village others to do in power to aid army inhabitant be to be set to work to dig hole for must receive payment from british khan also promised to despatch to dadur what supply must gather explained that unfortunately there be much greater difficulty than usual in collecting provision a previous season have be very bad one in many part of country villager have not be able to gather sufficient for own need a angus have heard same at candahar at village near quettah from guide there must be doubt that excuse be genuine one indeed officer who have be engaged in scinde in country bordering indus affirmed that supply obtainable there be also vastly smaller than have be anticipated throughout next week angus be continually employed in riding among town in khanate interviewing headman expediting despatch of convoy be always accompanied by troop of cavalry for plundering party of beloochees be making way on side towards line followed by army where murdered straggler captured lagging camel be so bold that ventured close to outskirt of village occupied by british camp robbed native of money paid for forage grain rendered necessary that convoy must be protected by considerable escort after week of work angus received order to join force be gathering at dadur during last two day march difficulty with regard to water have disappeared village have be situated on bolan river little irrigation canal enabled cultivation of considerable tract of country to be carried on supplied forage in sufficient quantity for first division of army came along dadur town of four thousand inhabitant stand on eastern branch of bolan river whose bank be fringed with high reed grove of dwarf tree country round be well cultivated field be covered with young crop of wheat barley close to town be garden whole presented agreeable appearance to troop who have for nearly three week be painfully making way across country even at best point be little more than sandy desert here angus again met sir alexander burnes who have be making greatest effort to accumulate supply at town success however have be very small have major leech who be also at dadur be more fortunate have be reckoned that twenty day supply for whole army must have be accumulated there not more than sufficient for two three day have be gathered general cotton on arriving there with bengal army decided that be necessary for at least portion of army to advance without delay sir alexander burnes started at once with major cureton of th lancer with troop of regiment three company of native infantry strong party of sapper miner to survey pas up to quettah major leech be sent to khelat to maintain strong pressure upon khan be still hoped that store might be collected by time bombay army came along report sent down be satisfactory inasmuch a physical difficulty of journey be concerned in spite of fact that heavy rain have fallen river have not risen sufficiently to interfere seriously with passage of troop animal on th of march horse artillery nd light cavalry th regiment of line th native infantry started early in morning forded by torchlight bolan river at eight o'clock pitched camp in valley where be to rest for day road have so far offered difficulty except that river have to be forded fewer than eight time baggage animal started at midnight have already arrived tent be pitched with difficulty owing to rocky nature of ground necessitated use of iron tent peg instead of wooden one previously used fortunately owing to pause have be made by advance party at dadur abundance of succulent food have obtained there animal have recovered to large extent from previous fatigue hardship journey through pas be accomplished with le loss suffering than have occurred during march from sukkar vast number of animal however died troop who have started full of life strength be sadly changed many of being utterly worn out mere shadow of former self rumour have precipitated march by three week upset transport arrangement caused so vast amount of suffering proved to be false forward movement have be made by candahar prince except for little trouble with marauding villager march be entirely unopposed once in shawl valley fatigue of army be over for time in spite of effort of sir burnes assistant only very small amount of food forage have be collected in readiness for so small indeed be supply that be necessary to place troop native follower on reduced ration of flour rice ghee meat however be plentiful proceeding of khan of khelat be not of character to inspire confidence in while protesting strongly friendship for told officer frankly that be certain shah soojah must not retain position for day after british troop marched away that whole feeling of country be against that although have advanced with only native army raised by might have be accepted people must never submit to sovereign thrust upon by british bayonet opinion differed much a to sincerity who doubted pointed to fact that although be said to have large store of provision at khelat have scarcely sold to troop have failed in promise in direction on other hand sir burnes maintained that store of provision spoken of did not exist that in case having belief in possibility of shah soojah maintaining be natural that must hang back until saw how matter went for if be to give active aid to british must be considered traitor by countryman must imperil khanate life when protection be withdrawn from question be never satisfactorily cleared up of who took part in proceeding wrote on subject regarded a very ill used man while others considered measure afterwards taken against a being fully justified by conduct a be absolutely necessary that food must be obtained party be sent into village rigorous search instituted in way considerable quantity of hidden grain be discovered be taken paid for at market price in quettah one very large store be found taken up for use of army climate be pleasant in spite of reduced ration men benefited by halt be not without excitement for large band of plunderer hovered round attack be frequently made upon party going out with camel to graze expedition to punish village to marauder belonged be undertaken at length general sir john keane who be in command of whole expedition arrived at quettah to satisfaction of army for be thought that decision must now be arrived at be evident to that unless something be done famine must ere long stare in face european troop must indeed exist upon meat native troop camp follower greater portion of whom be not meat eater be already in sore distress supply of grain rice barely sufficing to keep life together hope be justified a soon a general arrived head of department be assembled arrangement be made for advance greater portion of bombay army arrived soon after commander although men be still weakened by privation army be in most respect perfectly capable of carrying out work successfully there be however one serious drawback threatened to destroy efficiency horse of cavalry artillery animal of transport be so weakened by want of grain hay that be altogether unfit for hard work be upon th of april that army moved forward seven week having elapsed since started from shikarpore march to candahar be long painful several pass have to be traversed food became more more scarce hundred of animal died daily beloochee plunderer during first portion of journey afghan raider during second hung along line of march murdering who straggled capturing camel at time even threatening attack in force be able to do a cavalry horse be so broken down that must scarcely proceed beyond walk candahar prince with large following came out to give battle hajee khan kakur one of leading chief have be bribed by political officer deserting came into camp with large body of follower so disheartened prince excited so much fear among of further treachery that withdrew at once to candahar few hour after arrival there took northern road after immense suffering from want of water food army entered city on th of april shah soojah having gone on with hajee kakur made formal entry into town two day previously angus have have little to do during march from quettah chance of obtaining forage food at deserted village near line of march be so small that sir john keane decided that must be useless to endeavour to obtain anything there especially a officer leaving main body have to be accompanied by strong escort to protect from band of marauder be deemed inadvisable to give horse work must be avoided angus own animal being accustomed to country suffered le than from plain in order to spare a much a possible keep in condition that must be fit for work be ordered to make expedition generally walked by side greater part of day preferring indeed to sitting on horseback moving at snail pace necessitated by difficulty of road slow progress of weakened animal of baggage train among mortality have be terrible one writer estimated that fewer than thirty thousand transport animal died on road between sukkar candahar shah soojah have at first established in camp outside city two day after arrival of army took up abode at palace be accompanied by own official by macnaghten burnes assistant what be smiling at campbell lieutenant macgregor who have be companion tent fellow since left dadur asked a rode together into city be thinking of difference between position in procession fact that be going to take up quarter in palace position occupied when be last here pretended trader suspected watched obliged to escape by night yes be change certainly macgregor said one for better though after what have gone through may have to go through before leave wretched country think must be safe to assert that be le dangerous now than be then from time left shikarpore till arrived here three day ago have never have decent meal have practically never have enough to eat have suffered horribly from thirst have never dared to ride hundred yard beyond column camp have lived in fact dog life not life of respectable dog in england of starving cur in indian bazaar know much about future suppose will suffer from hunger thirst a have done danger of other kind will certainly not be abated everything look enough here think there be enthusiasm at for soojah there be doubt that prince be hated people heartily glad to be rid of fancy that will not have much difficulty in reaching cabul say ghuznee be strong place have taken score of place in india that native considered impregnable still considering way in marauding afghan hover round think will have very uncomfortable time of a soldier be not at first allowed to enter city merchant there speedily established temporary bazaar outside wall here vendor of rose water of sherbet of drink concocted of juice of fruit took up stall people from country round brought in load of lucerne wheat barley wood chopped straw other merchant displayed posteens pelisse made of sheep skin with wool inside embroidered outside with blue red yellow thread fowl sheep onion milk tobacco spice be also on sale before long horse dealer of herat brought down large number of good animal be eagerly bought up by officer who have lost charger a soon a soldier be allowed to enter town poured into wheaten cake cooked meat mulberry tempted appetite little later plum apricot be brought in in great profusion scene in street be very amusing british soldier sepoys with large variety of uniform mingled with people of town country round of wore long cloak of chintz woollen cloth with large turban hair beard moustache being allowed to grow very long beard being dyed red others be closely shaven dressed in jacket trouser of blue linen tunic of brown cloth with long hanging sleeve head being protected by skull cap of various colour with may heat already have be great became even more oppressive water be abundant troop camp follower be still on short ration of food price of grain be enormously high there be chance of magazine being replenished until field be ripe for harvest be not until nearly three week after possession be taken of capital that force be despatched under brigadier sale in pursuit of prince grievous mistake for shah soojah have entered candahar on day left a be greatly encumbered by baggage train lady of harem host of camp follower might easily have be overtaken whereas after escape became centre of intrigue against ameer in june harvest ripened large quantity of grain be bought up by commissariat preparation began for advance to cabul candahar be quiet apathetic so far sign be visible of enthusiasm for new ruler among people not only did none of neighbouring chief come in to pay allegiance shah order be everywhere disregarded marauding band harassed sometimes attacked convoy coming up even close to city be dangerous for soldier to move many hundred yard beyond limit of camp health of troop be far from good plain of candahar fertile a be be unhealthy a water can be found everywhere six seven foot below surface native troop suffered comparatively little european soldier be attacked by dysentery jaundice fever large number be carried off by disease at end of june necessary amount of grain be accumulated by arrival of large caravan from army be now to cut entirely free from former line of supply must have to depend solely upon country for food a ever increasing boldness of beloochees in bolan pas of afghan marauder between quettah candahar have made impossible for convoy unless very strongly guarded to make way up advance began at two o'clock on morning of th four hour later after passing through fertile district troop encamped at village of killa azim here obtained barley for animal peasant from other village brought in abundance of chopped straw for camel at midnight trumpet sounded hour later army moved forward again a far a kheil four day further march brought to kelat ghilzye chief town of ghilzye tribe two three hundred of horseman galloped away a troop approached marching ten mile day army followed valley of turnak afforded ample supply of water for need country be mountainous desolate dreariness being only broken by small village with orchard patch of cultivated ground grain be brought in in abundance force be now far above plain heat ceased to be oppressive even in middle of day morning evening be delightfully cool nevertheless number of sick increased owing to bad quality of flour absence of vegetable country now became more thickly populated little village with fortified dwelling of chief being thickly scattered about hostile tribesman followed march on flank many skirmish took place on one occasion ghilzye marauder made attack on line of march be driven off with heavy loss on th nephew of ameer rode in with fifteen follower have gone to ghuznee with brother to aid in defence suspicion being entertained by mohummed hyder governor of fidelity brother be seized put to death only escaped similar fate by flight a approached ghuznee sir alexander burnes said to angus mr campbell will be glad if will resume afghan costume ride to morrow at daybreak with party of six of hajee khan kakur men ascertain whether enemy be in strength outside fortress intend to oppose approach if do will leave baggage here under strong guard proceed to attack if retire into fortress will advance a have be doing for possibly siege may last time must be a well to take ammunition store with will undertake mission wish of course to approach enemy very closely will naturally take for party coming to join will pay attention to mile will be near enough for to go to fortress disguise be only necessary because too may have party out must come suddenly upon must pas without suspicion question indeed must be stopped knowledge of language be quite good enough to pas in case have requested hajee khan to choose well mounted men will remain here to morrow general will send out troop of cavalry to meet on return way between ghuznee so that must be pursued will know that will meet with succour before going many mile fortress be twelve mile from camp will undertake willingly sir alexander accordingly on following morning angus set out azim asked leave to accompany refused horse be not very fast one said be good beast may have to ride for life must soon be left behind be not dangerous expedition in country like there be always possibility of surprise after riding for two mile fortress of ghuznee be seen be situated on high rock surrounded by wall of great height strength be regarded by afghan a absolutely impregnable a approached must make out strength of fortification seemed to angus except by famine must be next to impossible to capture general have left few heavy cannon have brought with at candahar because of extreme difficulty of getting transport light field piece must make small impression indeed on massive wall when approached within mile halted there be sign of afghan force in front of be of course possible that might sally out when saw army approaching at present there be nothing to show that meant to do so be about to turn when be suddenly seized from behind in moment hand be bound tightly to side by sash of two of escort afghan burst into shout of triumph infidel dog one said did think because hajee khan kakur be traitor that men be also came to see ghuznee will see inside a well a outside angus be brave shudder ran through a thought of fate awaited afghan never spared who fell into hand fortunate be who be speedily killed for in many case be tortured before be done to death have never occurred to to doubt for moment good faith of men who accompanied yet now thought over possibility must have be foreseen since there be reason why men must be traitor to race although for moment have obeyed commander order ridden with into british camp might even have remained faithful to have not opportunity of rejoining countryman presented even in midst of own deadly peril be glad to think that by refusal to allow azim to accompany have saved from fate awaited knew well that entreaty must avail to soften heart of afghan commander determined that came must maintain firm countenance meet fate bravely gate of fortress stood open men a entered said few word to guard stationed there be forced said to accompany traitor hajee khan kakur to camp of infidel have taken first opportunity to desert have brought with man who be one of officer a prisoner why trouble to bring a prisoner thought that mohummed hyder must like to question be bringing here to show that be true men climbing steep road entered great courtyard here dismounted leader sub officer went forward to governor house followed by two others between whom angus walked leader entered others remained outside until returned follow with captive said mohummed hyder will speak to minute later angus stood before governor be seated on divan several other chief of importance be standing sitting round tell governor said that can speak tongue can do so angus said quietly where did learn in herat where fought during siege against persian now come hither a spy not a spy came here only to view fortress from distance be true that kafir be bringing big gun with a governor be doubtless well informed a to strength of british army number of gun angus felt that there must be harm in answering question be not said how do intend to take ghuznee will fly over wall burrow through rock governor said scoffingly be madman who think can tear down wall of ghuznee with finger nail know nothing of plan of general angus replied british have taken many strong place in india when seemed that must not be done will not take ghuznee when first shot be fired at wall will throw over to head limb to show that despise mock foolish effort take away yakoob do see safely bestowed angus be led to cell in one of turret on wall weapon have be taken from when be first captured when reached prison arm be unbound by leader of band who carried off sash to men to whom belonged massive door be closed behind angus heard two heavy bolt shot proof that tower be often used a prison listening heard door at foot of turret closed bolted window be mere loophole commanded view of road by have be brought up cell be circular in shape ten foot in diameter be absolutely bare angus stood for little time looking through loophole be three foot wide on inner side narrowed to six inch at outlet wall be more than two foot thick of solid stone be evident that there be possibility of escape said aloud a turned away from loophole even if must widen hole so to be able to creep through there be fall of hundred foot so there be nothing of rope must be made have knife said fortunately did not think of looking in pocket though have good long blade might at end sell life a dearly a possible force to kill can be of earthly use here for there be nothing to cut except rough plank in corner be suppose brought up for purpose other forgotten day passed slowly one came near until just a sun be setting two soldier came in bringing jug of water bread angus have little sleep that night dozed off occasionally hardness of stone floor cold speedily roused be glad indeed when daylight returned sun shone out hour later when looking from prison window perceived party of horseman long before must distinguish figure made sure that be british troop from fact that two three rode ahead rest evidently escort in close body behind approached within musket shot a soon a did so fire of matchlock broke out from wall drew off little then turned rode off there be doubt that be reconnoitring party who have ridden forward to ascertain best spot for attack two hour later three regiment of infantry came up followed by battery object of approach be to discover whether ghuznee be held in force for report have reached camp that greater portion of garrison have retired answered purpose for gun of fortress opened fire for hour there be exchange of shot between battery object of reconnaissance being fulfilled british returned to camp not until five o'clock be further movement perceptible then angus saw long dark line ascending pas on reaching head column made wide detour so a to keep beyond range of gun of fortress then entered rocky difficult country to east a knew that gate have be walled up with masonry with exception of through road from cabul entered have doubt that be intended to encamp on side thus cutting off fortress from relief by army assembled under of ameer son at same time preventing flight of garrison a long a be light column be still passing on long line of baggage waggon native follower guarded by body of troop against sortie might be made during night occasional shot be fired from fortress at various point of plain on surrounding hill fire raised gave indication of gathering of tribesman have indeed be painful difficult march several stream water course swollen by rain have to be crossed with enormous exertion whole force be established on following morning tent be erected along position chosen sir john keane accompanied by general cotton ascended height took survey of fortress decided upon plan of attack at two o'clock in afternoon body of afghan horse suddenly attacked camp in rear be beaten off by own cavalry angus heard outburst of firing concluded that governor must ere long carry out threat have idea what commander in chief plan be felt certain that attack when made must be sudden sharp must be in nature of surprise for in other way did seem possible that force however strong must without artillery capture place in case there be just possibility in excitement of moment existence must be forgotten at rate said to will do what can to defer moment of execution suppose will be of smallest use a have nothing else to do will cut wedge a soon a attack begin in earnest will jam in round door for rest of day occupied in cutting strip of wood off plank fashioning wedge of made about four dozen work sufficing to keep thought from dwelling upon probable fate concealed in clothes then cut off stout piece of plank fashioned into form of short thick bat with to drive wedge into place then laid plank in place again with freshly cut side against wall swept up chip threw out of loophole thought probable that sir john keane must attack without delay a be important to capture citadel before relieving army from cabul force of three four great chief be also in neighbourhood must join hand attack in rear while powerful garrison sallied out fell upon in front chapter ix just in time plan of british general for capture of ghuznee be bold one knew that little gun must make impression upon wall that must take week before must be possible to effect breach idea be to blow in gate to pour troop in through opening plan be admirably laid at midnight six company of infantry established in garden to right left of spot where assaulting column be to take up position ready to advance a soon a gate be blown in two hour later three company of native regiment made detour took up position to north of fortress field artillery took up post on height at three o'clock in morning infantry on north opened musketry fire at same moment artillery on hill began brisk cannonade while camel battery directed fire against wall gun of fortress at once replied wall be fringed with musketry fire be still hour to daylight when captain thompson of royal engineer with party of men crept forward to gate carrying with nine hundred pound of gunpowder in twelve sack movement be altogether unobserved by garrison who have be taken completely by surprise by sudden fire night have be exceptionally favourable for attempt wind blew so strongly that tramp of column sound of wheel of gun failed to reach ear of sentry on wall when fire broke out afghan at once burned number of blue light to endeavour to obtain clear view of attacking force light failed to pierce darkness firework burned fitfully owing to force of gale therefore distributed along whole circuit of wall instead of concentrating upon point where attack be about to take place engineer have done work admirably crept silently along causeway afforded passage across moat then up steep ascent led to gate unnoticed by who manned loophole two minute sufficed to place sack in position fuse be then fired party ran back to such cover a must find at moment afghan lit large brilliant blue light immediately over gate before must obtain idea of what be passing below explosion took place gate be blown to piece mass of masonry fractured beam fell into passage beyond then bugle be sounded by engineer storming party rushed down crept into dark blocked up passage here be fiercely opposed afghan have rallied almost instantly from first surprise rushed down to defend passage desperate struggle took place in dark british valour be triumphant four company of nd th regiment fought way into interior of fortress have be at once supported by column behind commanded by brigadier general sale capture of ghuznee must have be comparatively bloodless a be advancing met one of engineer officer who have be terribly bruised injured by explosion upon being questioned latter said that gate have be blown in that passage be blocked with ruin a in case must have be madness to advance general ordered retreat to be sounded call be heard by leading company not obeyed instead of troop retreating halted irresolutely rather than carry out order most unwelcome can be given to british soldier fortunately engineer officer soon came along assured brigadier although passage be greatly blocked storming party have made way through whereupon column at once rushed forward delay however have given garrison time to rally large number have run down from wall to take part in fight many however despairing of successful resistance now that assailant have won way into town allowed storming party to pas then attempted to escape through gateway a did so general sale with head of column arrived desperate fight took place among ruin of gate general be cut down assailant endeavoured to complete work sale succeeded in grasping sword hand weakened by wound must have be overpowered have not officer run up severely wounded afghan struggle continued general managed to gain foot cut down assailant column be long time in passing over heap of ruin now further encumbered by wounded dead a soon a have entered reserve who have be suffering from fire of afghan still on wall followed while general sale division ascended steep path led to citadel rose far above rest of fortress reserve began work of clearing out afghan from house large number of afghan have taken refuge here a troop entered rushing out flung upon troop with fury of despair many of who have first entered exhausted by exertion be with wounded sitting in courtyard at foot of citadel upon fanatic rushed cutting slashing with keen tulwars alike at soldier who started to foot wounded on ground own horse who mad with terror be galloping wildly over courtyard series of desperate hand to hand conflict be waged until last of afghan be shot bayoneted wall be cleared with little difficulty many soldier be shot a passed through narrow street of native town resistance ceased at quarter past five thus in two hour quarter after first shot be fired fortress deemed impregnable garrisoned by three thousand five hundred men be captured ghuznee have be provisioned for six month so certain be mohummed hyder of ability of place to hold out that have brought with lady of zenana in spite of desperate nature of fighting not one of afghan who surrendered be injured be slightest insult offered to lady of zenana woman in native town troop who have ascended to citadel found gate open afghan prince having lost hope a soon a found lower fortress in possession of british be found hiding in disguise be brought before shah soojah latter magnanimously said to have be have be have deserved evil at hand have day behaved like brave man forgive thee past go in peace young prince be then handed over to sir alexander burnes for safe custody success have be cheaply purchased only seventeen non commissioned officer private have be killed eighteen officer hundred forty seven men wounded of afghan five hundred fourteen body be buried next day more than hundred fugitive be killed outside wall upwards of thousand horse great number of camel mule vast quantity of provision ammunition arm fell into hand of conqueror together with more than fifteen hundred prisoner over thousand made escape at first outburst of firing angus have sprung to foot a fight increased in fury be certain that night attack be in progress at once proceeded to drive in wedge have prepared just a have completed heard dull roar of explosion followed by loud excited shout noise of gale prevented from catching word have doubt however that gate have be blown in that mine have be driven into wall that explosion of immense charge of powder have effected breach then came sound of heavy continuous rattle of musketry cannon of fortress opened fire while of besieger answered by occasional fall of mass of masonry scream of woman have doubt that british artillery be now directing fire against citadel in order to add to confusion among defender of fortress illustration took down prop thrust suddenly with force through hole presently heard rush of foot up staircase then bolt of door be pulled back yell of rage surprise arose a door did not yield to push against staircase be very narrow one one person must mount at time a terminated at door one man only must use strength against angus felt perfectly sure that must need much greater pressure than to force open have already propped plank against stood with foot at lower end to prevent from slipping man next to door finding that did not yield began to hammer with hilt of sword soon desisted finding that blow did not even shake there be confused sound of talking then silence for few minute then there be renewed noise heavy blow be struck at door evidently large block of wood have be brought up did not greatly alarm angus staircase be circular one at most two men must work battering ram on account of confined space be necessarily short proving unsuccessful there be again silence after interval came blow of sharper sound axe of sort be being used during lull of wind sound of struggle below must be plainly heard a be now dawn angus must have seen be going on have not loophole be on opposite side from sharpness of sound have doubt that firing be in courtyard that countryman have effected entrance chopping went on regularly door be thick strong be hour before edge of axe first showed through five minute hole foot wide appeared four foot from ground at rate must be time before opening large enough for man to pas through must be made took down prop thrust suddenly with force through hole striking man who be wielding axe full in face there be terrible cry mingled with yell of rage from others presently pistol be thrust through hole fired have expected have stood back again again shot be fired be evident that there be unwillingness on part of assailant to try axe again presently heard shout from below word came up distinctly mohummed hyder order be that attack be to cease angus felt that be saved prince indeed seeing that be lost have sent officer in great haste to put stop to attack on prisoner cell no longer thought of carrying out former intention british army be not after impotent enemy to be insulted victorious one to be appeased a soon a be informed of attack on prisoner cell have sent off to put stop to have not be made by order be act of soldier on wall near who seeing that british have entered have determined to take vengeance upon captive few minute later angus heard triumphant cheer of troop a poured in through open gate of citadel be hour before contest in courtyard below on wall of fortress came to end shortly afterwards heard step approaching through hole in door saw british officer coming up stair behind be azim be glad indeed to see campbell officer said a caught sight of face have given up a dead when found that none of escort came back boy on questioning prisoner found out that be confined here came at once to tell see by state of door that have be standing siege be uninjured yes rascally troop seized suddenly brought here will tell about a soon a have unfastened door be first time ever heard of prison door having bolt on inside be not bolt a will see directly took minute to get wedge out macgregor then entered shook angus warmly by hand while azim threw on knee seizing master hand kissed again again tear of joy streaming down cheek where in world did get wedge macgregor asked cut out of plank took day yesterday to make mallet how plank came here know certainly saved life that wit campbell be capital idea first rate see there be blood on staircase plank came in useful again used a battering ram on fellow who be chopping a caught full in face blood be accounted for a see by opposite wall fired few shot through hole afterwards of course took good care to be out of line of fire well come along sir alexander have be asking about must get information might have be time before be set free have not be for boy on going down into body of citadel angus be most warmly greeted by sir alexander burnes other officer who knew for supposed that have be murdered explained to chief why life have be spared have narrow escape indeed latter said for have doubt that afghan must have carried out threat have attacked in regular way be quite in accordance with barbarous custom certainly wonder that did not kill when entered fortress macgregor then told manner in angus have converted little cell into fort have resisted successfully attack made upon very narrow escape indeed mr campbell sir alexander burnes said be fortunate indeed that piece of wood have be left in cell idea of cutting wedge from fastening door must not have occurred to everyone be most happy thought certainly be mean of saving life be treacherous business indeed of hajee khan kakur for have doubt that be concocter of plot have given strongest ground for suspicion ever since left candahar have continually be making excuse for lagging behind have strong reason for believing that if have failed here must at once have turned against think knew of sir when be seized trooper said think that because chief be traitor be traitor too fellow be very crafty mr campbell hajee have special reputation way having before now turned traitor in spite of promise vow may very well have instructed one of men to say in order that if contrary to probability ever rejoined army might be shielded by repeating speech have never put trust in since joined though of course be politic to seem to do so a other chief might follow example be questioned very sharply a to order have given men when did not return afternoon of course swore by prophet that have chosen men in whom have greatest confidence be have doubt true however a be possible that might have fallen into ambush matter be dropped for time suspicion gained ground when a came up here sign of fight be discovered body of men horse intended to reopen matter a soon a thing be little settled down well can assure be heartily glad to see back again safe sound will not fail to report matter to sir john keane tell how cleverly escaped fate intended for army remained for week at ghuznee while preparation be being made for converting fortress into base from further operation must be carried on be thought well to pause so that full effect of disaster might be felt throughout country before advance began again fall of ghuznee have indeed entirely disarranged plan of campaign have be decided upon by dost mahomed fortress have be provisioned for six month be confidently believed that must resist attack for time with approach of winter position of besieging army must be desperate cold must be intense must be surrounded on side by swarm of fierce tribesman must be unable to obtain provision in country round must either retire through pass have ascended to candahar be forced by famine to surrender in former case disaster afterwards occurred in endeavouring to retire from cabul must probably have befallen plan be entirely brought to naught by fall of ghuznee six day later brother of dost mahomed arrived in camp with offer from ameer to surrender government to shah soojah on condition that must a head of barukzyes fill hereditary office of wuzeer prime minister a must have placed whole power of state in hand offer be refused on st of july army resumed march after three day march learned that kuzzilbashes have mutinied body of troop be of persian descent have for very many year formed important part of military power of cabul held position similar to of janizaries of constantinople mamelukes of egypt under very slight control be constantly causing trouble by insolence exaction now showed that entertained feeling either of loyalty gratitude towards dynasty served in spite of exhortation of ameer insisted upon granting discharge from service a be evident that news from ghuznee have so much dispirited whole army that reliance must be placed on fidelity unfortunate monarch be obliged to allow kuzzilbashes to disband rest of army to disperse to take to mountain a fugitive accompanied only by small party of personal follower force be at once sent in pursuit of a following of traitor hajee khan formed principal part of force double faced chief who desired to make safe turn affair might take so contrived that dost mahomed party be not overtaken in meantime main force marched forward to cabul wholly unopposed twenty two gun be found abandoned at spot where ameer army have dispersed placed in strong defile supported by large force of tribesman might have long resisted advance have kuzzilbashes other afghan horseman swept round on rear although british valour might have finally succeeded must only have be after terrible struggle now ameer be fugitive gun be in hand kuzzilbashes native tribesman have come in to salute new ruler nothing remained to enter capital in triumph entry took place on th of august ceremony be imposing one shah soojah after exile of thirty year rode at head of cortege on white charger with golden trapping wore jewelled coronet arm garment be ornamented with precious stone

extreme almost covered with orchard of peach other fruit under crop of sort grew luxuriantly on eminence commanding plain immense number of tribesman assembled to witness martial display on entering city victor found inhabitant clustered in street through passed to royal residence in bala hissar great citadel situated on hill commanding town so strongly fortified that must have be difficult to capture unless by aid of regular siege train aspect of inhabitant be perfectly peaceful there be shout exclamation of enthusiasm be evident from expression of satisfaction on face that majority be well satisfied with termination of rule of barukzyes whose exaction have pressed heavily upon dost mahomed be popular be affable kindly in disposition decision on matter brought before be just fair be accessible to having complaint to bring before have possessed body of trustworthy infantry to overawe marauding kuzzilbashes semi independent chief there can be doubt that rule must have be wise beneficial one shah soojah be reverse of rival haughty arrogant regarded treated with contempt new subject seldom granted audience troubled in way with affair rarely went abroad remained in almost constant seclusion in palace shop of cabul excited admiration of officer men of british force probably nowhere else in world must such display of fruit have be collected here be pile of peach equal to finest product of english hothouse grape of five variety rosy apple juicy pear several delicious kind of melon almond pistachio nut walnut quince cherry red white mulberry vegetable of kind butcher

unfortunately for moral of army there be also manufactory of spirit since leaving candahar spirit ration have be served out troop have greatly benefited in health during arduous work by privation power to purchase vile spirit at very low price now tempted many into drinking to intoxication lowered at once health discipline mr macnaghten staff have fine building in bala hissar allotted to sir alexander burnes with assistant occupied house in city position of burnes be unsatisfactory one have right to expect that after previous residence in cabul must be appointed british resident there have only accepted secondary position upon understanding that macnaghten appointment be temporary one have on way up rendered much valuable assistance have strictly defined duty opinion be seldom asked if given be wholly disregarded for be somewhat to blame temperament be changeable one at time be full of enthusiasm saw everything in rosiest light at other time be depressed despondent came to be regarded a prophet of evil having serious work to occupy mind worried over trifle exaggerated importance of bazaar rumour be often filled with gloomiest anticipation war have be undertaken altogether in opposition to advice have be most favourably impressed with dost mahomed remonstrance against attempt to force shah soojah on afghan have be so strong persistent that home government in defending from public indignation excited by subsequent disaster even went length of suppressing of despatch garbling others after be no longer alive to proclaim falsification once at cabul opportunity for doing useful service came to end macnaghten who be always sanguine to extent in light of subsequent event seemed to border on insanity be powerful with new ameer expression of opinion ran counter to own be in highest degree distasteful to be only in negotiation for supply of troop with petty chief burnes staff found employment although pushtoo be language of country people who came in with good inhabitant of cabul almost universally spoke persian angus campbell azim found quite at home among on rd of september force under colonel wade have advanced through khyber pas arrived at cabul be mixed body composed principally of pathan sikh have met with comparatively small resistance have rendered valuable service a large force have be detached from dost mahomed army to oppose advance thus greatly weakened army with ameer have intended to meet british advance from candahar afghan force have be recalled in haste after news of fall of ghuznee have not arrived until after disbandment of ameer army flight to bamian pas when have also broken up wade be therefore able to reach cabul without opposition be now necessary to decide what must be done with army of occupation macnaghten be pressing by constant succession of letter large reinforcement must be sent up in order to win back for shah soojah territory have once formed part of afghan empire urged that in order to check russian aggression army must not only occupy herat must extend operation until became paramount at bokhara while on other hand peshawur territory wrested from afghanistan by sikh must be reconquered sikh nation be becoming more more hostile to must be brought into subjection fortunately lord auckland now freed from pernicious influence of macnaghten surrounded by discreet counsellor be by mean disposed to turn favourable ear to fantastic project cost of army of occupation be heavy drain on revenue of india so far from assistance being rendered by afghanistan shah soojah be constantly clamouring for subsidy to enable to maintain position absence of so many troop be also much felt in india for be greatly needed on frontier of beloochees a well a of sikh macnaghten have so persistently asserted that shah soojah be personally popular with afghan that be decided that only comparatively small force be needed to uphold authority in case dost mahomed must make effort to recover throne order be given that greater portion of bombay army must march down through kojuk bolan pass most of bengal troop through khyber leaving six regiment with proportion of artillery at cabul with garrison at ghuznee candahar quettah jellalabad macnaghten in vain remonstrated entreated be settled that movement must begin at end of september so that troop must regain plain before winter set in in earnest september passed quietly climate at time be perfect troop enjoyed rest with abundance of fruit vegetable there be review race shah soojah established order of knighthood held grand durbar at principal officer be invested with great ceremony with insignia of new order on th of month bombay column started on march news having be brought down from force have occupied bamian pas that dost mahomed be collecting formidable army authority be induced to maintain great portion of bengal force round cabul great difficulty arose with reference to provisioning troop through winter there be abundant accommodation for in bala hissar citadel shah soojah strongly objected to presence of large body of troop there macnaghten with usual weakness gave way on th of october sir john keane with portion of bengal force be to return set out ameer left two day later to spend winter in more genial climate of jellalabad macnaghten accompanied sanguine a be must not help feeling uneasy at situation british occupation have greatly benefited merchant trader farmer cultivator of cabul have seriously injured poorer portion of community natural result of so large army well supplied with money being stationed in city be to raise price of article of consumption prodigiously to cause wide spread discontent exaction of native tax collector pressed heavily upon tribesman british officer by term of treaty with shah soojah be unable to interfere in way with internal affair of country when native revolted against unjust exaction be who be called upon to suppress consequently infidel supporter of ameer became more more hated by people be soon dangerous for to go beyond limit of camp ameer resented state of subjection in considered that be held though must not dispense with british bayonet british money macnaghten left behind experienced administrator burnes conolly leech todd lord have long acquaintance with country if anyone must under such circumstance have reconciled country to foreign occupation must have done so chapter x mission wish that have trustworthy news of what dost mahomed be doing sir alexander burnes said one morning when assistant be talking over work for day of course one hears from hindoo merchant what rumour be circulating be so contradictory that be not to be relied upon one day be said that dost have retired to bokhara that have already gathered formidable force be certain that if doe not recross bamian soon will not give trouble till spring for doubt whether even afghan hardy a be must traverse pass when winter have fairly set in still must be very useful to to obtain sort of inkling a to what movement intention be may intend to make bold stroke to recover kingdom may wait until there be popular rising here in first case force here must be maintained at present strength must be well to warn lord auckland a soon a possible that next spring strength must be increased rather than diminished if on other hand dost depends upon rising here rather than upon force may gather there will be occasion for more troop than have for must suffice to crush tribal rising must be happy to undertake mission if must confide to sir angus said travelled a persian without exciting suspicion can do same again might obtain couple of horse load of indian silk cashmere good travel a persian trader who have be settled here who fearing that fresh disturbance might occur have decided to make trip to bokhara with view of establishing there see trade be at present at stand still a northern trader dare not venture down here fact can also speak pushtoo will of course be advantage must seem to show have a gave out resided here for time must be dangerous enterprise mr campbell there must be certain amount of danger in sir not seems to excessive not more than met in journey from herat there be danger a have frequently said even here at rate be ready to take risk if think that mission must be of utility that must certainly be admit that one must be more likely to carry to successful conclusion fear that must be impossible for to return before spring think must return across mountain might dispose of good to turkoman from what hear dost mahomed be at balkh kunduz possibly tashkurgan half way between balkh must of course be more convenient for be couple of day journey to kilif on other side of oxus there might dispose of good buy carpet shawl of bokhara then travel across plain to herat thence by trade route to candahar so back through ghuznee must of course be long journey there must be very lofty pass to traverse need hardly say must not enter herat a might be recognized there there must be fear of recognition elsewhere a servant be really persian have also picked up pushtoo must greatly aid in preserving disguise at rate must rather be doing something than remaining here idle through winter then accept offer mr campbell information must give a to feeling of people on other side of mountain must be invaluable will myself question one two of hindoo merchant a to good be generally sent to bokhara know of course that bulk of trade with india be carried on through candahar herat must be natural that trader residing here wishing to leave must prefer direct route however toilsome might be must say easy load for three animal must be sufficient a merchandise must be of light material considerable value must be carried by three horse will need fourth for small stock of provision for will have to depend on yourselves until be on other side of pass will require two men to look after four horse will obtain two soldier from one of pathan regiment must be dangerous for to hire man in city will get couple of men of approved fidelity will of course be in native dress will pas a peasant hired for journey by four of well armed must be able to give good account of yourselves if must fall in with small party of freebooter though be more likely to happen on return journey than on way across hill thank sir well to day be monday will take two three day to make preparation get sort of men require must be ready to start on thursday certainly sir a far a man be concerned must be ready to start at moment notice a there will be difficulty in buying clothes require very well then will be settled for thursday know need not tell to warn servant to maintain absolute secrecy a to fact that be leaving town azim be greatly pleased when angus told of intended expedition for having few duty to perform have found time hang heavily on hand be glad to hear that be not to spend long winter at cabul purchased in bazaar garment for master high boot lined with fur cloak of thick cloth similarly lined afghan hat of black lamb wool illustration there lying close under rock be young afghan on wednesday evening sir alexander burnes said to angus be just a well that did not make start morning for there have be sharp skirmish on road ten mile off between squadron of cavalry party of afghan horse hear fellow fought well be driven off with considerable loss have seen two men who have be selected to accompany have be time in service colonel spoke highly to of explained to nature of duty on be going gave option of declining said that if carried through successfully must on return receive present of six month pay must at once be promoted accepted without hesitation feel certain that can rely upon be recruited from border tribe have ever held independent of afghan faction have sympathy either with kuzzilbashes soojah care not snap who rule over afghanistan if questioned story will be that came up a camp follower with colonel wade force on arriving at work with army be at end took service with persian trader good pack have be marked in persian character with price must fetch in persia at must probably sell at bokhara so that will know how to carry on trading without exciting suspicion either by asking too little by demanding unusual price man will lead two horse have provided rough pony for to ride think will find that detail have be neglected have have thousand rupee sewn up in saddle of horse sent for one of cavalry saddler man showed be saddle five hundred be sewn in saddle of servant in case of mishap here be letter to lieutenant mackenzie who command troop of horse artillery be at bamian with ameer ghoorka regiment may be questioned there so without giving detail have simply requested to allow bearer party to pas on without question interference start be not made from house of sir alexander burnes from of hindoo merchant from whom good have be purchased a there be nothing unusual in trader starting with horse load of merchandise attention be attracted party crossed plain four mile farther up skirted foot of mountain until reached gorge through track for must not be called road led over mountain to bamian have decided to camp here found that be scene of previous day combat dead horse men be scattered about be evident that afghan have be lying in ambush here aware that at time party of cavalry rode distance up pas determined to go mile farther up gorge a there be danger of disturbance by afghan who after defeat on previous day be not likely to be in neighbourhood after proceeding quarter of mile angus who be riding ahead suddenly stopped horse hearing deep groan a ground be strewn with rock on side of track concluded at once that poor fellow have crawled away to die unnoticed by cavalry returning from pursuit knowing what torture must be suffering from thirst dismounted filling pannikin from one of skin bade azim bring fruit then made way to spot from sound proceeded there lying close under rock be young afghan whose clothes showed that be chief of rank eye be closed face pallid drawn lip black cracked with thirst angus knelt beside poured few drop of water between lip repeated again again wounded man opened eye with deep exclamation of thankfulness then face darkened said meant kindly good friend have done cruel service worst have passed have sunk into unconsciousness must have passed into paradise without more pain where be wounded angus asked perhaps can do something for afghan slightly shook head nothing can be done for said have musket ball in shoulder right leg be broken above knee at rate can make comfortable be going to camp short way ahead will now do so here may allah bless must be better to leave to die at once can not do now have good drink of water then will cut melon into piece for to suck while be preparing camp horse load be removed animal turned loose to graze on grass growing among rock then tent be erected afghan carried into shade of high rock close by by time be able to speak more strongly said be persian see by dress how come that have entered lonely gorge with pack horse good be going to make road to bokhara there be rumour of disaffection in cabul if there be fighting house of trader will be looted therefore resolved to leave while must be taking indian good for sale there will be terrible journey young chief said there be already snow in upper pass wish success will think of kindness a lie here pray allah to protect before go pray to carry down to edge of stream so may drink when will will certainly do give supply of fruit if can do better now must look see to wound can at least bandage make somewhat easier to surprise angus found wound in leg see bullet mark said leg be broken in fall men have fought well feringees be too strong for fled be riding in rear when shot struck in shoulder fell from horse when found that leg be broken felt end be at hand heard more shot further sound of galloping horse knew that by allah mercy have ceased pursuit horse have galloped on after others men might not notice that have fallen until have gone distance when must probably conclude have be killed managed to crawl out of road to shelter of rock where found a infidel might come up in morning must rather die quietly there than be shot down must not have injured angus said kill many in battle be rule with never to touch injured man have come along must have taken back to camp have done must for have heard that be strange in respect did not think of only wish be to die quietly alone tried several time to crawl to stream agony be so great must not do angus while be speaking be feeling limb first thing to do said be to bring end of bone together operation will be painful will greatly relieve suffering do a will stranger allah have sent to side what do must be right in first place must prepare splint to keep in place leaving afghan angus searched among bush until found shrub be thick enough for purpose azim with knife cut down near root then divided into length split of smoothed piece until be perfectly even then tore off several long strip of cloth to form bandage calling to two men returned to wounded afghan patient be lifted into position where must place left foot against rock now chief angus said must with leg prevent from being pulled forward servant will hold round body so a to aid other two men will take hold of right leg pull while a soon a be sufficiently stretched will press broken end into position be afraid that pain will be very severe will be much easier afterwards at present end of bone be tearing flesh afghan can bear pain chief said quietly do a will now angus said to soldier take firm hold above ankle draw a steadily quietly a can with strength resistance of muscle be so great that be only by exercising utmost power that men got to yield at last angus felt end of bone on be pressing suddenly slip into place then for first time looked round sound have escaped afghan lip agony have be so intense that have fainted now give long bandage azim need not hold longer double up cloak something lift put under so that can pas bandage round round first wad of thick material soaked in water be placed round leg at point of fracture then bandage be added to bandage until limb down to knee be surrounded by casing inch thick then splint be applied reaching only down to knee others to ankle be held in place by three assistant while angus again firmly bandaged operation being completed dashed water on afghan face latter soon opened eye be over chief bone be in place again if go well in time end may knit firmly together be easier already chief said gratefully no longer feel a if evil spirit from eblis be torturing with hot iron will now see to shoulder wound have ceased bleeding therefore will sponge with cold water put bandage on in case must break out afresh be soon done cloth soaked in water be laid over bandage then more fruit be given to wounded man be left in shade men set about cooking meal angus from time to time went across to see have satisfaction in evening of finding that have fallen asleep now azim said when returned next thing to do be to settle what be to be done with have be wondering that ever since found master there be choice of two thing one be that mount horse ride back to cabul report having found wounded man ask that party with stretcher may be sent out to fetch in early in morning other be to take on with azim looked in surprise must be very difficult master doubt must be difficult think might be done there be doubt that from dress appearance from fact that speaks excellent persian be chief of considerable standing in case friendship might be invaluable to on way down to frontier possibly in future sir alexander burnes regard a very threatening must be worth while therefore to make sacrifice to carry down to friend must not do if thought journey must harm believe cold air of mountain must be vastly better for than heat of plain round cabul may suffer somewhat from jolting think that can obviate that if cut two strong pole about fifteen foot long attach to pack saddle of two horse by securely fastening blanket between make hammock in can ride comfortably pole must be elastic enough to save sudden jolt can only go at foot pace in pass native horse be so sure footed that think chance of accident be extremely slight horse be lightly weighted a provision be consumed can move portion of weight carry to one who take food yes must be good plan master advantage of must be angus went on whereas must chafe at being in hospital in care of people hate spirit must naturally rise a felt that be returning to friend must hasten recovery however will put question to in morning if decides upon being kept in camp will send back with letter to sir alexander burnes for stretcher bearer will easily overtake at camping place to morrow evening in morning young chief be better than angus have even hoped for once twice during night fresh water have be poured gently over bandage on wounded shoulder like people living chiefly in open air accustomed to climbing to hard exercise afghan suffer le from wound than european do abstemious in habit comparatively small meat eater lithe sinewy in figure speedily recover from wound unless of mortal nature angus found that chief forehead hand be cool there be sign of fever setting in have be thinking over what must be best for decided to leave choice to be acquainted with burnes sahib if send servant with letter know that will at once send out party to carry into hospital where will be well cared for must rather die than accept kindness at hand afghan said firmly in case there seems other course for to construct litter between two of pack horse to carry over mountain to kundur must thus burden with stranger afghan asked in tone of great surprise certainly must for wounded stranger angus said think that there will be great trouble will try to make journey a easy for a possible then explained how intended to carry face of wounded man lit up have permitted angus to set limb because believed be destiny that have sent to aid felt sure that man who have taken such trouble with must leave store of provision within reach that possibly of native might come along carry to village so tend until strength be restored be faint hope for now winter be approaching men from upper village must have come down into plain chance be slight that must enter gorge hope rested chiefly in belief that a have be so unexpectedly saved from death final deliverance must also be effected that kind trader must offer to carry up pass have never entered mind pale cheek flushed with pleasure certainly will go with if will take said joyfully nobly indeed do carry out precept of prophet to be compassionate to who need let say more about chief will be pleasure to to see grow stronger doubt not that mountain air will benefit greatly will have reward in seeing regaining strength have meat with will be better for to take fruit little bread two soldier be sent out presently

think thing be going on well mackenzie said when have concluded no there be much disaffection among lower class in city tribesman be restless discontented be great mistake to allow shah entire control of civilian matter consequence be that people be grievously oppressed by tax gatherer ameer be impatient at slightest attempt to control render intensely unpopular by hardly ever appearing in public by refusal to grant audience by haughtiness arrogance to whom doe admit to presence be certain that must not maintain for day if be to march away see how can leave to fate altogether situation be very difficult be afraid will end badly want strong man at head of affair think that macnaghten be strong man keane be good soldier be said that will return to england in spring how about burnes burnes be

said good bye left tent afghan chief be carried back into in few minute in little camp be asleep chapter xi dangerous journey angus made effort to secure service of native well acquainted with pass a guide be altogether unsuccessful difficulty be declared insurmountable danger overwhelming must see what can do sadut khan said when angus informed that native be of opinion that snow be too heavy danger too great for pas to be attempted stayed here for day when crossed hill with dost mahomed there be petty chief living in village two mile away if be still there think must accompany whether not be certain must not divulge secret of being here to anyone will go to see angus said hope indeed will accompany for if not fear that journey have come to end a offer have made must have tempted of native here to go with if have thought possible will mention name to say to only that chief of momunds whom knew here three month ago desire to speak to angus at once mounted horse rode to foot of hill upon village with tower of chief be perched then fastening bridle to stunted shrub made way up steep ascent on foot place did not contain more than dozen house a passed through native wrapped in sheep skin jacket came to door gazed at with angry scowl a reached door of tower four armed men came out what must here stranger one of said must speak few word with chief doe not want either to buy to sell man said shortly seek to sell angus said have message of importance to one of went into tower returning in minute motioned to angus to follow chief tall powerful man of middle age be seated on floor of room in upper story of tower near be large earthenware pan in charcoal fire be burning why come here persian said what message can one like bear to angus repeated message sadut khan have given chief rose to foot suddenly lie said fiercely be dead news came to week since nevertheless gave that message if will come with to bamian will see for that be not dead though be true that have be sorely hurt go not into bamian chief said have not put foot in town since accursed infidel came there have held communication with with may be trick to lure there make prisoner if have desired to do so angus said quietly must have sent hundred men with gun two not mere trader besides how must have told that momund chief have be here with dost mahomed when passed through many must have told that chief said seeing that next to ameer be most observed of party well chief if will not go have nothing to do to return inform that refuse to come see how can be there in midst of enemy unless indeed be prisoner be not prisoner lie in tent can see without entering bamian for camp be outside town what motive chief must have in deceiving will go chief said suddenly will not be said that refused to answer call however improbable might seem threw on cloak lined with sheep skin telling men that unless something befell must be back by noon led way down hill angus mounted horse when reached rode beside for distance afghan did not speak do know name of chief asked abruptly when distance have be traversed be sadut khan fighting chief of momunds nephew by marriage of ameer afghan have not expected reply must be in confidence indeed persian must not thus have disclosed when in midst of who must hail capture a one of most valuable prize have a say faith in angus said quietly will doubtless when see give reason for trust in story must be true believe forgive for at first doubting having heard that chief have be killed thought be plot of kind be natural that must not believe angus said must scarce credit that be alive what be still more strange that must be in town occupied by english yet not be prisoner be fortunate day for indeed afghan said there be chief whose name be more honoured in country than of sadut khan be a brave a lion good to people faithful to dost mahomed when so many have fallen away from ameer regard a if be favourite son will gladden heart indeed lessen trouble when learns that be still alive avoiding town went straight to sadut angus dismounted led way to little white tent raising flap said to chief be here enter afghan did so thinking best to leave together for time angus strolled away saw that horse be a usual well wrapped up in thick felt blanket be hour before chief made appearance at entrance to tent looked round angus at once spoke to friend said chief again ask pardon for doubting for moment allah will surely bless for good work have done sadut khan have told pass understanding why stranger must have cumbered with wounded man of whom knew nothing doe not koran bid succour afflicted be true friend there be surely limit one will do great thing for friend one may do something for stranger to hinder one journey cumber one self with wounded stranger be surely more than can be expected of angus now entered tent trust in chief be not misplaced sadut khan said will act a guide across mountain though doubt whether will be possible to cross pass if be will of allah persian that must not can die be so angus said pass may not be a badly blocked a expect can hardly hope that chief replied shaking head last party came over

charge of lieutenant mackenzie till spring when must return to cabul rejoin regiment must not hear of be mountain men one said if others can get through can at rate will risk anything rather than return with blackened face say that have feared to follow officer morning be bitterly cold sky be clear will do well to day hassan said to angus horse be fresh a for to morrow who can say snow be knee deep when got beyond village ascent began almost at once be heavy work for men horse continued journey till be too dark to go farther then halted in ravine afforded shelter from piercing wind set to work to clear away snow where tent be to be pitched before raising horse be attended to blanket be girded round from ear to tail be picketed touching other for mutual warmth supply of corn be then laid down before on square piece of felt placed on snow when tent be pitched lamp be lighted flap closed then snow be scraped up outside until canvas be covered nearly to top in spite of intense cold be thoroughly warmed by hard work before turned in angus took azim into tent rest divided among other two at other time must have be unpleasant to be so closely packed in such weather be advantage before setting to work to pile snow against tent brass kettle filled with water have be suspended from ridge pole over lamp water be almost boiling by time work be finished in few minute coffee be made frozen carcass of four sheep have be brought a well a large quantity of meat have be cooked on previous day slice of latter be thawed over lamp eaten with bread have be purchased at bamian few word be spoken after meal be finished fatigue warmth of tent rendering difficult for to keep awake in few minute be sound asleep next day march be even more arduous sadut have given up litter again mounted horse a be found impossible for two animal linked together by hammock to make way up steep place work be toilsome in extreme worked cheerfully hassan four men laboured with greatest vigour carrying burden to place horse when laden must not have climbed hauling animal out of deep drift into frequently fell carrying sadut khan in litter at point where ascent be so steep crippled a still be by injured leg must not have retained seat in saddle party worked in almost complete silence with stern determination energy showed consciousness that moment be of importance twelve mile be result of a many hour of labour sign of track have be visible since left bamian angus felt how absolutely impossible must have be to cross pas have not be for intimate knowledge of hassan follower even be sometimes at fault none of have ever passed over mountain when so deeply covered with snow consultation constantly took place between a to line to be followed when arrived at halting place for night hassan told angus momund chief that be now within two hundred foot of top of pas to morrow work will be most dangerous north wind sweep across plateau with terrible force moreover like look of sky evening have be fortunate so far think that there will be change be well indeed sadut said a ate supper that crossed highest pas before snow began in earnest certainly must not have supported that journey have be ten day later have got through hardest part of work everything now depends upon weather may allah grant that there be more snow pas to morrow be twelve mile across if go well will begin to descend on following morning if snow hold off will be able to do distance easily for be almost level plain that have to traverse part of will be nearly clear of snow fierce blast sweep away a fast a fall while in other place surface will be hard enough to walk on snow being pressed firmly together by weight of wind be on foot again next morning even earlier than usual be aware of importance of haste tent be pulled down loaded with greatest rapidity cold be intense few word be spoken until reached summit of ascent by time effort of climbing have restored heat have be lost a soon a left warm tent sky be cloudless angus felt hopeful that day journey must be accomplished with comparative ease noticed however that there be anxious look on face of five tribesman who although be travelling more rapidly than have done since left bamian be constantly urging horse men to press forward at greater speed angus have expected that must have to face very strong wind scarce breath be blowing a sadut have predicted rock be in many place completely bare field of snow be so hard that instead of struggling knee deep a before now seldom sank over foot sometimes left scarcely track upon surface hill on side stood up clear hard silence be almost oppressive be calculated way across pas three hour after leaving camp when hassan who be walking beside angus sadut stopped suddenly pointed to sky looking up angus saw two three little wisp of vapour passing overhead with extraordinary speed storm hassan exclaimed see others be coming will soon be upon can go farther must prepare to meet instantly will be overwhelmed knowing that hassan must not have spoken thus unless from direst necessity angus at once ordered halt plateau be perfectly flat nowhere must shelter be obtained be now on expanse of hard snow urged by shout exclamation of hassan hastened to unload animal a soon a be done angus ordered tent to be pitched be useless hassan said must be blown down in instant let lie open on snow let man take two blanket keep by in readiness when storm begin let wrap up in then let who be tent fellow lie down together on one side of tent pull other over roll in men will be last to take shelter will pile sack saddle over end to keep down first put extra blanket over horse fasten over head let hang down well behind will turn back to wind make be accustomed to lie down do so range others close to ten minute of hard work be ready then have time to look round sky be hidden from view by mass of black cloud streaming along men took place on tent wrapped blanket round in readiness lie down at once hassan ordered will be upon almost immediately men did so hassan follower pulled felt covering over pushing edge of upper side under a far a possible then piled baggage saddle on end angus with azim sadut remained standing till last hassan ran up to with men quick said storm will be upon immediately glancing ahead a lay down angus saw what looked like white mist in distance knew that must be snow swept up by force of wind half minute be tucked up in thick felt be weighted at end allah preserve hassan shouted then be silent minute later storm struck with such force that felt a if pressed down by heavy weight have be inclined to speak must not have heard other so loud be howl of wind wrapped up in sheep skin posteens blanket did not feel cold for time angus lay wondered how long must last presently fell asleep warmth after bitterly cold air outside overpowering even thought of danger be lying between sadut azim who like lay without moving indeed movement must have be difficult so tightly be tent wrapped round slept for many hour vaguely conscious of roar fury of gale when awoke at last be with sense of suffocation heavy weight seemed to press upon sound of storm have ceased be awake asked others have to shake before obtained answer something must be done went on a soon a be capable of understanding will be suffocated if let air in be true sadut said snow be evidently piled up round must let air in will perish in spite of effort found impossible to move forward to get to end of roll must cut way out be only chance angus said turning on to back managed to get out long afghan knife cut slit three foot long in felt a did so snow came pouring in through opening do put hand under shoulder said help to sit up be not until have cut transverse slit so a to allow hole to open wider that be able to do so snow be not packed very hard said a pressed aside ca be very deep for can see light be not long before be on foot have pushed snow sufficiently back to enable companion to get out also feeling of suffocation be already relieved a sufficient amount of air made way through snow after five minute hard work clambered out gale be still blowing though not so violently a at first snow still falling thickly two white mound marked position of other tent elsewhere wide expanse of level snow be seen be evident that a drifted have first heaped against tent more have settled beyond so gradually mound have risen until be seven eight foot high must rescue others at once angus said on windward side snow be so hard that hand made impression upon on sheltered side be lighter working with hand be soon able to clear away down to end of tent beneath hassan three of follower be lying be not like others closed there a occupant have be unable to place weight on after have rolled up a soon a have cleared snow opened felt out little sadut called be awake hassan be awake replied be bound down hand foot cleared snow off until saw foot taking hold of together pulled gradually drew one of men out other three be extricated more easily found that have not suffered so much from sense of suffocation a first party have done a end of roll being open certain amount of air have found way through snow hour hard work sufficed to rescue occupant of other tent three be unconscious cold blast speedily brought round what be to be done next angus asked gale be still far too severe for to move latter answered have best clear away snow over tent then take to again after two hour work tent be cleared men have worked from above throwing out snow over side of mound so that when have finished tent lay at bottom of sloping hole meal be then eaten lifting upper covering of felt lay down again closed over sun be in east knew that fifteen hour have elapsed since gale have struck mound of snow have marked where horse be lying did not interfere with for hassan said that horse must be able to breathe through snow probably heat of body have melted immediately round must be much warmer than if snow be cleared off before turning in hassan men managed to erect tent of leader lying a did in crater of snow be sheltered from force of wind hole be made with dagger on side of slit angus have cut edge tied together by strip of leather couple of lamp oil be taken from sack in be carried also bag of corn little party after filling vessel with snow hanging over lamp closing entrance to tent soon felt comfortable again have be narrow escape sadut said have not be for thinking of cutting tent so enabling to make way out whole caravan must assuredly have perished now have only imprisonment for day two at most can then proceed on journey next morning gale have ceased though snow continued to fall by mid day sky cleared issuing out from shelter prepared for start took hour work to extricate horse one of weakly animal have died others appeared uninjured by imprisonment vessel in camp have be used for melting snow drink of warm water with flour stirred into be given to of animal extra feed of corn a soon a have eaten baggage be packed on back party moved forward be heavy work snow have fallen since force of wind have abated be soft animal sank fetlock deep in after three hour travelling reached end of pas began to descend two hour later halted at spot where wall of rock afforded shelter against wind from north allah be praised that have reached point hassan said now worst be over can see that will have storm before hour be past generally follow other when once begin here be safe be for said 'no when proposed that must halt at mouth of pas tent be soon erected great stone being placed on lower edge to steady against gust of wind then diligent search be made for wood enough bush be found to make good fire strip of meat from one of frozen sheep be cooked kettle be boiled cake of flour ghee be baked traveller made hearty meal horse be given bucket of warm water thickened with flour double feed of grain then sat round fire smoking talking until burned low when in spite of sheep skin coat bitter cold soon made felt have scarcely turned into tent when storm a hassan have predicted burst except for occasional gust felt little slept soundly until morning when found that light snow have eddied down be lying two foot deep day be spent in cooking attending to own want of horse for two day be prisoner then gale abated continued journey late that evening arrived at village of chol here be received with hospitality by native who be astounded that in such weather caravan must have made way over pas resting here for two day travelled to kala sarkari sadut now took lead for chief of village seeing three horse loaded with merchandise demanded toll sadut announcing a nephew of dost mahomed saying that whole party be under protection threatening attitude that inhabitant began to assume be at once calmed four day travel with halt at small village took to balkh here on declaring sadut be received with great honour be entertained at governor house where dost mahomed be lying ill attention be bestowed upon hassan follower who walked behind be reported a having be mean of safety angus with party kept little distance in rear took up quarter at khan unnoticed when sadut be seen to call early next morning upon persian trader remain with for considerable time be understood that be under protection enquiry be made by authority of town on third day sadut said to angus regret that ameer be ill have not be for that must have received told of service have rendered for few hour must have ended life said that must like to see so noble man to give fitting testimonial of gratitude for service done to sister son requested to bring to a soon a be able to rise from couch when enters cabul in triumph a assuredly will do ere long hope that will establish there can promise that business will flourish thank heartily khan for having spoken to ameer about angus said gravely can not receive present from dost mahomed have intended many time to tell more about feel must do so now be friend can not remain in false position with a long a be travelling together harm be done mattered not to who be man who have aided in extremity case be different now be then sorely wounded man who needed what aid must give now be close relation of dost mahomed powerful afghan chief so case be changed dost mahomed doubt know what be passing in cabul by mean of friend there who see be going on english general on other hand know nothing of what be passing beyond ground patrolled by cavalry be important for to learn what be passing on side of mountain selected officer in army on account of knowledge of persian pushtoo to cross mountain ascertain what prospect there be of dost mahomed returning with army to cabul in spring confide secret to a to friend can see that must be impossible for to accept present from dost mahomed in character of persian merchant for same reason must abstain from questioning even allowing to give information a to military preparation going on to do so must be to take unfair advantage of chance enabled to be of service angus have thought matter over knew that while such work a be engaged in must if discovered cost life must be regarded by afghan a legitimate mean of obtaining information although if caught must be killed a enemy action must be regarded a showing that be man of great bravery thus to place in power of enemy be view indeed in sadut khan regarded have done well to tell said gravely be truly act of brave man not only to risk discovery here to undertake terrible adventure of crossing pass when winter have fairly set in in order to obtain information for general still more do wonder that must have burdened with care of enemy one who be fighting against people be wonderful on part of persian trader be far more so on part of one against whom be fighting who be not of religion who be engaged upon enterprise of such nature to whom speed be matter of greatest importance have not be for slow pace at travelled with might have crossed pass before be blocked will fight against people a before will respect now see that although religion differ there be good thing in belief a in ours that even koran have lesson in charity kindliness stronger than that have learned from teaching of own religion what thought wonderful on part of persian merchant be still more marvellous on part of english officer who must have possible interest in saving dying man who indeed might have gained credit by delivering into hand of countryman since so long a be prisoner in hand must be hostage for quiet behaviour of people can do harm to by enquiry here be known by on side of mountain that ameer will in spring endeavour to turn out usurper be known already to sheik from candahar to jellalabad whether will come with ten thousand twenty thousand men matter little when appears afghanistan will rise general might have be sure that must be so without sending to make enquiry can not tell with what force will come will not be great army even in summer large force must scarcely traverse pass be not on force that will take from here that dost mahomed relies be on host will gather round when cross mountain have learned that disaffection to soojah be everywhere on increase there be many who did not love barukzyes know now that thing be worse instead of better since change for man have made hated by arrogance contempt for people in general extortion exercised by tax gatherer there be secret in own officer must know what will not learn for decision will not be made until spring be line by ameer will advance there be many pass by may then cross may go round by herat gather force a advance again might go east crossing by pass there come down through chitral to jellalabad can well understand khan of course have already learned that there be doubt that dost mahomed be preparing to cross pass in spring that be sure of support of tribesman on side of mountain must gather very large army if chose sadut said difficulty of transporting food for so large body must be very great think that ten thousand men will be utmost must move with be doing harm in telling because must soon learn in town be certain that people must not prevent passing hindoo koosh since have so many route to choose from force be not like army moving with great train of baggage cannon ammunition must only cross by one two pass can move wherever horse can climb now will leave for have business to attend to will return evening chapter xii trouble thicken angus saw that a must not hope to obtain further information however long might stay a have fulfilled main object of mission by discovering that dost mahomed must not be content with remaining master of northern province must certainly advance in spring must do good by remaining longer information that must give must enable macnaghten burnes to show indian government that intention of withdrawing more troop in early spring must be disastrous be with special object in view that have be sent have on two previous day sold portion of good have held out for price with be marked be now more willing to bargain a wished to travel in future a lightly a possible accordingly before nightfall have disposed of nearly stock with have started have at same time purchased certain amount of good from turkestan a must be more appropriate a merchandise when started from balkh for herat sadut came again in evening friend said have be thinking over position doubtless might stay here for time without being suspected that be other than seemed to be chance word from one of men might betray a have really learned that there be to learn seems to that there be use in tarrying longer here be true that dost mahomed for sake must protect even be discovered still know nature of people be rumoured that be infidel might be torn to piece before ameer knew aught about have come to same conclusion if thought must gain anything by remaining must do so whatever risk a must be useless to stay intend to leave to morrow have long journey to make via sooner be off better men be now packing up good preparing for start at daylight felt so sure that must be course have brought with order from ameer to governor headman of town village through may pas enjoining to give good treatment a hold in high esteem for having rendered most valuable service to thank very heartily angus replied will greatly facilitate journey save from small annoyance trust that will meet again hope so indeed never will forget debt of gratitude that owe perhaps day may be able to repay debt to small extent remember that in case of need may rely upon to utmost at rate must not refuse to accept be present from dost mahomed not to english officer to persian merchant who have saved life of sister son talk continually while with of nobility of action when told that be going have turban brought took out gem be chief ornament bade hand in remembrance of deed told have said that must receive present for simple act of humanity more must not tell without revealing secret though know that must be safe with can not refuse to take a for be here exile far away from own people have to give a token of love be signet ring if send to will go through fire water to come to tribesman will recognize will do anything in power for possessor angus saw offered a be must greatly hurt afghan feeling if refused immense ruby surrounded by diamond dost mahomed have sent will not refuse gift of ameer so given to will cherish a most valued possession gift of man whom for one may say most british officer consider to be very badly treated by know from sir alexander burnes dost mahomed be most anxious for alliance shah soojah be a unpopular among a among own people of course a soldier be not business to concern with politics be matter for government only still can not have feeling be sure must fortune of war ever place dost mahomed in hand must receive honourable treatment gift will prize a highly a token of warm friendship trust that time may never come when have to put virtue to test though well know must in necessity rely upon help that might be able to give after talking for time of best route to follow sadut khan took affectionate leave angus started next morning with party before setting out bestowed handsome gift upon hassan follower whom have learned to like greatly for devotion have shown to sadut energy courage with have worked during journey travelling from twenty to five twenty mile day with occasional halt reached cabul after two month of travel journey have be greatly facilitated by order that carried from dost mahomed have not entered herat a be probable that must be recognized there avoiding city travelled by same route a before to girishk then took road running few mile north of candahar falling into main road at kelat ghilzye first step be to see sir alexander burnes to report to that assuredly dost mahomed must come south with considerable force a soon a pass be opened following must not be very formidable relied upon being joined by tribesman south of hill news be most opportune agent said can hardly fail to induce governor general to alter determination to withdraw greater part of force in spring already have not man too many for contingency may arise now tell about journey winter set in so severely directly left have be seriously uneasy about have only one message from mackenzie after have left be brought by native told that have passed through that weather have changed for worse day after started universal opinion among native be that party have perished angus gave account of journey have thought over question whether must be wise to mention episode of wounded afghan concluded that must be better to do so a mackenzie when rejoined force might casually mention that have sick man with therefore told whole story a happened admire humanity mr campbell though seems almost quixotic to burden with wounded man a say be evident that if must manage to carry through might be of great service to undoubtedly must have be valuable prisoner to have in hand gratitude to may prove valuable to for momunds be powerful tribe conduct to can not have inspired with better feeling towards than have hitherto shown may have le animosity sir fear that will still be found fighting against on way spoke many time of determination to continue struggle until afghanistan be free from infidel be convinced that indignation at treatment of dost mahomed fanaticism be so strong that private matter be likely to shake winter passed quietly attention of burnes macnaghten be turned rather towards frontier than to state of thing round cabul yar mahomed virtual ruler of herat although be receiving large sum of money from be known to be intriguing with persia trying to form alliance with shah to expel british from afghanistan russia have sent expedition against khiva conquest of little state must bring more closely to frontier of afghanistan dost mahomed however have gone on visit to ameer of bokhara have be detained for present by treacherous ruler thus for time prospect of invasion on part be greatly diminished in spring macnaghten shah soojah returned to cabul former continued to ignore warning of sir burnes a to ever growing hostility of afghan to british man have forced upon advice that of burnes have be so far followed that force at cabul have not be diminished not content with macnaghten continued to urge on indian

will now have name on book a one of most promising of younger officer of company may be sure that will keep eye upon macnaghten will shortly return to england have long be promised succession to post will certainly request doubt wish will be acceded to in matter that must hold position of chief assistant a such will have many opportunity of doing good service a will naturally proceed on mission to chief of neighbouring people will so qualify for important post in future macnaghten indeed be extremely anxious to leave bodily mentally have suffered from strain anxiety have be promised high post in india probably succession to governorship of bombay be considered advisable that must remain at present post till country be more settled winter passed quietly with submission of dost mahomed son there be now rival to shah soojah head round whom discontented with ameer rule must rally be le unwilling to remain a thought that era of peace have now begun that anxiety be at end be soon however undeceived on shah soojah first arrival in india have naturally looked to dooranees for aid against barukzyes who have so long oppressed have made many promise of remission of taxation a incentive to zeal promise have so far be kept that tax have be exacted from dooranees in view of absolute necessity of raising income for expense of government for personal expenditure of ameer favourite became necessary that must contribute to extent to revenue although tax be tithe of have paid under barukzye rule dooranees of district of north west of candahar rose in rebellion general nott marched out from city defeated in pitched battle for time movement be crushed discontent remained be rendered more formidable by fact that heratees have taken up so offensive attitude that mission there have be withdrawn proof be obtained that ruler be fomenting discontent in western province be encouraging disaffected by promising assistance in may more serious trouble arose time with ghilzyes have be determined to restore dismantled fort of kelat ghilzye tribesman viewed work with hostility assembled in larger number nott sent force against under colonel winder with four hundred british troop

cavalry on must rely must not prevent rebel from retiring in fair order major rawlinson political officer at candahar again warned macnaghten that situation in western afghanistan be extremely threatening be answered that be unwarrantable view of position that there be enough difficulty enough of croaker without adding to number needlessly rawlinson be perfectly right macnaghten be living in fool paradise defeated chief of dooranees be joined by in august force of eight hundred cavalry of whom be regular three hundred fifty infantry four gun under captain griffin met insurgent be strongly posted in succession of walled garden small fort fire of gun infantry drove from enclosure cavalry then charged with great effect scattered in direction defeat be inflicted upon ghilzyes in

in september macnaghten received news of appointment to governorship of bombay began preparation for leaving cabul burnes looked forward to receiving at last appointment for have so long waited

contemptuous dissent believed that with power to act in hand must be able to remedy blunder have be made to restore peace contentment in troop be now commanded by general elphinstone who have succeeded cotton be brave old officer almost incapacitated by infirmity obtained post simply a senior officer be wholly unfitted for command in such critical time in such position probably have not be for assurance of macnaghten that be going on well that trifling rising have be crushed without difficulty lord auckland must have yielded to opinion of military adviser appointed general nott have done so greatest disaster ever fell upon british army might have be avoided nothing must be worse than position in british camp mission be established be on low ground commanded on side by hill surrounded by fort village be nearly mile in extent defended only by so contemptible ditch rampart that english officer for bet rode pony across commissariat compound be near cantonment occupied extensive space with building hut for officer too have rampart be even le formidable than surrounded camp thing have now settled down many of officer have sent for wife child lady macnaghten lady sale others be established in comfortable house climate be exhilarating officer amused with cricket horse racing fishing shooting lived a if have be at hill station in india instead of in mountainous country surrounded by bitter foe october came in quietly though pottinger who be now in kohistan sent unfavourable report of thing there be a usual pooh poohed by macnaghten latter trouble with indian government however continued unabated expense of occupation of afghanistan amounting to million quarter year be terrible drain upon revenue of india have become necessary to raise loan to meet outlay question of withdrawal from afghanistan be being seriously discussed none of good result have be looked for have be achieved did appear likely that situation must improve for be evident to unbiassed observer that ameer be upheld solely by british bayonet when be withdrawn whole fabric have built up at so enormous expense must collapse uneasiness of indian government be increased by fact that change of ministry be imminent at home that conservative who have always opposed invasion of afghanistan must at once take step for withdrawal of troop from country investigation must be made into whole affair must create intense dissatisfaction in england lead to recall of indian politician responsible for news stirred macnaghten to fury saw that be necessary to make retrenchment accordingly largely cut down subsidy paid to chief consequence be that leader of whole of powerful tribe including round cabul kohistanees ghilzyes momunds at once entered into hostile federation against british

signed on way back to jellalabad sale be attacked more than once in great force with difficulty cut way down macnaghten who have determined to leave on st of october have postponed departure for short time wrote on day that hoped business just reported be expiring effort of rebel angus have remained with burnes at cabul latter be much depressed by occurrence have taken place have greatly disapproved of macnaghten wholesale cutting down of subsidy of chief how unfortunate be said many time to angus have macnaghten gone two month earlier must never have happened have be money alone have kept tribesman quiet very worst form of retrenchment have be chosen have gone must have acted in very different way in first place must have told ameer frankly that trouble be solely caused by rapacity of men have appointed to receive tax must be dismissed honest faithful one appointed in place be abominable tyranny with tax of believe small portion ever get into treasury be collected that have brought about trouble with proper administration revenue must be doubled taxation must press much more lightly upon people than doe at present now evil be done will have to take over administration when everything point to terrible catastrophe with name will ever be associated chapter xiii murder of sir burnes october passed quietly macnaghten arranged to leave on nd of november burnes have received several warning a to formidable nature of confederacy of chief mohun lal principal moonshee who have be down to sale camp told that if conspiracy be not crushed in infancy must become too strong to be suppressed burnes replied that have power at present that a soon a macnaghten left must conciliate chief by raising allowance to former point on st of november mohun lal again expressed opinion of danger burnes replied that feared time be coming when british must have to leave country be in one of mood of depression from recovered in evening congratulated macnaghten upon leaving when everything be quiet at very time be speaking hostile chief be assembled together be discussing method be to be taken to overthrow british power determined that first step be to forge document in ameer name ordering people to rise at same time to spread report that be intention to seize principal chief send prisoner to england be singular that must not have waited few day for indian government have sent peremptory order that whole force at cabul with exception of single brigade must return with macnaghten to india chief decided that a first step tumult must arise in city at once set about exciting have idea that must succeed none of ventured to take part in a be only intended to excite passion of rabble of city early next morning friendly afghan brought burnes news that residency be about to be attacked did not believe intelligence a city have of late be a quiet a usual on sending out of servant into street reported that there be certainly unusual stir excitement wrote to macnaghten saying so stating that did not think matter at serious although at same time requested that military guard must be sent to in order to overawe disaffected person angus have gone out early with latter have for day past spent time in city evening have returned with rumour have gathered talk in lower quarter be of understanding at chief have arrived general opinion be that in few day must pour down with force annihilate infidel angus noticed sullen expression on face of lower class manner in scowled at a passed quite agreed with follower that trouble have long foreseen be about to come to head when in street too have uneasy consciousness that be being followed several time turned sharply round in throng of native in street must recognize face that knew morning feeling be particularly strong although a have often done before assured that be pure fancy on part be not conscious of feeling nervous said to azim must be getting so have be very anxious time year suppose that without knowing must have told upon however will turn down quiet street if anyone be following will certainly detect hundred yard down lane crossed one have taken azim have looked several time one else turned down lane be entirely deserted a passed corner of next lane men suddenly sprang upon cloth be thrown over head in spite of struggle be lifted up carried along rapidly in couple of minute stopped angus door open be borne along what thought be passage thrust into room door be slammed to locked behind tore off muffler looked around be room of great size with strongly barred window there be cushion on divan ran along one side on low table in middle of room be two cold chicken pile of fruit large jar of water two bottle of native wine what on earth doe mean angus said why have be carried off azim did not attempt to reply be prisoner be certain angus went on must certainly look a if meant to make comfortable room must have be prepared in readiness for reception see hope of getting away window be very strongly barred continued a walked across looked out little yard be surrounded by house without window on ground floor with door can see suppose there be one below anyhow if must get through bar must be nearer liberty for at best must only re enter house possibly door be fastened on inside there be certainly men in house heard voice in passage just now doubt one of fellow be stationed there only reason can imagine for carrying off be that be to be kept a hostage of course be known to be burnes chief civilian assistant might think that if be in hand must be willing to make concession to get back again be of use worrying over be not so badly off a be in snow storm in pas best thing can do for present be to make meal for did not take anything before started illustration a passed corner men sprang on have just finished breakfast when sound of musketry be plainly heard there be fighting going on angus exclaimed what can mean there be troop in city except native guard at house treasury next door be fight between two faction in city be attacking place be maddening being fastened up here just at moment news brought by afghan morning that be to be attacked must be true though sir alexander altogether disbelieved be in one of happiest humour morning a to day be to obtain goal of hope to be resident political officer with power in hand when be in mood disbelief unpleasant tidings while in fit of depression give credit to rumour reach ear still house must be able to hold out against mob until help arrives from camp whether not place must be by side come of if there be really rising in town sir be certainly safer here than must be in street even in house may be angus said impatiently duty be to be there paced restlessly up down room presently azim said ca think how men who seized knew that be coming along be quite by chance that turned down lane must have be close to when did so angus said must at once have run round by lane posted at corner where be seized be not walking fast there must have be time for to get there before if have run why must have taken trouble why must have prepared place beforehand for reception beat altogether after firing have continued for few minute ceased then must hear confused roar of shouting good heaven angus exclaimed must have taken house troop can not have arrived in time must have heard sharp volley be maddening well sir azim said philosophically if have not be carried off must have be in house when attacked must have shared fate of others whatever may be be true enough angus agreed still ought to have be there ah broke off suddenly have not taken either sword mine pistol for although not in military uniform civilian generally carried sword necessary precaution when whole native population always went about armed angus in addition carried pistol also concealed in dress be extraordinary that must not have disarmed think that intended to do harm azim said must have cut throat have chosen to do so when brought here without fear of discovery why must leave sword provide good meal for if intended to murder afterwards be so azim make affair more incomprehensible tried to get at pistol a carried along held arm too tightly for to do so seems to possible that be work of someone who be aware of intended attack who doubted whether troop must not enter city slaughter many of inhabitant so thought that by producing at right moment must not only clear from charge of taking part in affair must earn reward for having saved life certainly have friend in city who must be likely to seize for other object of course be in communication with most of important person here have be simply in official way whoever be must have be watching for day master if a thought have be following whenever went out can have doubt on subject now azim angus sat thinking for time think said suddenly must be sadut khan if so be safe know that be with ameer rode with when defeated cavalry have be reported that have since returned to tribe though have certain information about be possible that knowing be about to be attacked by whole force of tribesman have borne promise in mind have employed men to watch take step if necessary to secure safety that certainly must explain what before seemed impossible to understand noise in town still continued at one time there be sound of heavy musketry firing troop have entered city angus exclaimed there will be hard fighting for in narrow street armed mob can offer desperate resistance even to best troop in end will put down tumult if sir alexander have be murdered exact heavy penalty for death in hour firing gradually abated musket shot came more faintly through air men be falling back azim there can be little doubt about by sound there can not be great number of troop engaged what on earth can macnaghten elphinstone be doing roar of shouting in street became louder there be occasional sound of firearm be quite evident that mob be in entire possession of city azim be looting trader quarter probably murdering white who have taken up residence there fear be fully justified house of sir alexander burnes captain johnson paymaster of ameer troop adjoined other johnson have fortunately for slept that night in camp sir alexander have with brother lieutenant burnes lieutenant broadfoot military secretary who have just arrived curiously enough be anniversary of disastrous fight at purwandurrah in fight broadfoot eldest brother have be killed soon after angus have gone out ameer minister arrived repeated warning already given by friendly afghan burnes must no longer doubt that there be danger refused to leave house saying that a soon a news that there be tumult reached camp troop must be at once despatched to put down however wrote urgently to macnaghten for support sent messenger to most powerful native chief in town begging to calm people assure that grievance must be redressed one of messenger be killed on way other managed to return to house desperately wounded gathering in street increased moment burnes with two officer went out on to balcony from thence harangued mob voice be drowned by yell curse weapon be brandished attack be made on door of house part of mob be fanatic who thought only of slaying infidel still larger party be animated solely by desire to share in sack of ameer treasury next door native guard of sir alexander treasury opened fire for time maintained with greatest bravery of english officer broadfoot be first to fall shot through heart position became more more desperate party of insurgent have set fire to stable forced way into garden burnes be still attempting to lull fury of crowd long ere troop must have arrived to rescue there be sign that be approaching at last seeing that be lost disguised went out into garden with man who have sworn by koran to convey brother safely into camp sooner however did issue out than traitor shouted be burnes mob rushed upon brother hewed to piece defender of two house fought bravely to last be finally slaughtered to man sir alexander burnes owed death to fault of others rather than own having be previously at cabul a british agent speaking language perfectly be to people made complaint to looked for redress knew nothing of macnaghten when found condition growing from bad to worse tax increasing trade at stand still food extremely dear employment wanting be on burnes that laid blame yet be time endeavouring in vain to persuade macnaghten that be absolutely necessary to compel ameer to abandon course be exasperating for people of class from most powerful chief to poorest inhabitant of city burnes be unquestionably man of great ability have be in macnaghten place with full power responsibility thing must probably have turned out differently expedition from first be gigantic blunder undertaken in teeth of remonstrance in case be doomed to failure be impossible that must maintain on throne man hated by whole of subject race of fighting men jealous to last degree of independence able to take full advantage of natural strength of country under administration of officer at once firm resolute anxious to conciliate in way british force might have remained until indian government must no longer support expense of occupation must then have withdrawn quietly with puppet who have proved so utterly incapable of conciliating people upon whom have thrust great fault in character of burnes be instability alternate fit of sanguine hopefulness deep depression readiness to believe what suited mood of moment characteristic be doubt heightened by unfortunate position in found have have reason to expect that in view of previous residence in cabul knowledge of character of people must have post of political officer of afghan capital only accepted secondary position upon understanding that macnaghten appointment be temporary one that must succeed when however month year elapsed be still without recognized position whatever when advice be never adopted opinion contemptuously set aside by man infinitely inferior naturally came to take worst view of thing fit of depression became more frequent at last fell not because house be isolated for must have held out until aid have come because three men whose duty be to rescue macnaghten ameer elphinstone be alike vacillating undetermined incompetent ameer be only one of three to take step when heard of riot sent down regiment of hindoostanee troop to rescue burnes instead however of marching outside town to end of street in burnes house be situated entered city by nearest gate tried to make way through maze of narrow lane advance be desperately opposed from house roof fire of musketry be kept up after losing two hundred of number fled in utter confusion to shelter of citadel elphinstone in report say that received news at half past seven that town be in ferment shortly after envoy came told that be in state of insurrection that did not think much of expected revolt must shortly subside macnaghten suggested that brigadier shelton force must proceed to bala hissar to operate a might seem expedient while remaining force be concentrated in cantonment assistance if possible sent to sir alexander burnes be not however until between nine ten shelton received order almost directly afterwards note arrived telling not to move a ameer have objected to shelton replied that in insurrection of city there be time for indecision recommended general at once to resolve upon what measure must adopt be then told to march immediately to bala hissar where must receive further instruction from macnaghten just a be marching off note came from officer telling to halt for further order sent engineer to ask reason for order officer be cut down by afghan while dismounting just outside square where ameer be sitting soon after military secretary came with order for to enter citadel when arrived there ameer asked who sent what came there for be forbidden to enter town that must do be to cover retreat of ameer hindoostanee troop in consequence of delay be twelve o'clock before shelton moved into bala hissar by time burnes friend have be murdered riot have spread house be burned shop sacked family of several british officer massacred be certain have slightest energy be shown have small body of troop be despatched when burnes first request for help arrived riot must have be nipped in bud for account agree that for considerable time not more than three hundred men took part in attack even when shelton urged necessity for prompt measure burnes might have be saved except in case of rising at meerut in indian mutiny never did such disastrous effect result from incompetence of british general day passed slowly to angus be maddening to be helpless when great event be happening until became quite dark one came near at seven o'clock heard bolt of door withdrawn man entered with torch by whose light at once recognized hassan guide over pass here hassan angus exclaimed have always thought of a back again in tower near bamian be who have thus made prisoner be sorry to use force effendi there be other way sadut khan charged to look after safety have kept in sight for day be living in house in disguise be absent yesterday evening to take part in conference with other chief did not return until after midnight then said 'there will be tumult in city to morrow hassan probably house of officer burnes will be attacked what will come of know other chief be leaving at once so that if thing

with bring also too must be saved waited on kindly did in power for if must not leave house then follower must join mob keep together forcing yourselves to front so that will be first to enter house take long cloak to throw round get out even at cost of life told that must be done saved life also saved ours for must have be suffocated in snow storm have not cut way out come to rescue so have be done be glad indeed when saw come out have not turned down that lane must have come up accosted telling have important message to deliver to must have asked to come with to quiet spot where might deliver safely a be directly turned down ran round a know captured without noise without being observed by will trust pardon for having laid hand on have order from khan who told that must have to use force a be sure must not however great danger persuaded to leave burnes have happened englishman two others with have be killed one of ameer regiment entered town be driven back there be looting going on everywhere many have be killed many house burnt what be army doing nothing there be force at bala hissar rest be under arm in camp seems impossible angus exclaimed however went on stifling indignation for time have to thank deeply hassan sadut khan for having saved life assuredly took only way to do so for have only told of danger threatened sir alexander burnes must have returned to warn share fate whatever might be a be can not blame be absent thank with heart pray tell khan when see that be deeply grateful to have nobly redeemed promise hope day to thank in person now sahib will start at once hassan said have clothes for to put over own there be fear of being suspected will take to within shot of camp called out four men entered bringing with afghan disguise when be put on sallied out at once five men be fully armed long afghan gun be given to angus azim street be full of people for most part in state of wild excitement though better class looked grave at prospect of retribution must probably fall upon city perhaps to morrow certainly in day two none paid attention to group who differed in respect from majority of around issuing from one of gate made way to cantonment when within few hundred yard afghan stopped after hearty farewell renewed thanks angus azim left have taken off disguise offered to hassan to carry back said have best keep may want again there be saying what may happen accordingly carried with in short time be challenged by sentry halted till latter have called sergeant four men then went forward angus be recognized at once a be known by sight to everyone in camp in short time met officer who told news of massacre of burnes brother broadfoot guard be already known a one man have escaped general slaughter have after hiding for hour come into camp angus went at once to macnaghten house sent in name envoy came out into hall be glad to see that have escaped mr campbell thought that have perished though name be not specially mentioned a among victim be not in house sir angus replied sir alexander burnes have sent out to gather information servant be suddenly seized carried into house where be kept a prisoner day after be dark made escape having obtained disguise from friendly afghan well be glad macnaghten said must excuse now for general be here be holding council have better for to night take up quarter in poor burnes tent will have time to attend to matter to morrow although burnes have residence in city have large tent not far from envoy house occupied when have business in camp be here that received native who brought news who have grievance that wished to report to here angus lay down for night with deep feeling of thankfulness that life have be spared mingled with foreboding that trouble have only begun that there be yet much peril in store before army be safely out of afghanistan in morning angus again went up to envoy have be thinking mr campbell macnaghten said when entered a far a have be able to think on one subject how service can be best utilized temporarily think that if must not mind might be attached to commissariat assist captain boyd captain johnson will gladly do so sir angus said will take up work at once anticipating consent have already written letter for to take to officer glad to have work before angus went at once to commissariat camp two officer be at breakfast rose congratulated heartily on escape how on earth did manage gave a brief account a have done to sir william macnaghten then handed letter have received from envoy be good news captain johnson said heartily will be glad indeed to have aid will have tent pitched for at once by side of ours of course have not breakfasted sit down with do think of state of affair know good deal more than do of disposition of afghan chief think thing look very bad angus said gravely after what seems to imbecility shown yesterday to death of chief be due be impossible to feel anything like confidence in general be universal feeling in camp captain johnson said if have sale here believe everything must go right poor elphinstone be only fit for snug armchair in comfortable club be more able to cope with crisis like than old woman must be in fact for choice must take average old woman order have be given for attack upon town to day be more than likely that will be countermanded if elphinstone can make up mind to throw whole force with exception of strong camp guard against city must certainly carry doubt there might be considerable loss of life must not be helped must certainly be successful then must say ought to turn whole of afghan population out of town move provision store there settle down for winter must beat off attack that afghan must make against a be be terribly anxious about store know originally established magazine for ameer army in bala hissar then macnaghten came up with ameer from jellalabad told that ameer objected to magazine being there be quite enough for macnaghten always give in to ameer wish however ridiculous so have to leave storehouse have built move out bag baggage only place must get be camel shed way between town unless strong

mismanagement up to nd of november matter might yet have be retrieved have conduct of affair be in resolute energetic hand macnaghten be personally brave fearless man have at last felt necessity for strong measure attack upon city must certainly have be attended with success now that first burst of hate passion have passed inhabitant be filled with apprehension at punishment must fall upon none doubted that british army must at once attack town army expected furious at treacherous massacre of sir alexander burnes comrade be burning for order to attack troop be under arm early order be issued for forward movement hour later th regiment of native infantry with two mountain gun came in from khoord cabul having brushed aside opposition have met with on march with valuable addition to fighting strength in camp opposition must have be easily overcome yet until three o'clock in afternoon nothing be done by time what must have be effected with comparative ease in early morning have become far more difficult operation vast number of tribesman have be pouring into city since daybreak two mile of plain between camp city earlier in day must have be traversed without shot being fired be now covered by host of fierce enemy yet after wasting so many valuable hour general instead of throwing whole of force in cantonment of brigadier shelton at bala hissar against city sent only three company of infantry two gun to attack naturally handful of men failed be well for that did not penetrate into city for have done so must assuredly have be overwhelmed before have gone fifty yard however officer in command seeing impossibility of task set withdrew detachment in good order result of day operation if must be so called be disastrous troop who have until then be eager to be led against enemy confident of success be irritated dispirited lost confidence in commander while on other hand afghan be jubilant over what considered cowardice of enemy next day misfortune invited by passive attitude of troop happened only eighty men be in charge of commissariat fort little party be commanded by lieutenant warren early in day threatening force of enemy approached warren sent messenger urgently asking for reinforcement afghan have already occupied old fort commanded road between camp commissariat fort considering enormous importance of store overwhelming force must have be sent out to drive off assailant to occupy fort in such strength that must be held against assault instead of doing two company only of th regiment be sent two captain in command be killed by fire from afghan fort other officer be wounded men fell so fast that officer who be senior in command seeing impossibility of reaching store drew off then order be issued be practically death warrant of army by general elphinstone for party of cavalry to go out bring in little garrison party suffered even more severely than preceding one from wall building orchard storm of musketry broke out trooper after suffering great loss again retired news that general intended to abandon store struck dismay into officer of commissariat captain boyd hurried to head quarter urged general to send force must sweep away opposition to hold fort at hazard general promised to send reinforcement relief be sent a night be coming on captain boyd captain johnson again went to general pointed out in strongest language

sent asking for reinforcement reinforcement came have arrived situation must have be saved kuzzilbashes be ready to side with british several of commander be with mackenzie when saw that help be sent refused to join cause seemed to lost night fighting went on next day until men be utterly worn out ammunition exhausted more must be done when night came on moved out of fort fought way to cantonment brilliant action showed what must be accomplished by mere handful of men well led while mackenzie be thus fighting for store under charge troop in cantonment be condemned to see crowd of afghan looting store within four hundred yard of camp carrying off supply have be garnered for subsistence through winter without man being set in motion gun brought to bear upon plunderer furious at imbecility of leader soldier clamoured to be led against enemy unable to resist demand general ordered th native infantry to move out instead of being led straight against enemy officer in command hesitated halted soon fell back with indignant sepoys general elphinstone be already talking of making term with enemy seemed to despair of victory when attempt have be made to gain success on th however party of th be again sent out under major griffith again be seen what must be done by energetic officer afghan fort be stormed enemy be driven out be routed by party of horse who dashed at gallantly troop must be no longer restrained cavalry infantry artillery poured out there be general plan consequence be that although desultory fighting went on day nothing be accomplished have general plan of operation be laid down combined action fought enemy must have be utterly unable to withstand troop worked up to fury a be by disgraceful inaction have be forced upon in meantime starvation must have already stared troop in face have not captain boyd johnson aided by angus other officer of department gone out to native village succeeded in purchasing certain amount of grain already troop be on half ration even scanty supply must not long be available general while troop be out fighting wrote to macnaghten urging that negotiation must be opened with enemy saying case be not yet desperate be becoming so very fast macnaghten be conscious of conscious under such leading situation be fast becoming desperate employed moonshee mohun lal who be still in cabul under protection of kuzzilbash chief to endeavour to bribe chief of ghilzyes two lac of rupee be offered chief gave favourable reply then macnaghten with usual instability be seized with suspicion that be not sincere abruptly broke off negotiation thereby mortally offending ghilzye chief fresh danger be threatening in direction mahomed akbar khan second son of dost mahomed be on way with force from north have already advanced a far a bamian mohun lal suggested that emissary must be sent to offer large allowance if must join british suggestion be carried out money be spent in other quarter lavishly be now too late quarter of sum must fortnight earlier have sufficed to satisfy demand of chief of tribesman now that success have encouraged assailant of force whole population have taken up arm against inspired alike by fanaticism hatred thirsting for blood be doubtful whether even chief must restrain have chosen to do so in letter journal officer still spoke with kindness respect of

mind be also enfeebled by suffering on very day of first outbreak have be little better have mounted horse have suffered very severe fall be carried back to quarter be altogether inexcusable that lord auckland against advice of commander in chief remonstrance of other military adviser must have appointed man to command beyond others in india demanded greatest amount of energy activity there be many men who might have be worthily selected men with knowledge of political condition of afghanistan of feeling of people of language of country general elphinstone knew nothing of thing depended entirely upon advice of others have relied solely upon of macnaghten thing might have gone differently asked advice from around took last be offered only to change mind again when heard opinion of fresh counsellor be conscious that position be too onerous for sent down medical certificate of incapacity for action requested to be relieved request have be granted be to have returned to india with macnaghten unhappily other officer have be appointed to succeed be upon lord auckland rather than upon unfortunate officer who in teeth of advice of counsellor of common sense be thrust into position for be wholly unsuited that blame of catastrophe of cabul must be laid macnaghten in hope that brigadier shelton brave officer hot tempered obstinate must be able to influence general to put end to deplorable indecision paralysed army persuaded elphinstone to send for to come in from bala hissar to camp bring in with regiment of ameer troop came into cantonment of th arrival be hailed with greatest satisfaction a be believed that at last something must be done unfortunately however shelton energy general weakness be a oil on water two men be le calculated to pull together shelton enforced argument with vehemence seemed to general insubordinate in extreme while brigadier on other hand be unable to make allowance for physical mental weakness of general be maddened by manner in order have hour before be issued be countermanded on morning of th enemy mustered in great force occupying small fort within musket shot of defence opened galling fire macnaghten only obtained general consent to party going out to capture fort by telling that unless gave order must take responsibility of doing so for at risk fort must be captured thereupon shelton be instructed to take two thousand men attack when be on point of starting elphinstone countermanded order shelton in fury laid case before envoy who be a eager a general be again persuaded to give order force advanced be intended to blow open gate with powder by accident only wicket by side of main entrance be blown in led by colonel mackrell storming party consisting of two company of european four of native infantry advanced

through opposite gate unhappily be not followed body of afghan cavalry threatened to attack storming party outside native british alike be seized with unaccountable panic fled in vain officer endeavoured to arrest flight event of previous week have terribly demoralized shelton set noble example by remaining on horseback alone at last shamed into returning again afghan horse approached again fled again shelton expostulation example brought back gun in cantonment drove afghan off shelton led men up to capture of fort in meantime handful of men who have entered fort have be engaged in

wounded be carried into cantonment to die lieutenant bird with two sepoys be sole survivor have when enemy poured in taken possession of stable barricaded there have successfully repulsed attack when be rescued ammunition be almost exhausted be uninjured fewer than thirty dead afghan lying in front of stable bore mute testimony to steadiness accuracy of aim several small fort be abandoned by enemy quantity of grain be found in a measure be taken to convey into camp be lost again when troop retired desultory fighting went on afternoon without decisive result next two three day passed quietly in meantime moonshee be making effort to bring over of chief to side macnaghten be sending off letter after letter to political officer with sale urging necessity for instant advance of force at jellalabad on th enemy occupied hill within range of cantonment planting two gun there opened steady fire macnaghten spent hour in endeavouring to persuade general brigadier of absolute necessity for driving enemy off hill without success be not until took responsibility upon that detachment under shelton be ordered to be sent be then four o'clock in afternoon troop advanced in three column infantry rushed forward with such impetuosity that two gun with must not arrive in time to herald attack detachment poured in volley within ten yard distance be unsteady from exertion in mounting hill fire took effect minute later afghan cavalry charged down upon attack be unexpected men in confusion afghan rode through through rank british troop retreated down slope where re formed behind reserve gun opened fire with great effect infantry again marched up hill cavalry now came into action drove enemy before infantry carried height enemy fled abandoning gun be now getting dark party of ameer infantry removed one of gun afghan marksman be keeping up heavy musketry fire troop british a well a sepoys be so demoralized that refused to advance carry off other be therefore spiked rolled down hill while smaller gun be brought by ameer troop into cantonment enemy now strongly reinforced attempted to intercept retreat be beaten off on th major pottinger officer came in wounded reported that ghoorka regiment have be retiring from kohistan have be entirely destroyed defended courageously against overwhelming force held barrack occupied until maddened by thirst then rushed to stream where enemy fell upon cut to piece two mounted officer alone escaping after innumerable danger on th macnaghten heard that there be hope whatever of assistance from sale who be surrounded with difficulty now urged that force must retire to bala hissar behind whose strong wall must have maintained shelton vehemently opposed step must have saved army from destruction urging that abandonment of cantonment must be acknowledgment of defeat on rd of november enemy again appeared on hill from have be driven strong force moved out against strangely enough however only took one gun with day be disgraceful a well a disastrous for british force be signally defeated gun be lost troop re entered cantonment in headlong flight hotly pursued by afghan till reached protection of earthwork conduct showed how completely imbecility vacillation of commander effect of insufficient ration on have to subsist have destroyed moral of troop men who month before must have driven afghan before like sheep be now unable to cope with even when in superior number on th elphinstone addressed letter to macnaghten stating opinion that position must no longer be maintained that must at once enter into negotiation with enemy accordingly sent message to insurgent chief inviting to send in deputation to discus condition of treaty two of leader came in a demanded that british must surrender at discretion giving up with arm ammunition treasure a prisoner of war macnaghten resolutely rejected offered term angus have be constantly employed from day reached cantonment work be to go out with small party of native employed by commissariat to bring in grain that boyd johnson have purchased there be slight risk in work for although villager be glad to sell corn on good term party who fetched ran risk of being cut off by band of tribesman might encounter of evening talked over situation prospect with two officer absorbed in work a be be le influenced by feeling of hopelessness than who have nothing to do to rage over trap into have fallen through incapacity of leader still did not attempt to disguise from magnitude of danger have faith in treaty must be made boyd said afghan be only bound by word a long a pay to keep will take macnaghten money will promise that will be allowed to go down pass without molestation be mistaken indeed if will not be attacked moment enter if do so few of will ever get through men be weak now from want of sufficient food be utterly dispirited demoralized a be shown by shameful flight yesterday besides will be encumbered with host of camp follower woman child be still of opinion that only hope be to take refuge in bala hissar shelton vehement opposition have already put stop to for must rather that attacked here even if attack meant annihilation must be better to die so than cooped up hopelessly in pass at best march must be terrible one cold be severe already hear that snow be deep in pass not so deep a to render impracticable deep enough to render passage terrible one of course be bound to stay with rest do best to end be not for that three might escape speak language well enough to pas a native indeed have already done so however of course be not to be thought of indeed must probably amount to same thing in end for must scarcely hope to reach either jellalabad candahar be not to be thought of johnson companion said have to do duty to last still hope that general may yet have hour of inspiration deliver battle in good order believe that troop must fight well if did see that be properly handled on following day learned that akbar khan have arrived be greeted with great enthusiasm much firing of gun macnaghten have faint hope that must side with a father mother brother be in hand in india on other hand have reason for bitter animosity against british who have without ground for complaint invaded country dethroned father prince bore reputation of being frank generous far brighter more cheerful than majority of countryman at same time be passionate impulsive given to sudden burst of anger wrong that family have suffered be indeed at present predominant in mind for two year have be exile from country father who have tried so hard to gain friendship of british have be dethroned by a be notorious that captive be always honourably treated felt that action upon part must recoil upon head be now heir to throne if must win be extremely popular among people who hailed advent a giving leader whom must rely upon under whom chief of tribesman must lay aside mutual jealousy animosity join in effort to drive foe for ever from country did not however at once assume chief authority nawab mahomed zemaun khan cousin of dost mahomed have be proclaimed ameer by tribesman order be sent forth in name be man of humane honourable nature of polished manner affable address a soon a learned state of affair akbar khan took immediate step to prevent further supply being taken into camp burned village where grain have be sold placed band of men to attack party coming out from camp to purchase grain day after day passed messenger came went between macnaghten nawab nothing be done food supply dwindled only three day ration remained in camp supply doled out be scarcely sufficient to keep life together ox other baggage animal be in such state of starvation a to be wholly unfit for service store of fuel have long be used up men died of cold suffered much macnaghten be still hopeful early in december again urged retirement in vain enemy have now gun planted in several position kept up almost constant cannonade on camp on th there be three day half ration left general informed macnaghten by letter that be absolutely necessary to surrender upon best term must be obtained three senior officer also signed letter saying that concurred in on th there be one day food left for fighting men camp follower be starving again again macnaghten urged that force must sally out at cost bring in provision general knew that men must not be relied upon to fight time have come when even macnaghten saw that hope have gone save in surrender drew out rough draft of treaty met leading chief of afghan at about mile from river by treaty british be to evacuate afghanistan be to be supplied with provision for journey shah soojah be to abdicate to have option of accompanying if did so wife family be to remain a hostage until dost mahomed family be released troop at jellalabad be also to retire a well a at ghuznee candahar four british officer be to be left a hostage to return to india on arrival of dost mahomed family on frontier conference lasted two hour main stipulation be agreed to meeting then broke up on understanding that british troop be to evacuate cantonment in three day that provision must in meantime be sent in treaty be humiliating one macnaghten be not to blame for when three military chief have declared that there be nothing for surrender be forced to make best arrangement must term of treaty be a good a must have be expected in circumstance when conference broke up captain trevor one of macnaghten staff accompanied chief to city a hostage for sincerity of envoy on th bala hissar be evacuated akbar khan pledged to conduct garrison safely to cantonment kept promise succeeding in inducing crowd of horseman who gathered round to let little detachment pas provision however be not sent in a agreed chief refused to send until garrison be withdrawn from fort occupied round cantonment party be suspicious of other good faith on th snow began to fall heavily macnaghten tried desperately to win over of chief lavishing money among afghan made fresh demand demanded more hostage lieutenant conolly airey be handed over to on nd akbar khan sent in fresh proposal to effect that british be to remain in afghanistan till spring then to withdraw a if of own free will shah soojah be to remain a ameer akbar a minister a reward for service akbar be to receive annuity of bonus of macnaghten accepted term agreed to meet akbar offer be so strange that elphinstone others thought that be probably plot macnaghten replied that did not think that be so in case must go after breakfast sent for officer of staff lawrence mackenzie trevor who have returned begged to accompany to meeting hour later set out with few horseman a rode on macnaghten admitted to officer that be well aware that be dangerous enterprise that be playing for heavy stake prize be worth risk at event said thousand death be preferable to life have of late be leading party met at hillock six hundred yard from cantonment where horse cloth have be spread upon snow by akbar khan servant macnaghten presented to akbar splendid horse have admired dismounted took place on blanket trevor mackenzie lawrence sat behind suddenly envoy companion be violently seized from behind three officer be dragged away compelled to mount horse ridden by afghan chief who rode off through crowd trevor unfortunately slipped from insecure seat be instantly cut to piece while other two reached mahomed khan fort alive in meantime envoy be struggling desperately on ground with akbar khan exasperated by resistance of victim whom have only intended to seize afghan passion blazed out drawing from girdle pistol macnaghten have given day before shot through body instantly follower closed round hacked to piece thus died gentleman who in other circumstance might have made great reputation for possessed of unusual talent course be marred by propensity to believe that wished to disbelieve ran counter to own sanguine project during last month of life did man must do to avert catastrophe have be unable to instil spirit into of military commander to induce to take only course to redeem position by giving battle to foe surrounded be author of ill fated expedition to afghanistan be noblest victim peculiar temperament be fatal to even when there be longer ground for hope still continued to be sanguine have along believed in scoffed at warning of men who knew country people of burnes rawlinson pottinger others be thoroughly sincere be always able to convince that what believed must be true acted accordingly be not strong man have be so course of event might have be altered deferred in way to shah soojah wish however much might be opposed to own judgment allowed to misgovern country to drive native to desperation by exaction of tax gatherer to excite bitterest animosity of chief by arrogance with treated strong man must have put stop to must have intimated to ameer that held throne solely by assistance of british bayonet unless followed british counsel must at once yield to oft repeated wish of indian government order retirement of troop chapter xv doomed army even murder of british envoy within sight of camp failed to arouse military authority from deadly lethargy sullenly troop remained in cantonment not man be put in motion to avenge deed to redeem honour of army only idea be to renew negotiation have be broken short by murder of political chief commissariat have nothing to do beleaguered a be be impossible to collect provision unless strong force be sent out military authority refused to allow man to be put in motion have confidence in soldier soldier have none in be leader who have made what be macnaghten in wrath have spoken of a miserable coward be not coward have at first full confidence in if ordered must gladly have attacked afghan force in open have carried cabul by storm kept in enforced inactivity while fort after fort be wrested from without effort being made to relieve garrison while whole of provision for winter be carried off before eye by enemy despised feeling that on few occasion on be led from entrenchment there be plan order opportunity for showing valour none for engaging in battle lost heart day by day be exposed to continual insult from exultant foe day by day exposed to heavy cannon musketry fire while food served out be insufficient to maintain strength almost insufficient to keep alive be not wonderful that fighting power be lost that have become little more than rabble in uniform angus have now no official duty to perform spent much of time with old friend eldred pottinger now major who after macnaghten murder took place by right of seniority a well a of energy talent a chief political officer have be employed in west have be sent to cabul very shortly afterwards have proceeded to kohistan returning almost sole survivor of little force be stationed there counsel since then have always be for energetic measure voice like of macnaghten availed nothing have however taken prominent part in affair having be confined to bed by wound have received be now recovering from took up work with same energy a have displayed at herat a said to angus seems to be fate to have to do with incapable men at herat be yar mahomed kamran here be shelton elphinstone elphinstone kamran have in younger day be fighting men be utterly worn out bodily mentally by disease age shelton be brave man hard fighter temper overmasters when in field show personal gallantry military capacity at first be always in opposition to general have given up a useless beyond always endeavouring to thwart chief when latter be roused to momentary flash of energy by macnaghten have sunk into deep gloom a if regarded a absolutely hopeless to struggle further must that other than have be placed in position now hold term proposed to macnaghten be hard enough will be still harder still more disgraceful now however disgraceful may be will be accepted by military leader name will be associated with most humiliating treaty british officer have ever be called upon to sign prevision be correct negotiation be renewed without slightest allusion being made to murder of macnaghten a if such event have never happened while be going on little food be allowed to enter camp enough to sustain life more at last term be settled afghan chief agreed to supply provision to send in baggage animal upon payment being made for six officer be to be handed over a hostage musket ordnance store in magazine money in treasury good property belonging to dost mahomed be to be surrendered dost family to be returned provision be made for safety of man have placed upon throne pottinger endeavoured in vain to obtain better condition received support from military chief even when at last agreed to term did so with little hope that must be observed warning came from friend in city that dependence must be placed upon chief in spite of promise force must certainly be attacked on way down through pass step be taken by chief to send in provision carriage animal escort be to accompany did not make appearance on th of january military authority determined to march out contrary to advice of pottinger who argued that without carriage provision without protection of chief a promised prospect of four thousand troop twelve thousand follower being able to make way down through pass be small indeed angus have come to rely very much upon azim for information a to what be passing outside cantonment latter have during three year come to speak afghan language perfectly in attire of peasant often went out after dark mixed with insurgent entered city have time went out brought back le hopeful report than on previous one angus be more impressed since young fellow be generally cheery disposed to look on bright side of thing taking indeed comparatively little interest in what be going on around having absolute confidence that master must find way out of difficulty might confront quite agree with say azim be powerless to act in way if be here a private person must certainly disguise endeavour to make way down to candahar a officer must remain at post come what may share fate of rest if be disposed to try get down will not throw obstacle in way will furnish with money sufficient to pay way back to persia down into india where with knowledge of language will have difficulty in finding employment azim laughed master come will stay with just a be in employment of government can not leave so be in employment angus did not attempt to push matter further for felt that must be useless indeed although must have done what must to procure follower safety felt that must be great loss to in many way have be so long together have gone through so many danger in companionship that regarded azim a friend rather than a servant when have be in city azim have ever seen friend sadut sir have heard that have be in city many time that be with afghan horseman who drove people in have not seen must speak to if do so yes might thank in name own for having saved life other day on account say anything to about future can not make overture for help to man who though friend of own be fighting against indeed however willing might be to aid to best of power must not do so if be really attacked in pas mixed up a will be with camp follower must not be found in crowd may be sure that tribesman ghazee fanatic will be mad with bloodshed hate that even chief must be unable to stand between victim even if be to send messenger to to say that men must again save if must let know in part of column will ride must refuse to do so must be act of treachery on part to others weaker le able to take care of than be on afternoon of day when force moved out of cantonment eldred pottinger sent for angus be ready to undertake hazardous mission asked be so hazardous must send one upon be not that consider that who stay here be running a great risk after murder of burnes macnaghten have not smallest faith in chief keeping to promise manner in have failed now to carry out term of treaty heightens distrust in believe that of messenger have be sent down of late have succeeded in getting through indeed until to day be impossible to say whether must really start not message sent down be necessarily vague be indeed only request for aid know doubt sale know that be a difficult for to fight way up pass a be for to make way down now that in spite of advice elphinstone shelton other officer have decided to wait no longer to start at once specific message must be sent be ready to try to get through angus said have doubt that while have be negotiating here tribesman from country round have be gathering in pass only way must be for to join party of men from village going way once fairly in pas among tribesman must leave party mingle with others of course must be slow work going on afoot must say that must be quite impossible on horseback have not much hope that mission will be of real use for sale be besieged in jellalabad still one must make attempt will enter in journal trusting that will day be recovered that a last hope have accepted offer of mr angus campbell to carry message to general sale saying that be starting begging if be possible to make diversion in favour by advancing a far a can to meet will not give written document be well known to many of officer who went down with sale therefore question can arise a to message bear being genuine one if be searched letter found upon must be death warrant still believe if anyone must get through alive can will do best anyhow angus said will start a soon a becomes dark be easy enough a far a khoord cabul after will keep sharp look out if overtake party of villager will join will come say good bye to before start campbell angus returned at once to tent have disguise ready own azim yes sir have ready have two of long gun dagger pistol have own pistol azim yes master will be a well to take must be seen directly if have in girdle doubt must azim there be good many english pistol among now there be three pair got at sir alexander house there have be several officer killed since can give out took part in fight at sir alexander got pistol a share of plunder be going anywhere master yes be going to try to get down through pass to jellalabad will start a soon a be dark will be terribly dangerous journey hardly think will be more dangerous than going down with troop be to take master will get ready there be not much that can take will go down to store myself get eight ten pound of ground grain there be not much of for mill have be smashed have have to serve grain out whole know that there be two three sack left in store there be meat to be have spirit not must take spirit if must get for if be found upon must excite suspicion at once thing must stain face hand be nearly a brown a of afghan if be searched took thing off must see in instant be white know how be to get stain must think master that if be to bake grain quite black then pound pour boiling water over so a to make like very strong coffee might do very good idea well will not want for next two hour will go round see of friend say good bye to mind do say word to anyone about leaving will be sure not to do master azim went out to little tent of thick native blanket few yard from of master there sat looking through entrance until saw master leave tent five minute later issued out in afghan dress long coat lined with sheep skin black lamb wool cap high boot sheep skin breech at once set off at brisk walk there be at time many afghan in camp indeed many of camp follower have since cold set in adopted same dress therefore attention be paid to question be asked by sentry a passed out at gate a soon a got among garden enclosure broke into run continued until reached village mile half away here entered one of cottage have news for one of four men sitting there said yes good news master start a soon a be dark will be on foot be going to try make way down through pass be good news indeed afghan said be afraid that must never get chance road will go by ca say exactly be sure to leave by western gate must have more chance of getting away unnoticed on side of course will be in afghan dress will be on look out suppose that will be armed yes will carry one of long gun brace of pistol have best choose spot where can close on suddenly for must certainly fight till last will be careful man said want to get pistol ball in body will follow at distance until find convenient spot be sure to keep along at foot of hill so a to avoid people on plain will suit best also a will not have far to carry mind must make struggle when seize a if be violently resisting then when start must order to walk threaten to blow out brain if try to escape master can learn truth afterwards if be to know now must be furious with in few day when fighting be going on in pass great disaster occurs will thank for having prevented from throwing away life especially a know perfectly well that english in jellalabad must not come out to assist here when angus returned to tent found azim busy roasting grain afghan costume have be laid aside everything be ready master grain be nearly done wo take long to pound up got few stick down at store kettle be just boiling then a soon a be ready will stain sha' put on afghan dress until last thing have cooked of flour yes sir have made four cake be baking in ash now thought perhaps must eat one before started can carry others for to morrow wish azim angus said that there be chance of journey being useful feel convinced that good can come of moonshee have sent in report confirms rumour heard there can be doubt that general sale be strongly beleaguered in jellalabad will have work to do to hold place therefore will be absolutely impossible for to fight way up pas then why must go master because have be asked to go a forlorn hope also because however great risk may run think that be greater than must be if went down with army have baggage animal have food for only three day more will only last that time by cutting down ration still further unfortunate camp follower be for most part without warm clothing of sort will die by thousand a to troop have doubt that most of will fight when know that unless cut way through be doomed chance of victory be small here in open plain might even now if well led worked up to enthusiasm by stirring speech thrash afghan numerous a may be pent up in pass under fire from hillside by foe can not reach for in present weak state must never scale mountain believe will be massacre rather than fight at rate if be to be killed must rather be shot a spy than go through such awful scene a there will be before bullet finish want to die at master if be will of allah so be a say must rather be killed straight off than struggle on through snow in pass get killed in end a soon a became dusk angus follower put on disguise few minute later eldred pottinger came in well a far a look go will pas anywhere campbell certainly a regard language there be fear of being suspected real difficulty will be in explaining where came from village have sent contingent of fighting men if happened that met anyone from place pretended to come from consequence must be very awkward intend to give out have come down from arcab be little village to south of ghuznee went out there once with detachment to buy cattle be hardly likely that of men from place must have come here for must naturally join band be threatening garrison there of course can invent story to account for not doing same pottinger nodded well campbell hope that will get well through a told have not shadow of hope that sale will be able to lend hand to still although be one in thousand chance feel that ought to be attempted in case say honestly that consider there be greater risk in going down by having own wit to depend upon than in going down with army if one can call broken dispirited soldiery army for in case bravest clearest head must share fate may be of dullest most cowardly quite see agree with that nothing can be slighter than chance of army getting down safely be assured that happens so far from blaming will consider that did best for by sending on mission will walk with to gate pottinger said in daytime there be check upon anyone passing in out at night sentry be on alert a be armed must certainly be stopped minute be spent in packing scanty store into pocket of coat then started for gate here pottinger after seeing through shook hand cordially not only with angus with azim whom have learned to like value for devotion showed to master in herat proceeded on way without meeting party of afghan until neared foot of hill then a be passing along path through orchard party of men suddenly sprang out upon be thrown down on face before have time to offer resistance angus indeed have repressed natural impulse to try to draw one of pistol resistance must have meant death seemed to that must only be plunderer what be doing fool exclaimed do not see that be friend answer be given captor be binding hand tightly to side then before raising muffled head in blanket be then lifted to foot heard men say to azim that be to accompany that if attempted escape must at once be shot man on side of put hand on shoulder one said be to walk quietly with escape be impossible be well for not to attempt angus indeed felt that escape be out of question be unable to conjecture into whose hand have fallen be not bent upon plunder for have be so must have taken arm searched probably cut throat afterwards seemed impossible to that must know be british officer only conceivable explanation must think of be that men have be scattered round cantonment to prevent anyone from leaving going out with message to one other of chief that have seen azim come out have followed seized be now taking to chief to be questioned a to why be in british camp after dark for what purpose have left certainly affair reminded of friendly capture at cabul seemed to altogether impossible that sadut must have learned that be about to start on mission have even learned must have known that azim must have followed road on have be captured soon found that path be following be upward one a became steeper steeper be sure that be being taken into hill once twice addressed captor received answer walked a far a must tell for two hour at last there be pause heard door open felt that be being taken into hut then for first time pistol knife be taken from sash captor after addressing few whispered word to men who be already in hut retired closing door behind piling heavy stone against blanket be then taken off head bright fire be burning in hut saw be fifteen foot square four men armed to teeth be standing by fire there be door save one by have be brought in be evident that hut consisted only of room be unhurt hope said to azim yes be knocked down before have time to think of doing anything do know where have brought threw cloth over head how must have happened azim can not understand at more can sir when started to fight against infidel never thought that must be attacked by own countryman seems to that there must be mistake then turned to afghan why be brought here what harm have done know not man said must have done something comrade must not have brought here be business seems to angus said angrily be business too tribe be not at war with others be new thing afghan must attack other when be uniting to fight stranger know nothing about only know that comrade brought here left to look after there be plenty of traitor among men who have taken infidel gold will be reckoned with when have finished with white men well did not tell to keep bound will take off cord if swear by faith that will make attempt to escape angus hesitated seemed to that if two of four men slept azim must if unbound snatch at weapon at least make fight for chance must be gone if gave word said will make bargain with men who have deprived of liberty well just a like other said seating by fire make matter to may a well sit down too angus said advancing near fire sat down by side of afghan azim did same where did say came from man who have be spokesman of party asked angus briefly named village have before decided upon then sat looking silently at fire saw that chance of being able to discover at present plan for escape be very small presently one of men said let have supper rising went to corner of hut where carcass of sheep be hanging from rafter cut off leg divided into slice spitted on ramrod then put over fire in meantime have unceremoniously placed four cake be taken from captive in ember to warm up when meat be done leader said to angus wish to starve will untie hand of one of let eat when have done will fasten up again let other eat in same way be done when be again securely bound angus said in pushtoo may a well lie down now friend perhaps in morning men who have taken will find out that have made mistake will let go with apology for having treated friend so roughly lay down close together angus be afraid even to whisper to follower lest must excite suspicion of guard for hour remained watchful then saw two of afghan lie down other two lighted pipe be evidently going to keep watch have tried quietly once twice to see if cord bound must be loosened found that although have not be tied unpleasantly tight be securely fastened did not yield in slightest to effort therefore gave up idea of trying to free from indeed even if guard must sleep prospect be hopeless for from noise made in rolling rock against door be certain that must not be opened without waking sleeper must therefore be necessary a preliminary to kill of even then might not be able to break open door at rate there be nothing to do at present after trying in vain to discover explanation of capture fell asleep woke several time in night found that two men be always on guard next morning heard stone removed from door one entered afghan breakfasted time permitted captive to share meal with from time to time one other of afghan went to door looked out at two o'clock one of said infidel be moving others went out have thought of way of escape angus whispered in persian to follower can think of nothing azim murmured a there seemed obstacle to going out angus joined captor must see on snow covered plain below dark mass of troop surrounded by host of camp follower while beyond hovered horde of afghan from time to time horseman rode in evidently delivered message then went off again departure of troop have be fatally delayed be ordered to begin at eight o'clock in morning at hour stood to arm day be clear bright although four mile from camp angus must clearly see what be going on although be now two in afternoon only portion of troop have left camp be not till six o'clock when night have already fallen that rear guard left already confusion have set in rank of soldier be broken up by terrified camp follower presented appearance of vast mob rather than organized army have started at hour fixed might have reached khoord cabul in safety loss of time be fatal only six mile be accomplished be two o'clock in morning before whole gathered when be seen that number be already diminished wretched camp follower accustomed to heat of plain of india thinly clad be first to succumb hundred especially of woman child sat down in snow be frozen to death already afghan be hanging on flank sometimes making rush cutting down many of unresisting multitude soon after two o'clock native came up to hut delivered order to afghan who at once cut up remainder of sheep divided between then leader said be to move rope bound prisoner be loosened one end be tied round wrist of captive other being wound round waist of afghan allowing slack of yard half a soon a be done party moved off descended hill for distance then followed lower slope in direction in army be moving kept on till long after midnight then halted at deserted hut far behind must see flame of burning cantonment have be fired by afghan a soon a have removed everything of slightest value in morning angus saw that halting place be high up above entrance of khoord cabul pas there be a yet sign of army in afternoon be seen approaching in confused mass night have be dreadful one soldier camp follower horse baggage cattle be huddled in confused mass warm clothes have be served out to follower hundred be frozen to death during night while others be so badly frost bitten that be unable to walk a soon a troop started again afghan horseman attacked rear seizing baggage capturing gun cutting down encountered at noon akbar khan with six hundred horseman rode up pottinger sent captain skinner with six horseman to communicate with akbar said that have be sent out by nawab to protect from attack of ghazees instruction be to demand other hostage a security for evacuation of jellalabad to arrest progress of force supplying in meantime with everything required until news of evacuation of jellalabad by sale be received troop however did not halt until reached entrance of cabul pas night be even more dreadful than preceding day have be sepoys burned cap accoutrement to obtain little warmth number be frozen to death at daybreak crowd of soldier camp follower began to push forward only thought now being how to escape death akbar khan spent hour in negotiation four more hostage be demanded pottinger volunteered to be one of captain lawrence have be specially named pottinger chose mackenzie a third be agreed that force must move down through khoord cabul pas to tezeen there to await tidings of evacuation of jellalabad chapter xvi annihilation of army in terrible confusion crowd of fugitive be now nothing more entered terrible pas ghilzyes at once commenced attack in vain did akbar khan chief endeavour to restrain fanatic from hillside from rocky crag opened murderous fire that day three thousand men fell either from musket fire from knife of afghan dooly bearer have deserted on first day greater portion of camel pony have be captured so far lady have escaped rode next to advanced guard a be considered safest point for soldier here maintained sort of order afghan therefore devoted attention to helpless crowd in rear again column halted in snow in morning camp follower made rush ahead troop who be ordered to march at ten o'clock did not move for in spite of remonstrance of officer general countermanded order believing akbar khan must send in provision troop to protect terrible night be passed then captain skinner rode into camp with new proposal from akbar khan namely that english lady of force must be placed under charge that might be accompanied by husband pottinger remembering that akbar khan family be in hand of british believing that be sincere in wish to save lady child from destruction sanctioned proposal elphinstone at once accepted be choice of two evil on one hand akbar khan have proved faithless on other certain death awaited lady be insufficiently clad have scarcely tasted food since left cabul have passed three terrible night in snow undoubtedly be wiser course to trust to akbar khan accordingly party of afghan horse rode in lady macnaghten lady sale ten other lady twenty child eight officer rode away under escort next morning survivor started sepoys have already lost greater portion of number remainder threw away gun must no longer use owing to hand being frost bitten joined disorganized rabble in front be attacked in narrow gorge pas be soon choked with dead dying not single sepoy survived of sixteen thousand men soldier camp follower have left cabul four day before not more than quarter be now alive akbar khan watched slaughter be going on declaring that be powerless to restrain ghilzyes whom even own chief must not control advised that remnant of british army must lay down arm place under protection general very properly refused offer for akbar khan have already acknowledged that be incapable of restraining tribesman march be continued rear guard be commanded by shelton nobly did work repulsing several attack of enemy giving time for ahead to pursue way before daybreak started again in hope that might reach jugduluk that day despair gave soldier strength moved off quietly in order to obtain start of camp follower who paralysed action latter however be soon on foot a usual endeavoured to push on ahead of troop for mile retreat be uninterrupted presently heavy fire opened on rear guard camp follower then rushed in tumultuous crowd past troop when little later head of column be attacked again fled to rear not only hampering movement of soldier carrying many of away by impetus of rush steadily until day broke afghan marksman maintained fire soon afterwards advanced guard reached village ten mile from jugduluk halting only till rear guard came up again pushed forward shelton with handful of rear guard kept afghan at bay covered retreat until arrived in jugduluk where took post behind ruined wall there be however little rest for afghan in ever increasing number posted on height opened terrible fire three bullock be found among camp follower be instantly killed served out to famishing soldier who devoured raw again akbar party approached captain skinner went out to remonstrate with for permitting continued attack afghan prince declared incapable of repressing men a order be disregarded handful of th regiment issued out made gallant rush at enemy drove back a main body did not follow example again retired behind ruined wall night long through next day force remained at jugduluk akbar khan sent in message inviting general shelton captain johnson to conference promised to send in provision promise a usual broke insisted on retaining three officer a hostage conference be resumed next morning akbar now seemed in earnest in desire to put stop to slaughter petty chief of tribe between jugduluk jellalabad be now present must listen to entreaty command to offer of large sum of money thirsted for blood be determined to extirpate infidel mahomed shah khan to whose daughter akbar be married then came forward asked whether british must pay two lac of rupee for safe conduct to jellalabad general agreed to seemed that at last safety of survivor be ensured at eight o'clock in evening survivor who now numbered hundred twenty of th twenty five artilleryman again set forth provision have be sent in during two day halt be terribly reduced by famine afghan rushed down among camp follower killing unresistingly soldier however held together bayonet in hand drove off assailant until reached jugduluk pas struggled up narrow terribly steep ascent until when near summit came upon barricade composed of bush branch of tree here column be thrown into great confusion camp follower crowding upon soldier latter fought with desperation while afghan massacred unresisting camp follower twelve officer fell here number be large in proportion to of men have be no better clothed have suffered equally from cold hunger did not give way to depression that during first two march have reigned among troop be upheld too by feeling of responsibility necessity of keeping up appearance of cheerfulness hopefulness in order to encourage men after desperate fighting twenty officer twenty five soldier managed to break way through barricade at daybreak reached gundamuck there be two round of ammunition remaining in men pouch most of be already wounded be resolute not to lay down arm when called upon to do so refused then mob of afghan rushed down upon one officer few private be taken prisoner seven officer succeeded in cutting way through being mounted left afghan behind reached futtehbad sixteen mile from jellalabad here however be attacked by peasantry two be cut down at once others rode off be pursued overtaken four of be killed one only dr brydon reached jellalabad alive sole survivor of four thousand five hundred fighting men twelve thousand camp follower with exception only of who have be taken over by akbar a hostage greatest disaster ever befell british army be due to vacillation weakness have characterized action since murder of sir alexander burnes have force pressed forward at once on morning when left cantonment greater portion must probably have reached jellalabad two day have be lost before army reached khoord cabul pas about ten mile from city there be fresh halt fresh delay fresh futile negotiation again again during time thus thrown away enemy from mountain round be gathering in pass to oppose building fatal barricade in pas of jugduluk have force pushed forward with only occasional halt of few hour must not have be enfeebled by hunger by slaying baggage animal abundance of food must have be obtained for opposition encountered must have be comparatively feeble cold must have be only formidable antagonist truly seemed that curse have fallen upon army that be divine retribution for most unjust iniquitous war day angus follower have be taken along always being halted in position whence must see terrible tragedy be being enacted angus be half mad with grief with fury that be not in place among troop azim in vain endeavoured to comfort by pointing out that be not fault that be not there that have be sent away from army by order of superior that even have not be taken prisoner must not be sharer in what be going on in pas be true azim be poor consolation to feel sure that pottinger foresaw what must happen that be a act of friendship in giving chance of getting through safely that sent down be doubt kindly meant must thousand time rather have shared fate of rest well master for part own be glad be up here have wish to be killed especially a must do good to anyone why must man throw away life allah have given to will die when time come must be wicked to throw away uselessly be very well to talk like azim when one be in safety when one see one comrade being slaughtered man must not be worthy of name did not long to be with to die fighting by side indeed know not at present whether life be to be saved know not into whose hand have fallen why must thus be taken along to be spectator of massacre whole thing be bewildering to illustration angus be half mad with grief with fury that be not in place among troop now generally conversed in persian guard although keeping a strict watch a ever on interfered with little fortunately worst scene took place at night be therefore hidden from on hill incessant rattle of musketry alone telling of relentless pursuit on night of th roar of fire have be louder than ever at last ceased suddenly angus guard alike remained awake angus listening in agony to sound of combat afghan talking together in low tone what do think have happened asked when minute have passed without sound of shot being heard akbar khan have succeeded in persuading ghilzye chief to spare what few there be left of infidel last man have be slain angus felt that latter be by far more probable solution throwing down on ground burst into tear eight day of mental suffering have shaken terribly now feeling that worst fear have be realized broke down altogether before daybreak captor moved distance farther up into mountain by cautious manner in made way often pausing to look back round angus concluded that be desirous of avoiding contact with countryman have indeed before observed how careful be to avoid afghan scattered on hillside now concluded that must be taking to tower of chief to be dealt with a might direct shot at once held by a hostage for whose delivery might obtain handsome sum must british again advance up pass day travelled among hill at last came upon large village there be men about doubtless have gone to take part in fray woman came out eagerly questioned a to fighting on night before know nothing leader said believe that last of infidel have fallen know nothing for certain without pausing took two prisoner whose appearance have created no surprise a be taken for native to chief tower much larger building than abode of most of petty chief standing upon crag of rock overlooked village entrance be only obtainable by ladder leading to door thirty foot above rock coming have be observed old man stood at door so be back suffyd yes a see have chief returned be two week since saw last started then with fighting men from here other village expect will not be long before return for from what have heard work must be nearly done party ascended ladder leader spoke word two with old man who looked greatly surprised captive be taken into room by furnishing be evidently one of chief private apartment be free to move about house leader said must not leave in few minute woman entered bringing dish of boiled grain with portion of mutton in gave usual afghan salutation be followed by woman with jug of water two mug bottle be placed on low table then without word left room minute later returned with large earthenware dish full of burning charcoal be good beginning azim angus said spirit rising at sight of hot food for although have not be actually starved have be on extremely short ration when supply of flour be exhausted captor being like reduced to handful of unground grain day doe not look a if meant to cut throat evidently afghan be acting under order order must have be that be to be well treated ate hearty meal then angus said see what there be in bottle azim cork have already be taken out azim poured of liquor into tin handed to master latter smelt be afghan spirit said same a sell in bazaar in cabul filled up with water drank off now azim do do same azim who be not very strict mohammedan have more than once tasted forbidden drink at cabul needed pressing well master said a put cup down after be better than lying dead frozen down in pas angus warmed with good meal by draught that have taken must not disagree with follower begin to think that be right azim though did not believe so yesterday be certain that have joined countryman must have perished with assuredly have be saved from eight day of awful suffering from death if indeed be saved from death think can feel certain of master be not way afghan treat man whose throat intend to cut certainly make pillau for provide with bottle of spirit do know have be thinking azim angus said after short silence that if have be possible for sadut khan to know that intended to leave camp in disguise might be work again must not have known one major pottinger three four officer to whom said good bye knew anything about besides must have sent men who captured before who knew by sight even supposing seems to be impossible that be doing why not have sent here straight instead of taking eight day to do journey must have be made easily in two forcing to witness awful scene in pass be most extraordinary however there be question sir that whoever captor may be have be mean of saving life there can be doubt of azim though may not feel that at present will in future be very grateful to even if be to have shot directly come here must still be grateful for must be sudden death not lingering one a have be to below well be of use puzzling over matter suppose will learn how came about when chief whoever be return here in meantime be certainly great deal better off than have be for past two month in cantonment that be master to begin with be warm for first time since winter set in in next place have have good meal feel must grumble at anything a to mission said that nothing must come of even if succeeded in getting through so that in respect nothing have be lost by journey being so suddenly brought to end next day of men who have be away with chief returned old man in charge told angus that only one man out of who have started from cabul have reached jellalabad that several officer have be taken a hostage including two general major pottinger captain johnson two others also that lady child lady husband have accepted protection of akbar be relief indeed to angus to find that friend pottinger johnson have be saved a captain boyd be one of married officer also must have escaped massacre a to fate of elphinstone shelton be indifferent be to that misfortune have befallen army be largely due thought that three greatest friend have escaped gave much pleasure with exception one man out of sixteen thousand five hundred must have escaped be appalling that loss have be terrible be well aware be hardly prepared for total annihilation of force two day passed continued to be well fed treated woman who waited upon seemed to regard a guest rather than a captive talking freely with only being silent when angus endeavoured to find out name of chief be evident that on point have order to keep silent on third day heard stir in village shout of acclamation welcome room in be confined be at back of house be therefore unable to obtain view of what be passing will learn fate now azim angus said have fear of being bad one master can not doubt that order be given that must be well treated if be kept prisoner till spring for part will not grumble if continue to treat a well a have be doing heard sound of many footstep loud talking then door opened sadut khan entered advanced with hand outstretched to angus dear friend said how thankful be that have be saved where so many have perished so be chief to whom owe life angus said returning warm grasp of sadut hand did not thank at first for seemed to shameful that english officer must not share in fate of comrade sadut smiled in case must have shared fate be not from have saved from being killed on way down knowing that pass be full of people be sure that must have be taken murdered story must have told must have availed be not ghilzye member of of tribe there must assuredly have be detected killed have not saved be so sadut although at first be half mad at being unable to join countryman saw before end came that have done so life must have be thrown away uselessly exactly be why ordered that must be enabled to see passed from what have seen of be sure that at first must bitterly resent being taken prisoner that even if knew into whose hand have fallen must resist be for reason did not time employ hassan follower to seize though through journey kept close at hand to use name authority must party of tribesman meet not that have much fear of detection have done so men with have order that in case did meet such party be to treat not a captive a forming part of own band still be a well that hassan must be at hand in case of need thank with heart sadut must not have done so at first can do so now have indeed saved life few day ago seemed to a nothing for felt be dishonoured in looking on at massacre of countryman have have time to think over since now know that view took be exaggerated must have joined be plainly duty to have done so if be prisoner blame must attach to have chief taken part in terrible business with twenty of own horseman rode with akbar who be friend relative have intention of drawing sword against people knew that have be promised protection thought that akbar force be going to escort word have be given did not think must withdraw think be intention to do so must have done much more than did must not have saved fugitive nawab be alone among afghan chief in sincerity of assurance akbar have influence with ghilzye chief even have influenced must not have restrained tribesman ghazees die be cast be allah will that who have invaded country without pretext dethroned dost mahomed who have eagerly sought alliance forced man hated upon must meet fate over over again implored akbar for sake of pledge word to assist people even if in effort to do so fell then name must go down a long a nation existed a one who died in defence of oath honour be all along irresolute at time did best short of attacking ghilzyes at other time held aloof altogether from scene at rate can feel that honour be not soiled be not one of who signed treaty have done best to prevent that treaty from being violated have people sallied out from cantonment given battle must have fought against even have there be treaty must not have taken part in massacre of men who be practically defenceless who be in way responsible for crime of government be glad to hear say so chief must have be grieved indeed have taken part in so treacherous terrible massacre how did learn be going to try to make way down to jellalabad have never be able to understand kept watch over whole time friend hassan one of men who knew be always in camp dressed a one of camp follower even then can not imagine how must have told be going knew few hour before started only major pottinger three four of friend be aware of watch be good one chief said when two afghan issued from tent may be sure news be quickly brought to men who have for day be lying in readiness who be prepared to repeat adventure in city suddenly to astonishment of angus azim threw on knee master exclaimed can kill own that be who betrayed have met hassan in camp told that assuredly white man must escape alive that be settled that must be attacked slain in pass said that sadut khan have resolved to save to do with certainty must be necessary that must be informed a to movement where must ride when army started said that unless helped might be impossible to save then agreed to do so met one of men day a soon a have left tent after telling of expedition ran to spot where knew must find hassan told that be going alone said at once that must be certain death be to try to go down pas that must be carried off a soon a have left camp knew well that must be greatly angered that if suspected must kill for treachery be nothing compared to life so turned traitor to be willing now that must order to be taken out beheaded angus held out hand to faithful follower must have be angry at first grieved angry too can not be angry now did what believed to be best for acknowledge that have turned out so treachery be act of fidelity undoubtedly be mean of saving life did wrong be with best intention ought to have confided in knew that if did so must not have consented be true enough still be best judge of what be consistent with honour however next to sadut khan owe life must be poor gratitude be to reproach let say more about will remember always that saved life will forget that somewhat betrayed trust have for four year past regarded a friend rather than a servant will esteem even more so in future azim retired with tear of joy in eye sadut angus have long talk together a if by mutual consent subject of late event be avoided conversation be upon journey across bamian sadut doings since time stayed at khooloom until governor whom have trusted implicitly handed over dost mahomed family mine to people happened to be away at time on return two day later be warned by hassan of what have taken place when dost returned from captivity among turkoman of course joined accompanied to kohistan fought by side in battle of purwandurrah ameer have said word even to of intention to surrender be thunder struck when heard that have given up remained there took part in attack on ghoorka regiment at charekar after returned home fortress a know lie far to west among momunds place doe not belong to to husband of sister of mine be at present at place with husband who be ill a wished to be nearer to scene of action begged to use fort a residence desired to hold aloof from negotiation a knew that most of chief be open at moment to betray cause for british gold still be often down in city where own house to be taken no longer hated people a infidel kindness to showed that there be goodness in religion a well a in mine be still ready to fight against a invader of country now chief what do propose to do with be for to decide friend know what will say though may regret deeply will certainly offer opposition be guest be not for to dictate to must be happy if must stay with till trouble have passed place wholly at disposal whatever may decide upon thank indeed be clear to that if be in power must immediately rejoin force be sure that must be wish will send down with strong escort to peshawur must rather join sale at jellalabad sadut khan shook head in case said will have rescued in vain sale force be already besieged will be repetition of cabul by order of akbar khan ghilzye chief have risen town be practically without fortification though hear that white soldier have be labouring hard to put place in state of defence if army at cabul must not withstand still le will sale force be only third of strength hold jellalabad forget chief that be commanded by man not by utterly incapable person be not dispirited by forced inaction want of food say that jellalabad may not be taken feel sure that will offer sturdy resistance news of what have happened in pass will only fill soldier with fury at rate sale be only force remains of army to be attached be there that be duty with permission to go be sure that be in place must also be decision so be sadut said after long pause be to go to peshawur might meet death there also a doubtless force will endeavour to relieve jellalabad in case must certainly go with will never force way through khyber pas from what hear sepoys at peshawur be almost in state of mutiny sikh have sapped loyalty have assured that will never be able to force pas when do move forward can not be depended upon to stand by british troop so that danger may be a great one way a however jellalabad be choice not mine citadel there be strong when town be captured a certainly will be soon troop can retire there may hold out until make term be allowed to return to india think will make term sadut have have terrible lesson a to manner in treaty be respected by greater portion of chief be not likely to trust again to promise will hold out until have fired last cartridge can not hope to defend sadut said positively akbar khan will head army think sadut that know yet what british soldier can do when well led there have be no great battle fought since entered afghanistan must not judge by small fight took place round cabul soldier there have lost heart confidence in commander will be very different thing when meet confident in in leader believe host however large frighten know how have overcome many of best fighting race in india that in teeth of odds a great a can be brought against here say not word against courage of people want discipline training even host of men fighting for can not withstand charge of well disciplined soldier why did not come up pass then to aid friend because be deficient in carriage be in country altogether hostile to have many sick must have left strong force to guard there may have be other reason of know not be sufficient for force to enter pass without animal to carry food wounded must have be madness believe that sale have not more than twelve hundred bayonet force sufficient to do wonder in plain must hardly fight way up pass against thousand of good marksman a afghan assuredly be armed with gun carry much farther than own firing in safety behind inaccessible rock whether jellalabad can resist attack a believe whether place fall be matter doe not affect resolution be duty to be there if will afford mean of getting there will assuredly go will start to morrow then sooner be off better news of what have happened in pass will spread like flame through country fighting man will turn out to complete work there be pathway from here go straight down to gundamuck will ride with with dozen of follower there be plenty of pony on hill certainly question will be asked suspicion can arise when get near jellalabad will see how can best enter will ride round place with a be friend of akbar will be supposed that be examining place to see where attack have best be made there be many orchard small village round when be a near town a can get can slip from horse a go through orchard keep under cover in garden until close to wall when get within musket shot can tie white cloth to gun will then be safe plan be carried out two day later after grateful parting from preserver angus stood at edge of moat opposite one of gate chapter xvii jellalabad sentry have already sent down word that two afghan have approached carrying white flag officer appeared on wall what do want asked want to come in thompson be angus campbell have escaped almost by miracle there be shout of pleasure minute later gate be opened thompson ran out warmly shook angus by hand be delighted to see said thought among slain in pass what awful time have be since left cabul on way a believed to india can scarcely believe terrible news even now have learnt little from brydon who be thought only survivor except hostage who tell be given over few day before end came be desperately wounded must scarce sit horse when arrived have be too ill to give detail can give very little for be not with army started evening before left camp on mission from pottinger to sir robert sale pottinger did not think that help must possibly come at same time thought right to make one more effort to communicate with general to tell that be on point of starting have gone short distance when be captured fortunately men who took be follower of sadut khan be taken to fort be absent at time when returned at once gave liberty escorted to within quarter of mile of wall a return for service have rendered two year ago be piece of luck indeed then saw nothing of yes saw great deal captor be suppose anxious to see what be going on followed course of army keeping on hill except for fighting at night saw almost whole of tragedy while be talking be approaching head quarter of general angus be well known to sir robert to whom have often carried message note from burnes macnaghten when first greeting be over repeated story have told captain thompson thought best to say word of escape being result of preconcerted plan on part of sadut khan a felt that might suspect that be privy to scheme have taken advantage of friendship of momund chief to make escape be not so surprised a might otherwise have be general said since received letter from pottinger yesterday akbar have allowed to send down thinking that information that elphinstone shelton lawrence mackenzie pottinger be right might induce to submit to term said ' trust before will have heard that be about to start from mr angus campbell who nobly accepted desperate mission of penetrating through pass bringing word of intention must have arrived safely beg to recommend most strongly to authority for accepting mission seemed almost hopeless one have rendered great service during time troop have be in cantonment by aiding commissariat officer in bringing in grain a have not arrived naturally feared that have be murdered on way down be glad indeed that have escaped will now of course give assistance to macgregor political officer if can not utilize service sir can have little political work to do now will be glad if will attach to one of regiment where think may be most useful have better talk over with macgregor first know of course if doe not want will attach to own staff with knowledge of afghan language service might be invaluable in obtaining information must make sortie have already made one with effect must be glad if wish to attach to infantry cavalry whichever prefer now that have told about please give detail can of what saw of fighting can hardly be said that there be fighting sir until last day troop be so completely surrounded may say overwhelmed by camp follower that be practically unable to use arm general shelton with rear guard fought nobly covered retreat into jugduluk until time when be enticed with general into akbar camp there held a hostage by what heard handful of men left only about hundred fifty told fought desperately to break way through barricade with afghan have blocked top of pas only ten officer succeeded in breaking through of one be killed on road soldier died fighting at barricade many officer last sepoy have fallen two day before have be bad business general sale said bad not only in terrible result in manner in affair be conducted here received with astonishment news that four thousand five hundred british troop be cooped up by horde of afghan without one single attempt being made to bring on battle in open officer men alike be astounded when pottinger first letter arrived saying that negotiation be continued after murder of macnaghten however be matter for future investigation now personal question can tell how be that wife lady macnaghten other lady escaped uninjured only know from pottinger that lady child be handed over to protection of akbar that who have husband be also accompanied by lady be always kept close behind advanced guard sir a showed unbroken front afghan allowed to pas without opposition falling upon confused mass behind do think that akbar be sharer in treacherous attack think conduct be doubtful in extreme sir certainly did try more than once to persuade ghilyze chief to allow survivor to pas on unmolested by time passion of afghan be absolutely beyond control have great doubt whether must have interfered have not be well aware that interference must be useless be only opinion based upon fact in first place shot macnaghten whom have invited to conference in second place took step whatever to carry out condition to supply baggage animal provision lastly because know long before column set out on march sent out order to ghilzye chief to attack case certainly look very black against general said at least may hope that a family be in hand in india will protect hostage hope sir that will hand over to nawab who appears to to be thoroughly honest man undoubtedly did best to persuade chief to agree to treaty with certainly did send in provision to camp generally formed high opinion of kindness of heart fortification be stronger than expected to find from what have heard sir yes men have worked incessantly at ever since came here mud wall can scarcely be said to have existed when marched in there be parapet ditch be

on other be bitterly disappointed when saw state of wall be question for time whether must not content with holding citadel only be at last determined for time at least to hold town a retirement to citadel must look like weakness consideration be once in citadel must be shut up entirely for a see stand in middle of town with street crowded with enemy there must be no getting out to obtain provision result have proved wisdom of step took wall be now strong enough to be obstinately defended from extent have be able to sally out at one gate bring in provision have two day food when arrived here now have succeeded in gathering in sufficient quantity to keep troop on half ration for two month hope that before be finished will be relieved from peshawur gave native handsome thrashing on day before got in here attacked in great force trying especially to carry off baggage infantry repulsed splendidly however came on to renew attack cavalry be placed in ambush troop after

truth of terrible massacre have to be told be happy to say that although filling with wrath indignation have in way abated spirit during six week rest have have since battle of st of december have a see really done wonder in way of fortification consider that be in position to repulse attack however formidable when do expect that relief column will arrive from peshawur be grave question can not answer last news be that brigadier general wyld be on point of advancing from tone in wrote have evidently no great hope of success four sepoy regiment have be corrupted by sikh who having great repugnance to enter pass have endeavoured successfully to inspire sepoys with same feeling sikh who be to co operate with be in state of open mutiny threatened to kill general avitable if interfered

brave man surrounded with difficulty ready to attempt almost impossible to bring aid to fear however that there be little chance of relief until reinforcement from india reach peshawur opinion be justified when on th news be brought that movement have failed on th colonel moseley have started under cover of night with rd th native regiment to occupy fortress of ali musjid have be held by small corp of men of one of native tribe under mr mackeson have be true to salt have resisted attack of afridis moseley force arrived there at daybreak met with little opposition on way be discovered that owing to blunder only fifty supply bullock have be sent on instead of three hundred fifty must have accompanied force therefore instead of having month provision have enough for few day brigadier wyld started on morning of th to relieve on preceding day sikh troop refused to enter pas marched back to peshawur nevertheless wyld determined to press forward with two native regiment a soon however a enemy attacked sepoys at head of column wavered opened aimless fire in vain brigadier officer endeavoured to persuade to advance must not move forward must rest of troop advance to assistance two gun

increased to eighteen hundred better man than pollock must have be chosen possessed at once great firmness kindness of heart manner calculated to inspire confidence declared to central authority at once that even with brigade have come up with to advance up pas must be to court defeat four sepoy regiment have be engaged must in present state not be counted on for service force at disposal be therefore no greater than wyld have lost set to work in first place to restore confidence be difficult task many even among officer have become affected with spirit of defection did not hesitate to express opinion that advance through khyber pas must involve repetition of cabul disaster new sepoy regiment be at once visited by emissary from of wyld brigade from sikh who endeavoured in way to persuade also to refuse to enter pas succeeded in case of th native regiment who joined four other battalion in refusing to advance on day after arrival general pollock visited hospital enquired into

british leader british soldier at worst other british commander men at best may be confidently affirmed that have sale be in place of elphinstone with full power of action fight in pass must never have taken place within three day of murder of burnes afghan host must have be mob of fugitive cabul must have be in hand british soldier be always best in attack be ready eager to fight against odds

similar order be sent to pollock latter however mindful of honour of country safety of hostage lady replied that being almost without carriage must be impossible for to retire at once thus gaining time utilized by entering into negotiation with akbar khan for release of prisoner general wisely kept order have received secret from troop who must have be profoundly disheartened however secret have be made a to order issued in calcutta news soon spread over india reached pollock camp that army be to be withdrawn pollock did best to throw doubt upon truth of report by marking out new camp two mile in advance arranging with native to bring in supply there so a to give ground for belief so far from leaving town be preparing for advance in meantime have written urgent letter pointing out evil difficulty of immediate withdrawal immense advantage must arise by striking heavy blow before retiring so to extent retrieving reputation of british army letter have influence governor wrote must be desirable undoubtedly before finally quitting afghanistan that must have opportunity of striking blow at enemy since circumstance seem to compel to remain there till october governor general earnestly hope that will be able to draw enemy into position in may strike blow effectually be good news effort be being made to collect carriage cattle in hindostan for purpose of withdrawal pollock determined to turn to account if there be carriage enough to enable to fall back upon peshawur there must be carriage enough for to advance on cabul in meantime negotiation be going on for release of

be at liberty to first march to cabul to meet nott have be preparing for movement pollock have sent several expedition against hostile tribesman have recovered one of captured gun on th of august left

found hill commanding road through jugduluk pas occupied by large body of enemy who opened heavy fire gun replied infantry then in three column dashed up hill drove ghilzyes from one strong body have taken refuge at apparently inaccessible point british storming party scaled height enemy fled without waiting for assault at close quarter thus on hill where afghan have massacred elphinstone troop be now taught that if well led british soldier must defeat in position have deemed impregnable at tezeen second division joined first force halted for day afghan believing that betokened indecision mustered force for final engagement akbar have a have threatened to do if advanced sent off captive to bamian pas with intention of selling a slave to turkoman on th two army be face to face valley of tezeen be commanded on side by lofty hill now swarmed with men enemy horse entered valley british squadron charged drove in headlong flight cut down many infantry climbed hill on side under terrible fire from afghan gun to made reply well knowing that musket be match for long firearm of enemy a soon however a reached summit fixed bayonet charged with mighty cheer only few of enemy stood ground fell rest fled day firing be kept up until at last enemy occupying highest ridge be in spite of sturdy resistance driven off fairly beaten on own ground in own style of warfare troop fought with extraordinary bravery be animated by desire to wipe out disgrace have fallen on arm be maddened by sight of numerous skeleton of comrade in jugduluk akbar khan saw that be up fled while tribesman scattered to home army marched forward without opposition to cabul in meantime nott have be busy on th of may inflicted decisive defeat upon dooranees outside wall of candahar on th of august army evacuated that city on th arrived at mookoor up to point opposition have be offered inhabitant have be friendly supply be obtained without difficulty afghan governor of ghuznee have raised country have taken up very strong position near source of turnuck on th force met position of enemy be unknown a thick mist covered country cavalry rode forward to reconnoitre cut up party of afghan infantry in plain pursuing hotly came upon hill crowded by enemy who opened heavy fire fell back in orderly manner when body of enemy horse appeared on hill above squadron of native cavalry charged be cut up by fire of body of afghan foot who have hitherto be hidden enemy horse poured down trooper already suffering from infantry fire turned fled panic spread whole of cavalry be soon in flight two british officer have be killed three wounded fifty six men disabled nott on hearing loss marched out with infantry on reaching scene of fight found that enemy have retired on afternoon of next day nott marching forward came upon fort held by enemy artillery opened upon with little effect afghan army ten thousand strong have be watching now opened artillery fire from height foot men moved forward to attack a neared infantry charged with cheer broke fled two of gun tent magazine store be captured on th of september nott encamped before ghuznee began to prepare for assault enemy however be in humour for fighting greater portion of tribesman have scattered to home after defeat garrison lost heart altogether evacuated city governor set off with few follower for cabul next morning british entered town without firing shot on following day however governor returned with large number of tribesman who have just arrived on th nott attacked hard battle be fought be indecisive on following morning enemy disappeared have received news of defeat of akbar at column however be again harassed when troop advanced cleared way in good style tribesman here have be actively engaged in cabul insurrection twenty six of fort be burned a punishment on th army encamped four mile from city learned that pollock have occupied cabul two day previously angus campbell have taken part in operation of advance on th of august news have arrived at gundamuck by messenger from moonshee mohun lal who have throughout kept force at jellalabad well supplied with news of what be passing at cabul now sent to say that on previous day akbar have despatched captive under escort of three hundred horse to bamian that be to be taken on to khooloom there handed over to governor once there be certain that must remain in captivity among tribe until death released a soon a heard news angus went to macgregor be going to ask said if will allow to go on expedition on own account be thinking that be just possible that captive might be overtaken be probable that will halt time at bamian certainly must come up to there with so many woman child will be impossible for convoy to move fast may stay at bamian until result of operation here be known have already promised that part taken by sadut khan will be forgiven seeing that did best to persuade akbar to give protection to retreating army also because showed great kindness to when be in hand if can obtain permission from general will start at once in disguise for fort in mountain can not think that will aid might with four of follower who have come from bamian be personally well known to succeed in way in rescuing at least few of captive eldred pottinger captain boyd captain johnson be dear friend of mine must willingly run risk in endeavour to save possibly if overtake party may in way cause delay must enable rescue party sent off when reach cabul to get up in time be brave offer campbell enterprise seems to almost desperate one however think must be justified in refusing be sure that if anyone must succeed will do so when will start in ten minute sir if will furnish with authority to offer bribe to officer in command of escort will go see general at once be well aware from report have made of kindness sadut showed of effort to save army have doubt that chief have fought against in last battle be only natural feel sure that above thing pollock must embrace offer promise slightest chance of rescuing hostage risk must be terrible campbell of course there must be risk angus agreed see how must be exceptionally great have journeyed a afghan two three time already without detection must just a well do so again at rate be willing to undertake enterprise must of course be useful for to take considerable sum of money to win over guard still more useful if general must authorize to offer term must tempt cupidity of commander a have always found that afghan be ready to do almost anything for bribe will take at once with to general be well acquainted with service rendered pottinger at herat have rendered army ever since began march from indus know favourable report have be sent in by pottinger burnes angus have indeed be introduced by sir robert sale to general pollock on arrival at cabul on reaching tent found for moment unoccupied listened gravely to macgregor statement of offer that angus have made be noble proposal mr campbell said in usual kindly courteous way risk seems to terrible must anything happen to service must be deprived of one of most promising meritorious officer at same time there seems fair possibility that may succeed in rescuing one more of captive of course must be quite out of question that of lady must escape there must be hot pursuit only horseman well mounted must hope to get off however feel justified in refusing offer affords shadow of hope of saving such men a pottinger will do mr macgregor suggests to facilitate operation will doubtless pas through cabul will at once write letter to mohun lal requesting to give authority in name a well a mine for payment to leader of prisoner escort of sum in reason at present native opinion be strong that will not be able to force pass name of moonshee may have greater effect than promise on part at same time until can get into communication with captive learn something of officer disposition must be madness to attempt to bribe difficulty of journey appear to to be great not insuperable real difficulty will only begin when overtake captive escort feel that sir rely greatly upon men hope to obtain from sadut although not of tribe have attached most strongly to be strong resolute men a one of be petty chief near bamian may be able to gather few others to aid will of course be very glad to have authority to offer bribe to officer in command of party rely chiefly upon men own effort at rate a far a pottinger be concerned captain boyd johnson can hardly leave family possibly by aid of men may be able to collect sufficient number of fighting men to make sudden attack upon escort to carry off captive to hiding place among hill there keep until send on force to bring in of course must be entirely guided by circumstance be impossible for to have fixed plan until see how matter stand can quite see mr campbell greatly a may desire to rescue whole party be eldred pottinger who be first object of expedition be so colonel be most kind to in herat be to owe present position therefore be first object if can free will be great step gained towards rescuing others feel sure that must not think for moment of leaving companion to fate name a defender of herat be known to afghan must be able to bring great influence to bear upon tribesman round bamian whose interest must lie quite a much with herat a with cabul general nodded approvingly see that have thought matter over well if will call here again in hour letter for moonshee will be ready for thousand pound in gold at appointed time angus called upon general received money letter then returning to own tent rode out with azim when fairly away from camp dismounted put on afghan disguise have brought orderly with who took back clothes have discarded be sword to macgregor tent having undertaken to have brought up to cabul with own baggage have difficulty a to way a path have followed with sadut have come down close to gundamuck have little fear of being interfered with on road afghan must have gathered in pass must meet must only have to say that village near gundamuck have be burnt by british be now on way to join sadut fight under order although saw several party in distance making way towards pas did not encounter within speaking distance just at sunset reached sadut fort have passed through village unnoticed tribesman be frequently coming going there be nothing to distinguish from others dismounted in front of fort man be sitting at top of ladder angus held up hand to hassan for be man who have twice captured at once waved hand in welcome stood up have come willingly time said with smile a angus reached of course wish to see sadut khan be within be lucky that have arrived to day for to morrow set out sadut greeted with pleasure mingled with surprise did not expect to see here friend suppose not chief be on mission with be sure will sympathize in hope will aid so far a to spare hassan four men what be nature chief asked know that must not come offer english money to abstain from fighting again must not think of thing sadut know that be fair open enemy think better of for fighting for country may say that general pollock have be informed of kindness to that did utmost to make akbar keep word to grant protection to retiring army can assure that in event harm will happen to yours will tell have come for do know that hostage lady child have be sent away by akbar from cabul that be to be taken over bamian pas to khooloom handed over to governor there that doubtless will be sold a slave to turkoman have not heard sadut said angrily be disgrace to be delivered up trusting to word honour be foul deed of akbar to harm in way after taking oath for protection be infamous infamous walked up down room in fierce indignation what must say burst out if family of dost mahomed akbar be to be sold by people a slave to barbarous race must complain if when news of treatment of hostage becomes known in india dost mahomed family must be treated in similar way then stopped abruptly what be that have come to ask of thing be done can not be undone akbar be ill friend now for have bearded in council denounced conduct certainly have influence must assist be afghan be pledged to join force will oppose march of troop up pass be man of word even be free to help must be of little assistance have here not more than thirty forty fighting men doubt if even must obey on enterprise might ride to own fort summon momunds whom have so far kept quiet enterprise must be desperate one must set other tribe against must not risk destruction merely for sake of rescuing few white men woman sympathy be with tribe round cabul share in hatred of infidel invader must be a much a must do to keep quiet certainly must fail if called upon to embark on enterprise have intention of asking of chief be going to see what can be done to save friend have come to ask to allow hassan men to go with be from bamian at bamian be likely that captive will be kept for time must of course pay well for aid can take chief said at once be good men faithful to rely upon a must not do on of own tribesman will call in at once hassan four men entered room minute later hassan sadut said men have proved yourselves true faithful follower from day when left home to carry over pass although thought that there be hope of getting through have fought by side in kohistan twice at order carried off friend here appreciates service did be in sore need of five men upon whom can rely to utmost have come to ask to let go with sore disgrace have fallen upon nation akbar khan have sent men who placed in hand a hostage woman whom swore to protect over hindoo koosh to be sold a slave to usbeg word have be given to fight against army of gundamuck if attempt to ascend pass at least will keep faith british officer be going to attempt to free of captive how will do so know not best wish will go with think likely that escort of prisoner will halt for little time at bamian more than others might therefore be able to help order to go ask to do so be good work concern honour of afghan moreover angus said will pay thousand rupee to five hundred to of follower will hand over to at once if be successful will pay a much more sum be huge one in eye must suffice to settle in comfort for rest of life hassan looked at men saw by expression of face that be more than willing to accept offer held out hand to angus be servant said will serve truly if need be lay down life for not only for sake of money offer because sadut khan have told that for honour of nation people ought to be released have be comrade in danger before be nigh dead when rescued when buried in snow see not how enterprise can be carried out will do what tell men can not do more when do start hour be of consequence angus replied can find way across mountain in dark if so will start at once certainly can find way must have meal first sadut said besides will need horse will be brought in got ready for in hour see that english officer horse have good feed that servant eats with food will be ready in hour time be lost in hour half after arrival of angus at fort

men have be going about among soldier sahib be discontented at journey have taken at prospect of still farther one if commander gave order to return must not think hesitate to obey let men continue at work let be careful not to appear to be too warmly interested let avoid at present mention of captive simply inflame men mind by talking of hardship of being sent on journey when so much booty be likely to be picked up in pass be not likely that if saleh order to proceed on journey will refuse to do so if learns from officer that men must gladly obey if ordered to return may help to decide to accept offer have to make will put off doing so till last moment because at time news may come that pollock nott be beating back opposition advancing on cabul in case may see that interest lie in

pen ink to write order have sahib angus said taking ink bottle pen such a be always carried by trader from pocket together with several sheet of paper price of good be added up then pottinger wrote

who do think be have be little puzzled not by face by voice have now be angus campbell have guessed right have come up by through pass to try overtake bear message from mohun lal to saleh saying that will be given pension of thousand rupee month present of thirty thousand if will hand over captive to british general when reach cabul have asked opinion a to whether must be safe to make proposition to man whether have better wait until news come that pollock have defeated akbar in pass have told have already sounded saleh that though passed matter off believe be open to take bribe if hears that nott pollock be making way up say that if bad news come think must then be useless to approach saleh will make attempt with men have with to effect escape also mine that of mackenzie lawrence boyd of course must not leave wife family must be impossible to take woman child with campbell be splendid fellow pottinger said behaved wonderfully well at herat be sure that in time must make very fine officer be noble thing undertaking tremendous risk letter be now written handed to angus saleh however took from hand read then handed back after assuring that there be nothing written what have be agreed upon then officer went downstairs with angus azim latter carrying easily enough one small bale sufficed for good unsold have made nice sum out of saleh said have have long journey with good angus replied humbly be well contented paid without bargaining price asked feel lord that be greatly indebted to for opportunity have not money with trader never carry cash will have to wait many month before receive price of good nevertheless lord will willingly give in token of gratitude shawl equal to last have brought with only two can select good like from remaining there be many silk thing among for only bought such a be needed for wear saleh be well satisfied telling angus that might call round in evening with of silk embroidered scarf allowed to return to camp two day passed then horseman rode in with news that akbar have be defeated at tezeen must fight battle a be being joined by many chief must doubtless overthrow infidel news spread rapidly caused much excitement in camp be heightened by fact that man said that there be report that ghuznee have be captured by british force be marching from candahar angus went in evening requested private interview with saleh a johnson have told in note afghan have already be revolving in mind whether must not do better for by halting at bamian until knew how affair must turn out at cabul johnson who have become very intimate with on journey have said casually that british government must assuredly pay large sum for return of captive have taken notice of remark at time have thought good deal of knew that money have be lavishly spent among chief seemed to that too might have share in golden flood be shrewd man a well a unscrupulous one have three time before deserted employer when better offer have be made to seemed to that have now in power to procure sum must make rich for life have be told by sub officer that there be growing disaffection among men that many of openly grumbled at prospect of journey to khooloom that of bamian petty chief have be going among believed stirring up feeling against journey have from first entertained suspicion of cashmerian trader why must not have bought larger store of indian good to exchange with turkoman doubt a to best course to pursue have be heightened at news that have received that afternoon what must happen if british again settled down at cabul must doubtless send force to endeavour to rescue captive although might be at khooloom before did so situation must then be most unpleasant one akbar a fugitive must no longer pay troop must of course leave must not dare to return to cabul be thinking over matter when angus be ushered in latter have already decided that must for present maintain character that have assumed if saleh knew that be british officer must assuredly if remained faithful to charge arrest also a merely agent of mohun lal one of most influential men in cabul afghan must probably allow to depart unharmed even if refused offered bribe have not come to evening to talk of merchandise saleh mahomed angus began have come upon more important matter a know troop from jellalabad have defeated akbar be making way up through pass will defeat again if fight troop from candahar have reached ghuznee assuredly there be force can arrest progress to cabul have only waited for to speak openly to be sent here by mohun lal authorizes to promise in name that of general pollock pension of thousand rupee month gift of thirty thousand rupee if will hold prisoner here until british force arrives to carry back to cabul afghan showed surprise suspected said all along that have come here for other motive than trade what guarantee doe mohun lal offer that term will be fulfilled must not have be safe for to have entrusted message to paper angus said give word word be guarantee saleh said especially word of chief must suggest saleh mahomed that have in power to obtain guarantee even will acknowledge to be binding one have in hand three men whose name be known throughout afghanistan through india a of men of honour have major pottinger captain lawrence mr mackenzie men whose word must be accepted unhesitatingly to whatever promise might make other officer must be sure give written guarantee that offer made by mohun lal will be confirmed carried out by government of india what must do with money without employment if desire employment have doubt that must be granted in addition to money payment command of native regiment raised among pathan of lower hill will think matter over afghan said with wave of hand dismissed angus latter have seen by expression of saleh face when mentioned term that be far higher than have ever thought of have doubt that must be accepted first thing in morning received message from saleh mahomed requesting to accompany to tower afghan beyond usual salute be silent during ride on dismounting saleh told to follow on entering prisoner apartment officer said be aware that prince akbar order be that be to take to khooloom have certainly intended to do so have received news lead to doubt whether may be in position to support if carry out order yesterday afternoon heard that have be defeated at tezeen will fight again with stronger force than before still issue be doubtful may tell that messenger also brought to fort news that force from candahar have taken ghuznee exclamation of joy broke from prisoner thing have happened afghan went on trader last night informed that really came here on mission from mohun lal promise in general pollock name that if release carry to cabul will be granted pension of thousand rupee month thirty thousand a present know nothing of general pollock have great faith in mohun lal seeing that akbar may be even now fugitive two army in cabul if gentleman will swear by god to make good to what syud moorteza state be authorized to offer will hand over to own people offer be joyfully accepted angus be requested by saleh to draw out bond to effect in persian be signed by pottinger lawrence johnson mackenzie agreement be then drawn up by johnson by officer bound to pay a many month pay allowance in accordance with rank a must be necessary to carry out term of agreement thus satisfying saleh must english general refuse to ratify first agreement must receive money from to prisoner lady signed name brigadier shelton heading list while lady macnaghten mr sturt who be widow bound in codicil to pay such sum a might be demanded from by major pottinger captain lawrence johnson be no longer prisoner sahib saleh said when two document be handed to on part have given bond to perform share of condition now must like counsel a to how have best proceed believe that men will gladly obey in matter because be discontented at being sent so far away feel sure that very slight inducement on part to will settle matter if must offer in name gratuity of four month pay when arrive at cabul must settle matter to officer willingly agreed have be thinking over affair night went on think must be best to travel straight for cabul when hear that british have arrived there to wait here hear that many of petty chief in neighbourhood be indignant that akbar khan must have broken promise made have treated so badly who placed under protection while at same time father together with own family be receiving most honourable treatment in india doubtless must rather go straight down to cabul must remember that if defeated akbar with very large number of follower may again fly by route make for khooloom a dost mahomed did when british first marched to cabul must meet on way down must assuredly attack number might be so great that must be overwhelmed on other hand if stay here can occupy largest of little fort set to work to strengthen might then resist force akbar must bring against until british troop arrive to assistance officer be silent for minute then pottinger said what do think brigadier be military matter must say last proposition be safest shelton replied may be sure that moment pollock reach cabul will send off body of cavalry to rescue akbar must have at best only forty eight hour start perhaps not must scarcely venture to stop here to undertake siege will certainly have gun with three hundred men of escort with ten twelve of to lead must be trusted to withstand hurried assault might make upon others agreed that must be safest plan very well saleh said will go now harangue men in meantime can prepare to move will select largest most defensible of fort will move quietly in there then will summon bamian chief proclaim have abandoned cause of akbar now with british ally summon to invite men to join so that when english force arrives here will be free from molestation will receive present in accordance with number of men furnish so saying left room joy of captive broke out in general congratulation among men tear of joy from woman pottinger johnson boyd gathered round angus poured forth thanks to nothing have hitherto be said to lady a to real character of supposed trader for be felt that if enterprise failed disappointment must to be terrible a soon a learned who be what have done too crowded round angus be for time quite confused with expression of gratitude showered upon see pottinger said when din of voice have quieted down that have not informed saleh mahomed of real character thought better not to do so really came from mohun lal if thought have not done so might have doubted whether have authority to make such proposal therefore thought must be well to keep up present character to end perhaps be best so pottinger agreed afghan be always suspicious man who have several time betrayed employer must be more suspicious than other people quite agree with that be best must keep up present character suppose mohun lal really did give assurance about ransom yes general pollock told that must give sum mohun lal might think desirable to offer be figure fixed upon a being high enough to tempt saleh yet not excessive for such service besides thought that might ask more in case must of course have bargained with be sum must tempt afghan chief pottinger said to mere military adventurer like saleh must appear prodigious well will hear of adventure afterwards may return at moment might put out of humour if found that be not ready not indeed that there be much to do even lady will be able to pack up scanty belonging in few minute there must in fact be nothing at to pack have not be for thing bought of next room be in confusion for one of
