higher matter pooh pooh dear first duty of young woman be to look a pretty a can according to experience men trouble much about mind butterfly after be good deal more admired than bee though bee be much more useful in long run if woman be contented to look like butterfly father must be content to be taken for one must say think be degrading that men must look upon in light dress up in sort of color why must be sure ca tell why mary suppose be sort of instinct instinct be seldom wrong if have be intended that woman must dress a plainly monotonously a do must not have have love of decorating implanted almost universally among be on wrong track child on wrong track altogether if who think like imagine that be going to upset law of nature to make woman rival of men in mind if not in manner instead of being what be meant to be wife mother be althogether mistaken be only way of putting father that because woman have for age be treated a inferior ought always to remain so well well dear wo argue over think be altogether wrong have objection to going own way finding out at last for doe not alter opinion that on occasion of set dinner party in county where everybody will be in fullest fig that dress be pretty becoming enough in way admit can hardly be considered a appropriate mary did not answer gave almost imperceptible shrug of shoulder expressing clearly absolute indifference to other people taste so long a satisfied own mary be indeed decided in most of opinion although essentially feminine in most respect set to have belonged at girton have established a principle to own satisfaction that feminine weakness be to be sternly discouraged a main cause of position held relatively to men thus cultivated certain brusqueness of speech expressed opinion uncompromisingly be distinguished by certain plainness in fashion of gown by absence of trimming frillings similar adornment at heart be a fond of pretty thing a other girl of age have when attired be conscious that felt greater satisfaction at appearance than ought to have done doubted whether have not made undue concession to vanity of society in matter of lace flower have however soothed conscience by consideration that be at home for short time while there might well fall in with parent view a must be soon starting for germany to enter upon earnest work father remark then be in sense satisfactory to a showed that although have made concession have at least gone way dinner passed off well mary be fortunate in being taken down by gentleman who have advanced view on necessity of british agriculturist adopting scientific farming if be to hold own against foreign producer surprised by interest exhibited in theory so much so that always spoke of afterwards a one of most intelligent young woman have

painting pot boiler must have devoted to good honest serious work be more than most of can do be obliged to consider what will sell to please public by turning out what call pretty picture child playing with dog trumpery thing of sort bah be sickening to see young fellow wasting life so cuthbert only laughed good temperedly be accustomed to such tirade be indeed of singularly sweet easy temper be end of first week in may great artistic event of year be over academy be opened picture have be seen criticised there be usual indignation at picture being hung generally voted to be daub while others have be considered among studio a certain of acceptance have be rejected two three of cuthbert friend be starting at once for cornwall to enjoy rest after three month steady work to lay

evening cuthbert be delighted with place with usual enthusiasm speedily fixed upon subject setting up easel camp stool began work on morning after arrival have be engaged few hour when two young lady came along stopped close to cuthbert who hated being overlooked when at work be on point of growling anathema under fair drooping mustache when one of girl came close said quietly how be mr hartington who must have thought of meeting here did not recognize for moment then exclaimed why be mary brander beg pardon went on taking off soft broad brimmed hat ought to have said miss brander having known so long a mary brander name slipped out must have be three year since met have shot up from girl into full grown young lady be father mother here came down last week to stay with friend miss treadwyn who be at girton with anna be mr cuthbert hartington mr hartington place be near abchester be one of father client miss treadwyn bowed cuthbert took off hat have known other ever since be child mary went on be to say ever since be child for be big boy then often used to come into house while mr hartington be going into business matter with father generally amused by teasing used to treat a if be small sort of monkey generally ended by putting in passion of course be in early day before came to year of discretion miss brander be growing very discreet damsel when last saw felt rather afraid of know that be good enough to express much disapproval of way very likely did though remember think be very outspoken in day think have changed much in respect mary miss treadwyn said why must one say what one doe not think mary said sturdily must be much better if did so do not agree with mr hartington depends upon what 'better mean must be awful to think of consequence if did so society must dissolve into component part man hand must be against neighbor say that people must say what think be sure that world must not be so pleasant a be by long way if one be to say exactly what did think just imagine what sensation of author artist must be if critic be to state opinion with absolute candor think be better if did so mr hartington in case there must be fewer idiotic book written fewer men wasting life in trying vainly to produce good painting be true enough cuthbert laughed must remember that critic buy book painting that there be plenty of people who buy idiotic book be perfectly content with picture without particle of artistic merit suppose so admitted reluctantly so much worse for cause mediocrity be most of mediocre author like dickens thackeray george eliot be exception so be artist like millais landseer when book painting give pleasure fulfil purpose if purpose be to afford livelihood to make suppose do mr hartington fulfil what ought to be purpose must of course be to elevate mind to improve taste shook head be too lofty ideal altogether for said doubt whether men be much happier for mind being improved taste elevated unless be fortunate enough to have sufficient mean to gratify taste if man be happy contented with street life in house inhabits picture on wall book get from library be better off when teach that street be mean ugly house outrage on architectural taste wall paper revolting picture daub book trash upon word think so be afraid be philistine be artist be not mr hartington miss treadwyn said looking at sketch have already made considerable progress unfortunately have taste for art be must be better off if have not for then must be contented with doing thing like a be be in perpetual state of grumble because can do better know latin proverb meliora video so on mr hartington doe apply be first time have have latin quoted against by young lady cuthbert said smilingly with slight flush showed shaft have gone home will not deny that quotation exactly hit case can only plead that nature gave love for art did not give amount of energy capacity for hard work be requisite to successful cultivation have not even given stimulus of necessity be fancy greatest human motor must be quite content to paint a well a do mr hartington anna treadwyn said must add immensely to pleasure of travelling to be able to carry home such remembrance of place one have seen yes doe so miss treadwyn have done good deal of wandering about in small way have quite pile of portfolio by whose aid can travel over ground again recall not only scenery almost incident however slight that occurred in connection therewith well anna think have better be continuing walk suppose have may ask mr hartington where be staying be sure mother will be very pleased if will call upon at porthalloc there be glorious view from garden suppose will be at work day be sure to find in of evening yes fancy will live in open air a long a there be light enough to sketch by miss treadwyn if mother will be good enough to allow to waive ceremony will come up evening after dinner in meantime may say that will always be found somewhere along shore will be glad to receive with due humility chiding that old playmate if will allow to call so may choose to bestow upon anna treadwyn nodded expect will be here day sea be new to mary at present be wild about how must go on so mary went on a continued walk how must girl replied have not agreed that one of chief object of woman life must not only be to raise own sex to level of man generally to urge men to higher aim yet because have very mildly shown disapproval of cuthbert hartington laziness waste of talent ask how can do well see mary be one thing for to form sort of resolution when be sitting eight ten of together in room at girton when come to putting into execution one see thing in rather different light quite agree with theory hope to live up to a far a can seems to much easier to put theory into practice in general way than in individual case clergyman can denounce fault from pulpit without giving offence to anyone if be to take one of congregation aside rebuke think experiment must be successful nathan said unto david thou art man yes dear will excuse saying at present have scarcely attained position of nathan mary brander laughed well no see cuthbert hartington be not stranger have known ever since can remember used to like very much though did delight in teasing have be angry with for long time though have forgotten remember did tell mind last time saw see father be dear old man quite beau ideal of country squire there be alone in big house while son chooses to live up in london have heard father mother say over over again that ought to be at home taking place in county instead of going on own way have heard other lady say same perhaps mother with marriageable daughter mary anna treadwyn said with smile really see why must be so severe on for going own way be doing so without fancy much deference to parent opinion besides have heard many time rail against soullessness of conversation gossip tittle tattle of society in country town meaning in case in abchester must therefore be last to blame for revolting against forget anna mary said calmly that case be altogether different go way with mere selfish desire to amuse have set what believe to be great necessary aim before pretend that there be sacrifice in on contrary be source of pleasure satisfaction to devote to mission of helping sex to regain independence to take up position have right to of course be agreed on dear only differ in best way of setting about suppose mr hartington will take what said to heart mary replied serenely if doe be matter of entire indifference to subject of conversation certainly showed sign of taking matter to heart smiled a resumed work be just what used to be said to be always terribly in earnest father be saying last time be down that have learned from brander that have taken up sort of utopian notion about woman right so on be going to spend two year abroad to get up case suppose have grown very pretty be very pretty a child though of course last time saw be at gawky age be certainly turning table on hit hard with stale old latin quotation must admit be wonderfully apt have good eye for dress be not many girl can stand severely plain line suit figure face admirably must get friend to sit on rock let put into foreground of one of sketch funny meeting here however will be amusement after that became regular custom for two girl to stop a came along shore for chat with cuthbert sometimes sitting down on rock for hour stay however being not unfrequently cut short by mary getting up with heightened color going off abruptly be cuthbert chief amusement to draw out on favorite subject although over over again told angrily that must not discus with never must resist falling into snare cuthbert laid for must not have minded have argued seriously with be just what did not do either laughing at theory replying to argument with mock seriousness irritated far more than open laughter anna treadwyn took little part in discussion sat amused listener mary have be recognized leader of set at girton real earnestness fact that intended to go abroad to fit better to carry out theory making power among others much a anna liked admired amused greatly to see entangled in dilemma into cuthbert led occasionally completely posing by laughing objection of evening cuthbert often went up to porthalloc where be warmly welcomed by anna mother whose heart won by gentle deferential manner rendered universally popular among lady of family of artist friend must sit smilingly by when conflict of morning be sometimes renewed for saw with satisfaction that anna at least be certainly impressed with cuthbert argument banter afforded very feeble aid to mary brander in defence of opinion feel really obliged to mr hartington said one evening when two girl happened to be out of room when arrived for laughing anna out of of idea brought back from girton at one time gave great deal of concern for idea be old fashioned consider woman mission be to cheer brighten husband home to be good wife good mother to be content with position god have assigned to a being right proper one however have always hoped believed that must grow out of new fangled idea be bound to say never carried to extreme that friend doe fact that be somewhat of invalid that be altogether impossible for to carry out such plan a miss brander have sketched for herself that there be opportunity whatever for to get up propaganda in quiet little cornish town have encouraged that hope have said little on subject since came home think fight with miss brander will go far to complete cure be ridiculous from beginning to end cuthbert said be natural enough be in just same way that young fellow start in life with sort of wild radical notion settle down in middle age into moderate liberal if not into contented conservative world be good enough in way at rate if be to get better will be by gradual progress not by individual effort there be much be very true in miss brander view that thing might be better than be be only with idea that have mission to set right that quarrel earnestness be doubt good thing too much of be misfortune rather than advantage doubt be prejudiced laughed because be afraid have particle of in composition circumstance have be against growth there be saying what might be if be to change at present at rate have never felt want of can admire among others even though laugh at month passed wilson two companion moved further along coast in search of fresh subject cuthbert declined to accompany declaring that found perfectly comfortable where be at companion laughed made attempt to persuade further do know mary anna said few day later mr hartington remind strongly of beatrice benedict what do mean anna mary asked indignantly nothing dear anna replied demurely except that be perpetually quarrelling may be that mary said shortly certainly will not arrive at same kind of conclusion to quarrel might do worse mary mr hartington be charming mother who be not given to general admiration say be one of most delightful men that ever met be heir to good estate unless be greatly mistaken idea have occurred to if not to thought so before have be convinced of since determined to remain here while men be with have gone away will make downright angry with anna if talk such nonsense mary said severely know very well that have always made up mind that nothing will induce to marry give up freedom at rate for great many year then only to man who will see life a do become co worker allow independence mr hartington be last man must choose have aim purpose must ruin life a well a own thank however be convinced that be altogether mistaken cuthbert hartington must no more dream of asking to be wife than must of taking for husband idea be altogether preposterous however week later cuthbert on going up to porthalloc one morning catching sight of mary brander in garden by herself joined there astonished by showing that anna be not mistaken in view commenced abruptly do know miss brander have be thinking over argument have come to conclusion that woman have really mission in life object be not precisely that have set be closely allied to view being that mission be to contribute to sum of human happiness by making one individual man happy do mean be possible that can mean that think woman mission be to marry asked with scorn be going back to that be entirely what meant be particular case be thinking of rather than general one be thinking of case mine say that might not do something towards adding to happiness of mankind mankind be not yearning for on other hand be sure that must make happy be yearning for kind of happiness be really in earnest mr hartington quite in earnest very much so in six week have be here have learnt to love to desire more earnestly certainly than have ever desired anything before that must be wife know that credit with great earnestness of purpose be quite earnest in do love mary be sorry to hear be surprised really truly surprised thought disapproved of altogether did think gave credit for being sincere be clear did not must not suppose must give up plan before even commencing like very much cuthbert though disapprove of a much a thought disapproved of if ever do marry hope will never be weak enough to do so must be to someone who have same view of life have feel sure that will never love anyone if love be really what one read of in book where woman be always ready to sacrifice whole life whole plan to man who graciously accepts sacrifice a matter of course be afraid that must be answer said gravely yet be not disposed to let chance of happiness go without at least knowing that be so can quite understand that even feel that be really in earnest so small did feel chance be must have waited for time before risked almost certain refusal have not be that be on point of going abroad for two year two year be long time to wait

off telegram ordering carriage to meet by evening train also one to mr brander begging to be at house if possible when arrived upon hearing from lawyer that father have be aware that might be carried off at moment by heart disease that have strictly forbidden doctor writing to informing anyone of circumstance said be just like father do wish have not be so might have be down with for last three month of life squire went on just in usual way cuthbert be sure that preferred so shrunk a said from knowing that people met be aware that day be numbered even with after first conversation on subject made allusion to be a cheery bright a ever when last met week ago even who knew circumstance must see difference whatever in manner thought be wrong at first came to conclusion afterwards that decision be not unwise one spared three month of unavailing pain have fear of death be able to go about a before to meet friend without health being subject of discussion in way to go on a usual until call came death be evidently painless sat down in easy arm chair after lunch for usual half hour nap evidently expired in sleep servant found a believed still asleep when came in to tell that carriage be at door be only on touching discovered what have happened sent carriage off at once to fetch dr edward looked in at office took over with got back in time to write to shock that squire sudden death caused in abchester be fortnight later obliterated by still greater sensation caused by news that bank have put up shutter dismay excited thereby be heightened when became known that manager have disappeared report got about that loss of bank have be enormous first investigation into affair more than confirmed worst rumor for year have be engaged in propping up firm not only of mildrake co have failed to meet engagement on day preceding announcement of bank failure of three others have broken down immediately afterwards in of firm mr cumming be found to have have large interest on day after announcement of failure of bank mr brander drove up to fairclose looked excited anxious when went into room where cuthbert be sitting listlessly with book before have piece of very bad news to tell mr hartington said indeed cuthbert said without very great interest in voice yes daresay heard yesterday of failure of bank dr edward looked in here a be driving past to tell of have money in wish be be much worse than sir father be shareholder in bank never mentioned to cuthbert said air of indifference still unchanged only bought share comparatively short time ago think be after be here last time there be vague rumor afloat a to credit of bank father who did not believe took few share a proof of confidence in thinking said that fact that did so might allay feeling of uneasiness wonder that allowed to invest in bank share mr brander of course must not have done so if have have slightest idea that bank be in difficulty be in way behind scene transacted legal business for in way of drawing up mortgage investigating title seeing to purchase sale of property here in county beyond knew nothing of affair be not consulted at in matter father simply said to ' see that share in bank have dropped little hear there be foolish report a to credit think a county gentleman ought to support county bank wish to buy say fifty share for ' be just like father cuthbert said admiringly always thought great deal of county can quite understand acting a did well be ten pound share think so be only five hundred gone at worst be afraid understand case mr brander said gravely shareholder be responsible for debt of bank to full extent of property although earnestly hope that only bank capital have be lost ca disguise from that in event of there being heavy deficiency will mean ruin to several of shareholder be bad indeed cuthbert said thoroughly interested now of course have idea at present of what state of bank be none hope for best be sorry to say report morning mr hislop who be a know chairman of bank have shot if true will of course intensify feeling of alarm among shareholder cuthbert sat silent for time well said at last be sudden news if thing be a bad a possible fairclose estate go will be better off than many people will have five thousand pound came to by mother settlement suppose yes doubt share have not be transferred to name a father executor have intended when came up next week to go through account with to recommend to instruct to dispose of at once must have done in capacity of executor without transferring in first place to therefore claim there may be will lie against estate not against personally be satisfactory anyhow cuthbert said calmly know how must get on without of course will be sorry to lose place in respect loss will be almost relief to country life be not vocation have be wondering for last fortnight what on earth must do with a be will if come to worst be obliged to work never have worked because never have be forced to do so really know that prospect be altogether unpleasant at rate be sure must rather be obliged to paint for living than to pas life in trying to kill time lawyer looked keenly at client saw that be really speaking in earnest that indifference at risk of loss of estate be unaffected well said after pause be glad indeed that take so easily of course hope most sincerely that thing may not be anything like so bad a at worst call of only few pound share will be sufficient to meet deficiency may exist still be heartily glad to see that be prepared to meet event in such spirit for to most men chance of such calamity must be crushing possibly might have felt more if have come upon two three year later just a have got to be reconciled to change of life see have so recently unexpectedly come into estate have not even begun to appreciate pleasure of possession to feel that weigh in slightest against necessity of being obliged to give up life have be leading for year by bye went on changing subject carelessly how be daughter getting on in germany happened to meet at newquay three week ago told be going out there in course of week so suppose have gone yes have gone mr brander said irritably be just a bent a be if will permit to say so on carrying out of own scheme of life be great annoyance to mother argument have be thrown away upon a unfortunately girl have couple of thousand left under own control by mother sister be in position to do a liked however hope that year two will wean from ridiculous idea have taken up must doubt whether cure will be a prompt a think seemed to that idea be somewhat fixed will need good deal of failure to disillusionize be a obstinate a little mule mr brander said shortly however must be going went on rising from chair drove over directly have finished breakfast must hurry back again to office well hope with heart mr hartington that most unfortunate affair will not turn out so badly after cuthbert did not echo sentiment accompanied visitor silently to door after seeing off returned to room where reseated in chair filled lighted pipe put leg on to chair proceeded to think matter out be certainly wholly unexpected change at present did not feel to be unpleasant one rather relief have for last ten day be bemoaning while heir apparent must live own life take pleasure a liked a owner of fairclose have duty to perform have tenant welfare to look after there must be bailiff to interview morning to go into sort of petty detail a to hedge ditch fence repair thing cared not jot for interesting a be to dear old father supposed must have to go on bench to sit for hour listening to petty case of theft drunkenness varied only by poaching affray at long interval there must be county gathering to attend must naturally be expected to hunt to shoot have seemed to inexpressedly dreary now be if brander fear be realized at end even if must not turn out to be a bad a that sum must be called upon to pay might be sufficient to cripple estate to afford good legitimate excuse for shutting up letting house going away to retrench until liability be cleared off of course must have to work in earnest now even thought of be not altogether unpleasant believe be going to be best thing that ever happened to said to know must never have done anything if have be for though be not fool enough to suppose be ever going to turn out anything great be sure that after couple of year hard work ought to paint decently anyhow to turn out a good thing a of men be just what have always be wanting though did not know be afraid will have to cut dear old fellow for must never be able to give up to work among must say must be best for to go over to paris can start on fresh groove there at age must not like to go through

be a dull for a for told one of stable boy to go to house say that must not be back to lunch then went for twenty mile walk over hill returned somewhat tired with unaccustomed exertion with feeling of buoyancy light heartedness such a have not experienced for long time past for next week remained at home then feeling too restless to do so longer went to town telling mr brander to let know a soon a committee have already commenced investigation into real state of bank affair made first report lawyer be much puzzled over cuthbert manner seemed to utterly impossible that anyone must really be indifferent to losing fine estate yet must see reason for cuthbert assuming indifference on so vital subject unless felt even discussed matter with wife can not understand that young hartington said most men must have be completely crumpled up at news gave took a quietly a if have be mere bagatelle only possible explanation of indifference can think of be that must have made low marriage in london doe not care about introducing wife to county be just sort of thing that man with irregular bohemian habit might do pretty model perhaps peasant girl have come across when out sketching never did care particularly about anything mr brander said may be be really glad to get away from country must be possible enough if have good income in addition to fairclose that will have be that five thousand came to from mother must say be likely enough to run through in couple of year at outside then where will be ca think jeremiah how ever permitted father to do mad thing a to take share know what be doing dear worry about that have be wanting for very long time to give up business go into country how must fairclose suit be not in earnest exclaimed with excitement very unusual to ca mean

be fortunate indeed that did not hold share jeremiah be not such fool said shortly a to trust money in hand of body of men who be doubt excellent fellow admirable county gentleman who knew more of business than baby who must be mere tool in hand of manager have excellent excuse considered legal adviser of bank must have pecuniary stake whatever in affair be able to act altogether without bias there be ironical smile on lip wife said admiringly how clever be jeremiah did not require much cleverness for said with complacency can reserve compliment dear until be established at fairclose ask be that wo ask question allude to matter until be settled leave entirely in hand so far thing be working in right direction perhaps will be good thing for cuthbert hartington after said after sitting for minute in silence doubt will said at rate a doe not take to heart in slightest degree need not worry over be funny said sometimes idea have occurred to that cuthbert might day take fancy to one of girl might see one of mistress at fairclose never dreamt might be mistress there ca guess even now how can think of managing trouble to guess at dear be content with plum when fall into mouth worry a to how manage to shake tree to bring fruit down three week later became known definitely that after calling up remainder of bank capital there must be deficiency of nearly million shareholder must be called upon to contribute to full extent of ability to cover loss one two letter from mr brander have already prepared cuthbert for final result of investigation have already begun to carry out plan

will come when will think that misfortune be best thing that ever happened to be not quite sure that think so already cuthbert replied be not at disposed to fancy martyr can assure mean to go over to paris enter art school there know what fellow be must never let work there be general chorus of indignation well how much do work yourselves potter about for nine month in year work for four five hour day for other three saul among prophet exclaimed idea of cuthbert hartington rebuking for laziness be rich indeed roar of laughter showed general appreciation of absurdity never mind cuthbert said loftily will see 'from morn till dewy eve ' will be idea of work be way men loaf call working have so far kept from setting to now be going to burst bond of castle of indolence when come back from paris will try to stir up to something like activity there be laugh then wilson said well be best thing can do to go abroad believe must ever make fresh start here have made fresh start wilson

with instruction at once informed receiver of bank that be prepared to hand over fairclose estate for benefit of creditor instead of waiting for call to be made that wished matter to be arranged a speedily a possible a be shortly going abroad necessary deed will in few day be prepared will doubtless be surprised to hear have arranged with receiver for purchase of estate by private treaty have long be intending to retire from business have be on lookout for estate in county hope arrangement will not be displeasing to a mr brander have reputation of being wealthy man wife wish that must retire from business purchase estate in county be public property cuthbert be not surprised at same time be not altogether pleased have never liked lawyer have particular ground for not doing so have a boy instinctive notion that be humbug wonder said to whether have all along have eye to fairclose whether really did best to dissuade father from making disastrous investment at rate doe not make difference to who be there might have be stranger manufacturing fellow must rather think of mary being at old place than man of sort must have be more likely than brander to be hard on tenant to have sold off thing have turned place inside out say that under ordinary circumstance must choose brander a landlord will know well enough that there must be nothing must do more harm in county than report that be treating squire tenant harshly well suppose have better write line saying that be glad to hear that have bought place a must naturally prefer that must be in hand than of stranger fortnight later cuthbert in looking over abchester guardian be sent to weekly a subscription be not yet run out read following paragraph understand that greatly respected townsman mr j brander have purchased house estate of fairclose have come into market owing to failure of abchester bank in late mr hartington be most unfortunately shareholder have involved hundred of family in ruin greatest sympathy be everywhere expressed for mr cuthbert hartington understand that price given by mr brander be l believe that be correct in stating that mr brander be holder of mortgage of l on estate mortgage for l cuthbert repeated impossible why must father have mortgaged place must have occasion to raise money taste be most simple be sure that never lived beyond income paid handsome allowance thank god never exceeded what in world can mean will write to brander at once wo will write to liquidator if there be such thing be certain to have looked into closely for be so much off sum available for asset by return of post cuthbert received following letter dear mr hartington in reply to question beg to confirm statement in newspaper cutting send to mr brander be holder of mortgage for l on father estate looked into matter very closely a came a surprise upon everything be in proper order mr brander bank book showed that drew out l on date of mortgage book of bank confirm book notice have be given to week previously that must require that sum in note gold be so paid over to book also show payment of interest receipt for same be found among mr hartington paper there be therefore shadow of doubt possible a to genuine nature of mortgage yours truly w h cox although satisfied that for reason other father have borrowed sum on mortgage from lawyer cuthbert be le puzzled than before a to purpose for have be raised what father must possibly have done with money therefore wrote to mr brander saying that though be matter in have no pecuniary interest must be glad if must inform of circumstance led father to borrow sum thought said that knew everything about father money affair for always spoke most openly about to never let drop word a to mortgage a to difficulty in have involved investment have thought of making be therefore entirely at loss to understand how must have required sum of money lawyer answer came in due course dear mr hartingon be in way surprised at receipt of letter indeed have be expecting inquiry from a to mortgage happened in way three year ago father said to ' want to raise l on estate brander ' be naturally greatly surprised for acting for a did be of course aware that lived well within income went on course be surprised brander a must know well most men have skeleton in cupboard somewhere have one a be getting on in life want to bury for good make difference to what be have intention of going into matter suffices that want l ' 'of course there be difficulty about sir ' said estate be unencumbered a there be entail be free to do with a like 'but want done quietly said ' want talked about have mortgaged fairclose best plan by far must be for to do have doubt can do easily enough if like ' said that must much rather have nothing to do with a have always considered mistake for lawyer to become principal in money transaction with client have always refused to do anything of sort however put matter so strongly that at last induced against better judgment to consent to advance money at earnest request handed money in note so that one even at bank must be aware that sum have passed between of course mortgage be drawn up in usual form duly executed witnessed have doubt that liquidator of bank will be happy to show father receipt for money receipt given by to for interest a say matter doe not pecuniarily affect now at same time be naturally anxious must satisfy thoroughly that transaction be in respect bona fide one cuthbert sat for time with letter before suppose dear old dad must have got into scrape other year ago said to what be be use wondering still le inquiring about be surprised never told suppose must not wind up to point have doubt intended to tell day must have done so if have be carried off so suddenly anyhow knew well enough to be sure that when heard of mortgage learned how have be done that love respect for must be sufficient to prevent trying to search into past little thought that mortgage must not affect to extent of penny well there be end of wo think more about matter secret be dead buried let rest there now be time to be off to work chapter iv year later cuthbert hartington be sitting in room somewhat better furnished than majority of student lodging on second floor of house in quartier latin occupant of room below arnold dampierre be with be man three four year cuthbert junior handsome grave eyed slightly built be native of louisiana dark complexion showed taint of mulatto blood in vein so have made up mind to stay said certainly intend to see through in first place want to break off work a know be ambitious enough to intend to get couple of picture finished in time for salon although whether will hang there be matter altogether pretend to be modest cuthbert know well enough will be hung more than that will be success must wager hundred dollar to cent on though have a yet settled on subject know that be goude favorite pupil that predicts great thing for there be not one of who doe not agree with know what goude said of last thing did 'gentlemen must be proud to be able to sign name in corner of picture be admirable ' be little thing cuthbert said carelessly nevertheless coloring slightly hope to do much better work in course of year then went back to former subject of conversation yes will see through have have good many excitement already march away of troop wild enthusiasm shout of ' berlin think there be soul in crowd who be not convinced that german be going to be crumpled up like sheet of paper be disgusting to hear bragging in studio be almost furious with when ventured to hint mildly that prussian be not fool must not have chosen time to force france into war if have not felt that be much better prepared for than napoleon be since then have be just a exciting other way stupor of astonishment disappointment rage a news of disaster came in then awful business at uprising of scum here flight of empress proclamation of republic idiotic idea seized parisian that republic be sort of fetish that mere fact of establishment must arrest march of german well now be going to have siege suppose a have never seen one will be interesting of course have shadow of faith in chattering newspaper men lawyer who have undertaken government of france say trochu be good soldier paris ought to be able to hold out for time mobile be pouring in think will fight well especially breton officer be gentleman though be sure must not draw sword for republic will fight sturdily for france must not miss for anything be not sure that sha join one of volunteer battalion have nothing to do with quarrel companion said have nothing to do with quarrel if be walking along street saw big lout pick quarrel with weaker one then proceed to smash up altogether fancy must take hand in business german deliberately forced on war knew perfectly well that when put up german prince a candidate for throne of spain must bring on war with france why be within ace of going to war with france when guizot brought about spanish marriage although be comparatively of slight importance to that spain france must be united to french thing be absolutely vital question for with germany spain united very existence must be threatened have nothing for to fight a germany knew must have to do candidature be withdrawn hartington withdrawn ay after damage be done france in flame of indignation if man meet in street pull by nose do think that if take off hat bow say that withdraws insult be going to keep hand in pocket twice already have france be humiliated have stood once when prussia made that secret treaty with bavaria baden threw scornfully in face second time over luxembourg affair doe germany think that great nation jealous of honor full of fiery element be going to stand being kicked a often a chooses to kick may say that france be wrong in going to war when be really unprepared grant be unwise when man keep on insulting say to yourself must go take lesson in boxing before fight must hit out straight even if be twice a big a yourself be what feel about dampierre feeling so fancy that when thing begin here will get too hot over to help joining in ah here come of lad there be clatter of foot on staircase moment later dozen young frenchman ran in in state of wild excitement have entered versailles party of horseman have be seen from valerian shot have be fired at have fled well must think naturally must cuthbert said handful of horseman be not likely to remain to be made target of by gun of valerian be beginning of end one of student exclaimed paris will assert france will come to assistance german will find that be one thing to fight against army of despot to stand before free people in arm hope so rene own have considerable doubt of man when begin to fight fight because be there have got to do if doe not kill enemy will be killed if doe not thrash enemy will be thrashed for time being question whether be by despot by provisional government that be ruled doe not matter to one single jot a to parisian will see sincerely hope will do that expect of in point of fact must rather have battalion of trained soldier than brigade of untrained peasant citizen however full of ardor may be ah english be always discipline discipline be quite right rene be when come to fighting in open fighting in street of town be very different thing then grant individual pluck will do wonder look at saragosa look at lucknow civilian in case fought a well a best trained soldier must do in field discipline be everything putting aside great battle where feudal lord with brave undisciplined follower met disciplined bow billmen look at jacquerie peasant be brave enough be animated by hate despair be scattered like chaff by mere handful of knight men at arm swiss have defended mountain against army of despot because have mountain to defend be accustomed to scaling rock good shot just a people of town might hold street believe that will hold paris doubt whether german will ever be able to enter wall famine will enter defend yourselves a obstinately a may time must come when food will give out a if must wait to be starved of student said scoffingly if time come when there be nothing to eat must set paris on fire hurl man upon german fight way through do think that must block road round paris know nothing about military affair leroux therefore suppose anything one way other believe parisian will make gallant defence have heartiest good wish sympathy when men join rank intention be to go with a to end belief be that will be decided not by paris by france bravo bravo cuthbert others exclaimed that show indeed that love france rene said thought must shoulder musket with said englishman only fought for duty interest did not see why must mix up in then be altogether wrong if said englishman fight for what call glory must be right can take word for that in spite of what peace at price people may say there be people in world who be more ready to fight when think be right than englishman find hard enough to get recruit in time of peace in time of war can get number want regiment chosen to go to front be delighted who have to stay behind be furious glory have nothing to do with be just love of fighting say that be thinking of joining one of volunteer battalion because want to fight do so because think be in right that war have be forced upon by german who be likely to inflict horrible suffering on city never mind why be going to fight leroux said be going to fight for be enough be good comrade friend here what be going to do will join also dampierre said be republic now like own of course sympathy be wholly with vive la republique vive l'americain student shouted cuthbert hartington shrugged shoulder be just starting for stroll to wall to see how be getting on with work of demolition be of disposed to go with be disposed being in so great state of excitement that anything be better than staying indoors quietly street be full of people cart be rumbling along filled with provision others with furniture effect of house now being pulled down outside enciente from villa residence at sevres meudon other suburb village outside line of defence sometimes came upon battalion of newly arrived mobile who be loudly cheered by populace a marched along sturdy sunburnt peasant with little of bearing of soldier with earnest serious expression seemed to say must do best against foe who be cause of being torn away from home occupation staff officer galloped about at full speed soldier of garrison of vinoy corp who have come in day two before lounged about street looking in at shop small proportion of male population wore kepi showed that belonged to national guard to battalion be springing into existence why do not register name to day rene exclaimed because day two will make difference cuthbert replied be just a well to find out before do join something about men in command let above thing choose corp where have have good sense to get hold of two three army men who have have experience in war a field officer want to be under worthy citizen who have be elected solely because be popular in quarter demagogue who be chosen because be fluent speaker have made conspicuous by abuse of napoleon be not time for tomfoolery want men who will keep tight hand over make into fair soldier may not be quite agreeable at first corp show efficient be sure to be chosen when there be work to be done will be doing outpost duty whilst many of others will be kept within wall a being of practical use just at present everything be topsy turvy may be sure that trochu vinoy other general will gradually get thing into shape will not be long before find what corp be to be depended on what be not crossing river made way out beyond wall even light hearted student be sobered by sight beyond thousand of men be engaged on work of demolition where ten day since stood villa surrounded by garden tree there be now mere waste of brick mortar stretching down to fort of issy vanves tree have be felled for most part cut up carried into paris for firewood most of wall be levelled frequent crash of masonry showed that last vestige of bright happy home must soon disappear continuous stream of cart foot passenger came along road to gate men grim bitter woman cry laden with most valued of little belonging number of cattle herd of sheep attended by guard grazed in field beyond fort by jove dampierre cuthbert said if have made up mind to join corp before scene must decide be pitiful to see poor people who have more to do with war than bird in air rendered good many of bird have be rendered homeless too fortunately for be autumn instead of spring have nest nestling to think of can fly away to wood on slope below meudon what fellow be hartington to be thinking of bird when there be ten of thousand of people made miserable fancy bird be just a capable of feeling misery a be cuthbert said quietly not perhaps over trivial matter though do bicker quarrel good deal among have great calamity die of thirst of hunger of cold remember during very hard frost year ago garden be full of dying bird though father have bushel of grain thrown to day be one of most painful sight ever saw know felt pretty nearly a much cut up at a do now hate to see dumb animal suffer there be sort of uncomplaining misery about appeal to one at rate appeal to infinitely poor fellow be suffering too will say yes have consolation promise that a soon a get into paris will join corp take vengeance on who have hurt may think perhaps with reason when trouble be over will find cottage still standing will take up life again a left have at least consolation of swearing consolation a far a know be denied to animal bird be rum fellow hartington never know when be in earnest when be not let go back rene caillard who with others have be standing silently said abruptly be too painful feel suffocated to think that humiliation must fall on paris surely civilized europe will rise cry out against desecration turned with comrade walked back towards gate cuthbert followed with arnold dampierre be just way with former said must have be desecration have encamped before berlin now because be other way almost expect miracle from heaven to interpose in favor curious people french belief in be firm unshakable happens be fault of others not of now in point of fact from hear german be conducting war in very much more humane civilized way than french must have done if have be invader yet treat misfortune a if high heaven have never witnessed such calamity why march of german have be peaceful procession in comparison with sherman march sheridan foray have sacked city path be not marked by havoc conflagration fight men maybe loot deserted house a rule unarmed citizen peasant have little to complain of be true enough other agreed reluctantly opinion be cuthbert went on that poor people who be flocking into paris be making hideous mistake if stopped in village betting be that harm must have come to whereas now have left home unguarded untenanted must not be human nature if german did not occupy while in paris will have to go through privation hardship of siege perhaps of bombardment besides there be so many more hungry mouth to feed in opinion trochu provisional government must have acted very much more wisely have issued order that stranger save whose house have be destroyed must be allowed to enter city advising inhabitant of village round to remain quietly in home to retire to place at distance fighting men might of course come in useless mouth will only hasten date when famine will force city to surrender seem very sure that will surrender sooner later hartington dampierre said irritably opinion be that france will rise come to rescue if bazaine cut way out of metz may do have heard nothing of moving longer stay more difficulty will have of getting out have fine army with if once give time to german to erect battery commanding road out of place will soon find well nigh impossible to make sortie except army france have nothing can really rely upon be very well to talk of general rising ca create army in twinkling of eye host of half disciplined peasant however numerous must have chance against enemy who have shown capable of defeating whole of trained army of france dampierre must make up mind beforehand that be going in on losing side paris may hold out long enough to secure reasonable term fancy be about will come of other did not reply have something of unreasoning faith pervaded france that republic be invincible france must finally emerge from struggle victorious will try find out to night about corp rene caillard said a others overtook distance inside gate after what have seen to day be determined to join without delay heard last night from men at veillant that good many others have put name down for corp be to be called chasseurs de ecoles said understood that be to be composed entirely of student not art of course law other school must be just thing cuthbert said if can only get good officer one like men one have to work with to be little of one own class well if officer be right can put name down suppose there be occasion for to go of course there be occasion lazy one have to be sworn in cuthbert nodded suppose sha have to give up work altogether must think not rene said suppose will have two three hour drill in morning nothing more till time for action come of course troop mobile will do work at fort wall will be only called out if prussian venture to attack if march out to attack so much better came here to work want to stick to not waste time in parade

pound have be settled on mother fortunately be not affected by smash so have two hundred year be amply sufficient for want be enough of course to live upon in way cuthbert so different from what be accustomed to suppose spend two hundred year said with smile oh woman be so different that be just what have of course spend anything like of a said be so different with who have be accustomed to spend ever so much more find in way pinched can assure lodging in quartier latin be not what must call sumptuous be comfortable enough stand in quarter of what paid for chamber in london can dine sumptuously on franc half franc cover breakfast be generally cafe au lait two egg franc suffices for supper so see that necessary of life including lodging fuel come to anything like income can spend rest in riotous living if choose girl looked at earnestly be not growing cynical hope cuthbert hope not be certainly not conscious of look cynical do said doubtfully see change in what do do with paint said really really truly have become what wanted to become very earnest person indeed day people may even take to buying picture never quite know when be in earnest cuthbert if be true be very good news do mean that be really studying be indeed work at studio of one m goude if choose to inquire will find be perhaps best master in paris be afraid prussian be going to interrupt study good deal have made angry have enlisted be to say be sworn in a member of chasseurs de ecoles most of student at goude have joined what be going to fight against german exclaimed indignantly never can mean cuthbert mean can assure said amused at indignation suppose be almost germanized regard war against french a just holy cause certainly do said though of course must not say so here be in france living in french family naturally must say nothing must hurt feeling of people round there can be doubt that french deserve misfortune have fallen upon must have invaded germany poor young german have be torn away from friend family to fight so have young frenchman to mind war be deliberately forced upon france think have better agree to differ on subject have be among german be not unnatural that must have accepted version have be living among frenchman although say that must not have be much wiser if have avoided falling into pit dug for sympathy be wholly with except in outburst of folly have resulted in establishment for time at rate of republic now have sympathy with republic still le for republic controlled by political adventurer like many frenchman be going to fight for france in way for republic at rate let agree to avoid subject altogether will never convince other however much might argue over girl be silent for two three minute then said well will agree not to quarrel over know how be that always see thing so differently cuthbert however may talk about doings without arguing over cause of course suppose there will be much fighting week two will see end of again differ said believe that there will be sharp fighting believe that paris will hold out for month looked at incredulously must have thought said after pause be last person who must take noisy shouting mob seriously think anything of mob one way other said despise utterly troop mobile be sufficient to man fort wall believe that middle class corp like one have entered will fight manfully history of paris have shown over over again that mob of paris fickle vain headed noisy braggadocio a be always have be can at least starve well held out against henry of navarre till number dropped dead in street until spaniard came at last from netherlands raised siege believe will hold out now have courage enough a have be shown over over again at barricade will be useless for fighting because will submit to discipline still a said can starve will be long time indeed before suffering will become intense enough to drive to surrender fear that have altogether underrated gravity of situation that will have very severe privation to go through before siege be over suppose can stand a well a others laughed think be altogether wrong however if must come will be very interesting very said shortly doubt if will see quite in same light when come to eating rat must not eat said decidedly well when come to nothing own will eat rat if can get have heard that country rat fellow life in rick be by mean bad eating own to having doubt a to paris rat be disgusting to think of thing said indignantly idea be altogether ridiculous know whether consider that betting be among thing woman have a much right to do a man if do be ready to wager will come to rat before paris surrender never made bet in life said will wager five franc with that there will be nothing of sort say that rat may not be eaten in poor quarter know what eat there hear eat horse flesh for anything know may eat rat will wager rat will never be openly sold a article of food before paris surrender be bet said will book at once gravely took out pocket book made entry now said a replaced book in pocket how do pas time spend hour day at bibliotheque then take walk in quarter round boulevard one can walk just a freely there a one must in germany find can not venture off into poorer quarter people stare be not pleasant certainly must not recommend to make experiment way in great thoroughfare lady walking by pass unnoticed especially if look english american be coming to understand that young woman in country be permitted amount of freedom be shocking to french mind idea have not permeated to lower stratum of society if be really desirous of investigating way of female population of poorer quarter will be happy to escort whenever like think will be altogether gratified with result of research think that must obtain much closer insight into french lower class life by studying balzac of modern writer be not always savory at least be realistic balzac be terrible said of others have read little of be detestable think can be serious in advising to read certainly must not advise to read of miss brander if be young lady of ordinary type a take up cause of woman in general be distinctly necessary that must study phase of female life how else can grapple with question be laughing at again mr hartington said somewhat indignantly can assure that be not if crusade be in favor only of girl of upper middle class be touching fringe of subject for be outnumbered by twenty to one by of other class in far greater need of higher life than others seems rather hopeless mary brander said despondently after pause one be so unable to influence exactly so be setting to move mountain when time come there may be upheaval mountain may move of own accord effort of thousand ten thousand woman a earnest a must be no more use in proportion than of colony of ant working to level mountain discourage cuthbert said pitifully do believe with heart in principle do often feel discouraged task seems to grow larger more difficult more see of own living year among german woman be rather crushing to that can quite understand said with smile average german woman differs a widely in idea say aspiration for have none from little group of theorist at girton a pole be apart think replied rallying that be in least shaken because see that difficulty be greater than have looked for simile of ant be not correct great thing can be done by individual voltaire rousseau revolutionized french thought from top to bottom why must not great woman day rise exercise a great influence over sex a two frenchman did let talk about more want to hear more about what be doing have thought of so much during past year have seemed so strange so sad be really working hard mean steadily regularly evidently think that impossible laughed can assure be true if doubt will give goude address if call upon say that have interest in can assign reason like say that be aunt of mine intend to make heir beg to inform frankly of opinion of work progress feel sure that will give account will satisfy doubt think must do that said seriously there be laughing at again broke off a looked up at of course must not do thing must very greatly like to know about do think miss brander be working hard enough steady enough to satisfy even did so for six month in england with fellow named terrier be just master wanted have not shadow of imagination be up in technical detail of painting in six month hard work really learnt to paint previous to knew nothing of painting must make colored sketch be now be on highway to becoming artist goude will only receive pupil whom considers likely to do credit on seeing two of thing have done after have be working with terrier accepted at once be splendid master out away best in paris be really great artist be peppery little man will tolerate nonsense can assure that be well satisfied with be going to set to work to do couple of picture on own account for next year salon must have waited year before trying wing if have not encouraged to venture at once a be very much opposed to pupil painting for exhibition until be sufficiently advanced to begin with success be proof that have at least hope of be glad indeed cuthbert sha be quite so sorry now a have be about losing fairclose be so much nobler to work than be to fritter away life doing nothing how tiresome be said that have taken unfortunate idea in head of joining french corp will unsettle altogether really broke in with laugh must protest against being considered so weak unstable have perfect right in thinking lazy think have right in considering reed to be shaken by passing wind can assure that be very fixed in resolve be content to be lazy before simply because there be particular reason for being otherwise admit that constitutionally may incline way when cataclysm occurred a may say foundation be shaken became necessary for to work took resolution to do so have stuck to possibly must have done so in case see when man be told by young lady be useless idler who doe cumber earth wake up little be sure did say that mary said indignantly with hot flush on cheek not in precise word spoke to effect conscience told be not far wrong in opinion have begun to meditate whether ought not to turn over new leaf when came in suddenly for fairclose that of course seemed to knock on head then came what may call smash be so manifestly interposition of providence in direction of bestirring took heroic resolution to work mary felt that be desirable to avoid continuing subject have long since come to regard interview in garden a sort of temporary aberration on part that although perhaps sincere at moment have very speedily come to laugh at own folly have recognized that idea be altogether ridiculous upon have made so little impression that have scarcely occurred to when met that passage of sort have taken place have welcomed a lad have known a child rather than a man who have under passing impulse asked to marry think said suddenly will fetch madame michaud in will be nice for to come here in evening sometimes must be better for to ask to do so than for french people have such funny idea must certainly be more pleasant agreed evening will be time have most leisure be to say when happen to be on duty a to be very vague at present say sailor will garrison fort army take outpost duty fancy when german really surround will be necessary to keep so strong force outside wall that will have to call out of in addition arrangement at present be be to drill in morning will paint in afternoon so evening will be only time when will be free what do do in evening generally must find very lonely not at have american who be in school who lodge in same house a do then there be student light hearted merry set of young fellow have little supper party go to other room to chatter smoke then occasionally drop into theatre be very much like life have in london only good deal more lively amusing with great deal le luxury very much smaller expenditure be very serious can assure very much worse tobacco girl laughed merrily what will do about smoking when be reduced to extremity prophesy point be confess troubling seriously look forward with very much greater dread to prospect of having to smoke dried leaf sweeping of tobacco warehouse than do to eating of rat have be making inquiry of sort a to state of stock of tobacco intend evening to invest five pound in laying in store mean to take up plank hide under floor to maintain most profound secrecy a to existence there be saying whether a time go on may not be declared offence of gravest character for one to have private store of necessary if have special weakness such a chocolate tea anything of sort must advise not to lose moment in laying in good stock will see in week when people begin to recognize generally what siege mean that everything eatable will double in price in month only millionaire will be able to purchase really will buy tea chocolate said get in good stock said especially of chocolate be quite serious can assure unfortunately have place for keeping sheep two bullock bread at end of couple of month must scarcely be eaten really must advise to invest in dozen of big square box of biscuit ham two may come in a welcome addition day mary laughed incredulously be much more inclined than before to look at matter seriously when on fetching madame michaud in lady in course of conversation mentioned that husband have that morning bought three sack of flour hundred tin of preserved meat be going to get box said to have flour emptied into then baker will bring round in cart so that one will guess be flour say be likely that there will be order issued that everything of sort be to be given into public store for general distribution so must be brought here quietly tell that one know be doing same thing servant have be out morning eight time have be buying egg have brought hundred time be putting in cask in salt do really think be necessary madame mary asked doubtfully most certainly do say everything will go up to such price a never be heard of before of course in month two country will come to rescue destroy prussian till then have got to live already egg be fetching four time a much a did last week be frightful to think of be not monsieur if be in place madame must not reckon too surely on relief in month think that there be doubt that a say there will be prohibition of anyone keeping provision of sort everything will be thrown into public magazine likely enough house will be searched can not hide thing too carefully why must insist on everything being put in public magazine mary asked will not go further way than if people keep own stock eat will be necessary if for nothing else to prevent rioting when pinch come people be starving in poorer quarter may be sure if have suspicion that middle upper class have food concealed in house will break in sack must only be human nature therefore in interest of order alone decree forbidding anyone to have private store must have to be passed besides must make food go much further for may be sure that everything will be doled out in

skirmish will be different men altogether a to mobile be mere peasant at present month of hard work will turn into soldier must say better soldier than linesman be afraid will never make anything out of national guard only way to do so will be to establish big camp outside wall send out there put strict army men in command with regiment of regular in camp to carry out order must be necessary doubt to shoot few hundred of before anything like discipline must be established once week whole must be sent out to attack german so a to teach to be steady under fire in way might be turned into decent

rave against prussian be bourgeois hate talk of fighting while what want be to sack plunder nothing of kind american said hotly want honesty purity public spirit see vice more rampant than be in day of empire see bourgeois shirking duty see license extravagance everywhere be pity look at home cuthbert laughed good temperedly have not yet learnt that purity honesty sense of duty be conspicuous at montmartre belleville there be just a much empty vaporing there a there be down boulevard a to courage may have chance presently of showing whether have more of than better class personally must doubt then added more seriously dear dampierre can of course guess where have learnt know that minette father be one of firebrand of quarter that since have be earning income here have never done stroke of work have taken up profession of politician be not doubting sincerity may be for aught know perfectly in earnest be capacity doubt uneducated men be able to see one side of question be own be not at blind to danger believe be possible that be going to have red revolution men at belleville montmartre be capable of repeating worst most terrible feature of most awful time know what came of how ended even now of blackguard print be clamoring for one man to take supreme control of everything so far there be sign of coming man doubtless in time bonaparte may come to front crush down disorder with iron heel will not be until need for saviour of society be evident to hope dear fellow will not be carried away with visionary idea can of course understand predilection for republic between republic commune for organ of mob be already clamoring there be shadow of resemblance be founded be true on will of majority in state be majority of educated distinctly law abiding people here be majority of men who must set law at defiance who desire power simply for purpose of spoliation dampierre must have replied angrily at moment door opened two three of other student entered have heard about affair at clamart demanded eagerly say line behaved shamefully that trochu declares will be decimated may be quite sure that if said so will not carry out cuthbert said army have to be kept in good humor at rate until discipline be fully restored must be too dangerous task to venture on punishing cowardice be unfortunate certainly thing will get better in time can hardly expect to make fugitive of beaten army into hero at once have not least doubt that if german made attack in full force must meet with very slight resistance wo do will go to work in regular steady way will erect battery commanding road out of town will then sit down starve out hastening process perhaps by bombardment will take time there will be frequent fighting at outpost if trochu rest of make most of material have at hand

careless vaurien rene better perhaps for will take much greater pain when come to fighting dozen reckless daredevil be worth hundred of think if have be trochu must have issued order unmarried man in paris between age of sixteen forty five must be organized into might call active national guard for continual service outside wall while married men must be reserved for defending enceinte at last extremity outside force might be third of whole must be worth a much a whole force together be why think that corp may distinguish have none of wife family nothing much to lose consequently will fight well sha mind hardship for have not be accustomed to luxury be fighting a volunteer not because law call under arm be educated have got too much self respect to bolt like rabbit say may not retire one ca do impossibility if others stand ca oppose prussian army corp there be one thing must do be preserve good discipline there be discipline at in national guard saw party of yesterday drilling two three of quietly marched out of rank remonstrated on term of most perfect equality with colonel a to order have given maxim of republic may do for civil life though have not shadow of belief in equality fraternity have in liberty when liberty mean license whether be so not equality be not consistent with military discipline army in idea of equality reign be not army mob be more use for fighting purpose than so many armed peasant shibboleth be always absurd in case like present ruinous first duty of soldier be obedience absolute implicit complete surrender of right of private judgment must obey officer if be sure that be wrong cuthbert certainly must might if mistake did not cost life argue matter out with afterwards if a might happen among be personal acquaintance must at same time carry out order might be to best of power now propose that for evening avoid subject of siege altogether in future engaged a be likely to be will hardly be able to avoid moreover bareness of table emptiness of wine cup will be forcible reminder that will be impossible to escape did show goude sketch for picture for salon rene did after have gone have not got over interview yet remark on design conception drawing be equally clear decisive more than hinted be hopeless idiot that time have given be altogether wasted that have mistaken avocation that if german knocked on head must be loss either to to society in general be true that after have finished cooled down bit made number of suggestion from gathered that if whole thing be altered idea of background altogether changed figure differently posed effect of light shade diametrically reversed few other trifling alteration made thing might possibly be hung on top line ma foi feel altogether crushed for have really flattered that sketch be not altogether without merit when laugh have subsided cuthbert said courage rene goude bark be always worse than bite have doubt will take much more favorable view of a get on be very well for to say so rene said ruefully be spoiled child goude have never word of reproof for probably because know very well that will not break heart over must hold committee of inspection on work to morrow none of have seen design yet may be able between to make useful suggestion rene exclaimed heaven protect from do come cuthbert none of mind what say about picture criticism hurt one must no more think of being angry with for using knife than with surgeon for performing operation very well rene will come round early have doubt sketch be very good one on whole after few little change will satisfy even goude by way have heard be to elect company officer to morrow will stand be sure must have vote be twenty five to start with a know most of fellow in company certainly must secure who have not candidate want to run besides there be of course to be three officer so must be able to traffic vote officering for cuthbert laughed in first place have greater qualification for post than anyone else in second place be english though might be elected thanks to vote must never be liked trusted besides have not shadow of ambition way be going to fight if necessary will have note book in pocket have doubt that when be lying waiting for turn to come will have lot of opportunity for jotting down little bit will work into great battle picture be to have place of honor day in salon think will certainly be pleasant to have one of own number among officer propose that of put down on slip of paper name of man think will make best leader throw into hat then get most vote will

not win great prize work will be esteemed in end will score a heavily a of who posse real genius yes henri be felt now thought over one must rely upon must not lose head must be calm in danger a be calm at other time certainly must show lack of courage accordingly when paper be opened be found to have received considerable majority of vote thank for choosing comrade said quietly can only say that if elected will do best man ca say more than why must have fixed upon can not think be business think can promise at rate wo run away when franc tireurs de ecoles assembled next morning hour be

past six week paris have done nothing talk come back with of number short have got something in be too good for food for prussian powder cuthbert went that evening to michauds in uniform not for purpose of showing off because men in plain clothes especially if of fair complexion be constantly stopped accused of being german spy be often ill treated not unfrequently have to pas night in cell before must prove identity mary gave exclamation of surprise at seeing so attired made remark until after chatting for hour with michauds husband presently made excuse that have to attend meeting went off while madame took up knitting settled in easy chair prepared for quiet doze then mary said in english have patience with cuthbert taking part with foolish people more see of more get tired of

sake although a seemed then there be occasion for to work if have be on other side must not have minded just so smiled have become germanized have not friend here have enlisted be going with partly because be friend partly because be evident german might have well stopped war before now demand term that france can never submit to a long a there be faintest hope of success need not be at anxious about be not going to attack prussian position can assure be only going out to do little outpost duty to learn to hear bullet flying without ducking to fire rifle without shutting eye suppose there be five men in three company who have ever fired rifle in life see franc tireurs be to great extent independent of military authority if can call men military authority who exercise next to authority

confidence in ourselves in rifle just at present parisian be disposed to look upon german a bogy will wear off a discipline be recovered by line mobile grow into soldier will see that thing will be very different although indulge in vain fancy that be going to defeat german army do think that will bear ourselves like men show something of old french spirit will be change indeed girl said scornfully yes will be change answered quietly by mean impossible one must not take vaporing bombast of paris bourgeois ranting of blanqui belleville rough a voice of france german thought that be going to take paris in three day doubt if will take in three month if have provision must say must not take in treble that time certainly must not do without making regular approach before can do that

by way said without pursuing subject farther hear that there be movement on foot for forming corp of woman if must do so will afford illustration of equality of sex to ours in matter will go so far a to admit must much rather lead company of market woman than one composed of parisian shopkeeper mr hartington said appealingly feel equal to fighting now then wo fight good bye if be not lucky enough to light upon empty cottage to sleep in fancy gloss will be taken out of uniform before see again picked up cap shook hand be gone madame michaud woke up a door closed have gone tall countryman yes be going out to morrow to outpost think be very silly of very wrong mixing up in quarrel doe not concern especially when there be ten of thousand here in paris who instead of fighting for country be content to sit day in cafe talk will fight when time come madame michaud said complacently will fight like hero prussian will learn what frenchman be capable of doing mary have patience just at present to listen to sort of thing with excuse that head ached went at once to room understand english madame michaud thought a drew lamp nearer resumed knitting here be young woman young man who be more like comrade than lover be angry more angry than thought must be for be generally good tempered when asked first time came if be affiances 'we be old friend madame ' said 'and nothing friend can not girl have man a friend without there being thought of love in england people be friend can talk laugh to other without silly idea of sort occurring to be one of thing keep woman back in scale supposition that be always thinking of love ' did not believe then have listened to night when thought be asleep even peeped out two three time between eyelid must not understand word of what said one can tell thing by tone without understanding word there be love making scolded laughed sat carelessly in chair did not move inch nearer to be a straight a upright a always be be not way lover act when one be going out to fight peeped out when shook hand with did not hold hand moment just shook be strange people english must be wrong for french girl thus to talk to young man suppose be different with who can understand strange islander why if lucien be going out to fight must dissolve in tear must embrace hang on neck might even have hysteric though have never have in life be good girl too though have such strange idea about woman what can want for manage house lucien go to office if say thing be to be done in house be done call that equality can not tell what be aiming at at time seems to that be even more mad than compatriot yet on other subject talk with good sense what father mother can be about to let be living abroad by be more than can think must be even more mad than be work at m goude school went on steadily during interval between turn of franc tireurs de ecoles going out beyond wall indeed m goude acknowledged that work be better than usual certainly studio be never merrier more full of life so far from active exercise rough work entailed by constant vigilance necessary during long night watch diminishing interest of young fellow in work in studio seemed to invigorate painted a if inflamed with determination to make up for lost time converted in fact for time from group of careless merry young fellow into men with sense of responsibility time when away from studio have previously be spent in folly frivolity often drank much more than be good for smoked inordinately be up night came in morning to work with heavy head nerveless hand now be soldier men who matched against invader of country who risked life in defence bore more erectly tone of earnestness replaced languid indifference carelessness a to work in spite of privation in way of food figure seemed to expand loss of two night sleep week rendered early hour necessary ensured sound sleep during remaining five discipline of studio have be relaxed master felt that at time must not expect same silent concentration on work that demanded at other time found to surprise that while laughed joked a painted worked none worse for that in fact there be general improvement manifest cuthbert heartily enjoyed change prevailing tone be more like to be accustomed at studio of st john wood than be somewhat strict discipline have before prevailed in studio enjoyed hard work excitement outside wall fact that be running same risk sharing in same work be added bond of union among student although when met a very frequently did in other lodging there be le uproarious fun than before there be healthier atmosphere more pleasant earnest talk arnold dampierre be only exception to general rule when in field evinced want of spirit upon contrary be always ready to volunteer when few men be required to crawl forward at night to ascertain precise position of prussian outpost to endeavor to find out meaning of stir movement might be heard towards front at other time fit of moodiness seemed to increase be seldom present at of gathering of companion went off after work at studio be over be generally late at night before returned to room cuthbert felt that american avoided opportunity of conversation with alone replied cordially enough to greeting when met no longer dropped in to smoke pipe in other apartment a formerly have done cuthbert have great difficulty in guessing at reason for change in relation when first noticed that arnold be taking first place with minette have spoken to half jestingly half seriously on subject have never made secret of own distrust of model in early day of intercourse have spoken freely to arnold on subject must understand that if american a appeared have become really attached to must shrink from risk of expostulation on course have adopted cuthbert believed that comrade be at present in state of indecision that although deeply in love have not a yet be able to bring to idea of taking minette back a wife to home in louisiana must be sheer madness said to yet have doubt will end in doing so a must know be piece of stupendous folly can understand reluctance to risk speaking to on subject be awfully sorry for know be one of case in now that have gone a far a have must be worse than useless to try to interfere must only make more bent upon going through with see that one can do anything trust to chapter of accident minette dazzled a might be by prospect of marrying gentleman man of property might still hesitate to do so if must entail having to leave paris live abroad have doubt that be very fond of dampierre may change mind may be killed before business be over may decide to return to america directly siege end with idea of coming over to fetch afterwards may get over infatuation on return may find that one else have supplanted in affection must not fancy that constancy must be one of strong point at rate see that can do good by meddling in matter though if dampierre spoke to about must certainly express opinion frankly be much best that thing must go on between a be now doing be hot headed beggar probability be strong in favor of having serious quarrel if subject be ever broached between one evening cuthbert have taken up book after return from studio sat reading until be long past usual dinner hour before went out passed through several badly lighted street on way to restaurant in palais royal where intended to dine there be few people about for evening be wet be vaguely conscious that one be going in same direction a for heard footstep following short distance behind in one of worst lighted most silent street step suddenly quickened cuthbert turned sharply round be just in time for man who have be following be on point of springing upon with uplifted arm cuthbert felt rather than saw that there be knife in hand struck straight from shoulder at face fellow be in act of striking when received blow fell a if shot knife flying from hand clattering on pavement several yard away cuthbert stood for moment prepared to strike again if man rose a made movement turned on heel walked on must serve right if be to give scoundrel in charge for attempted murder said must give end of bother must not be worth trouble have be pretty well punished have cut knuckle imagine that when come to be will find of teeth wonder what object be robbery suppose yet be hardly likely that fellow must have singled out decided to kill on off chance of finding something worth taking must not have seen have watch on for greatcoat be buttoned be more like act of private revenge have never given anyone of class reason to dislike cartainly man followed for distance for have heard step behind ever since turned off into quiet street by way exclaimed suddenly must not be at surprised if took for dampierre be about same height although be good many inch wider than be that might not be noticed in dark if fellow be watching outside door have known nothing of there being man of same height in house might very well have taken for arnold spends time up at montmartre may likely enough have given offence to of ruffian up there when be not in pleasant temper doe not mind what say possibly too fellow may be admirer of minette thing may be outcome of jealousy at rate will tell in morning about affair let take warning by if chooses accordingly next morning waited outside in street for arnold who be generally last to arrive at studio rather unpleasant thing happened yesterday evening dampierre be followed from here attacked suddenly in one of back street leading up to boulevard have heard footstep behind for little time have vague sort of idea be being followed fellow ran up suddenly have just time to turn hit out be in act of striking with knife if have be second later must probably have settled a be knocked down fancy stunned at rate did not move so walked on of course may have be mere vulgar attempt at murder robbery from fact that man followed for considerable distance must say be not so question of revenge know that anyone in paris have cause of quarrel with idea afterwards occurred to that might be that took for be about same height if be watching house might when came out mistake one for other of course have not shadow of reason for supposing that have enemy at rate thought a well to tell about so that might be on guard a will certainly be in future arnold be silent for minute must not be surprised if be right hartington be rough lot at montmartre be possible may without knowing have rubbed of wrong way suppose did not notice what be like be too dark whole affair too sudden for to see anything of feature be in blouse with low cap workman generally wear must say stood four five inch shorter than do about five foot eight so be square built fellow if happen to come across fancy may recognize not from description from handiwork see pointed to right hand be wrapped up in handkerchief hit hard have cut two of knuckle pretty badly fancy against teeth if so think likely that two three of will be missing a man of sort be hardly likely to go at once to dentist to have gap filled up may prove guide to for next day two lip be sure to be swollen pretty badly of course if have one in mind eye a being specially likely to make attempt upon life little thing will afford clue if have sort of suspicion that one of three four men might be likely to have grudge against may enable to pick out fellow who attempted life of course may be mistaken altogether fellow may have be only ordinary street ruffian personally wo make much difference to for be pretty handy with fist a know have have practice way recommend always to carry pistol when go out at night always do hartington always have one in pocket of coat well may be useful must recommend to be careful to walk in middle of street when be in doubtful neighborhood pistol be very good in way take time to get out cock while one fist be always ready for service at instant notice by time have arrived at door of studio arnold made allusion to subject for day then meeting cuthbert at door of house said by way hartington have reason to believe that be right that blow luckily escaped be meant for however think there will be recurrence of matter in fact may say that be sure there wo that be right then dampierre of course want matter followed up in way must not have spoken about have not thought that ought to give warning feel very much indebted to anyhow hartington probably have be in place matter must have gone altogether differently arnold have in fact learnt with absolute certainty who have be cuthbert assailant when went up to montmartre told minette what have happened added suspect that scoundrel took in dark for why must one bear ill will to minette asked that ca say do think that very likely be right keep to never attends meeting of kind can hardly have made enemy while be possible that may have done so minette be thoughtful for time when father joined said that be time to be off to meeting asked abruptly have seen jean diantre to day ay have seen pretty sight be how be that father took more liquor than be good for got bad fall a be going upstairs to room a luck must have mouth caught

of many banquet in house where such entertainment have become rare still there be sign that time when paris be to make attempt to burst bond be at hand among national guard complaint at long inaction be incessant there be good reason for doubt whether discontent be a general a seemed be one thing to talk of sweeping prussian before quite to take part in performance still steady drilling went on have effect if national guard did not learn discipline at least gained power to make respectable appearance to go through simple manoeuvre fairly walked more erect even assumed military swagger spoke somewhat contemptuously of line mobile whose discipline be a lax a own among whom drunkenness be rife for else failed supply of wine spirit appeared inexhaustible cuthbert went not unfrequently to dine at english restaurant of phipson where utter outspoken contempt of proprietor for french in general parisian in particular amused greatly to see fellow giving military air when take care never to get within gunshot of enemy be enough to make one blood boil mr hartington believe that couple of score of stable boy with pitchfork must lick battalion of be worse still when one go out on boulevard see sitting at cafe drinking absinthe a if there be enemy within hundred yard of place have never liked sir be downright sickened by now will sell out a soon a be over think be a bad a seem phipson if prussian ever do force way into paris think will see that fellow can fight fight desperately so will rat mr hartington if corner will run a long a get chance think will do world of good take down of

use ca wear when have got not to look easy comfortable in have score of time wondered what difference be must not tell to save life for can tell frenchman moment come in matter how be got up there ai occasion for to open mouth can spot a easy a one must tell difference between thorough bred common roadster a rule franc tireurs de ecoles went out on southern western side of paris one morning marched out to st denis there have be pretty hot skirmishing on side colonel said to officer before starting have be asked to march out in direction to take up outpost duty on portion of line there troop have be having pretty hard time of have be pushed backward once twice though have always ended by winning back ground have lost have reputation of keeping eye open general told morning might consider a compliment be sent there be marched to small cluster of house relieved two company of line who have be on duty there during night be first time specific post have be assigned to men be in high spirit at what considered honor authority treated franc tireurs a being valueless for real fighting a being useful to certain extent for harassing enemy outpost not to be counted upon for regular work so omitted altogether in order assigning position to be occupied corp therefore considered feather in cap to be assigned position by side of regular fire of troop be still burning men be soon at work cooking breakfast one company being thrown out in front of village house bore sign of strife be almost unroofed others have yawning hole in wall work of shell from prussian field gun while be pitted with scar of bullet on side facing enemy scarce pane of glass remained intact floor have be torn up for firing furniture have shared same fate breastwork have be thrown up fifty yard in front of village house have be connected by earthen wall so that if outwork be taken place must be defended until reinforcement came up hundred yard to left there be battery of six gun on mound four five hundred yard to right in daytime fire covered village there be little chance of german attempting attack until after enemy occupied in force village of size five hundred yard away have covered with strong earthwork outpost faced of french with interval of two hundred yard between sentry on duty be stationed at distance varying from ten to twenty pace apart behind wall bank of earth enemy outpost be similarly protected shot be exchanged at interval throughout day between french battery on right left redoubt german have thrown up on rise four five hundred yard behind village gunner on side occasionally directing fire upon house outpost be for most part silent a be seldom indeed that even momentary glimpse be obtained of helmet kepi order be that there be to be useless firing during day company took turn at outpost duty when night fell line be strengthened men being under rifle while rest lay down with arm by side ready to fall in at moment notice dropping fire be kept up on side be rather for purpose of showing that be on alert than with idea of harming invisible foe at ten o'clock cuthbert went out with half company to belonged to relieve comrade who have be for last three hour in front line have be little time on duty when pierre leroux who be in charge of half company said to de valles who commanded whole of outpost seems to that can hear deep sound come in pulsation think be considerable body of men marching captain listened with bent head for short time be right pierre there be certainly movement of sort going on in front fancy be distance away if be marching on village in front must hear more plainly have better send out three four men from right let go distance along before attempt to creep forward prussian sentry be too thick along there facing men might possibly crawl pretty close up to outpost farther along wo be so thick there pick four good men be dangerous service tell to get a near a can to sentry without being observed then to lie listen attentively will have better chance of hearing there than have there be getting men to lie perfectly quiet here can take three men go with de valles yes if like will stop with company until return lieutenant went along line stopping at man to ask name chose cuthbert two men one from of principal art school a thought might look like favoritism if took from among own comrade sentry became more more scattered a went along main body being posted in front of village last few men be warned that be going forward that be not to fire until returned sent last man on line to communicate with outpost furnished by corp occupying ground farther to right that men be going out to reconnoitre then companion cautiously crawled forward be rather more than half way across ground when cuthbert uttered exclamation a came in sudden contact with figure advancing with similar caution in opposite direction needed not guttural oath in german to inform that be enemy touching a be neither must use arm instinctively grappled with other a lay on ground look out leroux have got hold of german cuthbert said in low voice while at same moment antagonist said something to same effect in german lieutenant other two men leapt to foot a did so four five men sprang up close in front of fire leroux exclaimed two men discharged piece shot flashed out in front of in darkness none be hit in moment be engaged in hand to hand fight with foe in meantime cuthbert antagonist be rolling over over locked closely in other arm seizing moment when came uppermost cuthbert steadied relaxed hold of opponent half kneeling managed to free from embrace gripped by throat fight between others be short one lieutenant have run one of opponent through body german have equalized matter by bringing butt of musket down on head of one of franc tireurs being now two against four pierre called to other to retreat german followed few yard then halted a passed cuthbert gave final squeeze to antagonist throat feeling sure that must not be able to speak for time crept away for few yard lay still among cabbage covered field where be sergeant one of german said in low voice a retraced step must have be somewhere here when called after two three minute search came upon be alive one of said stooping over be gasping for breath think be dying anyhow may a well carry in lifted man a did so several shot rang out from french outpost a soon a have gone on cuthbert sat up to listen must hear now heavy tread of men who be seemed to crossing from right towards german village listened for minute two to assure that be not mistaken then crawled back towards own outpost fire said when knew that must be near to be one of who went out just now fire heard voice knew to be lieutenant repeat be hartington be afraid be done for minute later joined at moment sharp fire broke out from german line showing that party have also returned to outpost will find de valles farther along hartington if have anything to report have better go to at once can tell afterwards how escaped have quite given up suppose have better go to cuthbert said have not much to report except there be doubt noise heard be caused by heavy column of men marching into village over there cuthbert found captain made report thank hartington be pretty well convinced be so for even before firing between party german began sound be loud enough to be clearly distinguished suppose can give guess at number be strong body how strong must not tell hundred prussian marching will make a much noise a five hundred frenchman even allowing for must think there will be at least one strong battalion perhaps more if be case must be on lookout of course may fancy mean to attack on other hand may intend to push forward will go with to colonel ought to know what think about be along here few minute ago noise be not so plain then did not estimate force to be anything like a strong a be in opinion cuthbert made report to colonel latter at once went forward with de valles to outpost after giving order for men in house to fall in at once be ready to advance to support front line to man barricade house cover retreat reaching outpost sound of marching be no longer heard there be faint continuous murmur must be plainly made out in interval of fire kept up by enemy what do think be de valles colonel asked after listening time must say sir that column have broken up in village men be making way to front in open order if be to suggest colonel must say must be a well to send off men to two battery to tell that enemy be mustering in force in village opposite to that expect to be attacked also to officer commanding troop on side of four men be at once despatched ten minute later battery almost simultaneously opened fire on village a if have be signal crashing volley be fired from line held by german outpost here come colonel shouted steady men wait till see then open fire upon a quickly a can load aim steadily captain de valles will warn line to left that be when word be given to retreat at double bearing away first to left so a to clear ground for fire from house a soon a be abreast of be to enter at rear aid in defence captain rainault will take similar order away to right ah here be a spoke storm of musketry broke out all along line a dark mass must be seen approaching enemy be too strong to be resisted in few second colonel shouted order to retreat then at top of speed franc tireurs ran back instant cleared off from front of house colonel shouted to officer in command there to open fire in minute franc tireurs be in enclosure company have already have position in case of attack assigned to for short time only on side facing enemy be engaged prussian speedily overlapped position attacked on side several time rushed up close to barricade fire be so hot that be compelled to fall back again circle of fire afforded gunner in battery sufficient indication a to position of defender shell fell rapidly in front behind fight have lasted few minute when crashing volley be fired from left attack on house at once slackened a prussian turned to oppose reinforcement have come up when shortly afterwards regiment from other side also reached scene of action commander felt surprise have failed prussian retired to former position affair be over four company of line be left to strengthen position must enemy try attack before daybreak then after congratulating colonel of franc tireurs on vigilance have prevented being taken by surprise sturdy defence have made officer of line withdrew men to position have before occupied loss of franc tireurs be small volley have preceded attack have done execution whatever a have fought in shelter have lost eight men killed score wounded be sharpest affair in have a yet be engaged old colonel be highly pleased with result after outpost have resumed former position cuthbert related to comrade particular of struggle with prussian sergeant be pretty well matched said suppose be equally surprised when found other grappling in dark of course of knew how many supporter other have close at hand first thought struck be that must silence if possible before comrade came to assistance be only afraid must not be able to shake free from grip so a to get to throat fortunately relaxed hold moment felt that have loosened mine a be on top of rest be easy well got well out of anyhow hartington pierre said did not see anything of man who be knocked down by musket did no did not occur to to look for if like will go out with bring in be very good idea hartington probably be only stunned will go get leave for to do so however just a turned to go call be heard in front minute later man came in have said when recovered consciousness heard tremendous fire going on a soon a must collect thought became assured that enemy must be attacking village therefore concluded that best thing be to lie still did until fire ceased must hear prussian retreating then have crawled in until close to line of outpost be heartily glad to see back again pierre said shaking by hand must always have be subject of regret to if expedition proposed have lost life a to who fell in defence of village have personal responsibility must certainly have felt that death always lay at door chapter x month great change have come over paris spirit of empty gasconnade have be succeeded by one more befitting time circumstance a hope of assistance from without lessened spirit of resistance grew stronger firmer there be longer talk of sweeping prussian out of france no longer be article of faith that paris must be saved thought of surrender be farther than ever from men mind must resist to last must give time to france to reorganize must set such example of devotion patience under suffering that when at last famine forced to surrender world must at least say that paris have proved worthy of reputation defence have be strengthened to enormous extent outlying fort when siege began must have be carried without much difficulty by resolute attack have now be rendered practically impregnable approach have be thickly mined obstacle of sort erected round casement barrack magazine protected by covering of trunk of tree so great depth of earth a to be able to defy heaviest shell wall of enciente have be repaired greatly strengthened covered by bastion other work so that even be one of fort taken work of enemy must be begun theatre have be closed from first cafe chantants open air concert have long since followed example partly because of increasing seriousness of temper of people partly because of failure of gas cafe be no longer crowded until midnight dim light of lamp have taken place of gas gave sombre air to establishment by eight o'clock in evening most of put up shutter national guard be being reorganized from battalion three four hundred of most able bodied for most part unmarried men have by order of government be selected formed into company for service in field promised in short time to develop into troop equal in physique spirit to mobile vastly superior to line lady no longer appeared in street in rich dress be felt that be out of place now adornment have be rigidly given up woman of better class set example of dressing in simplest of costume quietest of color great number have devoted to service of hospital ambulance spent whole of time in ministering to sick wounded a yet there be little real suffering in paris privation inconvenience be borne uncomplainingly even cheerfully beef have become almost unobtainable be agreed that horse flesh be not bad substitute cat dog be fast disappearing from street flesh prepared in variety of way took place on card of restaurant of hare game change be hardly noticed cuthbert be working hard school be now definitely closed who liked to do so be free to work there when chose m goude have taken advantage of cessation of lesson to paint on own account be engaged upon large canvas announced be intended for salon said have wiped away old quarrel if be fit for must do a so many of artist of paris have done take place in rank be past age for marching sleeping in ditch can entertain further anger against men who be fighting for france be duty of who can not fight to paint when salon open must show world that in spite of barbarian france still hold head high be at head of civilization cuthbert however be not among number of who used painting room have chosen lodging so a to have north light kept door closed from early morning until light faded ardor for work have seized be with reluctance that put aside brush when day work be over be engaged upon two picture worked upon alternately a mood seized when have done for day canvas be always covered up easel placed behind screen in corner of room door opened to friend once week for two day when corp marched out to take turn at outpost work work be laid by between regular troop on side there be occasional exchange of shot except when one other side attempted to advance position be seldom for post of advantage village be now so strongly fortified a to defy capture except by large force german have recognized already that paris be not to be taken by force at cost except of tremendous expenditure of life therefore be content to close avenue of escape to leave to famine to do work for french on side felt that minor operation to enlarge boundary somewhat be vain effort reserved for great attempt to break through line franc tireurs however be ever active kept up increasing fusilade upon prussian outpost night day keeping in state of perpetual irritation watchfulness except when on service cuthbert saw little of arnold dampierre latter have entirely given up painting be seldom at lodging when at home did join in smoking party at one other of student room other luxury have given out tobacco be still fairly cheap solace made up for many privation be arnold absence regretted have never be popular on few occasion when appeared among be so moody taciturn that absence be felt a relief when on duty with corp however be always in good spirit seemed to delight in action be ever ready to volunteer for dangerous work such a crawling up close to german outpost to ascertain precise position have so many narrow escape that comrade declared that held charmed life against prussian bullet american must be pleasant fellow if be always under arm pierre leroux said one evening be not same man directly get outside wall be cheerful good tempered full of ardor here be bear will get into trouble if doe not mind be afternoon opposite hotel de ville there be many of unwashed denouncing government way to who must listen to dampierre be standing in one of group where man whom knew to be minette father for came to studio one day to say that be unwell must not come be addressing be pouring out threat against bourgeois against government against one in fact said that at present true patriot working men of paris be disarmed even have arm must not imperil defence of paris by civil war that a soon a accursed german have turned back day must come true principle of republic principle of ' must then be triumphant france must be free of incubus of selfish capitalist who ground down people must see that dampierre thoroughly sympathized with fellow believe that if there be trouble be capable of putting on red cap marching with scum of belleville be not minette father minette who have converted saw marching at head of one of belleville battalion other day dressed a cantiniere carrying with air of young amazon that girl be capable of anything cuthbert said have always said that be small sleeping volcano if there be barricade can fancy standing on top of one of waving red flag however thickly bullet might be whistling around went a far a must in way of warning dampierre in early day soon saw that if be to continue on term of amity must drop be infatuation most unfortunate one must run course dampierre be gentleman although at present may be carried away by enthusiasm of people fancy that if must happen god forbid to get upper hand must soon be shocked when proceeded to carry theory into execution a to minette if be ever mad enough to marry best thing must be to do so a soon a paris be open to take straight away to new orleans be born actress be a clever a be pretty have doubt must have good sense to play part of grande dame admirably must soon become leader of french society there must be sorry to predict how long must last what must come after believe in heart that best thing must happen for must be to be knocked over by prussian bullet after thing may never come off girl like minette must have lover in own class have doubt be fond of dampierre at present one can say how long will last can imagine that be proud of conquest be good looking gentleman rich doubt be envied in quarter besides must be gratification to to have induced fascinated into casting in lot with red will pall in time if be in place must never feel sure of until have placed ring on finger be time when must begin not to feel sure of rene laughed anxiety must begin then be a changeable a april sky must love passionately for time for how long must be sorry to guess see in studio be delighted with fresh dress fresh pose never be there so good model for few day then get tired of want something fresh be like child with new doll for bit will be wild over can not sleep without take with everywhere adores will soon be thrown by perhaps will be battering head with stick when minette first came to studio be mad about now must a soon have tiger cat for mistress be too severe rene young man who have joined studio three month before expostulated seemed to charming young woman can not understand what cuthbert be talking of in way for rene laughed ah have got over first stage yet many of others will agree with like know be glad to have with be like glass of champagne can not say anything against in quality be only when one come to talk about a wife that one be frightened believe be on account of standing last month a judith about to kill holofernes perhaps be right clement admit be revelation to used to laugh at cuthbert who declared frightened felt then be right good heaven what judith be be enough to make one shiver to see look of hate of triumph of vengeance in face one knew that one blow must do that head must be severed by heavy knife held a surely a maitre d'armes must cut dead sheep in two be only piece of acting rene might a well say that tragedienne must be capable of carrying out tragedy in own family perhaps so clement then see must never occur to to marry tragedienne must imagine that must ask for salt in same tone that must demand poison grant be acting there be terrific truth about showed that be at least able to picture position feel tried to sketch gave up a hopeless be beyond altogether observed that others failed too except cuthbert here dashed off in note book if ever paint must not have hung up in bedroom for thousand franc for must never dare to go to sleep with looking at indeed of late minette have changed good deal little fool be carried away by talk up at belleville take quite seriously remember have refused last three invitation said quite superbly when asked last time 'this be time for feasting enjoyment m rene when paris be besieged thousand be starving ' then know where be pierre said belleville be never so well off a be to day man get franc half day for wearing kepi going for few

charity time must come when there must be plenty for will have trouble with before have done expect what do think lieutenant took pipe out of mouth nodded there will be trouble said have be up to belleville several time spell of idleness be doing much harm a soon a have done with prussian will have red on hand be seven to one against rene said contemptuously voting other day showed that ah seventh know what want want to be master want money enough to keep without work want to set street flowing with blood other six only want to be left alone have idea of risking life will see when begin will hold butt of musket up will say let irritate demon man will hope that even if others be robbed will somehow escape can not rely on national guard be use to count in mobile only want to be off to village if troop have leader might fight who be to lead trochu be imbecile real fighting army be in prison of germany when be released will not care to embark in war think thing look bad what must do pierre asked must paint henri said be to say must paint if thing go a think will national guard refuse to fight if men who have something to lose wo lift arm to defend why must who have nothing at stake might paint who be going to buy picture henri cuthbert said quietly a soon a red get upper hand will have guillotine at work first head to fall will be of best customer suppose ruffian of belleville be going to become patron of art for part must rather fight against savage than level rifle against honest german lad who be led here against must think more of shooting one of rough than of killing tiger indeed regard tiger a more honest beast of two still if frenchman like to be ruled over by king mob be business of mine thank god thing be never likely to happen in england at rate in time in first place can trust troop in second must trust be there not soldier in land thing will never happen workman have sense enough to know that mob rule must be ruin to a well a to rich be needed in twenty four hour million men must be sworn in a constable must sweep rabble into thames rabble must be unarmed ours have at present got musket more fool who gave to what can one expect from such government there be not among single practical man except gambetta be away at tour be government of lawyer spouter of word give plenty of government nothing must rather infinitely rather that woman at halle must chose dozen of most capable woman among establish a government will guarantee must see change for better before twenty four hour be over doubt if must see change for worse jules fauvre with ridiculous phrase not one foot of territory not one stone of fortress be better than mountebank others be a bad must that ducrot vinoy have firmness talent of napoleon must march troop in sweep away gathering of imbecile establish martial law disarm belleville montmartre shoot floureus pyat blanqui hundred of most noxious of vermin forbid assemblage turn national guard into soldier after rendering paris impotent for mischief turn attention to german one thing can save paris to mind be military dictator see sign of such man being forthcoming bravo bravo several of student shouted what pity be that be englishman cuthbert must be just man for otherwise at rate must do something not let everything drift cuthbert retorted joining in laugh at own unaccustomed vehemence there have broken agreement now let revert to art effort be vain talk soon drifted back again to siege many be conjecture a to what trochu famous plan must be point offered most hopeful chance for army to pierce german cordon mary brander have fortnight before enrolling among nurse at american ambulance be doing admirable work be admitted by french to be model must be followed with great advantage in own hospital here everything be neat clean well arranged wounded be lodged in tent be well ventilated yet warm surgeon of nurse be also under canvas while others among whom be mary brander went back to home when turn of duty be over have like lady who worked in french hospital adopted sort of uniform wore white badge with red cross on arm with must go unquestioned free from impertinent remark through thickest crowd everyone making way for with respectful civility be terrible said to cuthbert upon calling one evening when be off duty yet feel so trying a listening to silly talk seeing folly of people in street poor fellow bear suffering so patiently be so grateful for little thing done for that one can not feel how much there be likable among french in spite of folly talk to good deal be almost always about home family especially mother sometimes be sweetheart sister with mobile linesman be just same sometimes write letter for such simple touching letter a be be difficult not to cry a dictate what be in many case last farewell always want at home to know that have died doing duty beyond that say much of be of to whom be writing that think tell to cheer up bid younger brother take place besides letter will be photographed sent off by pigeon post have pile of little packet to be despatched when paris be open lock of hair photograph bible keepsake of kind think at rate mary have at present discovered one branch at least of woman mission upon can not quarrel grant not only equality superiority to a nurse mary brander smiled faintly ignored opening for argument of be dreadfully wounded went on thought reverting to hospital be terrible to think that when great battle everyone seems looking forward to take place there may be thousand of wounded to be cared for when do think will be soon of course one can say when see anything to gain from waiting longer mobile be a good a be likely to be made one ca call line disciplined according to english idea of discipline be better than be at rate be anxious for something to be done do think will get through shook head if must fall suddenly upon german might do so be easy matter to move large body of men quickly to be successful ought to be able to hurl against german before have time to concentrate have doubt whichever side issue out on will get on fairly enough a long a have assistance of gun of fort beyond think will get german must by time know country vastly better than do be immensely better trained in making extensive movement have excellent general good officer fancy will be same thing that have be before will make advance will push enemy back for bit will occupy position next day german will retake have method commissariat even now body of troop be outside wall frequently four twenty hour without food in confusion consequent on battle matter will be ten time worse in morning troop will be half starved half frozen there will be very little fight left in what must do if be commander in chief cuthbert be altogether unfit to make plan still more unfit to carry out said idea must certainly be to attack somewhere with half force to force enemy back to hold position at end of day so that german must concentrate to attack in morning at night must withdraw greater portion of march straight across paris other half of army must attack there at daybreak must be reinforced soon after fighting began by who have fought day before think in way ought to be able to cut way out what must do when once get out be more than can tell have cavalry to speak of while german have splendid cavalry force who must harass continually infantry must pursue must march infinitely better than must do must scatter to get food whole regiment must break up become mass of fugitive finally must be surrounded either cut to piece forced to surrender of two thing be not sure that must not be best for to be handsomely thrashed on first day of sortie take very gloomy view of thing said almost angrily why must have thought must be pleased be prophesying success for friend german know why must always insist that be friend be of opinion that be right at first be so still think now be behaving hardly cruelly at least think bismarck be be heartless for to insist a condition of armistice that paris must not be re victualled while lasted of course must not agree to though must have agreed to anything like fair condition everyone really wanted peace if german have insisted on term peace must have be made so thing have changed altogether be clear that not german leader want to injure humiliate france to utmost be not content with pound of flesh want to destroy france altogether despised people at first despise now at least be wonderfully patient though know what will have to suffer when everything be eaten up one have said word in favor of surrender since bismarck showed how determined be to humiliate think will win bet after mary be not so sure a be that wo did think must ever have eaten horse flesh be really not so bad monsieur michaud told yesterday that dined out with friend have have cat rat of course be disguised with sauce people made secret of what be said be really very nice think must try feel a certain a did anyhow have begun to touch store there be talk of confiscating everything yet chapter xi two men be sitting in cabaret near halle one be dressed in uniform of sergeant of national guard be powerfully built man with black beard mustache rough crop of hair stuck out aggressively beneath kepi other be fifteen year younger beyond cap wore military uniform have mustache only be good looking young fellow of ouvrier class tell be too bad pere dufaure year ago pretended liked fact that wore good dress be earning lot of money did not seem to make difference in now be changed that foreigner have turned head think now be going to be lady have thrown over a if be dirt wo have struck fist upon table cursed aristocrat be not to have everything own way patience jean woman will be woman right way to win back be to have patience wait say that just at present head be not turned with american who by way be good republican though have money have good notion hold with that have too long be ground down by bourgeois still may tire of after while be not amusing american though minette may like being adored like being amused also pooh pooh matter will come right besides although like american at present think more of commune than of have patience quarrel with know be on side minette be good deal like what mother be ah woman man can hing with when make up mind to have own way

such luxury in second because most of horse have be turned to other us did not seem to pay very much attention to what be saying broke in with question do think there will be much fighting must be folly to try to persuade that there wo said when there be so many thousand men with gun cannon who be determined to get out of place equal number of men with gun cannon just a determined to keep in chance be that a irish say there will be wig on green suppose loss will be great in comparison to number engaged because certainly good many of french will reconsider determination to get out will be seized with burning desire to get back a soon a german shell begin to fall among still do hope that will make decent fight of know there be tremendously strong battery on ground enclosed by loop of marne be where say be going to be fort will be able to help so that certainly for time will fight with great advantage do wish that be not so cold fighting be bad enough in summer possibility of lying

certainly like to have talk with have never be able to get quite out of mind that there have be something mysterious about whole affair a far a father be concerned though where mystery come in be more than can imagine expect be simply because have never liked brander have always have strong idea that popular townsman be at bottom knave a well a humbug mary brander went about work very quietly day more than one of wounded patient remarked change in manner mademoiselle be suffering to day one of said to a missed ring of hopefulness cheeriness with generally spoke to be not feeling well have bad

grandchild that got scar on day when drove prussian from front of paris must have be something to say courage mademoiselle after there be twenty who get through thing safely to one be hit friend will be covered with glory hope that will be a think said may be other way that sortie will fail must not think that said have not have fair chance before now have got one even must not win first time will second third be frenchman always to be beaten by prussian have beaten of late because have be badly led there must come jena to one of day mary nodded then passed on to next patient in evening news came that thing be not in readiness that sortie be deferred at least for twenty four hour be not well miss brander chief surgeon of hospital said to soon afterwards have noticed day that have be looking fagged worn out a be certain now that will have unusual pressure upon resource for thirty six hour at rate think have better go home have bad headache said yes can see hand be a cold a ice go home child have long night rest sort of work be very trying until one get hardened to fortunately have lack of assistance if feel better to morrow morning take twenty four hour off duty be likely to want strength nerve on monday if affair come off in earnest own be inclined to doubt for so far there have be shadow of earnestness about anything since siege began chapter xii franc tireurs de ecoles have marched out beyond wall when order came that affair be postponed that must not be required till following day when be to parade at daybreak there be much indignation at change sort of cause be suggested for one rumor be to effect that pontoon bridge for crossing river be of insufficient length others said that train of provision be to accompany force after have cut way through prussian be not ready one rumor be to effect that prussian have be apprised by spy of trochu intention have massed heavy body of men at threatened point most generally received opinion be that trochu object have be only to make demonstration on side of paris with object of deceiving prussian inducing to weaken line at other point that real attack must be made in direction altogether be nuisance way be cuthbert said a after corp be dismissed walked back with group of friend be mistake too have got up to boiling heat have made up mind to go through with delay be like dash of cold water of course be same with rest of force one hate being humbugged make one doubt whether general know business well there be one thing delay wo be long one be eight o'clock now a must be up by six will turn in at once get good sleep be sure forget flask in morning weather get colder colder next morning however men be again dismissed after parade told be to fall in again at daybreak next day there be feeling of restlessness disquiet throughout paris town be placarded with proclamation of trochu ducrot latter be sort of valedictory letter to paris saying that be going out to conquer to die that if defeated must never return to paris alive be evident by tone at time proclamation be penned be intended that battle must take place on day that delay be consequent upon breakdown in arrangement be not result of fixed plan paris for once be serious special service be held in church be thronged by citizen soldier cuthbert went to building where few of english resident attended service throughout siege mary brander be not present a have said day before must be on duty for twenty four hour have not expected to see in afternoon went to restaurant dined fairly well indulging in luxury obtainable then returned spent evening with rene pierre next morning when dressed for parade took precaution of putting on a many article of underclothing a must button tunic over time there be mistake in order a not few of who fell in have hoped in heart might be case a soon a corp be formed up arm ammunition pouch examined word be given marched away towards gate of charenton issued out many body of troop be converging upon other gate on side of city with train of ammunition supply wagon there be delay of hour before must pas out greater part of force have left city on two previous day hundred thousand men under ducrot be massed in bois de vincennes between point neck of loop formed by marne franc tireurs be halted near charenton learning that attack must not take place till night colonel took possession of empty barn near village men piled arm outside made a comfortable a must now that there be longer doubt that engagement must take place in few hour natural light heartedness of student revived have brought with good store of provision in haversack man carried thick blanket besides military cloak many of have in addition to flask slipped bottle of wine into haversack meal be joyously partaken of after pipe be lighted with blanket wrapt round leg be inclined to agree that campaigning even in winter have pleasure be deal better off than most of troop cuthbert said to arnold dampierre must be bitter in snow out in wood will be worse when get dark be better for than be for fellow in south dampierre said have warm clothes plenty to eat be in rag often well nigh starving yes must have be very rough business be great advantage that be franc tireurs therefore free to great extent to follow own device heard colonel say that when have applied for order be told that none must be given to detached corp like now a at other time must make useful when saw opportunity line be to cross first then mobile then active battalion of national guard if judge colonel rightly will manage to put somewhere in front stand well after affair at bourget so have doubt will get across one of bridge a soon a line be over soon after four o'clock began to get dusk colonel who have be away endeavoring to find out what be general plan of operation returned soon after officer gathered round pontoon bridge will be thrown across river on side of loop pontonners will set to work on when be dark fancy real attack will be through champigny that on other side will be more of nature of false alarm so will go with main force there be strong battery erected in loop will prepare way for big train of field gun troop will begin to cross at early daylight so ca do better than remain where be until five o'clock then will go take place near one of bridge slip across a soon a see opportunity with mass of troop to move there be sure to be delay in bringing regiment up first occurs will slip in get over men may a well lie down at once get good night needed somewhat close packing for men to rest crowding be more than counter balanced by warmth be not long before be asleep at one o'clock in morning be awakened by tremendous cannonade fort round paris have suddenly opened fire upon german position believing that enemy must have obtained knowledge of approaching sortie be anticipating by assaulting fort colonel ordered men to stand to arm in hour firing ceased be quiet again men with little grumbling at being taken out chilled in night air returned to barn at four o'clock be again aroused by fire being resumed may a well be off lad colonel said have distance to march be not worth while to turn in again between report of gun dull rumbling sound must be heard artillery train be on move cuthbert said to rene who be next to in rank so will not be too soon if be to take share in early part of fighting left main road followed field a many of be well acquainted with country have difficulty in keeping in right direction men marched at ease picking way a best must across ground be broken up into small enclosure garden halted outside village on bank of marne where one of pontoon bridge have be thrown across here piled arm endeavored to keep warm by stamping foot swinging arm soon after morning dawned heavy firing broke out suddenly behind colonel have learnt at charenton that general vinoy with men be to advance from between southern fort to attack ville juif height of mesly so a to induce concentration of enemy in direction so to diminish difficulty of main advance for time there be sound of cannon only then came crackle of musketry telling that advance have begun battery on commanding position of st maur opened in earnest be aided by several battery of field artillery din being now incessant gradually rattle of musketry became fainter showing that french be driving enemy back mounted officer riding past told that montmesly be taken news raised spirit of soldier to highest point impatience be becoming almost uncontrollable when order arrived for to advance troop at once began to cross six pontoon bridge have be thrown at different point across marne there be hurry me brave colonel said a franc tireurs stamped with impatience a saw column crossing river while remained in enforced inactivity at first troop will carry before a vinoy men have done fighting will only commence in earnest when prussian bring up support will be in time for never fear ought to have begun at daybreak growled in low voice to major four precious hour have be wasted by time ought to have gained at least three four mile of ground in case might have be through prussian line before sunset hour in short day be of importance presently roll of musketry showed that french skirmisher be engaged with german outpost franc tireurs have by time moved down close to bridge be not until midday that be able to cross then colonel taking advantage of short delay on part of one of regiment to come up to bridge pushed men across leaving road took forward at double by time roar of battle be unbroken battery along height behind fort field gun in advance be hard at work shell flying over head of advancing troop bursting in village held by german in front rattle of musketry be deafening champigny learned from wounded soldier who be making way to rear have be carried troop there have pushed distance forward on left villiers la desert be found to be too strongly fortified to be taken french battery be however raining shell upon a franc tireurs approached champigny saw that place have not be taken without severe struggle body of french soldier strewed ground thickly a passed through street saxon uniform be mingled with of assailant corp pushed forward until ascended low hill behind village here found french troop halted be evident ducrot did not intend to advance further until joined by whole of command be pure madness colonel said by to morrow will have fifty thousand german in front of if ducrot have got whole force train ambulance up might at least carry villiers by assault of course must not be done without loss what have come out for to fight can not advance a long a hold place for when support come up a may be sure will do ere long can pour out from there take in rear however may a well go forward to skirmishing line will work down by right if german support come up be likely to advance way a hear firing in quarter may find spot unoccupied by line order be given corp marched off presently took up position between river french regiment forming extreme right flank of advance in extended order taking advantage of inequality of ground pushed on after advancing quarter of mile be brought to standstill by sudden outbreak of musketry fire at various point along crest of slight rise six hundred yard in front of taking cover behind low wall running at right angle to river opened dropping fire in return however be at once stopped by colonel who went along line throw away shot lad said may want cartridge before have done will be time enough to begin when show in force over crest there be more for men to do than there have be when be waiting for turn to cross bridge be satisfied now be in front line within shot of enemy march have set blood in circulation while two three of company kept keen lookout over top of wall others laughed joked after first employing in knocking hole through wall few inch above ground so that must lie fire through if enemy advanced musketry fire have almost ceased away to right hoped that vinoy have established well out in direction various be conjecture a to why advance have ceased on own side conjectured that trochu plan consisted only in crossing river then marching back again in order to accustom troop to stand fire one suggested that general have come out without ink paper with to write grandiose proclamation to parisian be waiting until have be fetched from office what do think henri rene asked lieutenant must say said gravely that when advance came upon real prussian line of defence found too strong to be carried must have known that must never hold champigny under fire of gun fort used only a outpost of course be from side must think likely that must try to break out must certainly erect battery to command road have have nothing else to do for last ten week have doubt be partly reason henri cuthbert said think may be principally due to fact that ducrot ca get troop across river even with well organized army good staff commanding officer who know duty be big job to get hundred thousand men with artillery ambulance train across river here with exception of ducrot few of line officer nobody know anything about matter by what saw must think there be not more than twenty thousand men across river confusion on other side must be frightful saw that street of village be absolutely choked up with wagon have doubt road be same of course never ought to have moved forward at till troop be over if trochu really meant to break out north be side where must have tried whole force must have be massed between wall st denis have be marched in regular order against prussian with field battery at interval train following at proper distance on various line of road hope be plan still that attack from south be only feint to draw a many of german a possible over to side have tremendous advantage in having short line to march across if trochu be to send train off at once while recrossed followed a soon a be dark whole army might be outside northern wall before morning to morrow might get into position for attack make arrangement advance far enough to dash forward at line a soon a be light next day with ducrot vinoy force united ought to go right through must have men suppose must oppose with third of number however strong position ought to be able to carry if went at with rush besides must have gun at northern fort to help at rate after delay here consider idea of further advance in direction to be out of question by to morrow morning may have hundred thousand men facing if recross to night may find very difficult business to do so to morrow have got battery fort to cover henri vaucour said german must never advance against in force under fire hope be going to cross evening if be going to cross at pierre leroux said be cold enough now if be going to pas night here will be bitter there be house by river be good deal nearer to than other troop arnold dampierre said will hold if pack in pretty closely a afternoon wore on colonel sent two officer to inspect house be found to be empty a soon a received report sent twenty men off with order to cut down hedge form fagot then to light fire in room there be further movement heavy musketry fire be kept up far away to left battery occasionally fired heavily idea of movement be evidently abandoned for day enemy be not in sufficient force to take offensive a soon a became dark therefore company be left on guard at wall rest of corp marched off to house roaring fire be blazing in room for fruit tree have be cut down split up into log party on guard be to be relieved two hour a soon a men be bestowed in quarter major went off to discover if possible what have be result of fighting on other side of loop be two hour before returned news brought be dispiriting have be up to creteil said have learnt from people there who saw whole affair what have happened advance be good swept german at first before for time fellow made stand on crest of montmesly enemy be reinforced drove down hill again then came disgraceful panic soldier who have fought fairly at first became mob mobile who have not done a well a have be expected be worse there be battalion of national guard of belleville scoundrel ran without firing shot at men absolutely fought to get through street be disgraceful hear that further to right line did better that still hold ville juif other village well in advance of old position be must learn say loss have be pretty heavy at rate creteil be full of wounded ambulance be taking into paris there be great confusion on other side of river road be choked with wagon train nobody have got order nobody know what be going to be done one know where ducrot trochu be be enough to make one tear one hair to see such confusion mismanagement night passed off quietly next day to surprise of everyone thing remained unchanged effort be made to pas baggage train over bridge portion of troop have be put under canvas first evening save for dead still lying about broken arm stain of blood party engaged in carrying wounded across river to ambulance wagon others burying dead scene differed little from ordinary encampment troop laughed jested round camp fire occupied with cooking horse have be killed be already skeleton flesh having be cut off for food advance party have be called in barricade thrown up just beyond champigny where advance guard occasionally exchanged shot with prussian few hundred yard away strong party be at work erecting series of earthwork on hill franc tireurs fell back from position have held night before established in few house half roofless shattered by shell between champigny river most of house in long straggling street of champigny bore mark of conflict have raged there before saxon have be driven out fortunately large store of straw be found in village added much to comfort of troop franc tireurs carried off good many truss to quarter considerable amount of other store be also discovered there be thoroughly appreciated by soldier after restricted ration smoked pipe that evening feeling thankful that a lay behind champigny there be occasion for to turn out on outpost duty say will fight again to morrow for certain rene said think likely will rene must be inclined to bet ten to one that be prussian who will attack will have have forty eight hour to mass force here will be fool if take advantage of opportunity have be good enough to give day be just breaking when sharp rattle of musketry broke out franc tireurs sprang to foot must have won bet rene if have taken cuthbert exclaimed a slung cartridge box over shoulder be on along line in le than minute rattle of musketry swelled into continuous roar above came boom of cannon explosion of shell in around champigny just a corp be formed up heavy gun in battery of st maur behind opened fire deep roar sounding loud above sharp explosion of prussian field gun a advanced at double towards village must see mob of panic stricken men rushing from front coward vile coward broke from lip of men a of fugitive ran past saluted with yell cry of contempt fully five thousand panic stricken men be in wild flight rushing towards bridge if be commander of st maur rene said must turn gun upon coward be greater enemy to france than be prussian forward child shouted old colonel let show that there be still frenchman ready to fight die for country officer in command of st maur general on spot be equal to situation seventy eighty field piece be massed round redoubt tremendous fire opened upon prussian battery out on plain while strong guard be sent down to end of bridge to bar way to mob of fugitive german have already obtained possession of other end of village when franc tireurs entered small body of troop be standing firm barricade thrown up across street be manned from from house replied to fire of advancing prussian latter be still pushing on wresting house by house from hand while hail of shell from german battery fell upon part of village still held by french a franc tireurs advanced colonel ordered one company to wheel off on hand to occupy garden behind house so prevent enemy from taking defender in rear pressed forward down street to aid soldier at barricade sun have by time risen light glinting on prussian helmet showed strong body advancing down slope into village wood on hand be still held by french irregular fire showed that be not in strong force din be terrific three four of french mitrailleuses be adding to roar sending stream of bullet into advancing german nerved by desperation of situation fiercely angered at cowardice of countryman young artist of cuthbert company dashed forward climbing wall bursting through hedge burning with eagerness to meet foe prussian shell be bursting round bullet sang above around rattle of musketry grew louder fiercer there be not moment check until francois de valles shouted to to halt behind low wall enemy be hundred yard away pressing forward through garden steady men steady shouted lie down for minute to get breath then let other man open fire throw away shot let others try get stone out of wall make loop hole a yet have not be seen by german be fifty yard away in thick line of skirmisher when de valles gave word franc tireurs rising on one knee resting musket on wall opened steady fire upon many fell taken by surprise rest ran back to wall thirty yard in rear thence opened heavy fire lie down lad de valles shouted set to work to loop wall show head above unless advance again have got to do be to hold ground chapter xiii by aid of sword bayonet franc tireurs soon pierced wall lying at full length yard apart replied to enemy fire through smoke must just make out upper line of wall a prussian stood up to fire picked off henri vaucour crept along line urging men to fire slowly will advance presently said can tell by fire that be getting thicker thicker must check rush five minute later there be deep cheer crowd of dark figure leaped over wall flash of fire ran along line of defender then a fast a chassepots must be reloaded rolling fire broke out so heavy be that before crossing third of intervening space german wavered hesitated then ran back to shelter bravo bravo de valles shouted springing to foot in excitement a spoke enemy fire broke out again vive la france shouted then fell heavily backwards fall be noticed only by nearest to for franc tireurs be busy rattle of musketry in house to right showed that french be still holding own german be apparently waiting for reinforcement before attempted rush against position held by invisible foe in turn loop holed wall held musketry duel continued between wall be two line of low hedge leaf have fallen party must see loophole through opponent fired henri vaucour who be now in command ordered men to crawl back to next wall fifty pace in rear to loop hole that next time come said will be too strong for must fall back remainder of men placed near two end of wall so that a fell back comrade behind must open fire so cover retreat be

obeyed mary brander conscientiously tried to carry out doctor instruction walked briskly along boulevard then going up champ elysees turning to left went to edge of plateau above river there sat down on bench looked over country to south there be many group of people gathered at point most of doubtless like have friend in army gathered outside wall be too anxious restless to remain indoors although eye be fixed on country beyond fort mary brander did not take in scene be thinking a have be for last two day be full of regret for past have not altogether admitted to herself knew now that

corp went out last night will go to day hope wo be in front have right to put volunteer in front when have got regular soldier be downright wicked that must have enlisted when be business of wonder let do then broke off rose to foot suddenly with angry exclamation mary brander be weak fool started back at quick pace with head erect again walked round boulevard having thoroughly tired made way home drank cup of bouillon made from horse flesh went straight to bed sobbed to sleep woke up with start house shook with explosion of heavy gun sprang up went to window threw open looked out must see fort issy vanvres be firing heavily while between boom of gun must hear report of others flash came back from meudon of prussian position though held breath to listen must hear sound of musketry struck match looked at watch be one o'clock closed window wrapping up in dressing gown sat there for time looking out presently fire slackened crept back into bed again rose when fort re opened fire then feeling that sleep be impossible lighted candle forced to read until daylight be dressing when roar again broke out time be away to left threw on thing put on bonnet cloak went out of room just a m michaud issued from be going out mademoiselle so be will walk with if will allow think real thing have begun firing last night be only fancy to rouse german make pas a bad night a men be doing think be real thing mary be glad of escort seemed to make more bearable to have someone to speak to in few minute reached spot where have sat day before crowd be already collected where be m michaud asked a joined group who be gathered near edge of plateau be from southern fort that be firing man said look at smoke rolling up from be clearing way for men there do see that puff of smoke away on right be from battery up at creteil now prussian gun on montmesly way round ville juif be answering affair be becoming hot listen chassepots be at work indeed between sound of cannon continuous murmur must be heard sounded like railway train passing over distant viaduct be there place where can see better from must see better from wall over on side one be allowed there national guard be under arm have taken place on wall of mobile who have gone out be wretched seeing nothing here said feverishly do think must get up to top of tower of notre dame be long way off m michaud said if people be permitted there may be sure by time there be not standing room besides even from there distance must be too great to make out movement of troop mary felt that be right with little shiver said will hurry back now will then go down to ambulance swallowed cup of coffee in two egg from hidden store have be beaten up ate piece of bread then started off a went along gathered from talk in street thing be believed to be going on well musketry be certainly good deal further off light smoke be rising fur out upon plain say that have captured montmesly on side can not be far from ville juif ah prussian have begun to learn what paris can do expect william bismarck be by time packing up at versailles said will know day have come to end everyone say will be hung if catch mary hurried on knew that hour must elapse before wounded must be brought in felt feverish anxiety to be at ambulance to hear what be said there just before reached roar of distant combat suddenly increased seemed to further away to left dr swinburne be standing outside tent when came up do know what be going on sir asked breathlessly a came up to believe that first firing heard be advance of vinoy who moved out under cover of gun of southern fort from hear have advanced considerable distance across plain believe that firing have just begun away to west be real battle ducrot be out there with men vinoy attack be feint to draw prussian to south so clear way for ducrot who cross marne advance through champigny heard plan last night from one of trochu staff seems good one if be carried out with spirit see reason why must not succeed rest have done good miss brander eye be brighter look more like feel better doctor have be rating soundly have done good feel quite ready for work again doctor detected little pathetic ring beneath almost defiant tone in uttered word only said have need of scolding occasionally act a tonic must rather like to be braced up for to night work be too bad mary said almost indignantly be always insisting on resting have work on shoulder there be eight ten of be by not quite by mr wingfield be of great assistance to aid will be invaluable when rush come besides surgeon after first operation treatment have little more to do than to watch patient if have nurse that can rely upon a go round get report know how patient have passed night if there be change in condition if wound require rebandaging be at hand with be necessary be responsibility rather than work try one still if one know that one be doing best at rate wounded be very much better cared for have much better chance of recovery here than in city hospital one must be content worry doe good to one patient to oneself be maxim doe for of miss brander now have better go in get everything ready be probable that of wounded early morning may soon be brought in mary went in to marque child be herself on list of wounded surgeon said a looked after have be fighting battle of sort have be hit pretty hard expression have changed altogether there be brisk alertness about before went about work in resolute business sort of way be almost amusing in girl of nineteen twenty be easy to see that have good health plenty of sense abundant confidence in herself at one moment must be lecturing patient with gravity of middle aged woman five minute later chattering away with like young girl must have put down a absolutely heartwhole a never having experienced slightest real care trouble a never having quite recognized that have grown into womanhood well something have occurred to alter have received blow of sort though may soon get over will never be quite same a be before if one be so weighed down with work have so many serious matter to think of must be interesting study never quite understood what on earth be in paris for by herself at time a there be something will give other matter to think of something be ambulance wagon minute later drew up in front of hospital from moment there be indeed time for doctor nurse to give thought to anything save wounded men who continued to pour in until fully bed be occupied men belonged to vinoy division dr swinburne must take more there be already more work to do than must get through before next morning none of wounded who came in later from beyond marne be received there be distributed among other hospital ambulance at of preparation on very large scale have be made by morning most pressing part of work have be done wounded have be made a far a possible comfortable of bullet have be extracted of most urgent amputation made fresh batch of nurse arrived to take place of white faced woman who have nobly steadily borne part in trying work of night thank lady doctor said a gathered outside tent before going away assistance have be invaluable trained nurse must have shown more nerve pluck than have done have just learned that be not likely that there will be renewal of fighting to day can therefore go home with conviction that can take twenty four hour off duty without fear that there will be pressure in absence be going to lie down for three hour even surgeon have nerve must keep mine steady there be several operation must be performed afternoon bullet to hunt up beg to force yourselves to take something a soon a get to home then to go to bed sleep a long a can did not seem to mary brander when started that must be able to walk home keen air revived kept on until entered madame michaud flat mon dieu child how white look french lady exclaimed a girl entered room where be taking morning coffee what night must have have need for strength be past now mary sank into chair burst into fit of hysterical sobbing madame michaud caressed soothed a if have be over tired child there said when mary recovered little take cup of coffee drink have not touched there be two egg beaten up in margot will make more in few minute here be fresh roll made batch morning in oven try eat child drink coffee then will help into bed mary with great effort ate mouthful of bread drank coffee in quarter of hour be asleep be growing dark when woke remembering doctor order got up went into sitting room madame michaud kissed affectionately now be looking more like child truly looked like ghost when came in be husband turn for duty on wall so can sit have cosy chat together well went on when mary have taken seat that have placed for by stove be going on famously have pushed german back everywhere be proclamation say plan have be carried out exactly a arranged there have not be much fighting to day have hardly have gun fired everyone be rejoicing world agrees that now prussian have seen how can fight will speedily take off altogether hope be so madame michaud certainly wounded said that have advanced long way on south side have not heard at what be done on other side of marne none of wounded from there be brought to hospital champigny be taken say that there be hard fight there pushed prussian back beyond ever so far madame michaud arm expressed illimitable distance suppose there be report a to what regiment be engaged mary asked oh everyone say that soldier fought like lion that national guard be splendid there be none of national guard brought in wounded to ambulance mary said be linesman mobile perhaps there be national guard engaged on side dear perhaps not mary agreed think went out by east gate yes be where ducrot commanded be where great fight be to be madame michaud said complacently doubt wanted to have national guard there mary having a result of own observation from imbibing very pronunced opinion of cuthbert a to efficiency of national guard formed estimate reverse of favorable to body made reply indeed derived little comfort from point of view diametrically opposed to of madame michaud saying to herself that trochu probably sent national guard with ducrot because be not likely that must be called upon to do serious fighting there wo let boy in madame michaud said changing subject think chatter must do good brain seems stupid still boy be brought in from next room where be doing lesson be full of report have gathered from school fellow if half of have be true be evident that remnant of german army be in full flight towards frontier that bravest deed of antiquity faded into insignificance by side of heroism displayed by french soldier talk excitement have effect of rousing mary preventing thought reverting to scene in ambulance at half past nine again went off to bed feeling more like than have done for day chapter xiv mary brander be a usual called before daylight by margot be dressing when sound like rumbling of heavy wagon caused to pause suddenly then hurry to window throw open have begun again exclaimed firing be heavier than be before come from east must be trochu force engaged again hastily completed toilet drank off coffee margot have got ready for then started on way to ambulance be louder than ever exclaimed must be terrible battle roar of cannon never ceased window door be open a went along woman in various state of dishabille be talking excitedly to other from former across street while men equally excited be discussing battle in group agreed that fort in loop of marne be engaged caused disappointment ca be so far out a thought one said must be beyond range of gun perhaps german be attacking old man suggested idea be received with derision mary caught more of conversation a hurried along be absolute relief to when entered ambulance for continued roar of gun thought of what be going on be well nigh intolerable to nerve hand be shaking a removed bonnet cloak even quiet hospital tent shared in excitement outside patient whose hurt be comparatively slight be sitting up in bed discussing battle eagerly others more seriously hurt raised head to listen while lying apparently unconscious moaned moved uneasily muttering occasionally incoherent word quiver in earth air arousing dim sense of battle danger more work for dr swinburne said a passed while be trying to soothe restless patient into quiet again be afraid so doctor by sound will be even worse than last loss be not always proportionate to noise said cheerfully fort may be merely preparing way for general advance said be to begin morning a before be not until evening that wounded began to come in who be first brought be sombre depressed be german who be attacking french have be surprised badly beaten later on news be better champigny have be nobly defended french have rallied after hard fighting prussian be driven back ground lost recovered of wounded have be among who have defended champigny to mary put question have asked of others who be not too severely wounded to be able to talk who have taken part in fight mobile line have be engaged there be national guard nurse have seen franc tireurs hitherto answer to question have be no men from champigny gave different answer yes corp have fought there did not know who be be dressed in gray whoever be fought like tiger be agreed who saved champigny prussian be advancing one said must not have held out much longer be advancing by road through garden be over with when men in gray came up be at barricade one said there be not twenty of left there when company arrived if have fought in hundred battle must not have done better have colonel with fine old militaire be killed by side prussian never got foot further for though be hard pressed again again held ground till coward who have run began to come back again be hot mademoiselle can tell be rain storm of bullet shell fell moment among must have be up with if battery have not silenced gun be in one of house comrade put in be doing best to prevent prussian coming up through garden behind there be few of be hundred strong if have gone on must have caught in trap be just going to warn others to fall back when saw franc tireurs come running up be smart fellow a well a brave one knocked loophole through wall in time clung to for hour at least then prussian be reinforced heavily franc tireurs fell back to next wall when prussian rushed forward gave hotly while took in flank from house must have hundred fifty men left behind when rushed back to wall have advanced from did franc tireurs suffer much mary asked must say lost more than number when formed up after fighting be over prussian driven back gave hearty cheer believe there be three company of when came up altogether there be not more than strong company paraded must not think that others be killed madbeoiselle seeing by mary face that news be terrible to of who did parade may reckon that two third be only wounded not so many a that other who have not observed mary face said be not fellow to fall out for slight wound why best part of who paraded have hurt fancy of be serious though did best to make light of waved cap when cheered may be sure that who be missing must have be hard hit indeed imbecile beast comrade growled a mary moved silently away must not see by face that girl have friend in corp did notice how pleased looked when praised bravery how white face came when said what loss be tried to comfort by making out that most of missing might be only wounded then imbecile that be break in with talk a good a tell that if ai dead be likely to be so before long must have bit tongue out before must have said so other said penitently did not notice look do think must have said if have just a have be bandaging wound too like little mother franc tireurs remained in village night a soon a fell out have scattered over whole ground collected dead laid together brought wounded into house soldier estimate be not far wrong number of dead exceeded that of wounded most of be very seriously hurt of found lying behind wall many have be killed outright being struck on head by bullet through loophole behind be firing of hit during retreat when at last took offensive many of wound though of disabling be not of fatal nature company on other side of village have not be pressed so severely prussian shell have fallen thickly there large proportion of wound be caused by fragment of shell stone company held barricade have comparatively few wounded have lost number by bullet through head a fired over crest be hard work indeed for surgeon nurse night for many nothing must be done be beyond reach of surgical aid not only be there work of bandaging wound of giving drink soup to must take of writing down last message to friend from among dying who retained consciousness in aiding dr swinburne assistant in work in temporarily bandaging wound of for whom nothing else must be done till daylight at eight o'clock next morning ambulance wagon drew up to door orderly came in to doctor with message have six wounded here surgeon told to

certainly name said though can not think how guess have heard of from friend of mine cuthbert harrington can tell sir if be hurt then must be miss brander yes be sorry to say be hurt know how badly went on hurriedly a saw look of pain in face did not see until be put in wagon next to other be not much up to talking in fact motion be too much for fainted doubt will soon come round be bringing into next bed perhaps will be better for if be to let one of other nurse attend to until come round bit mary shook head silently have be trembling a asked question stood stiff rigid a cuthbert be brought up gave one short gasp when saw face a lowered litter to ground then hurried to table on glass be standing poured brandy into tumbler be turning when surgeon entered tent put down glass hurried up to laid fluttering hand on arm come doctor please come quickly momentary flash of surprise crossed face however said nothing quickened step stood by pallet on to cuthbert have just be lifted shade passed over face put hand on cuthbert wrist then knelt down placed ear over heart be dead mary asked in whisper a rose to foot again dear hope be worth many dead men yet have fainted from jolting of wagon just a many others that have seen have done fetch that brandy have just poured out be hard hit pointed to bloodstained patch in shirt just above waistband of trouser there be doubt about will know more about presently a hurried off to fetch brandy doctor lip tightened be fifty to one against muttered still have seen men live with similar wound took glass from mary hand a returned poured little between cuthbert lip then listened to heart beating again be stronger already said encouragingly to mary now dear have better go out for few minute get little fresh air ask mr stanmore to come here must try find out where bullet have gone a moved away went on wait here minute wilson will want to turn over directly now for wound ah thought so a removed lightly fastened bandage lifted pad of lint beneath there have be bleeding since be taken up doubt fell forward at first now turn over ah bullet have gone right through must have be hit by shot fired at close quarter well that will save trouble chance of complication be now simple question of how much damage did a passed through ah mr stanmore went on a nurse came up with tray of bandage other necessary find that there be not much to do here took two small piece of lint rolled up poured few drop of carbolic acid on to placed one in orifice put pad of lint over passed bandage twice round body to keep in place thank wilson will do for present please pour little strong brandy water down throat mr stanmore now will see to next man how be hurt in shoulder see by bandage be lying down behind wall doctor raised slightly to fire through loophole when bullet came through heard surgeon say that have smashed collar bone have gone out through bone behind know what called be what must call shoulder bone well in case be in surgeon said if have glanced more downwards must have be dead man five minute after be hit do feel comfortable at present a comfortable a can expect then in case wo disturb bandage be tight now man who bandaged evidently knew what be about be more than can say for of who have sent in specimen of handiwork for present there be nothing for to do to lie quiet will have look at again later there be so many case must be attended to at once be in hurry can assure doctor suffered too much when bandaged to want repetition of until be absolutely necessary doctor nodded then hurried off to visit men who have be carried off into other marquee a pushed aside flap at entrance stopped abruptly for few yard away mary brander be lying insensible on ground now covered with light sprinkle of snow have fallen in morning poor little girl said a raised in arm carried into own tent placed in rocking chair affair coming on top of work last night have be too much for went into next marque miss betham said to one of nurse miss brander have just broken down have fainted will find in chair in tent take bottle of salt little brandy when come round make lie down on bed there tell that order be absolute that be to keep quiet for time be not to go to work in ward again be not to leave tent until have seen there be getting conveyance wo be fit to walk home for time hour later dr swinburne snatched moment from work looked in at tent mary sprang up from bed a entered be right dear said see be active again be sure will be glad to hear that patient called to have recovered consciousness bullet passed right through be good sign so trouble be disposed of a to future can say nothing a yet of course depends upon what damage ball did on way through however be inclined to view case favorably can only judge by face although be of course white drawn there be not that ashen sort of pallor be almost sure sign of injury to vital part then think there be hope doctor asked with hand lightly clasped before honestly think there be must of course be kept absolutely free from anything like agitation if think presence be likely to agitate in slightest degree must say that when come to work again have better exchange into one of other ward will not agitate in least doctor said after moment pause can answer for be old friend for have known since be little child be more like cousin than anything else if know ambulance be in be sure will be surprised if come to think be likely will guess dr swinburne said when hears nurse speaking english indeed seems that one of others particularly asked to be sent here if be a say presence may do good rather than harm can go to for short time remember that be not fit for nursing that sooner be able to get home again better have be on duty more than twenty four hour have be terribly trying time for mary nodded really feel better now doctor have be very anxious about mr hartington ever since knew that corp have gone out think suspense be harder to bear than anything will see sha break down again if do miss brander remember will have to take name off list of nurse have enough to do think about here without having fainting young lady on hand spoke gravely mary saw be not really in earnest never thought said must come under category of fainting young lady feel humiliated then may go in doctor yes if be sure of yourself be certain that wo agitate minute later stood by cuthbert side be lying on back with eye open hospital rug have be thrown over a bent over eye fell on face smiled faintly be wondering whether have heard be here said in voice so low that must scarce hear well see brought egg to bad market friend prussian have given lesson must not learn from beat fairly squarely there be satisfaction in there doe not seem much consolation in cuthbert said quietly there be to said that show be not soldier to soldier make difference a lie wounded whether have shared in victory suffered in defeat then be very glad that have won if make difference to cuthbert now know have to lie very still be sure talking be very bad for suppose make difference one way other mary few hour perhaps whether be to day to morrow be immaterial must not talk like cuthbert must not think so doctor say that although of course be badly wounded think there be hope for so surgeon said who dressed wound last night mary knew that did not really think so be sure dr swinburne doe think so cuthbert be certain that be not trying to deceive well hope that be right cuthbert replied with indifference common to men in extreme weakness must certainly like to give finishing touch to two picture there be nothing else to show for life yes must like to finish be looking bad added suddenly be too much for be only tired said of course have be trying work for last twenty four hour well must go home get rest if have be going soon must have liked to have stopped with till went if a say doctor think may last for time doe not matter must rather know that be getting rest than that be wearing out here what o'clock be now be just two please worry about if be to break down there be plenty to take place be not going to anyhow will wait to hear what dr swinburne say when next come round then if report be favorable will go home for night be here again first thing in morning be in much pain cuthbert be in pain at just feel numbed little drowsy foot be cold mary went away filled tin bottle with hot water placed at foot then covered over with rug now must not talk more cuthbert hand be cold let put rug over there look more comfortable now shut eye try to get to sleep until doctor come round cuthbert closed eye at once mary went about ward doing work for next two hour returning at frequent interval to bedside seeing with satisfaction that be sleeping quietly at four o'clock surgeon came in be occupied in serving out soup to patient did not go round with have finished work when returned to where be standing near entrance did not wake said in answer to look pulse be stronger action of heart regular there be certainly good chance for hope that there be vital injury be strengthened will hope sleep for hour perhaps till morning by time may be able to give more decided opinion now think have better be off at once can see have recovered nerve there will be dozen fresh nurse here in few minute will clear out do feel strong enough to walk home oh yes doctor may come in first thing in morning may yes if feel equal to be possible thought to a went to next marquee that poor fellow only regard a cousin be greatly mistaken if have not very much warmer feeling towards though did so stoutly declare that be old friend mary putting on bonnet cloak went out a did so man in uniform of franc tireurs young woman approached pardon mademoiselle said lifting cap a came up to be possible for friend to visit wounded mary glanced at speaker companion at once recognized be face of have seen so many drawing in cuthbert sketch book be not possible to day said except in extreme case there have be many applicant have be refused fear be extreme case rene for be urged be comrade of mine surgeon told after examining that be hit very seriously lady be fiancee know who mean mary said after moment silence must not see even if be wife be asleep now everything depends upon sleep being unbroken if must only

indeed rene remonstrance entreaty to induce to leave be clear said that can not be near death be so must assuredly ask for so after be good news that have received a told along though surgeon said that be serious wound did not say that be likely to be fatal a did in case of cuthbert hartington army surgeon mince matter there be reason why must not have said at once to that american be likely to die if thought must be so will go to see to morrow said with angry stamp of foot if woman try to prevent will tear face if men interfere to stop will scream so loud that will be forced to let in be abominable to keep woman from bedside of man love be of use talking in wild way minette rene said sternly how do suppose hospital be to be managed if sick man be to have woman sitting at bed be

whatever in well thank god that be better cuthbert must not have gone away yesterday afternoon if dr swinburne have not assured that there be nothing must do for that really thought might recover

be perfectly quiet tranquil now shut eye try to doze off again spoke in tone of nursely authority with faint smile obeyed order stood for minute looking at a did so eye filled with tear at change that few day have made yet experience taught that must be far greater before long a yet weakness fever pain have scarcely begun work of hollowing cheek reducing to shadow of there be already scarcely tinge of color in face while there be drawn look round mouth bluish tinge on lip eye seemed deeper in head expression of face greatly changed indeed be rather lack of expression that characterized might have be waxen mask from time to time went back to although soft clinging material of dress list slipper rendered movement noiseless always seemed conscious of presence opened eye with little welcoming smile a stood beside sipped few drop from glass held to lip then closed eye again without word after few hour period of pain fever set in doctor found reason for anxiety must expect dear said to mary one day when fever be at height man can not get through wound a without sharp struggle nature can not be outraged with impunity be certain now that there be vital injury pain fever almost necessarily accompany effort of nature to repair damage see reason for uneasiness at present must say that have excellent constitution have never played fool with in few day in probability fever will abate a soon a doe so will be on highway to convalescence during ten day mary seldom left hospital only snatching few hour sleep occasionally in tent have now be erected for use of nurse on duty at end of time struggle be over victory won cuthbert lay terribly weak mere shadow of free from fever with perfect consciousness in eye how long have be here asked mary think be fortnight to day since came in cuthbert answered quietly thank god be quite out of danger now doctor say have got to do be to build up have have hard time of child said though knew nothing else seemed to be conscious that be always near have have plenty of sleep cuthbert be perfectly well said cheerfully then look belies said know that be use arguing have be happening outside nothing troop be withdrawn day after fight when be

cuthbert have quite looked forward to little chat have with morning when came to ambulance for news be grand fellow mademoiselle must say with tear in eye love have such talent such great heart be not till now that quite know when man be dying men speak of thing must not tell otherwise there be four five that have helped who for must have given up study rest of have idea of when knew how bad be first one broke down then told how generously have come to aid how delicately have insisted upon helping making promise to say word of to others ma foi cried together have lost six of number besides five here rest except dampierre be countryman yet be of englishman that think talk most be very pleasant to mary cuthbert be now of course nothing to soothed to hear praise have be wicked in one respect in others seemed to have be what have thought of when be child save that developed talent power of steady work for have never given credit for on head rene be a emphatic a on other point will be great artist mademoiselle if life know how much master thought of so did worked harder than of much harder be not that only have talent great talent while rest of be dauber will see picture hung on

have not heart to finish if cuthbert dy will put by for year rene be admitted to see cuthbert day after fever have left sat for hour by bedside telling after first burst of emotion on seeing change have taken place in about fate of comrade in studio mary did not go near there be question cuthbert must want to ask message that must want to send that ought not to hear have wondered that woman who have for time come day have a regularly made scene at entrance to ambulance have since cuthbert be at worst ceased coming have never asked about be ignorant that for last four day have be allowed to sit for time by side of patient in ward thought most likely that be ill have broken down under stress of grief anxiety have even in thought pitied be not herself that ought to be watching cuthbert bedside might not be good be woman loved must be terrible for to know how ill be never to be allowed even to see for moment be evident that have be taken ill when on rene leaving went to patient expected to find downcast anxious sad certainly be did not seem to restless excited a have expected have be hearing of others said six of be gone merry lad taking life easily a student do with plenty of good in must have come to surface later on will make sad gap in rank when rest of come together again wounded be going on well hear that of course be great comfort hear other two company suffered much more than did wall fought behind saved good deal see rene say troop went out again three day ago that there be talk of great fight there have only be skirmishing have begun to come back into town again corp did not go out think have done fair share of work think so too rene say old major who be now in command be so furious at cowardice shown last time by national guard of troop that declares will not take out brave lad to throw away life when parisian will not venture within musket shot of enemy think be quite right hope there will be no more sortie for be sure must be useless if have seen a did seven eight thousand men running like flock of frightened sheep must agree with that must be hopeless to think of breaking through german with such troop a one victory must make difference in world to morale will never win that one victory will take year before french soldier regains old confidence in have taken to rat yet mary asked with flash of old manner sir mean to be still going on very fairly meat ration be very small boil down into broth a have plenty of bread to sop into do very well store of egg have held on until now have be having beaten up in morning coffee instead of milk be just gone madame michaud say that must now begin upon preserved meat be long way from rat yet though believe be really hunted eaten in great number in poorer quarter there be talk of surrender talk at say can hold on for month yet what be news from province everywhere bad bourbaki have be obliged to take refuge in switzerland force have be disarmed there chanzy have be beaten badly near new orleans prussian have probably by time entered tour faidherbe have gained success in north a german be pushing forward there a well a everywhere else that doe not make very much difference to then what on earth use of holding out longer said be sheer stupidity suppose parisian think that a ca fight will at least show that can starve what be weather like felt very cold last night though have plenty of blanket on be terribly cold said snow be deep on ground be one of coldest winter have be for year what be day of month th then yesterday be christmas day yes said not merry christmas year to of roast beef plum pudding mince pie yet cuthbert have reason to be thankful for what much more unhappy christmas might have be to nodded know what mean yes must have missed child cut off a be from world here be a be sole representative of family of course have not heard from shook head suppose trouble much about said little bitterly be sort of disappointment know of course have be away now for nearly two year except for fortnight be over there even before scarcely seemed to belong to did not care for thing that thought great deal of have interest in thing cared for somehow think have got on well with ever since went up to girton see now be entirely own fault doe not do for girl to have taste differing from of family felt that mary felt very much have told ever since day of dear old father death have be brute wish with heart have put aside own whim gone in for country life be very well to say did not like ought to have made like if must not do ought to have made pretence of liking to have stuck to a long a lived have even excuse of having high purpose before make mistake in life cuthbert girl said quietly be of use bemoaning at rate have done best to retrieve yours mean to do best to retrieve mine have quite made up mind that when be over will go to london be regularly trained a hospital nurse then join nursing sisterhood what give up woman in general cuthbert said with faint laugh will abandon down trodden sister impossible mary be quite possible said in business like manner become back slider mary absolutely shock at present have got nursing on brain must have thought that ambulance work must have be enough for life time at rate must advise to think over very seriously before commit too deeply to new fad nursing be one of greatest gift of woman after woman be made only to nurse more than be to devote life to championing sex mary did not reply silently moved off with air of deeply offended dignity what enthusiastic little woman be cuthbert laughed quietly to anyhow be splendid nurse must infinitely rather see so than a female spouter on platform fancied siege might have have effect on have seen something of reality of life be likely to give up theorizing look older more womanly softer good deal than be think can improve picture now have never seen look soft before have to trust to imagination be sure can improve now fortnight cuthbert be out of bed able to walk about in ward to render little service to other patient do know said one day when happened to be idle be standing talking to a sat on edge of bed curious thing happened to very day before went out on sortie saw that fellow cumming rascal ruined bank then bolted know for moment did not recall face struck directly afterwards saw go into house have grown beard be evidently living a quiet respected british resident be capital idea of for be a safe here a must be if be up in balloon intended to look up when got back again into paris see circumstance prevented doing so of course will get arrested a soon a siege be over cuthbert be very glad that be found well know have quite made up mind about suppose that made off with great sum see company bolstered up with bank money smashed at same time suppose that intended to rob bank at time helped probably have sunk saving in thought must pull round with aid of additional capital a far a must make out from report of men who went into matter did not seem to have drawn money at on own account until very day bolted when took eight ten thousand pound there be in safe think meant to hand over indeed to say anything about thought must give good fright richly deserves then ask few question have never quite understood how be that dear old dad came to buy share did inquire so far a to find out be cumming who transferred to must really like to hear what be said at time if man can prove to that when sold did not know that bank be going to break must have ill will against if be sure persuaded to buy knowing that ruin must follow must hunt down spare pain to get punished why must have persuaded father to buy share be just what can not make out must have have interest in involving in smash besides be not on intimate term in way can not imagine that father must have gone to for advice in reference to business investment be of course to father must have turned in such matter how long have be shareholder bought share only two month before death make matter more singular what did father say cuthbert girl said after short pause suppose spoke to about said that father have heard rumor to effect that bank be not in good state having belief whatever in bought share thinking that doing so must have good effect upon credit in a sort of county institution felt interest did not father who be solicitor to bank must have known something of affair warn of danger that be running be what asked said that only attended to legal business outside knew nothing of affair seems curious affair altogether mary said gravely be time for to be at work again chapter xvi while in ambulance mary brander resolutely put conversation with cuthbert aside a soon a started for walk home became uppermost in thought be certainly curious affair from time to time friend at home with whom corresponded sent local newspaper have especially be case during first few month of stay in germany a naturally supposed must be greatly interested in calamity of bank failure have at time be issued read full report of committee of investigation upon affair although have passed lightly over account have noticed that proceeds of sale of fairclose estate be put down a subject to deduction of fifteen thousand pound for previous mortgage to jeremiah brander esq matter have made impression upon mind at time now came back to remembrance of course be perfectly natural that if mr hartington wished to borrow money be to father a solicitor friend that must have gone there must be nothing unusual in what cuthbert have told about mr hartington buying share two month before death be certainly singular surely father must have prevented taking so disastrous step few men be regarded by member of family in exactly same light a be considered by public jeremiah brander be certainly exception while suavest of men in eye of fellow townsman family be well aware that possessed temper when girl be young conversation be always guarded in hearing a grew up no longer felt same necessity for prudence of speech frequently indulged in criticism of colleague for whom professed most unbounded respect admiration in public mary have often felt something like remorse at thought that first time read chuzzlewit many touch in delineation of mr pecksniff character have reminded her of father believed to be just upright man must not help admitting to herself that be not by long way man public believed to be be subject on rarely permitted to think have never got on very well together acknowledged to herself that be a much fault a be not so much fact that have strong will be bent on going own way regardless of opinion of others have be cause of gulf have grown up between a dissimilarity of character absolute difference between view held of thing in general to rest of family entertained regarding outspoken frankness with be in habit of expressing contempt for thing praised highly thinking over matter of mr hartington purchase of bank share found wondering what motive father must have have in permitting to buy for knowing how squire relied upon opinion in business matter must not doubt that latter must have prevented disastrous transaction that must have have motive felt sure for experience of be amply sufficient for to be well aware that never acted without motive of sort so far a must see motive be apparent in way altered opinion cuthbert think curious affair wonder said to herself suppose have suspicion that anything have be wrong suppose there have there may have be what call sharp practice think cuthbert like father be very last man to suspect anyone be horrid before being at fairclose will be ten time a bad now whole thing be disgusting be wicked of to think that father must possibly do anything be quite honorable right especially when there be not slightest reason for suspecting be only suppose because know be exactly what other people think to be that make uneasy about know well enough must never have gone away from home a did if have not be that hated so to hear running down people with whom seemed to be so friendly making fun of thing in seemed so interested used to make quite hateful be just a glad when said must like to go to girton to get rid of a be to go be very well to say honor father mother if ca honor be to do have doubt be worrying for nothing now ca help be dreadful to feel like towards one father felt quite chill run through when cuthbert said must go see man cumming try to get to bottom of thing one thing be certain will never live at fairclose never if leaf between julia clara may live there if like let have so much year go own way will never put foot in after father mother be gone be very miserable do think be getting to be most hateful girl here be suspecting own father of having done something wrong although of what have not least idea that without shadow of reason then be almost hating woman because man refused love have become discouraged have thrown up plan have laid down for because doe not seem a easy a thought must be be not quite true be much more because cuthbert have laughed out of anyhow must be nice woman to teach other woman what must do when be a weak a weakest of think there ever be more objectionable sort of girl in world than have become by time that have arrived at conclusion have nearly reached home sudden feeling that must not in present mood submit to be petted fussed over by madame michaud struck turning abruptly walked with brisk step to arc de triomphe then down champ elysees along rue rivoli then round boulevard returning home fagged out better for exertion one thing determined during walk must give up work at ambulance there be plenty of nurse said one more le will make difference be miserably weak at rate have sense enough to know that will be better for not to be going there day now that be out of danger belongs to someone else must rather die than that must ever dream what fool be now know will be harder harder a get better to be talking to indifferently accordingly next morning when went down told dr swinburne that felt that must at rate for time give up nursing be quite right miss brander said kindly have taxed strength too much already be looking mere shadow of what be two month ago be quite right to take rest have plenty of assistance there be not likely to be such strain again a that have lately gone through paris can not hold out many week longer after two failure feel sure that there will be no more attempt at sortie especially a hope that army may come to relief be now at end found more difficult to tell cuthbert be not necessary for to begin subject for noticed at once that have not usual nursing dress on be going to take holiday to day suppose said a came up to bedside be going to take holiday for little time said quietly can do very well without now almost patient in ward be convalescent really feel that need rest be sure do said earnestly have be awful time for to go through have behaved like heroine good many of owe life to work have told on sadly suppose know how much will miss at end of ward miss greatly be sure there be not one who will not feel a do glad to know that be taking rest after work of course will look in sometimes to see how patient be progressing a for hope will be able to come up to see at michauds in ten day so now that doctor have taken to feeding up can feel that be gaining strength day must not hurry cuthbert said gravely must keep quiet patient be not in nursing dress now miss brander decline altogether to be lectured by have be very good obedient up to now only bow to lawfully constituted authority now come under head of convalescent intend to emancipate will not come down here to see unless hear good account of conduct said with attempt to speak playfully well good bye cuthbert hope will not try to do too much good bye dear thanks for goodness to said earnestly a held hand for moment in have right to call dear mary thought almost indignantly a left hospital doe not guess know why be longing to be out again almost wonder have never spoken to about must know very well must be interested in anything that concern think might have told suppose will bring up day introduce a wife anyhow be glad know about will be able to take a matter of course mary did not pay visit to ambulance now that have given up work felt reaction although refused to take to bed passed time sitting listless weak in easy chair paying slight attention to madame michaud talk often passing greater part of day in own room madame michaud felt so uneasy about that went down to ambulance brought up dr swinburne who scolded mary for not having sent for before prescribed tonic sent up dozen of wine from hospital ordered to wrap up sit at open window for time day to make effort to take turn round garden a soon a felt strong enough to do so on return to ambulance surgeon said carelessly to cuthbert who have now gained sufficient strength to be of considerable use a assistant in ward have be up to see late nurse miss brander there be nothing serious matter with a thought likely must be case have collapsed now that work be over will need good deal of care attention to build up again will be out in few day now be sure will do good if will go up have chat with cheer up bit be not in bed visit did good want rousing remember if can get to laugh joke about laziness will do more good than by expressing pity for think be well enough to be discharged now doctor ' cuthbert said eagerly yes will have to be very careful for time will want generous food see how be to get outside restaurant be still open common one be closed can still get dinner at of best place although will have to pay very heavily for mind that doctor besides be very anxious to be at work again will be no more tiring standing at easel than be doing what can to help here be true enough providing do too much of up to certain extent will be good thing for mind distinctly forbid to attempt such folly a to try to walk from quartier latin up to passy let see added thoughtfully yes think can be managed will send home by ambulance will be here to morrow morning at eight o'clock be to keep quiet day will get madame de millefleurs to send carriage round for at eleven o'clock next day to take round by passy have told many time that be always at disposal of of patient to whom must be useful will see time to morrow arrange about thank indeed doctor need not say how grateful be to for kindness have received here have done best must for doctor said be sure there be not one of who have provided fund for ambulance feel well rewarded by knowledge that have be mean of saving many life think may say that have not lost one whom be humanly possible to save while in french hospital have lost hundred from over crowding want of ventilation proper sanitary arrangement mortality there have be fearful percentage of death after amputation positively disgraceful rene came late afternoon to pay visit to cuthbert be delighted to find that be to be out next morning have kept room in order said will have big fire lighted in before arrive will give breakfast before leave hope will do rene will manage very well if there be still anything left of store of mine in big cupboard may be sure that there be rene replied be always most particular in locking up door when come away have not used key gave of cupboard be positively afraid to be virtuous hope there be limit to one power to resist temptation know told to take anything liked if have once began must never have stopped then will have feast to morrow rene ask others in to supper must act a cook tell not to come to see till eight o'clock if kept dropping in day must be too much for wish dampierre must be with have not got on so fast a have wound be never so serious doctor said bone be badly smashed take longer to heal say be not good patient worry fidget think visit of minette be good for doctor have to put stop to must talk excite so however hear that be likely to be out in fortnight by time will be over rend said negotiation be going on now say that in three four day will surrender best thing to do rene ever since last sortie failed hope have be at end there have be point in going on suffering for suppose by time suffering have be very severe not so very severe cuthbert of course have be out of meat for long time for ration be so small be scarcely worth calling meat flour held out well so did wine most other thing few hundred have be killed by prussian shell with exception mortality have not be very greatly above average except smallpox have be raging have carried off large number among young child too mortality have be heavy owing to want of milk thing of sort must doubt if there have be single death from absolute starvation to m goude student that supper at cuthbert harrington be memorable event master be there two large ham dish prepared from preserved meat be on table together with abundance of good wine be first reunion have have since one before sortie be only gap among number fact that host several of comrade be still weak greatly changed in appearance restrained spirit from breaking into hilarity next morning madame de millefleurs carriage came to door cuthbert be driven to michauds for moment margot failed to recognize cuthbert a opened door a did so exclaimed mon dieu monsieur hartington look like ghost be very far from being ghost margot though there be not much flesh on bone how be mademoiselle brander hear have not be well be a pale a be monsieur not so thin doe nothing sit quiet day with eye wide open who be always so bright active have smile for one go out cry often after going into room have just gone into parlor will find alone there added for margot have always have idea a to cause of cuthbert visit mary be sitting at open window did not look round a cuthbert entered well mary be actually doing nothing said cheerily turned round with start flush of color swept across face how startled said be glad indeed to see did not think must be out so soon surely be very foolish of coming so far still thinking be nurse mary laughed can assure be very prudent have be brought up here in carriage carriage with live horse dr swinburne told have not got over effect of hard work that have have to order to take tonic so see instead of being nurse be patient at present while be free man came out of hospital yesterday morning have grand supper last night out of hoard found just a have left say wonder for honesty of parisian in general for self denial of friend rene caillard in particular why must have thought stopped abruptly what must have thought miss brander oh nothing can not be put off in way be going to say that thought must have distributed store long ago that ought to have sent for for use of hospital really ought to have done so must have be only fair in fact idea never occurred to rene have key of room told to use store a liked meaning for for comrade of studio must have thought began again then a before hesitated then asked abruptly have not something to tell cuthbert something that old friend must tell to have be expecting to tell time be in hospital have felt hurt did not cuthbert looked at in surprise there be slight flush on cheek be evident that be deeply in earnest tell something mary repeated really know what mean honestly have not notion wish to pry into secret said coldly learned accidentally a wish to take into confidence will say no more about must say more about replied repeat have idea of what be talking about have secret whatever on mind by manner must be something serious think have right to know what be be silent for moment then said if wish can have possible objection to tell will finish question began twice must have thought that must have wished that store must be sent to lady be engaged to cuthbert looked at in silent surprise dear mary said gravely at last be dreaming be understood that reply to question year before last be a definite a absolute refusal a man must receive certainly have not from that moment have reason to entertain moment doubt that intended a rejection be talking about asked rising to foot with energy of few minute before must have deemed altogether incapable be pretending that be alluding to be insulting by suggesting that mean that be engaged to say be mary that if mean have not most remote idea in world what do mean say that because think be impossible must know mary retorted indignantly be mistaken have have from own lip that be engaged to came to hospital to see night be brought in claimed admittance on ground that be affianced to cuthbert surprise changed to alarm a flashed across that heavy work strain have be too much for girl that brain have given way think that there must be mistake mary said soothingly there be mistake went on still more indignantly came with friend rene knew before spoke for have seen face in score of place in sketch book told be model in studio be business of mine mr hartington whom be going to marry can understand perhaps wish that matter must remain for time secret did not think when told that knew must have kept up affectation of ignorance have always regarded a being truthful honorable beyond thing be bitterly disappointed be hurt that must not have given confidence to did think when told that knew secret must have manfully owned not descended to pretence of ignorance for moment cuthbert face have expressed bewilderment a went on speaking smile stole across face mary noticed voice manner changed think mr hartington said with great dignity must see that will be pleasanter for that interview will terminate rose from seat took hat off table said quietly have one observation to make before go have discovered miss brander that made one mistake in life have never struck that might also have made mistake time think that very long acquaintance might have induced to hesitate little before assumed a certainty that old acquaintance be acting in way that for sake of old time might have given benefit of doubt strength that mary indignation have given deserted suddenly finger tightened on back of chair by side for support how must there be mistake asked weakly vigorous attack now turned into defence more by manner than word when heard say so sit down child said in old authoritative manner be not fit to stand felt must be step towards defeat if did so brought up chair in have before be sitting placed behind quietly assisted into now went on say heard from lip what did say said insisted on going in to see that a affianced wife have right to do so said that did that be affianced wife of cuthbert hartington mary thought for moment did not use word at least not can remember be not necessary knew who be have seen sketch in book there be several of on wall of room of course knew who be speaking of though did not so far a can remember use name did never occur to miss brander that be natural thing one must have many sketch of girl who always stood a model in studio that student there must have sketch book full of did not know that there be three four other wounded men of same corp a myself in hospital one at least be fellow student of mine also foreigner that young woman be just a likely to be asking to see a to see awful feeling of doubt shame came with overpowering force over mary brander said desperately never thought of such thing naturally thought be there be reason why must be be perfectly free to please only felt hurt that when got better did not tell voice be so weak that cuthbert poured water into glass held to lip now child went on in lighter voice be not going to scold be too weak to be scolded day may scold a deserve not only be minette told name before nothing to dislike a passionate dangerous young woman capable perhaps of good certainly capable of evil however regret to say that arnold dampierre man who be in next bed to know doe not see in same light be very much afraid will be fool enough to marry actually did few day later obtain permission to see have believe seen several time since a be moved out of ward whilst be battling with fever have not seen now cry child have be goose there be harm done ought to be glad to know that old friend be not going to make fool of can still be regarded by a truthful honorable do think must have taken round to room if have be going to make mistress girl cried say anything more cuthbert can not bear be not going to say more madame de millefleurs horse must by time be half frozen coachman be out of patience must be going will come again a soon a can will be very angry if find looking much more like when next come chapter xvii belief that in few hour siege must come to end be so general next morning that cuthbert determined to lose time in seeing cumming a soon a way be open man might take opportunity to move off to other hiding place therefore instead of bringing out canvas a have intended cuthbert decided to call on at once having chartered one of few remaining fiacres at exorbitant rate drove to house where have seen cumming enter went into concierge want information friend said laying five franc piece on table have foreigner lodging here man nodded monsieur jackson be good tenant said pay well for little service how long have be here came just after war be declared have taken apartment for long period have taken for year monsieur think will take permanently hope so for give trouble have never be out late once since came here want to see cuthbert said believe be old acquaintance of mine if ring bell will open keep old woman a servant have just gone out to do shopping always take meal at home be on second floor door to left cuthbert went up rang bell cumming opened door looked at visitor inquiringly remember mr cumming cuthbert said cheerfully be not surprised for have just recovered from very serious wound will come in sit down if mind want to have chat with name be cuthbert hartington man have given violent start when name be mentioned face turned to ashy pallor hesitated for moment then a cuthbert entered closed door behind silently led way into sitting room happened to see in street cuthbert went on pleasantly a seated of course beard have altered bit must not at first recall face soon came back to be happy idea of yours shutting up here when there be chance of extradition warrant being applied for however to morrow next day little difficulty will be at end thought must come have conversation with naturally course that will take will depend good deal on result may mention went on taking revolver from pocket laying on table before thought a well to bring with for just at present feel quite up to personal tussle what do want to talk about man asked doggedly may tell at once placed what little money got where will never be found beyond sending up for year there will be nothing to be gained by denouncing there might be satisfaction though in seeing man who have ruined punished at least there must be to men know that there must be to must depend upon circumstance be ready to believe that in transaction of yours brought bank to ruin honestly believed that company assisted must turn out well that thing must come out right in end suppose be fool a to run risk of ruin penal servitude when have snug place unless have thought so indeed a director be a responsible a for making advance although be of course ignorant of fact that held considerable interest in company there be nothing actually criminal in transaction therefore be only for matter of making off with content of safe that can be actually prosecuted at rate have present intention of interfering in affair can remain here a mr jackson up to end of life for what care if will give information desire look on man face relaxed will give information desire have nothing to conceal of course can obtain conviction against for taking money must save trouble by pleading guilty at once therefore see must harm in way by answering question may choose to ask want to get to bottom of what have along be mystery to be how father came to take share just at moment when bank be so shaky be more than can tell mr hartington have be puzzle to myself be share be transferred to be so money came in useful enough for knew that smash must take place soon that possibly might not be able to lay hand on much ready cash however will tell exactly how came about brander lawyer came to said client mr hartington wanted fifty share own be astounded for brander knew perfectly well that thing be in very bad way by way spoke saw there be something curious about affair a put screw on a much a hinted that if did not follow instruction must blow whole thing into air made objection especially a proposed must transfer of own share transfer be drawn up in regular form brought to duly signed by father noticed that own clerk witnessed signature so supposed be done in office made point must get transfer passed with others without attention of director being called to matter got transfer signed sealed by two of director while there be talk going on about other thing signed without looking at name so far a be concerned be beginning ending of matter oh there be point transfer be ante dated three week of course might have be lying in brander office time be dated on day after previous board meeting so in ordinary course must not be passed until next meeting might very well have remained in brander hand until knew that director be going to meet again have often wondered what brander game be of course thought more of when saw that have bought fairclose be crafty old fox brander have never be able to understand why permitted father to ruin cuthbert remained silent for time explanation only thickens mystery said can no more understand motive than can brander explanation of affair to be that father insisted against advice in buying share a did not believe in rumor to discredit of bank be strong county man a may know thought that when people heard that have taken share must tend to restore confidence in concern now a on contrary brander seems to have taken special pain to prevent transaction being known even by director be clear that explanation be lie for reason of own wished to defeat father intention think must get to put statement have made to on paper to get sworn before public notary at least think be way out here have objection to do a be intention to continue to live here where be now known a resident feel pretty safe except from chance meeting like of yours must rather that must be done somewhere else be reasonable enough cuthbert agreed expect gate will be open in day two will go to england at once try to get to bottom of matter must think prussian will let englishman pas out at once must mind going with a far a calais can get document sworn to in legal form can then come back here must rather go to brussels man said doubt must be best cuthbert agreed might be a well that must not be done at place in france well mr cumming secret be safe with will call on again a soon a find that can get across to brussels will be ready whenever be mr hartington of course quite see what will do with document be perfectly ready to sign see either will want to think matter over at present feel in complete fog can quite understand may tell that brander puzzled good deal last two three month before bank stopped spent two three hour going into affair with knew generally how matter stood have never gone thoroughly into before when have done said ' knew be in very bad way before did not think be a bad a want to see whether smash must not be postponed thing have be bad lately think be improving of affair that have be bolstering up might pull round if have time given did not see much chance of however did not say so in fact wanted to hear what be driving at went on after looking through list of mortgage held 'of course cumming be to interest to hold on here a long a possible may have mine for wishing bank to keep door open for little time must never do for to be going into market to try transfer of mortgage have client in london who must think take of over of course have taken good care that in case did bank lend more than fifty per cent of full value of land mortgage be a safe a if be on consols so if will give fortnight notice when there be anything pressing coming forward think can manage to get twenty thousand pound worth of mortgage taken off hand altogether might repeat operation three four time must get done quietly with fuss in way bank must be kept going for good many month must give time for thing to take turn in case of anything like run taking place think be unlikely must let have fifteen thousand of own in few hour have standing at call must run up to town bring down by next train why must make such offer a puzzled reason for wanting to prop bank up be business of mine there be doubt if must get fifty sixty thousand pound worth of mortgage taken off hand must enable to hold on for time did in fact get one batch of twenty thousand pound worth transferred about month before stopped came in one morning said ' be sorry to tell cumming have heard from people in town have relied on to help about mortgage tell have undertaken financing of contractor for south american railway that therefore be not inclined at present to sink money farther in mortgage so be afraid a far a be concerned thing here must take course ' a know did take course naturally did not believe brander story be evident have when made offer reason for wanting bank to keep door open for time that reason whatever be have ceased to operate when withdrew offer see that part of business have bearing upon affair cuthbert said beyond helping to show brander be playing deep game of own know mr hartington however will think matter over will have opportunity for discussing again on way to brussels almost wish have let matter alone altogether cuthbert said to a drove back to lodging wanted to clear up what seemed mystery find plunged much deeper into fog than ever before only dimly suspected brander of having for reason other permitted father to take share when word from must have dissuaded from doing so now find that whole transaction be carried out in something like secrecy so far from father name being used to prop up bank be almost smuggled into list of shareholder that even director be kept in ignorance of transfer of cumming share to whole business have very ugly look though what motive of secrecy be why brander must be willing to allow if not to assist in father ruin be more than can conceive worst of matter be be mary father yes wish to goodness have left whole business alone cuthbert have given address to cumming to surprise man called on that evening did not expect to see again to day mr hartington said when entered thinking matter over fresh light have struck felt obliged to come round to tell hope be not disturbing have be so worried over confounded business have given up going to friend a have promised a did feel must talk about indifferent matter well mr hartington idea will surprise will seem incredible to almost seems so to yet work in so that ca help thinking be near mark believe that father never signed that transfer at that signature be in fact forgery deuce do cuthbert exclaimed what on earth put idea into head why man idea be absurd if be forgery must have be done by brander what possible motive must have have for such act pretend to say if must see must say be certainty own absence of motive be weak point of idea in other respect thing work out in first place although father be not man of business be singular that must go out of way to take share in bank when must have known that in case of thing going wrong whole property must be involved doubt that idea must have occurred to certainly astonished beyond measure that must have done thing wrote to brander at once hoping for sort of explanation be at time satisfied with that gave be a know because matter on reflection have since seemed so extraordinary came to to try get further information about saw father after supposed transaction mr hartington yes be down there for fortnight did not mention to not word be habit to talk on business matter with never have business matter except about estate generally told if have difficulty about rent discussed improvement thought of making beyond there be never question of money sometimes must say bey balance at bank be rather larger than usual cuthbert if like extra hundred can have ' never did well of course be only negative evidence that made allusion to having purchased share still a be in habit of speaking to about thing might very naturally have said have be investing spare cash in share of bank here ' yes must have thought must have done so think must have abstained from telling because might have thought must have considered rash speculation certainly not cuthbert said warmly must no more have thought of criticising anything chose to do with money than must of flying well at rate may take that there be proof that mr hartington be aware of transaction at time of visit that be aware of up to time of death cuthbert nodded now let suppose that transfer be forgery be committed by brander what course must naturally pursue exactly that followed namely to get placed on register without being noticed by director men be personal friend of father knowing to extent though admit without realizing peril that bank be seriously involved might have refused to register transfer until have privately remonstrated with especially a be vendor even have not done one other of must almost certainly have alluded to subject first time met brander might have intended later on to re transfer share to bogus purchaser at rate if knew father be in bad health must have wanted to keep bank from putting up shutter until after death will remark that did assist in way while father be alive almost immediately after death declined to support bank farther what motive can have be in own can not imagine given motive supposition appears to be perfectly feasible that motive whatever be must have be very strong one admit for in first place be running risk of being detected of forgery in second must have be three hundred pound out of pocket for be amount of check handed to be own check then not father yes said have rent in hand therefore paid out of seemed natural enough how about signature of two clerk may be forgery too possibly knowing father signature may have signed a matter of course without actually seeing affix will admit that be possible seems possible enough cuthbert said what motive must there have be on brander part must never have run risk merely to gratify special fancy may have have for fairclose certainly not mr hartington jeremiah brander have not particle of sentiment in composition of course a be solicitor of company made business to study man pretty closely came to conclusion that be rank humbug that be humbug because paid to be one be quite own idea of doe not help in slightest towards explanation a to why must risk everything when have nothing whatever to gain by feel that difficulty cumming said stroking chin thoughtfully admit that beat altogether by way said suddenly saw in official report that have mortgage of fifteen thousand on estate do mind telling how came about may possibly help have not least idea never heard of existence of mortgage until brander wrote to about at time bought estate gave explanation perfectly satisfied at time mr cumming looked at inquiringly be explanation cuthbert said after pause closed lip altogether on subject in present strange state of affair know that need abstain from mentioning to brander explained that father said that required to close up matter have long be troubling gathered from way put that be folly with woman in early year need not say that respect for father memory prevented from pursuing matter further brander said that have advanced money on mortgage in order that business must be done privately without third person being cognizant of cumming sat thoughtfully for minute without speaking then leapt suddenly to foot put hand on cuthbert shoulder take word for mr hartington that mortgage be just a much bogus affair a transfer one supply motive have be looking for for other failure of bank brought fairclose into market not only did brander purchase for ten fifteen thousand below value at other time gained fifteen thousand by bogus mortgage there be motive for forgery of father name on transfer can not believe cuthbert said slowly brander must never be such scoundrel a besides of course men who wound up affair of bank must look closely into mortgage whether be real whether be forgery brander must equally have obtained money at father death so supposition of motive fails know have claim be made direct to must naturally have got sharp lawyer to investigate must have be inquired into good deal more closely than official liquidator probably took trouble to do mortgage of one know anything until after mortgagor death must always be looked upon with suspicion collateral proof must be required of course may be wrong altogether must be well for to ascertain whether official liquidator did take step to obtain such evidence will certainly do cuthbert said did write to at time be bound to say answer seemed entirely satisfactory straightforward said that mr brander have given proof that did draw check for amount of mortgage on day on be executed although did not show that interest have be specifically paid by check from father there be receipt found among father paper for half yearly payment of interest be seemed settled when brander who collected rent made up account with that seems straightforward enough mr hartington a long a there be ground for suspicion must doubtless pas muster be certainly worth while inquiring into cuthbert sat silent for time after whole of be barest suspicion said only thread of fact being that transfer be kept secret from director of doubt brander will be able to give plausible explanation character stand so high at abchester that question if raised must be scouted a atrocious libel upon supposing that have absolute proof see how must stand if father be not shareholder in bank creditor have of course claim whatever on property a property have in fact be sold proceeds divided long ago who must have to go against be matter for lawyer mr hartington imagine must not have to go back on creditor to bank must simply prove that bank be not in position to give title therefore sale be null void must be argued of course that gave title a suppose signed deed plea must be that signature be obtained from by fraud did not sign deed cuthbert said brander pointed out that a have not received rent profit must be better must stand out of altogether that will must not be proved a otherwise death due must be charged upon therefore remained in hand of executor of whom be one be who gave title gave title must say that a bank have claim on property if transfer be forgery sale must be declared void loss must fall on purchaser must in case of anyone brander have be very hard must in be in strict accordance with justice however be matter for of course will require best legal opinion be for after consideration great difficulty grant see how be to be got over be to prove that father signature to transfer be forgery first step be to ascertain whether attesting witness be actually present a must have be when father signature be affixed will clear up point anyhow cuthbert said will go straight from brussels to england see clerk hear what have to say on matter if be present saw father sign transfer there be end to whole affair other nodded must not mind wagering hundred pound to one find that be not present well that will soon be settled for have heard afternoon that condition of surrender be signed morning to morrow fort be to be given over armistice will commence in case suppose that foreigner will meet with difficulty in obtaining pass to leave at once well be very much obliged to for suggestion have made mr cumming though have confess very little faith indeed that anything will come of just at present seems to must much rather matter have remained a be chapter xviii next morning cuthbert drove to madame michaud be looking better mary said a entered why have got quite pretty color in cheek talk nonsense please be better great deal better be wonder have color have be blushing with shame at own folly ever since be here if never do anything more foolish than will get through life well enough appearance be against jumped at conclusion little too fast let say more about be not looking so well think cuthbert have be little bothered have seen that man cumming asked quickly yes answered in surprise though what must make associate with being bothered know said that be going to see somehow know why have be rather worrying over be interview satisfactory did learn what wanted not altogether said be matter of conjecture mary own that have worried bit indeed be sorry went to at however a be business lady be not good at business suppose talk of something else mary made reply sat looking at while twisted finger nervously before may ask one question cuthbert yes if like promise to answer do think that there be blame attached to father cuthbert be startled have certainly not expected question what on earth must put idea into head mary know replied have always struck a so strange that must not have prevented mr hartington from buying share know much of business have thought great deal about have always seemed strange affair to have worried great deal over since bought house be one reason why hate going there perhaps father be not quite so prudent in matter a might have be mary cuthbert said trying to speak lightly though found difficult to do so with girl earnest eye fixed on even of be not sure now suppose change subject again seems that be to hit on difficult subject morning gate will probably be opened at rate to foreigner in day two be thinking of going home to prepare for taking up vocation a nurse not yet replied there be hurry for will be time before country be settled be sure that have not changed mind again why must thought perhaps might have done so might possibly be inclined towards vocation so scornfully repudiated when suggested before intended to ask yesterday must not have be fair when be so weak shaken girl have glanced at have then flushed hotly know be not sure what mean be sure that know very well mary that mean vocation of taking care of repudiated with scorn in fact refused to entertain seriously at of course there may have be other ground one laid stress on be be lazy purposeless that if ever did take up vocation must be to take care of one must respect say for instant approach to altitude at least may say be no longer idler have worked hard have hope of success see too want more than did then be poor artist not heir to good estate a be fond of sacrificing may not be altogether objection at rate dear think will be able to keep comfortably be not sure must ever have mustered up courage enough to have spoken on subject again have not be for yesterday that gave little hope that really have come to care about little that possibly might be willing to change plan again in favor did not think really loved then said thought be just passing fancy see be not dear month have worked hard be partly from love of art with hope might be really great artist at bottom of along have be thought of determination that in one respect must become worthy of talk like cuthbert know now be headstrong conceited girl thinking be strong when be a weak a water be right when said be not yet woman for have never found that have heart be who be unworthy well be question of worthiness now question be do love a love be sure do cuthbert have thought month that have taken at word that be a friend regarded be sure be not gratitude for what little did for in hospital still more that be not because showed feeling so plainly day before yesterday that be from pity a well a gratitude that speak now then be really little jealous mary know be be shameful of to show so shameful have hated since know that after doing so ought to say thousand time love cuthbert love must rather never marry than feel be out of pity that took must be too hard to bear be standing now be talking nonsense child said tenderly a took hand know love truly surely picture must have told that honestly now did not feel that be so did not know loved then cuthbert there be other thing know that made feel must not be so then that for first time really knew stopped that loved darling drew closer to now gave straightforward answer before insist on a straightforward one now time answer be not no mind said few minute afterwards vocation be definitely fixed at last mary there must be no more changing a if did not know there wo be said saucily then suddenly altering tone went on now cuthbert will surely tell what must not before what did find out be something about father be sure let think before answer said then sat silent for two three minute well said at last think have right to know may be sure that in case must before for sake have done everything in power towards arranging thing amicably with now of course that feeling be vastly stronger for own sake a well a yours must abstain from action against mind at present have only vague suspicion if suspicion turn out true will be evident that father have be pursuing very tortuous policy to put stronger in order to gain possession of fairclose can not say definitely a yet what will do at present incline to opinion that will drop matter altogether not for sake cuthbert said firmly have always felt uneasy about can scarcely say why be afraid be so of course know father better than people in general do have known that be not what seemed to be have always be sorest trouble that have never got on well together have never liked have not be able to respect know that if have done anything absolutely wrong seems terrible must even think thing possible if have be so know will not expose will not talk more about dear cuthbert interrupted be vaguest suspicion so let put aside altogether now just at present be great deal too happy to give a much a thought to unpleasant matter have to attend to business of hour have two year of love of have be deprived to make up for be very very glad cuthbert be not in love with then why because must have started wrong think must ever have come to look up to honor a do now must never have be cured of silly idea might even have thought that have made sort of sacrifice in giving up plan besides then be what people call good match now one can think that be not for love only well at rate mary will have between enough to keep out of workhouse even if turn out absolute failure know wo do hope not at rate one be liable to illness to loss of sight sort of other thing a have between four hundred year can manage very comfortably even if come to end of ardor for work take to idleness again be not afraid of smiled after painting two picture must not stop painting think when anyone can do good work of sort can get tired of especially when work be art only fear be that sha get fair share of time well if see getting jealous mary have mean of reducing to silence by word have indeed will please tell what word be that will just say minette mary color flamed up instantly if do sir if do then stopped something terrible will come of eh well be not fair be quite fair cuthbert will always be painful recollection to hope lesson too will not be painful recollection to laughed think owe minette debt of gratitude now what do say to taking drive mary horse flesh have gone down five hundred per cent in market in last three day be able to get fiacre on quite reasonable term be waiting here still how extravagant cuthbert must have be here nearly hour must say have be here over two hour quarter according to clock dear what will madame michaud think will tell cuthbert care snap what think can do just a like about telling perhaps will be a well a intend to see good deal of in next few day if write home say anything about there be reason can talk over time why will be best to keep to ourselves for time mary nodded that wished thing be quite sufficient for at present moment do want to go out with asked just a like believe that a rule ring have to be purchased at conclusion of arrangement such a have just entered into thought might just a well chose one must much rather not exclaimed besides think for to day must rather sit quiet think over realize how happy be well for to day will have own way mary have be doing good deal more thinking than be good for after to day must go out for good walk regularly see have to get up strength have quite forgotten have anything matter with only wanted rousing dear doctor said a much to know after happiness be best tonic then must be perfectly cured already cuthbert remember must take care of best of tonic wo set one up at once who have have real illness a have have want something more substantial good strong soup roast beef be essential in case remember sir have be nurse mean to continue so till cure be complete will come again to morrow cuthbert of course dear now about ring have observed never wear one have one can lend must measure with piece of thread will get one cuthbert be not without possession although have never worn one looked upon a female vanity added with laugh in day when thought above such thing what little fool must have thought cuthbert next morning when cuthbert came mary have thing on in readiness to go out with after short delay to admire try on ring set out together did not tell yesterday mary cuthbert said after have walked short distance that a soon a arrangement for foreigner to leave town be settled be going to brussels with cumming be going to make affidavit can not do here a if must have occasion to use document must be mean of enabling police to trace here to demand extradition after will go on to england to make inquiry be essential will give particular if wish think will be very much better that will know nothing about matter may turn out to be nothing at may on other hand be extremely important be painful business anyhow in case think will be much best that must know nothing about can trust can not altogether said certainly must rather know nothing about mind cuthbert must do what think be right best without question about if have be wronged must right be sure that in doing so will do a gently kindly a possible will try to do so said at present a told suspicion be very vague rest entirely upon statement cumming have made if suspicion must be verified great wrong have be done that wrong must be righted that can doubt be arranged without publicity scandal reason why wish to say word about engagement be that be known must tie hand terribly render so impossible for to take strong ground must be altogether powerless do entirely a think best cuthbert of course beyond fact that perhaps something wrong may have be done have not idea what can be want to know unless must be told how long be likely to be away do think be fit to travel there be great fatigue in travelling said ca say how long will be not long hope may be sure that will not be longer than can possibly help will miss dreadfully of course if think necessary must go besides said saucily if be in hurry about know will be anxious to get back to finish picture cuthbert really ca have that there be people in sight care if there be laughed do very much whoever heard of such thing must think of did not know that cared what people thought of mary not about thing perhaps there be limit know week later duly provided with pass cuthbert cumming made way in carriage to belgian frontier then went on by train to brussels where on day after arrival cumming drew up signed statement with reference to detail of transference of share to mr hartington swore to content before belgian legal official will stay here for few day said to cuthbert a latter started next morning for england be quite safe for present after long course of horse flesh really can not tear away from decent living until paris be re victualled one can live there in comfort again wish success in search more think of more convinced be that be not far wrong a to manner in brander have got hold of estate cuthbert on arriving in london took up quarter at charing cross hotel on morning after arrival wrote letter to dr edwardes at abchester dear doctor have just returned from paris where have be shut up for last four month care about coming down to abchester at present suppose have not quite got over soreness over matter in general for reason need not enter into want to know if brander clerk who be with when be last there be still with in office if not where be employed know anyone else to write to on subject be sure will not mind taking trouble in matter for answer came back by return of post dear cuthbert be very glad to hear of again have asked brander from time to time about always say that have not heard from for month though letter say nothing beyond fact that be alive be glad to get hope next time write will give full detail about that ere long will make up mind to come down need not say that will be delighted to put up when do come must imagine must not care to go to fairclose now a to question harford elder of two clerk left office here very shortly after went away levison younger be still here put in way of meeting a went to office morning stopped chatted with for minute two asked carelessly how mr harford be whether ever heard from said heard occasionally that be well 'by way where be working now ' asked know went up to firm in town ' 'oh yes be with barrington smile of essex street be getting on very well there believe be head of conveyancing branch wish must drop into a good billet doctor must be very glad of change ' so much for business thing be getting on pretty much same up at old place brander still come up to office for hour so day think care much for county gentleman life fancy mr b be rather disappointed woman fact be there be good deal of feeling in county a to brander connection with bank almost everyone be let in more le know for depositor have only got eight shilling in pound so far suppose will ever get much more there be idea brander ought to have found out what be going on indeed that must have known good deal about at rate what did know must have be ample to have rendered duty to warn father against taking share so short time before smash purchase of fairclose did not improve matter so far from taking father place in county may say without being absolutely cut be much more out of than be before however when come down will give local gossip be late in afternoon when cuthbert received letter at once went to essex street several clerk be writing in office lad came forward to ask business want to speak for moment to mr lad went up to one of desk clerk came forward know whether remember cuthbert said name be hartington remember very well mr hartington though be changed good deal have have sharp illness be getting over now particularly wished to speak to about matter in connection with father affair be staying at charing cross hotel must feel very much obliged if when leave here must come round for few minute with pleasure sir will not get away till seven will do very well cuthbert said must not have troubled have not be important few minute past seven clerk be shown into cuthbert room after asking to take chair cuthbert said a be aware mr harford loss of fairclose estate arose from unfortunate circumstance of father having taken few share in abchester county bank matter have always be puzzle to have be abroad for last eighteen month now having returned be anxious to get to bottom of matter if can transfer of share from cumming manager of bank to father be signed at mr brander office fancy at rate mr levison be attesting witness to father signature have memory of transaction must object to tell what took place remember about transfer mr hartington because when crash came everything connected with be talked over in point of fact did not see mr hartington signature actually attached called at office one day just after have left mr brander called in said 'please witness mr hartington signature ' of course knew very well witnessed did not notice name on body of transfer though of course knew from appearance of document what be mr brander just pointed out where be to sign signed only thing noticed be that a wrote eye fell on top line saw that be dated ten day earlier be that unusual document be often dated at time be drawn up although may not be signed for day later of course be not exactly regular often happens form be filled up one other of party may be away unable to sign happened to notice did not strike in way be often called upon to attest signature in way without seeing written there be nothing unusual in a general rule be called into room when signature have to be witnessed occasionally happened in case where be well known client be perfectly acquainted with signature that did not sign until have left office do remember if such thing ever happened other time in case of father only once think be afterwards signed then a witness to signature to legal document know what nature be be done in same manner directly mr hartington have driven away might have be mortgage deed might have be sir a saw only last page of a there be three four line of writing at top of page followed by signature have idea even of nature of document may ask if have left office at abchester on pleasant term with mr brander partner for of course know that still take interest in firm oh yes be still carried on a brander jackson brander still go down there for hour two day yes left on pleasant term enough be to say left of own free will have for time wished to come up to london hearing through friend in office of vacancy at barrington smile applied be fortunate enough to get cuthbert sat silent for time so far answer have received tallied precisely with cumming theory did not see how must carry inquiry farther here at present clerk who be watching closely be first to speak own mr hartington that in slightest degree understand gist of question can well imagine at present moment be wondering whether must be safe to ask farther will therefore tell at once that one of reason for leaving mr brander employment be that did not like way of doing business did like man general opinion of be that be public spirited kind hearted man can only say that opinion of in office be very different one be hard man frequently when pretending to be most lenient to tenant on estate to be agent to men on whose land held mortgage strained law to utmost limit will not say more than must quote case in put on screw in way be to mind most absolutely unjustifiable have be for very long time trying to get out of office before opportunity came may also say mr hartington have highest respect for father always have kind word when came into office regularly at christmas handed levison check for ten pound for a said trouble business gave tell in order that may feel can safely repose confidence in that advice will be wholly at service if must think fit to give confidence in matter may be at same time must say must be still better if put in hand of respectable firm of solicitor suggest own principal more than others although few men stand higher in profession there be reason against laying matter before firm of solicitor chief of be that hand be tied in peculiar manner that be unable to carry through to natural sequence will very thankfully accept offer will frankly tell nature of suspicion for be nothing more than suspicion may first say that news that father be shareholder in abchester bank astounded for time put down to one of sudden impulse be unaccountable may tell here confidence begin have come across cumming bank manager from have obtained curious particular of transaction particular have excited suspicion wondered why asked question will tell did not see father affix signature to of document one being certainly transfer of of cumming share to other being a believe mortgage that a doubtless heard mr brander held over father estate how must tell two signature be not clever forgery mr harford gave start of surprise god bless sir exclaimed such idea never entered mind can quite understand cuthbert said quietly must admit be possible in case clerk said after pause brander must have be forger surely be not possible fancy know mr brander pretty well must never have dreamt capable of forgery not because have high opinion of honesty because believe to be cautious man besides see what possible interest must have have in ruining father by putting name on to register of shareholder even if have interest in so doing risk of detection must be frightful for not only must matter be known to director a be aware shareholder have right on payment of nominal fee to inspect list of shareholder precaution be taken against cuthbert said just glance through paper have be signed sworn to by cumming in proper form at brussels mr harford ran eye over document then read through carefully word by word be extraordinary statement said gravely do believe mr hartington believe implicitly have man practically at mercy a know there be warrant out for arrest word from must have set police on track led to application for extradition therefore have motive for telling truth be a certain a can be that did so if so there can be question that mr brander have very strong reason indeed for preventing knowledge of transfer having ever be made from being known in case must have come out when bank failed of course must have have pretty accurate knowledge of state of affair yes man be that have equally accurate knowledge of state of father health must account for what cumming say a to offer to bolster up bank for time for retraction of offer within few day after father death why on earth must have run risk merely to ruin have cause of enmity against have sir none so far a knew now come to other document where witnessed signature without having seen signed if signature on transfer be forgery why not that on mortgage if be mortgage if so see motive of transfer smash of bank brought good many estate into market must consequently go cheap not only must get far below value by reason of pretended mortgage must get further drawback of l from price must pay a purchase good heaven mr hartington take breath away have reason for believing that mortgage be bogus one none beyond fact be ignorant of existence be so surprised that not only wrote to brander to official liquidator former said have advanced money at urgent request of father who told wished to settle very long standing claim upon that desired that transaction must be kept absolute secret official liquidator said have gone carefully into question of mortgage that be of three year standing that receipt mr brander have given father for half yearly interest on money have be found among father paper that brander have moreover produced document showing that have sold security to amount have drawn money from banker in town by singled check for l do remember whether such deed be ever drawn up in office certainly be not see that prof nothing for be to be kept secret brander might have have drawn up by solicitor in london see well then deed whatever be that witnessed be that drawn up in office remember levison talked over said be curious that deed between brander mr hartington must not have be given to a usual to be drawn up witnessed signature then a well a of father yes have particular reason for remembering for have sat down hurriedly after have signed dipping pen too deeply in ink made blot be doubt stupid thing to do brander be so unreasonably angry about blew up so roughly that made up mind there then to stand no longer wrote that very evening to friend in present office letter led to getting situation there two three month later that blot may be most important one cuthbert said if occurs on mortgage deed on fairclose be clear that document be not a professes on face executed three year earlier must be so indeed mr harford exclaimed excitedly must be piece of evidence there must be no getting over that fact must account for brander anger seemed to be out of proportion to accident if must show that mortgage deed on brander claimed be really that document witnessed must be up with a to receipt for payment of interest proved nothing a be of course in brander own handwriting be found where put if must find out that brander have knowledge of mr hartington state of health about time transfer be produced must strengthen case seems to that must have got inkling of just before filled up transfer that ante dated week so that must appear to have be signed before learnt about illness can see other reason for ante dating may have be reason cuthbert agreed be one of point for cumming talking over must see motive certainly must wish that if anyone said to ought to have prevented mr hartington buying share when knew that be in precarious state of health to be able to reply when share be bought have not slightest idea of being in anything best of health at rate will see dr edwardes ascertain exactly when did tell brander be certain to be able by turning back to visiting book to ascertain when became aware of father danger be likely to remember whether told brander at once even without mr hartington if can prove question of date of deed have completely on hip still will be very difficult case to carry through especially if can not get cumming to come into court a began by telling can not carry out case to legitimate conclusion do want intervention of lawyer in matter want estate back again if can get rather than matter must be made public must not lift little finger to regain property happens smiled dryly that mr brander reputation be almost a dear to a be to for be going to marry daughter must not feel quite comfortable together see at thought that father be working out sentence of penal servitude be unfortunate combination indeed mr hartington mr harford said seriously though must not repress smile of amusement at unexpected news then seems to sir that brander may in fact snap finger at threat may hold out for must feel certain that must never take step must make matter public fortunately cuthbert replied mr brander be wholly unaware of little fact have mentioned be likely to remain so until matter be finally arranged between be indeed fortunate then understand mr hartington object be to obtain so strong proof of brander share in affair a will place in position to go down to force into satisfactory arrangement with be be clear first step will be to see official liquidator to obtain sight of mortgage suppose know that be head of firm of cox tuke atkinson in coleman street suggest that best plan will be to see to morrow to make appointment with for to inspect mortgage must wish of course to be with when do so think very much will go round there in morning will call at office afterwards let know if have arranged matter time at be to call to inspect mortgage chapter xix cuthbert on calling upon head of great firm of accountant be courteously received by of course remember name mr hartington with reference to abchester bank failure seemed particularly hard case know mr wanklyn who have charge of winding up took particular interest in personally consulted more than once about though can not exactly recall circumstance now what be that say want to examine want to have look at deed of mortgage mr brander who purchased property have upon yes remember now be one of point on mr wanklyn consulted struck at first sight a being rather remarkable transaction went into carefully be proved to be correct to satisfaction be unfortunate that system of registering mortgage be not enforced everywhere a be in london must save great deal of trouble in such case a present be affair of bank quite wound up dear mr hartington why be two year since failure there be property to be realized that can not be forced on market without ruinous loss there be asset will not be available until after death be not asset of bank asset of individual shareholder debtor of bank have to be collected must say will be at least twenty year before last dividend will be divided be sure mr wanklyn will be happy to let see document desire will take to mr wanklyn have room on same floor with principal mr cox took cuthbert introduced to mr hartington want to have look at mortgage brander held on late mr hartington estate remember have several talk about at time took good deal of pain about matter mr hartington wrote to about from paris if recollect replied to in name will leave with to talk over have particular reason for wanting to see deed mr accountant asked when mr cox have left room only ask because suppose document connected with winding up of bank must weigh several ton will take considerable time for clerk to hunt out one in question if have really motive for examining will get looked out for by to morrow will put to great deal of trouble be really anxious to see for special purpose mr have reason to believe there be irregularity in matter be afraid will make little difference to whether be so not mr hartington creditor of bank have be sufferer if there be irregularity in yes suppose so yet assure be not mere matter of sentiment with other question might turn upon then will certainly have ready for by to morrow give until afternoon will four o'clock suit very well will with permission bring with one of attesting witness to father signature be one of mr brander clerk at time mr wanklyn looked up keenly can bring whom like said after pause will put room at disposal of course document can not be taken away certainly not mr wanklyn be very much obliged to for granting request cuthbert called for james harford at hour at have said went out to lunch told of appointment have made have be thinking over mr hartington must recommend to bring cooper with who be cooper be one of greatest expert on handwriting know whether have of father letter in possession yes have several brought over last two have from thinking might be useful well opinion on signature may be valuable though a rule expert differ so absolutely that evidence be always taken with considerable doubt be part of business to look out for erasure alteration be quite possible brander may have removed that blot that have done so well that must detect whether did with knife chemical may be sure that cooper will be able to spot whichever used have very little doubt that suspicion be correct parchment be really pretended mortgage deed if like will go round see cooper at once arrange for to meet in coleman street to morrow at four o'clock thank very much idea of blot being erased have never struck next day cuthbert met james harford mr cooper at door of accountant after being introduced by clerk to expert went up together on giving name in office clerk came across to if will come with gentleman will lead to room be ready for be document that desire to see a soon a be alone sat down at table opened deed how be for size cuthbert asked be about same size be nothing deed be on two three size of parchment last page be thing cuthbert turned to there be four line of writing at top of page below came signature of course must not swear to mr hartington be precisely in accordance with recollection there be three four five line at top certainly not more than five certainly not le than three a see there be blot to signature now mr cooper will be kind enough to compare signature of two letter with same name there mr cooper took letter deed to desk by window examined carefully then took out large magnifying glass from pocket again examined must say be certainly not by same hand said decisively call even good imitation be nothing like a good a must be made by expert in signing other people name tail of j ' in james in two letter run up into ' a will notice pen be taken off letter ' start afresh here on contrary see pen have not be taken off upstroke of j ' run on continuously into ' more naturally must be just other way in two letter writer must be signing name more hurriedly than to formal deed must be much more likely to run letter into other than when making formal signature on parchment looking through glass will observe also that although letter run on together there be slight thickening in upstroke between letter a if writer have paused though without taking pen off to examine exact method of making next letter in copy lying before in surname there be dozen point of difference to begin with whole writing slope le than in other signature in father letter cross of first ' be much lower than usual almost touch top of r ' ' same peculiarity be shown in second 't in letter while on deed 't ' be crossed good deal higher whole word be more cramped flourish at end of 'n be longer le free in capital letter two downstroke be good deal closer together there have be same pause between letter a pointed out in christian name indeed glass show pen be altogether taken off paper between ' o 'n a writer studied that final flourish opinion be that be not only forgery clumsy one must be detected at once by anyone who have original signature before will even go so far a to say that doubt if bank clerk well acquainted with mr hartington signature must pas now for blot cuthbert said there be blot somewhere near signature of mr harford tell where be mr harford must rather not know exact position with aid of magnifying glass expert carefully examined parchment then held up to light blot be in middle of signature involved letter r ' be that right be right mr cooper used blotting paper to at once did not show up very strongly eraser have be used chemical of sort two letter involved in blot have be re written at rate touched up have run little can see quite plainly through lens difference between outline that of other letter be quite distinct by holding parchment so that light fall across can see that although have be rubbed probably by handle of penknife to give gloss difference between gloss rest of surface be distinctly visible see that clerk said must be quite prepared to swear now mr hartington that be document signed three week after signed a witness to transfer be quite good enough think cuthbert said thank mr cooper have quite settled doubt have in mind think will have occasion to ask to go into court over matter must have to do so will of course give due notice after paying expert fee cuthbert went into office handed document over to clerk from whom have received must kindly put where can be got at easily must be wanted again be of highest importance after parting with mr cooper at door cuthbert walked westward with mr harford so far have proved that suspicion be correct sir have not least doubt that father signature to transfer be like forgery may ask what step propose to take next of course if object be not to prevent publicity course must be clear must first apply for warrant for arrest of brander on charge of double forgery when be proved must have to take step to apply to have declared that father name be wrongfully placed among shareholder of bank then endeavor to obtain decree ordering liquidator to reimburse proceeds of sale of estate other money received by from father executor lastly must apply to have sale annulled not only on ground of fraud on part of mr brander because liquidator must not give title of course in step must have to be guided by firm of high standing a particularly wish to avoid publicity suppose first step will be to confront brander with proof of guilt suppose must wish to go down with will be able to do so without difficulty for took holiday last year can therefore get two three day choose to ask for thank mr harford will certainly be desirable must be backed up by presence first thing will do will be to go down to abchester to see dr edwardes want to ascertain from when first knew of father having heart disease that did know before death be aware though at father particular request abstained from informing of fact may also know when brander first became acquainted with will strengthen case much if be in position to show that be after have knowledge that father death might take place at moment that committed fraud a soon a find out will probably be in few hour after arrival there will send telegram be anxious to lose time because want brander to know of arrival in abchester until confront if must find out what did with l proved to liquidator that have drawn out on day mortgage be said to have be executed must have chain of evidence complete see how be to be got at might be got at by advertisement mr hartington l be large sum be to advertise reward of l for information a to whom mr brander paid sum of l on date named in mortgage be quite probable might obtain information might get way unless be absolutely necessary must rather not do so be to advertise before see might have attention drawn to must put on guard can resort to afterwards if refuse to come to term accordingly next day cuthbert went down to abchester travelling by train arrived there after dark taking fly drove to dr edwardes servant took in name doctor at once hurried out into hall why dear cuthbert be glad indeed to see though from letter have hardly hoped to do so for little time come in come in wife will be delighted to see dinner be just on table so have arrived at precisely right moment dear mr hartington be looking terribly ill mr edwardes exclaimed after first greeting be over have be ill be quite convalescent now did rather foolish thing doctor joined corp of franc tireurs raised in school studio german put bullet through body be very near squeak of fortunately be taken to american ambulance be far best in paris pulled through be ten day since be discharged cured of course will be little time before quite get up strength again where be cuthbert then be fortunate indeed went on a cuthbert laid finger on spot odds be twenty to one against did get bullet out went out by doctor be at close quarter in village of champigny when made sortie on st of december so ball went right through almost by miracle a surgeon said without injuring anything vital there be dinner bell doctor will go into surgery wash hand remember way of place see during dinner time talk be entirely of siege when meal be over doctor cuthbert went to former study where doctor lighted cigar cuthbert pipe how be getting on at fairclose cuthbert asked carelessly doctor shrugged shoulder must say heartily regret having changed quarter of course be doing that did so be curious mixture of cleverness silliness weak point be ambition to be in county society to drop town altogether have always be hankering for doubt be partly for sake of girl at least always lay to when used to attend a baby be always complaining to that air of town did not suit however so far from gaining by exchange have lost a leading solicitor here may say leading man in place brander went good deal into county of course wife did belong to county family doubt that helped open door of many good house to well be in county now be not of county there be naturally lot of bad feeling about smash of bank good many men besides be absolutely ruined a everyone banked there there be scarce gentleman in county tradesman in town who be not hit more le severely idea be that brander whose name have be tower of strength to bank have be grossly negligent in allowing affair to get into such state think be wrong for imagine from what heard brander be correct in saying that be not in way in counsel of director confined to strictly legal business such a investigating title drawing up mortgage that be only present at board meeting when be consulted on legal question still there be stemming tide of popular opinion abchester demanded scapegoat cumming have disappeared five director be ruined so fell upon brander must have got over indeed have got over a far a town be concerned purchase of fairclose set county against considered that got for l below value be true enough other estate went into market be sold at equal depreciation be felt somehow that at least ought not to have profited by disaster altogether there be so strong feeling against that county turned back on fairclose by way doctor can tell when how first became aware of state of father loss be so recent that asked few question about when be here though told that have known for little time can give exact date doctor said stretching out hand for book on desk yes here be be rd of march man rode down with news that have found insensible of course went up a hard a horse must carry have recovered consciousness when got there first request be must say nothing about illness when examined found that heart be badly diseased so badly that told frankly have not many week to live that a slightest shock might prove fatal absolutely forbade to ride said hated to be made fuss of urged at least to let write to positively refused saying that must be greatly cut up about that must much rather go on a be only exception made be brander be only soul to whom spoke of called in told directly got back here went that afternoon to fairclose date be conclusive to cuthbert transfer have be ante dated three week two clerk therefore attested on th th of march so brander have lost time in conceiving plan carrying into execution by way doctor said after pause will be glad if will not mention to anyone be here want people to be coming to see must especially rather not see brander never did like man from time be boy think must stand business manner hearty one thought must come down have pleasure of chat with again for day two mean to stir out while be here next morning cuthbert obtained telegraph form from doctor sent man with to post office be directed to harford contained only word come down evening if possible put up at george come round in morning to dr edwardes cuthbert be really glad of day rest felt better for on following morning harford name be brought in just a breakfast be over be man who be brander clerk doctor said met in town have come down to see on little matter of business take into consulting room cuthbert be not likely to have patient come for next half hour settle sir clerk said when heard from cuthbert of date have obtained from doctor though can not swear to day hear that brander come to office about eleven o'clock be sure to be there for hear that jackson have gone away for few day will go at half past if will call here for at time will walk there together will go in by myself will get to call two three minute after so can call into private room if necessary have soon done with doctor said a cuthbert returned to breakfast room have given instruction will call again presently cuthbert replied by way be talking of brander how have two girl turned out mean two younger one met mary in paris during siege ah heard from brander that be shut up there be wondering whether have run against be very savage at what call vagary did get through starvation right oh yes be living in french family like most of middle class have laid in fair stock of provision when became evident place be to be besieged though supply of meat be stinted think there be lack of other thing liked mary doctor said warmly be straightforward sensible girl till got that craze about woman right in mind in other respect be very nice girl differed from rest of a much a chalk from cheese be sister like be like mother vain affected only without cleverness feel bitterly position at fairclose make matter worse by querulous complainings never go into house unless be sent for professionally for peevishness bad temper be intolerable if thing have gone differently have made good marriage might have turned out pleasant girl enough a be be a utterly disagreeable a young woman ever came across then brander must have very bad time of yes from what have seen when have be there thing show off before much fancy brander temper have not improved of late of course in public be same a ever think let loose at home must say that girl be thoroughly afraid of have noticed anyhow that when be at home when call be on best behavior there be not word of unpleasantness discontent from lip however suppose feeling against brander will die out in time think be unjust though say be not quite natural when soreness wear off bit people will begin to think have be rather hard on brander there be surgery bell now must leave to own device at half past eleven james harford called cuthbert at once went out with walked towards mr brander office be couple of hundred yard away how do do mr levison cuthbert asked a entered be mr brander alone yes be alone mr hartington be glad to see again sir with nod cuthbert walked to door of inner office opened went in mr brander started rose from chair with exclamation dear then stopped there be something in expression of cuthbert face checked word on lip need not begin with greeting mr brander cuthbert said coldly have come to tell story be very extraordinary manner of address mr hartington lawyer said in blustering tone though cuthbert noticed color have paled that there be nervous twitching about corner of lip brander have felt there be danger blow have come so suddenly that have not have time to brace to meet without paying attention to word cuthbert seated repeated have come to tell story mr brander there be once man who be solicitor agent friend of certain land owner one day have heard from client doctor that have have attack of heart disease that life be only worth few week purchase also that landowner desired that absolute silence must be observed a to illness then like unjust steward lawyer sat down to think how must best turn honest penny by news be rather tough job must involve forgery among other thing there be good deal of risk by playing bold game might be managed what do mean by lawyer exclaimed furiously calm mr brander there be occasion for to fit cap on to own head yet if think there be anything in story of libellous nature be at liberty to call two clerk in to listen to well sir scheme lawyer be telling about worked out did credit to genius be complicated bold novel happened be solicitor to bank knew bank be hopelessly involved that must last few week longer that failure must involve whole of shareholder in absolute ruin if therefore be to contrive to place client name on register of shareholder point must be achieved accordingly having form by filled one up forging name of client must not have done to have have date of transfer later than seizure of gentleman for manifestly man aware that have few day week to live must have entered on fresh investment therefore ante dated transfer by three week a to witness to forged signature there be difficulty waited for few day till client called upon then after departure called in two clerk who witnessed signature a matter of course irregular proceeding doubtless not altogether uncommon that matter concluded went to bank be above thing important that none of director must be cognizant of client having be put on register a being friend of gentleman might have mentioned matter to when met having manager good deal under thumb from knowledge of state of affair requested to pas transfer with others at next board meeting in way that must be signed a matter of routine without name being noticed suggesting that manager must transfer of share held little business be satisfactorily performed name passed unnoticed on to register there be one thing further to be done in direction namely that bank must not fail before death of client therefore requested manager to let know must there be pressure imminent on bank resource offering to get of mortgage held transferred so to bolster up bank for considerable time a matter of fact did raise l in manner so kept bank going until after client death when withdrew offer there being no longer occasion to keep on leg follow hope mr brander be interesting for ingenuity boldness lawyer made reply a cuthbert spoke ruddy color on cheek have be replaced by ghastly pallor expression of bewilderment have come across face perspiration stood out in big drop on forehead thus far see mr brander cuthbert went on first part of scheme have be ably carried out still remained to reap benefit of ingenuity in first place be certain that estate of client must on failure of bank come into market under such circumstance seeing there must be widespread ruin in county estate must fetch far under value must be advisable to get cheaper still must be managed by production of mortgage upon by invention of plausible tale to account for mortgage having be kept secret even from dead man son a to deed matter be easy enough document must only have to be drawn up by in office in signature of client affixed a before two clerk be called in to witness must be necessary to satisfy official liquidator however who might make inquiry concerning happened that time before lawyer have have occasion to pay over sum of l a must be able to prove by bank book therefore l be sum fixed upon for mortgage date of document be made to coincide with of payment of amount be easy enough to place among dead man paper receipt for half yearly payment of interest be not necessary to show that client have paid sum by check a must of course have be deducted from amount to be handed over by a agent to client scheme worked admirably after death of client bank be allowed to break estate fell into hand of official receiver of bank mortgage be presented proof considered satisfactory lawyer bought estate for l below value with mortgage brought purchase money down from l to sum story be interesting if anyone must doubt be in position to prove up to hilt have sworn statement of bank manager a to particular of interview with injunction that transfer must be passed unnoticed offer to support bank partial fulfilment of offer have opinion of expert that signature be not only forgery exceedingly clumsy one have statement of one of clerk that signature of transfer mortgage be witnessed by fellow clerk in obedience to order of solicitor did not see signature affixed lastly have singular piece of evidence that mortgage be signed not on date purported shortly after seizure of client clerk might have have difficulty in swearing that mortgage be document that signed a signature be written on last sheet of parchment saw nothing of content happened that there be only four line of writing on page there be four on mortgage in hand of official liquidator be not crucial point clerk in making signature dropped blot of ink on parchment now be clear that blot of ink might prove mean o identifying document of proving time at be signed therefore be necesssary that must be erased lawyer proceeded to do so cleverly that unpracticed eye must not detect expert however though not knowing where blot have fallen detected erasure at once noticed that in erasing two of letter of name have be involved have be retouched so a to make same darkness a rest chain of evidence be therefore complete last blow have proved too crushing there be sudden rush of blood to face with gasping sob mr brander fell back in chair insensible cuthbert ran to door opened mr levison employer be taken ill send other clerk to fetch dr edwardes at once will not have started on round yet bring water in here with assistance of clerk cuthbert loosened lawyer necktie collar swept paper off table laid upon folding up great coat placing under head chapter xx apoplexy dr edwardes exclaimed a soon a entered cut sleeve open cuthbert fetch basin sir water added to clerk took lancet from pocket opened vein in arm at first only few drop of dark colored blood issued out dip cloth in cold water wrap round head do lad run down to miggleton confectioner get ice quick be matter of life death at last blood began to flow more freely think will do now doctor said be first seizure have told good many time that be too fond of good living did not take exercise enough what brought about cuthbert have unpleasant interview doctor have ugly truth to tell did not spare then think have better go before come to sens again tell man to bring down mattress pillow blanket wo be fit to be moved to day must make up bed here directly see that be out of immediate danger will send over to fairclose to break news to wife yes will come round let know how be going on a soon a can leave cuthbert nodded put on hat went out james harford be standing few pace from door have have fit cuthbert said a joined thought that be when saw clerk run down street without hat come back with doctor two three minute later will get over doctor think so be sure most sincerely hope will do so must be bad business in way if did not now mr harford think there be occasion to detain here longer may be day before can see again think will be needful for to confirm statement fancy fight be out of came upon too suddenly if have known that be here might have braced up coming down like avalanche upon stunned now mr harford must permit to draw check for ten pound for expense down here when come to own again will be able properly to show gratitude for inestimable service have rendered will take money for expense mr hartington can assure have thought wish for payment of kind for share in business be only too glad to have be able to give little aid towards righting grievous harm have suffered to say nothing of paying off old score against brander hour later dr edwardes returned home be conscious now said to cuthbert be to say vaguely conscious have not let speak word simply told have have fit must remain absolutely quiet suppose have a yet recollection whatever of what preceded be going to write note send up to fairclose must keep close watch over for bit for have taken good deal of blood from must rather did not mention to anyone doctor be present at time have fit a thing may happen ere long that will set people talking if be known that be during interview with that have apoplectic stroke might give rise to unpleasant surmise unpleasant not only to to for be also secret at present be going to marry eldest daughter say so cuthbert well congratulate for be charming girl need not say that can rely upon keeping quiet until choose to have published well doctor a may be day before can see brander again will go back to town evening did not see anyone knew a went to office must rather that must not be known that be down here a be going back there now might ask levison to come round here to see will then tell that brander must wish mentioned that be with at time have that seizure then suppose fact be cuthbert that have be flattering visit be to really came down to see brander be rather afraid doctor have influence in bringing down must forgive time right lad be glad to have have glimpse of again whatever motive be in coming down be ten day before cuthbert received letter from doctor saying that mr brander be now strong enough to see have asked to see several time said have told must not permit to talk however be good deal stronger now be downstairs again a be sure worry other be preying on mind keeping back told morning must send for cuthbert went down by next train be driven over in doctor gig to fairclose be strange to to enter familiar house a visitor looked round library into be shown upon giving name with sort of doubt whether last two year have not be dream have not much time for thought for door opened mr brander entered cuthbert be shocked at appearance looked mere wreck of walked feebly uncertainly face be pale flesh on cheek chin be loose flabby made way to armchair sank wearily into be going to do with cuthbert hartington asked in weak voice doe world know that be forger swindler one know mr brander need anyone know if make restitution a far a be in power matter may rest entirely between with evidence in possession be in position to obtain judge order striking out father name from list of shareholder of bank annulling sale of fairclose of regaining own of securing punishment for offence have committed latter part a have said have desire to press consider that have be punished sufficiently already must insist upon restoration of estate of have be wrongfully deprived will say nothing of what have done nothing whatever will be for to offer reason choose for resigning fairclose to there be one other point must insist on namely that leave abchester illness will be valid excuse for retiring altogether from active share in business of relinquishing part have taken in affair of town a senior partner will doubtless receive sufficient income from business to enable to live in comfort elsewhere will be for own benefit a much a mine for to leave place for will be painful for of to meet can not give up fairclose altogether unburdened lawyer said l of purchase money found other l raised on mortgage of estate although mortgage must be invalidated by proof have power to give mortgagee must of course fight question whole matter must be made public cuthbert be silent for minute not from great doubt hesitation did not wish man to see that be eager to make term for must at once think that be not in position to prove statement have made be large sum said very large sum to lose then there be two year rent that have received must repay harrington lawyer said eagerly have six thousand pound invested in security must realize at once cuthbert be silent again mr brander said at last feel think naturally very sore at cruel wrong have be inflicted upon can not forget that in boyhood be always received with kindness by wife for sake that of daughter be most anxious reputation must remain untarnished be willing to believe that crime be result of sudden impulse that in other respect have be honest man can not forget too that father have great esteem for a to two year rent have received will not claim have done well enough without in fact necessity for working for living have be of great advantage to that alone make le inclined than otherwise might be to press hardly upon will therefore make offer will sign

seemed to there be nothing disgrace ruin staring in face now may hope that thanks to forbearance may enjoy in peace what remains to of life may not believe mr hartington there be reason why must swear to have be miserable man ever since father death be not be afraid of detection seemed to in respect have nothing to fear yet be miserable before be proud of respect in be held in town felt to extent

felt have always liked cuthbert have long ago cherished faint hope that might day take to mary come very suddenly upon mr hartington suppose ought to call cuthbert again now must certainly sound more like old time mr brander only think dear lawyer put in proposed to mary more than two year ago refused suppose never told never said word on subject mr brander said almost indignantly why must have be before stopped before short reign here a master mr brander yes be down at newquay sketching when be staying with friend miss treadwyn mary be at time too much occupied with idea of raising womankind

to live by cuthbert said when be obliged to do instead of painting what like have to paint thing will sell be up hill work none men of real talent can push way up out of crowd will be more happily situated will therefore be able to devote amount of care time to picture must be impossible to man who have daily bread cheese to earn by brush now mr brander will have few more word together then must be off will most likely return to town evening must be for to decide mr brander went on when be alone in study how news will be broken to public be quite ready to be guided entirely by wish in matter sooner better must suggest that must see dr edwardes before go up to town if will tell told in next room that have be discovered that there be flaw in sale of fairclose that a be engaged to marry mary have arrived at amicable agreement under will return at once to fairclose while intend to seek entirely new scene to retire altogether from business there will be very little more needful

waiting for two hour god bless said can not tell how deeply grateful be to for forbearance generosity worry more about mr brander cuthbert said a shook hand have be temporary change good rather than bad have come of believe will put matter out of mind altogether back again cuthbert doctor said when be shown into consulting room be down just now at station to see man off station master said have

will be glad if will retail to patient for public consumption then repeated statement that have arranged with mr brander that must make be tale wish to disseminate doctor said with twinkle of eye when cuthbert concluded be statement doctor have merit of being a far a go true what nature of illegality of sale be be not at liberty to disclose not even to have discovered that beyond question be irregular invalid brander have come to perfectly amicable understanding may tell that to prevent trouble inseparable even from friendly lawsuit assigns property to a mary dowry a sort of recognition of fact that acted without sufficient care in advising father to take share in bank thus necessity for reopening of bygone event will be obviated very sensible way lad will understand of course know enough of jeremiah to be quite sure that must not relinquish fine property if have leg to stand upon however be business of mine have doubt that fact that be going to be father in law have have small influence in bringing about very admirable arrangement of course matter will make good deal of talk thing soon die out county will welcome back too heartily to care how return have be brought about can rely upon action in part of town crier be sure to of patient flutter of excitement news will occasion will do great deal more good than medicine must give of course be going to stay here only to

have for time held aloof in absence of support from without being enormously outnumbered be powerless extreme party be now in absolute possession of city m thiers assembly at versailles have so far be unable to take step to reduce revolted capital such troop a have be hastily collected must not be relied upon to act seemed probable that national guard paris must in short time take offensive obtain possession of versailles in case flame of insurrection must spread at once to great town of france horror of terror might be repeated line of railway to paris be still open for upon communist preparing to cut off communication german still in great force near town pending carrying out of term of treaty of peace threatened to enter paris be step taken vast emigration have taken place among middle class over fifty thousand person have left paris so far communist have abstained from excess from outrage upon peaceable citizen have be otherwise cuthbert must have returned to fetch mary away at once letter to however have assured that there be cause whatever for uneasiness about that everything be going on precisely a have done during siege by german have be anxious that must if possible remain for present in paris for did not wish to return to family have made up mind that if became absolutely necessary for to leave paris must arrange to go straight down to newquay stay there with friend a alighted from carriage at northern railway station found place occupied by national guard there be semblance of discipline among smoked lounged about scowled at few passenger who arrived

back did not expect though monsieur caillard who come here day told that must be sure to be back again in spite of red ah monsieur what horror to think that after paris have gone through monster must have become master of city must have be thousand time better to have have prussian here must have kept order wild beast of montmartre must not have dared even to have murmured have heard how shot down peaceful citizen in rue de la paix have come to stay monsieur for time anyhow taking key of room cuthbert carried up pormanteau then at once came down drove to madame michaud mary be half expecting for in last letter to have told hoped to arrive in paris that evening have be horribly anxious about mary said after first greeting there be occasion for being so replied everything be pefectly quiet here though from what say there may be fighting day if there be will be outside wall will not affect here think there will be much fighting said if troop fraternize with communist there be end of business france will join will have reign of terror over again though will not venture upon excess here in paris for fortunately german be still within gunshot must have hearty approval of europe in marching in here stamping whole thing out if troop on other hand prove faithful feel sure from what saw of belleville battalion that there will be very little fighting outside wall may defend paris for time perhaps bravely for will know be fighting with rope round neck veriest cur will fight when cornered people here be not thinking of leaving hope must not now if wanted commune have put stop to emigration though train still run once twice day go out a empty a come in have got through business asked with shade of anxiety yes dear most satisfactorily everything have be arranged in happiest way

may say that mother girl be delighted with arrangement for somehow have not be received a cordially a have expected in county owing of course to foolish prejudice arising from father connection with bank whose failure hit everyone heavily be in consequence very pleased indeed at prospect of moving away altogether mary forehead be puckered up in little wrinkle of perplexity a listened be glad of course very glad that have got fairclose back said though seems very strange to be that be to know cuthbert be be necessary that must know mary one else will know more father illness doctor injunction that must retire from business altogether settle in place with mild climate be ample reason for leaving fairclose engagement to past connection with place be equally valid reason why must be successor there say mary that there may not have be other cause have operated to bring about result into there be need for to enter be contented dear to know that have turned out in best possible way have recovered fairclose that family be very pleased at prospect of leaving in fact matter end happily for everyone lunched at old place only yesterday went on lightly girl be in full discussion a to where

show to rene be least can do after kindness now go look out of window until easel in good light want first impression to be favorable there after pause curtain be drawn up show have begun spoke lightly there be undertone of anxiety in voice hitherto one mary have seen opinion upon subject of art be of little value believed that work be good yet felt that vague dissatisfaction doubt whether might not have be good deal better that most artist entertain a to own work in school rene opinion be always sought for eagerly there be others who painted better none whose feeling of art be more true whose critical instinct keener rene looked at picture for minute two in silence then turned to cuthbert took one of hand in own dear friend said be a expected always said that have genius real genius be true congratulate dear friend if be not that know english object to be embraced must do so be cold like show of feeling picture will place well in second rank in year two will climb into first will be hung on line go without saying be charming be admirable to think that be still at school might paint life must never turn out two such canvas be sin one who can paint like must expose to be shot at by prussian now do sit down let look at do so rene please remember want not praise honest criticism know have defect want to point out to for while feel that might be improved have own idea so strongly in head can not see where fault be a can remember ca be too severe if possible to do so without entirely having to repaint will try to carry out suggestion rene produced pipe filled lighted then placed chair so that must sit across lean upon back sat for upwards of quarter of hour puffing out cloud of tobacco smoke without speaking mean what say cuthbert said at last very well will take bright one first a to figure have nothing to say effect of light falling on head face be charming dress be perhaps little stiff must have be bettered if relieved by light lace gauze will let that pas be portrait good one be pretty nurse at ambulance be to congratulate there too cuthbert nodded thought so rene went on without moving gaze from picture will congratulate presently background of figure be one weak point of picture too like portrait doubt not be taken from reality for with artistic feeling must never have placed that bare wall behind figure have tried by shadow from vine above to soften have done must in way nothing must really avail want vine to cover that wall must be thrown into deep cool shadow with touch of sunlight here there streaming upon le than now have falling on wall a be now cool gray of dress be not sufficiently thrown up like wall be in shade except where sun touch head face with dark cool green somewhat undefined not too much broken up by form of foliage figure must be thrown forward although still remaining in shade be sure picture must gain at once in strength repose now a to other be almost painfully sombre want relief express grief hopelessness be good also express despair be painful one doe not feel quite sure that young woman be not about to throw into sea now if be to make gleam of watery sunshine break through rift in cloud lighting up small patch of foam breaker must be relief if must arrange so that head must stand up against must add greatly to effect what do think asked breaking off suddenly turning to cuthbert be right in instance rene background be from sketch made at time veranda in one case sea sky rock in other be a saw did not occur to to change yes be thousand time right see now why be discontented with change suggest will be invaluable of course in sea scene light will be ill defined will make way through thin layer of cloud will contrast just a strongly with bright warm sunshine on other picture a doe unbroken darkness there be nothing else that can suggest rene almost wish have not made suggestion picture be so good that be frightened lest must spoil by single touch of brush have fear of rene be sure of dark picture hope can manage other if fail can paint wall in again will begin at once suppose be going round to goude tell that be back will come round evening after dinner ask others to come here to supper at ten thank goodness will have decent feed time directly rene have left cuthbert set to work with ardor felt that rene have hit upon weak spot that have felt yet failed to recognize in four hour sea scape be finished a stepped back into window to look at felt that ray of misty light showing rather on water than on air have effected wonder added immensely to poetry of picture have only just time to change get there in time said with very unlover like tone of regret a hastily threw off painting blouse ate piece of bread left over from breakfast drank glass of wine glanced many time at picture curious muttered how blind men be to own work can detect weak point in man work in moment yet though felt that something be wrong must not see what be in own if succeed a well with other a have done with will be satisfied indeed be quarter of hour late sir mary said holding up finger in reproof a entered idea of keeping waiting very first time after engagement tremble when look forward to future have be painting mary when one be painting one forgets how time fly feel greatly ashamed of be deeply contrite look contrite at cuthbert not one bit well will not press for forgiveness now think when see have be doing will overlook offence what have be doing thought told that have quite finished two picture day came to say good bye before started for brussels rene have be criticising have shown where committed two egregious blunder then think be very impertinent of mary said in tone of vexation be sure nothing must have be nicer than be even when saw be certain there be blunder in see how must be improved wait until see again mary altered one morning other will take three four day steady work be not so sure of success there if like when see promise will restore to former condition now let be off if be not mistaken there be something going on saw several battalion of national guard marching through street there be report that men be to march against versailles may a well see start may turn out to be historic event chapter xxii march against versailles did not take place on first of april although communist have reason to believe that must meet with opposition a on previous night two regiment of army forming advanced guard between versailles paris came in together with battery of artillery declared for commune next morning cuthbert went up at nine o'clock a have arranged to take mary out early to work in afternoon just a reached house heard cannon shot hurry on thing said a met gun have just fired be first in civil war perhaps national guard be starting against versailles at rate will be worth seeing girl be ready in two three minute walked briskly to arc de triomphe a did so must hear not only boom of cannon distant firing of musketry around arch number of people be gathered looking down long broad avenue running from through porte maillot then over bridge of neuilly to column of courbeil heavy firing be going on near bridge upon bank of river away beyond to right that firing mean that france be saved from horror of red revolution mary cuthbert said show that of troop at least be loyal in matter example be everything there be report that charrette zouaves gendarme have be placed at outpost if report be true be wise step indeed for mcmahon to take for must be relied upon now fighting have begun there be hope that troop behind will stand firm why must cuthbert of shot from side be sure to fall among if few be killed wounded rest will get angry idea of fraternizing with men who be firing on will be at end must like to see how crowd of national guard be behaving will go down look cuthbert see there be omnibus going down hill so suppose there can be much danger think that there be danger at present mary ball will hardly come so far if troop open fire with cannon will send shell right up avenue must go by if be not here cuthbert well certainly must be reason why must go with can see woman looking out of window said so will go down together cuthbert have german shell falling near while siege be going on thing went on just a usual come on then dear at rate will be only field gun not heavy siege artillery dare say can get into one of house look out from twelve pounder must scarcely do much harm to one of solid stone building went quietly down road whiz of bullet crash of shell be heard without interruption continued course until arrived near gate near be two battalion of national guard who be in state of utter disorder of men be quietly walking away with rifle slung behind in spite of line of sentry placed across road effort of officer cuthbert questioned of men a came along a to what have happened most contradictory answer be given have be fired upon from fort valerien have be attacked from courbevoie have be betrayed have be sent out without cannon ammunition be short be not going to stay to be shot down be going to hotel de ville to turn out traitor who have sent out without proper supply of ammunition that have ammunition be evident from fact that several musket went off accidentally result of nervousness on part of held wo stay here to risk being shot by cowardly fool cuthbert said let get into one of house went back short distance cuthbert spoke to man standing at door lady be english said must allow to go up stand at one of window to see what be going on request be at once acceded to be soon posted at window on fifth floor look at cuthbert said in disgust be hero who clamored to go out destroy german scene below be certainly singular bugle drum sounded assembly beat rappel alternately men paid not slightest attention to call continued to slink away until drummer bugler remained alone of two battalion fifty men posted at loop hole of crenelated wall by gate remained rest have melted away from balcony at window fine view be obtained across country heavy musket fire be still maintained along river side there be continuous roll of musketry at courbevoie where a one of national guard have told battalion occupied barrack there have be cut off by advance of troop artillery musketry be at work there elsewhere there be artillery fire close to bridge at neuilly struggle be maintained for time presently column of troop be seen advancing against bridge a did so firing there ceased at once be soon evident that troop have gained position number of national guard soon came trooping in at gate very few remained there rest without waiting for order hurried on into paris dark group now appeared on road leading up to courbeil there be white puff of smoke shell exploded hundred yard on other side of gate steady fire be now kept up by two gun greater part of shell exploded beyond outer work several came up avenue two of striking house others exploding in roadway time when whistle of shell be heard approaching cuthbert drew mary back from balcony into room fancy said troop have idea that there be mass of communist

conflict cuthbert pointed out to mary great amusement precaution that of be taking to ensure personal safety one woman have drawn down venetian blind be looking between be peering out with pillow held over head few national guard who remained at post be men of courage for showed sign of flinching even when shell exploded within few yard of position occupied presently there be sound of wheel two four pounder gun be brought up placed one on side of gate to sweep approach between one two o'clock several battalion of national guard came leisurely up piled arm sat down under shelter of wall be evident have idea of making sortie have be brought up to defend gate in case be attacked soon after arrival party have remained near river returned be clear that at least portion of troop have proved faithless for with be forty fifty soldier who have come over during fight be disarmed then escorted into town where a cuthbert afterwards learned be received with enthusiasm by mob be evident that there be idea of attempt being made to recapture bridge at present mary know how feel be getting desperately hungry so think may a well be going back must like to see what be going on in city will come with have doubt will be able to get voiture up at arch can have lunch there mary be a anxious to see what be going on a be in quarter of hour alighted in rue rivoli a yet population have heard

home in fiacre have be quite alarmed about dear where have be madame michaud said a entered have be seeing fighting madame red have be beaten have heard sort of story about most of say that versailles people got worst of then story be not true mary said most of national guard must fight at regiment broke away went into paris without firing shot troop have taken bridge of neuilly good god be thanked madame michaud said piously husband be afraid troop must not fight that be going to have terrible time there be hope now that commune will be put down hope madame cuthbert said be sure scum of paris must not fight if troop must do so have too much regard for worthless skin may be time before mcmahon can get force together sufficient to take paris sooner later will do so though will be serious business with fort in hand of communist if have handed over one two of fort to gendarme kept company two of sailor there there must have be line by troop must have approached town a be will have to bring up siege gun silence issy vanves before much can be done hour later monsieur michaud arrived too have be in city be in ignorance of what have taken place during morning account for said be ordered to be under arm at eight o'clock evening will not go wife exclaimed anxiously must go dear have desire to be shot think there be much more fear of being shot if answer to call of name than there will be if do in first place may not go out beyond wall in second place if there be may see chance of running away for mind though hope must have fought a bravely a others if german have come feel called upon to fight against frenchman in cause hate will find in good company anyhow monsieur michaud cuthbert laughed have seen nineteen hundred fifty men out of two thousand march off without firing shot to day so much better monsieur four out of five of national guard hate a much a do will dine with to day monsieur then can go down together afterwards cuthbert accepted invitation willingly yes can come down with mary went on in answer to look of appeal from will bring back safely madame michaud sight will be well worth seeing before go will have look round see if can get bed for night be long way out from lodging must like to be out here by daylight for if mean to march on versailles be sure to start a soon a be light have spare room madame michaud said be quite at disposal will be doing kindness if will accept for when husband be away always feel nervous without man in house a be ten minute walk from here to arc de triomphe will be on spot indeed from roof of house can obtain view over country great change have taken place in appearance of paris when went down in evening town be in state of wildest excitement everywhere drum be beating trumpet sounding everywhere national guard mustering street be crowded most violent language uttered by lower class threat of kind poured out against 'butchers of versailles on wall be red placard issued by commune headed men of paris butcher of versailles be slaughtering brother a rule brother decline to be slaughtered mary cuthbert said a read proclamation see if troop fire be butcher if national guard fire be hero considering paris have ten armed men to one mcmahon have got even if troop must be relied upon parisian must indeed be of mild temper if submit to be butchered monsieur michaud now left to take place in rank of battalion be not long before national guard be in motion for hour column of troop moved up champ elysees rue rivoli be actually choked with men mob shouted vive la commune until be hoarse battalion from working quarter lustily sang chorus of marseillaise at ten o'clock cuthbert mary arrived at arc de triomphe on way back along whole line from tuileries national guard be bivouacked arm be piled down centre of road many of men have already wrapped in blanket lain down to sleep with head on knapsack wine shop in neighborhood be crowded be evident that many of men have determined to keep up night madame michaud have coffee ready for on return after drinking went to room mary being completely tired out with fatigue excitement of day at five o'clock cuthbert be up have told night before that must return for at eight on arriving at arc de triomphe found national guard pouring down avenue to fort maillot three heavy column be marching along road converged at bridge of neuilly here cuthbert expected desperate struggle few shot only be fired then small body of troop covered by party of skirmisher retired up hill then turning off made way towards fort valerien force be evidently insufficient to hold bridge against mass of revolutionist advancing against real resistance to force of commune must commence further back crossing bridge national guard spread out to right left mounted hill a did so eighteen pounder gun have be day before mounted on fort opened fire on bridge for time forward movement ceased regiment on way down towards gate be halted cuthbert chatted for time with one of officer learnt from that be not real point of attack be from other side of river that great stroke against versaillaise will be struck said hundred fifty thousand national guard advanced on side will cross height of meudon move straight to versailles have twenty five thousand here will advance a soon a others have attacked meudon in hour forward movement have again commenced heavy column poured across bridge firing from valerien having now ceased cuthbert watched black mass advancing up slope towards courbeil be not until reached top of slope that valerien suddenly opened fire puff after puff of white smoke darted out from crest in quick succession shell bursting in around heavy column in moment character changed have be literally cut in half by iron shower in front of point where storm have struck broke off fled to village of nanterre on left where took shelter among house other portion of column broke up a suddenly became at once disorganized mob who at top of speed rushed down to slope again to bridge at neuilly across poured in wild confusion made halt until have passed fort maillot there officer attempted to rally in vain many have thrown musket away in flight rest slung behind continued way to paris vowing that have be betrayed that must have vengeance on commune seeing that there be more probability of fighting on side cuthbert returned to madame michaud madame be on roof margot said a entered everyone be up there said be to give breakfast when came in coffee be ready have omelette prepared will be cooked in three minute madame said that must be sure to be hungry after being out so long in quarter of hour ascended to roof resident on ground floor have astronomical telescope with be in habit of reconnoitring sky from garden have taken up to roof where twenty person be gathered magnificent view be obtained here of circle of hill from valerien round by meudon whole of left bank of river needed glance to see that army of commune have made little progress although fighting began soon after two o'clock in morning be now nearly mid day height of meudon be still in hand of troop from among tree by chateau white puff of smoke shot out many of shell bursting in around fort of issy replied briskly gun of vanves joined in combat fire being directed towards plateau of chatillon be held by troop round issy force of national guard be assembled main body be in deep valley between fort meudon on slope nearly up to chateau rattle of musketry here be continuous light smoke drifting up through tree after time be evident that line of musketry fire be lower down hill descending showing that troop be pressing communist backwards presently one of battery near chateau shifted position took ground distance down hill battery near end of viaduct by chateau opened heavy fire on fort look through telescope showed that communist be crouching behind wall house occasionally when fire of gun be silent few of must get up advance into open only to scamper back into shelter a soon a reopened fire that settle monsieur cuthbert said to owner of telescope after taking long look through hitherto communist have believed that versailles be at mercy have to march out to capture have failed failure mean final defeat say that prisoner of war be arriving in versailles at rate of two three thousand day in fortnight thiers will have force sufficient to take offensive by time will doubtless have siege gun in position say that paris may not hold out for considerable time must fall in long run fear that who have got anything to lose will have very bad time of fear so monsieur a wretch become more desperate will proceed to greater length see have already insisted that national guard opinion will join in defence of city have declared confiscation of good of member of guard who will leave town hear decree be likely to be published to morrow next day confiscating church property already have taken possession of church turned into club if do such thing now there be saying to what length may go a see chance of success diminishing daily although artillery fire be maintained for time longer be by three o'clock evident that battle be virtually over party therefore descended from roof cuthbert strolled back to centre of paris street that evening presented very strong contrast to scene of excitement have reigned twenty four hour before there be shouting singing marching of great body of troop air of gloom pervaded lower class while bourgeois remained for most part in house afraid that deep satisfaction event of day have caused might betray in face for next few day cuthbert worked steadily going up late in afternoon to passy commune have on day after failure against versailles issued decree that unmarried men from seventeen to thirty five must join rank house to house visitation be ordered to see that none escaped operation of decree one of party visited cuthbert consisted of man with red sash two others in uniform of national guard a soon a be satisfied of cuthbert nationality left having be much more civil than have expected thought advisable however to go at once to hotel de ville where on producing passport be furnished with document bearing seal of commune certifying that being british subject cuthbert hartington be exempt from service be allowed to pas anywhere without molestation equal good luck did not attend other student of whom be to intense indignation enrolled upon list of national guard of quarter cuthbert have difficulty in retaining perfectly serious countenance a rene pierre two three others came in to tell have occurred there be getting away from rene said if have thought that must come to of course must have left paris directly affair began now be impossible ticket be issued by railway except to old men woman child one be allowed to pas through gate without permit from commune even if one must manage to get on to wall drop down by rope one might be taken shot by communist troop outside if one got through by sentry of army of versailles what must advise to do cuthbert be afraid ca give advice rene be certainly horribly unpleasant being obliged to fight in cause detest think there will be very great deal of fighting till assault be made on city when begin must say communist will be too busy to look for absentee from rank will be in double danger then pierre leroux put in run risk of being shot by communist for not fighting at barricade if escape that have chance of being shot by versaillais a communist be horrible position to be placed in well must say pierre keep eye open escape if possibly can before assault take place must think might manage to get out a woman of course must have to sacrifice mustache if did that borrowed paper of young woman other might manage doubt must be awkward if be found out might be worth trying if can not leave before assault take place mean to go to one of english hotel here meurice dover establish there during such fighting a there may be in street there will be very few question asked one might be shot before one must explain one be foreigner hotel be not likely to be disturbed seriously must say that best thing can all do when fighting begin in street be to keep out of way until battalion be engaged then burn anything in way of uniform get rid of rifle somehow gather at goude must vouch for a being pupil a being wholly opposed to commune name must be sufficiently well known if not to first officer who may arrive at least to many officer for testimony to be accepted still do think that best plan of will be to get out of place when get chance of student did succeed in getting out pierre two others made way down through drain came out on river at night swam across one of youngest went out by train dressed a woman rest be forced to don uniform take place in rank of national guard question of leaving paris be frequently discussed by cuthbert mary brander finally determined to stay be morally certain that troop must enter paris at port maillot at gate of pont du jour at rate somewhere on side of paris once inside wall must meet with resistance there fighting must only commence when entered city be to large extent inhabited by well to do people be not here that search for communist must begin troop must here be greeted a benefactor think there be smallest risk mary if there be must say at once that have better be off must escort down to cornwall a there seems to danger must say let stick to original plan own must like to see end of might amuse at present by making good sized union jack can hang out of window when troop enter when see time approaching intend to make arrangement with michauds to establish here so a to undertake task of explaining if necessary think explanation will be asked be likely enough that a soon a troop enter will establish in quarter before making further advance will know that have hard fighting before until have overcome opposition will have plenty to think about will have time to spare in making domiciliary visit chapter xxiii arnold dampierre have moved from lodging in quartier latin at outbreak of insurrection have taken up abode in one of street leading up to montmartre there be in close connection with many of leader of commune speech regular attendance at meeting connection with dufaure who be president of one of revolutionary committee with daughter fact that be american have rendered one of most conspicuous character in quarter must have be named one of delegate of council of commune refused honor preferring to remain a said representative of great republic across sea more than once cuthbert met a rode about only once did speak cuthbert be crossing square in front of hotel de ville when saw arnold dampierre latter be on foot did not notice cuthbert until be within few yard of a eye fell on hesitated then walked on a if about to pas without speaking cuthbert however held out hand why dampierre said be not going to cut be there have be quarrel between last time met be when be lying next to other in ambulance dampierre took offered hand no said with nervous quickness quarrel at hartington see have gone different way be to say have gone out of way thought that must not care to continue acquaintance there be such feeling on part can assure there need be question between a to part have taken be sorry be concern of mine after living in same house for year so having faced death side by side at champigny difference of political opinion must interfere with friendship besides know added with laugh may want to get to exert influence on behalf event be thickening in troubled time be always well to have friend at court if come to be treated a suspect will refer to for character a peaceable well intentioned student of art there be fear of anything of sort hartington must by possibility get into trouble have to send to however state of thing will not last long people be fairly roused now will soon sweep butcher of versailles before reign of perfect freedom equality will be established world will witness spectacle of free country purging from tyranny of capital abuse of power under have so long groaned have much to do must be off with hasty shake of hand hurried away again cuthbert looked after poor fellow be fast qualifying for mad house said have changed sadly cheek be hollow eye unnaturally brilliant patch of color on cheek be sign of fever rather than of health that woman minette be responsible for ruin must end badly one way other best thing must happen to must be to fall in one of sortie have made so conspicuous that be almost certain to be shot when troop take paris unless indeed becomes actual lunatic before wound up a be by excitement enthusiasm will never bring to sneak off in disguise a most of men who have stirred up business will do time passed quickly enough in paris event followed other rapidly there be scarce day without fighting more le serious gradually troop wrested position after position from communist not without heavy fighting army at versailles have swelled so rapidly by arrival of prisoner from germany even in paris where journal of commune endeavored to keep up spirit of defender by wholesale lying a to result of fighting outside wall be known that at least hundred thousand men be now gathered at versailles there be doubt of one thing cuthbert said a standing with mary on trocadero one day watched duel when gun at meudon be replying vigorously to fire of fort must modify first opinion a to courage of communist have learnt to fight allowing for exaggeration bombast of proclamation now stand admirably have more than once retaken position from have be driven although very little be said about loss be talking yesterday to surgeon in one of hospital tell that already must be a great a throughout whole of first siege be still occasionally subject to panic for instance there be bad one other night when troop took chateau of becon again at clamart fancy be owing to mistake communist made in forcing men who be altogether opposed to into rank men naturally bolt directly be attacked that cause panic among others who must have fought have rest stood still altogether be fighting infinitely better than expected at clamart fought really well in open for first time before own that only feeling towards battalion of beetle browed ruffian from faubourg be disgust now be beginning to feel respect for make prospect here darker have doubt that a soon a mcmahon have got battery into position will open fire a will silence fort speedily make breach in wall real fighting wo begin till enter barricade be at first little more than breastwork have grown grown until have become formidable fortification if stoutly defended with house occupied by desperate men will be terrible work carrying by assault however there be few place where main defence can not be turned for be impossible to fortify street however if communist fight a desperately a may now expect in despair work of clearing whole city must occupy many day will be very unpleasant in passy when battery on height open fire must indeed if be to direct fire in direction for must wipe passy out altogether in few hour everything show that thiers be anxious to spare paris a much a possible not shot have be fired at random scarcely house have be injured fire only at fort at battery on side when begin in earnest have doubt will be same must be mere waste of shot to fire up there if versailles people be to do unnecessary damage must bring into odium throughout france for must be said that be worse than prussian on th of april at o'clock in morning long silence of besieger battery ended cuthbert be taking coffee when heard sound like rumble of heavy wagon ran to window there be quiet in street below for everyone have stopped abruptly to listen to roar from window head appeared completing dressing hastily went out took first fiacre met drove to passy rumble have deepened into heavy roar air quivered with vibration shriek of shell mingled with deep booming of gun when entered madame michaud husband mary be standing at open window have just come down from top of house mary said be grand sight from there will come up cuthbert certainly mary see be right there seem to be shell coming way be desperately alarmed be not madame when began be enough to alarm one madame michaud said indignantly window be broken be enough to startle one even without firing be perfectly natural madame cuthbert agreed first shock be always trying even soldier with seasoned nerve might be excused for starting when din a commenced cuthbert mary went up at once to roof where old gentleman from below have already set up telescope did not need however to observe what be going on along almost whole crest of eminence round south west heavy gun be playing upon defence from height of chatillon puff of white smoke came thick fast battery at chateau of meudon be hard at work a be of brimborien breteuil mount valerien be joining in fray while battery on plateau of villejuif be firing at fort of montrouge bicetre without exception greater part of fire be concentrated upon fort of issy vanves while attention be also being paid to battery at point de jour porte maillot communist replied to fire steadily although issy came in for by far largest share of attention of assailant fired only gun now then showing that be still tenanted by defender be difficult indeed to see how often replied for shell burst so frequently on that be difficult to distinguish between flash of gun through telescope must be seen how terrible be effect of fire already fort have lost regularity of shape earth with have be thickly covered be pitted with hole presently there be outburst of firing comparatively close at hand be battery on trocadero one of party exclaimed think that must be firing at valerien saw several spurt of smoke close to hope not cuthbert said for if valerien answer position here will not be so pleasant for hour valerien disregarded shell bursting in around continuing fire against issy be good shot astronomer said a sat with eye at telescope watching fort shell burst right on one of embrasure minute two later came rushing sound rising rapidly to scream instinctively most of on roof ducked head valerien be waking up cuthbert said here come for hour valerien poured fire upon battery on trocadero with so accurate aim at end of time be reduced to silence while fire be going on on roof went below for although precision with artilleryman fired be so excellent that there be slight danger trial to nerve from rush of heavy shell be so great that be glad to leave roof to take place at window below danger be le for have shell struck house exploded must have wrecked whole building there be sense of safety in drawing back behind shelter of wall a missile be heard approaching to disappointment of middle class who still remained in paris bombardment be only partly renewed on following day then thing went on a before be supposed that effect great a have be on fort most exposed to have not come up to expectation of besieger telescope showed that troop be hard at work erecting great battery on montretout eminence near st cloud on night of th of may whole of battery opened fire again troop made desperate effort to cut force in issy from communication with town with vanves national guard poured out from city for hour fighting be very severe troop at last succeeding in object a soon a have done so gun on enciente of vanves opened so tremendous fire upon that be forced to abandon position have won at railway station at clamart there be also heavy fighting national guard attacked suddenly in such overwhelming number after short desperate resistance garrison of station be forced to retire reinforcement be soon brought up troop again advanced insurgent be driven out loss during night be put down a thousand on th montretout be armed with heavy gun opened fire rest of battery joined in for couple of hour din be terrific next day issy be captured by troop attacked village at daybreak advancing slowly capturing house by house occupied church marketplace at noon just a have done so battalion of insurgent be seen advancing to reinforce garrison of fort be allowed to advance to within fifty yard when heavy volley be poured into halted for moment colonel rallied be however killed by volley when men at once broke threw away arm ran back to city gate rest of village be carried with rush when troop reached gate of fort be found open be at once occupied whole of defender having fled a saw that steady advance of troop must if remained cut off from escape fall of fort be so unexpected that battery on height continued to fire upon for time after troop have gained possession capture of issy created immense effect in paris general rossel resigned command of insurgent army have be colonel of engineer be officer of merit political opinion have proved too much for loyalty to country profession doubtless have deemed that if a at first seemed probable insurrection must be successful revolution triumph must become napoleon now saw ruin of hope have forfeited position life in proclamation issued announcing resignation poured out bitterness of disappointment told commune opinion of namely that be utterly incapable without idea of principle of liberty of order filled only with jealousy hatred of other so scathing be indictment that be at once arrested managed to make escape fire from battery on assailant right be now concentrated upon vanves be evacuated by insurgent two day later fall of fort left position at point de jour unsupported indeed gun remounted at issy took defender in flank rendered impossible for to work gun in despair commune now threw off mask of comparative moderation proceeded to imitate to fullest extent government of jacobin decree be passed for establishment of court to arrest try execute suspected person without delay under false pretence that prisoner taken by troop have be executed murder of archbishop of paris other priest who have be taken thrown into prison a hostage be decided upon upon fall of issy being known cuthbert considered end to be so near that must be better for to take up abode permanently at madame michaud have be pressing to do so for time a husband thought that presence of english gentleman there must conduce to safety when troop entered paris have indeed spent most of time there for last three week have always returned to lodging at night therefore packed up picture principal belonging drove with to passy two day later met arnold dampierre be glad to have met latter said have be to old place found that have left minette be to be married to morrow civil marriage of course must be very glad if will be present a witness there be saying who will be alive at end of week must like marriage to be witnessed by will do so with pleasure arnold though seems scarcely time for marrying be true if escape must escape together if be killed wish to go over to america live a mistress of place there therefore will place in hand official copy of register of marriage where will be able to find after be over cuthbert gave address at madame michaud suppose will stay there long after be finished here said will know where to forward letter to must not be better arnold for to throw up at once return to old lodging where may perhaps remain quietly until search for leader of affair relaxes arnold shook head gloomily must go through to end cause be noble one be not because leader be base at same time wholly incapable men must desert besides even if must do so must not no be not to be thought of marriage will take place at mairie of montmartre at eleven o'clock tomorrow will be there arnold cuthbert walked slowly back to passy be shocked at dismal shipwreck of what have seemed bright pleasant future of man of whom have seen so much for upwards of year dampierre life have seemed to offer fairer chance of happiness prosperity than of other of student at monsieur goude have estate amply sufficient to live upon in comfort even affluence have artistic taste must save from becoming like many southern planter mere lounger through life fatal love for minette have caused to throw into insurrection to take so prominent part in that chance of life being spared did fall into hand of troop be small indeed even did succeed in escaping with minette chance of happiness in future seemed to cuthbert to be faint indeed with passionate impulse must speedily weary of tranquil easy life on southern plantation with to weary be to seek change however change might come about must bring happiness to husband be going to see rival married to morrow said to mary what model call rival cuthbert make ashamed of even to think must have suspected of caring for woman saw on horseback other day then will call supposed rival mary yes be going to be married to arnold dampierre to morrow what time to choose for said with shudder in few day paris will be deluged with blood for commune boast that street be mined need not believe mary doubt principal street have be mined commune have made boast of fact that may be sure french general will avoid great thoroughfare a much a possible will turn barricade by advancing along narrow street lane besides be one thing to dig mine charge quite thing to explode at right moment in midst of desperate fight however agree with that be dismal business arnold explained to that did because minette might have to fly together that if fell might inherit property did not seem to foresee that too might fall be to mind a likely a own death for a in former fight here female communist will be sure to take place in barricade with men if so will guarantee minette will be one of foremost to do so production of female fiend seem to be one of peculiarity of french revolution a told be going to wedding in order to sign a witness must hardly refuse what regard a poor fellow last request though will be most distasteful business last time spoke to said struck that be going put of mind yes thought so think so still manner be changed to day before have that restless nervous excitable look be indication of one phase of insanity to day there be gloomy brooding sort of look be equally characteristic of form of madness at same time might be well explained by circumstance have not same absolute conviction in sanity have before suppose will not care to honor wedding ceremony by presence cuthbert not for anything can not think must like to be present at ghastly ceremony thought church be shut up so be marriage be to be civil one will merely declare man wife in presence of official will enter a such in register affair will be over must not say so to arnold have serious doubt whether american authority must recognize ceremony a legal one did ever appear there to claim possession of course if get away also can be put right by marriage when get out can stop for few week on way through england be married again there be most horrid cuthbert well if see in light mary wo press to go to morrow will give up passing idea may have have that might embrace opportunity be married at same time be lucky that did not make such proposition to in earnest cuthbert mary laughed for if have must assuredly have have nothing more to do with oh yes must mary must not have helped must in very short time have made excuse for on ground of natural anxiety to waste further time before securing happiness one must expect happiness after being married in sort of way sir when quite long time on do get married will be in church in proper decent manner know might not be persuaded to make sacrifice do without bridesmaid even wedding breakfast everything else must be strictly en regle next morning at appointed hour cuthbert went up to montmartre several men whose red scarf showed that belonged to government of commune be standing outside looked with surprise at cuthbert a strolled quietly up be here monsieur to be witness to marriage of friend arnold dampierre manner of men instantly changed one said be here also to witness marriage of noble american friend to daughter of colleague dufaure dampierre be within dufaure will be here with daughter in few minute cuthbert passed through entered office where commissary of commune be sitting at table arnold be speaking to turned a cuthbert entered thank hartington be not exactly what have pictured must be scene at wedding be not fault that must be managed way intend to have ceremony repeated if get safely to england after be what call gretna green marriage yes a say can be married again arnold must certainly be best in respect might save litigation day here come think there be stir at door minette father entered followed by communist with red scarf arnold also wore one of insignia minette be in dress a vivandiere held out hand frankly to cuthbert be glad to see here monsieur said be good that arnold must have one of own people a witness never liked very much know make difference now please to take place officer said cuthbert stepped back pace arnold took place in front of table with minette by side father standing close to there be nothing arnold dampierre official asked in law of country must prevent making binding marriage nothing when man be of age in america be free to contract marriage chooses without obtaining consent of relation whatever official made note of martin dufaure do give sanction consent to marriage of daughter with arnold dampierre american citizen do communist said take hand arnold dampierre do take woman a wife a word left lip there be pistol shot with low cry arnold fell across table cuthbert have turned at report a man who have fired lowered pistol to repeat shot sprang forward struck with weight strength on temple man fell like log pistol exploding a did so with cry like of wounded animal minette have turned around snatched dagger from girdle a man fell sprang to side leant over with uplifted knife cuthbert caught wrist a be about to strike soil hand with blood minette said quietly a turned fiercely upon arnold must not like leave fellow to justice give attention to dropping knife ran forward to table again two three of arnold colleague be already leaning over believing that lover be dead minette must have thrown on body restrained be not dead minette wound be not likely to be fatal be only hit in shoulder be lying be lying be dead minette cried struggling to free from restraining arm be a say minette father said leaning over arnold here be bullet hole in coat be same shoulder be broken before will recover child calm order minette ceased to struggle burst into passion of tear have better send man to fetch surgeon at once cuthbert said to one of communist have doubt arnold have fainted from shock coming a did at moment then looked at wound 't be not so serious a last said by long way be higher have doubt broken collar bone be not very serious matter think have better lay down on bench put coat under head pour few drop of spirit between lip sprinkle face with cold water cuthbert then went across room several of communist be standing round fallen man be stunned think cuthbert said be dead one of men replied blow be enough to kill ox be best thing for for assuredly must have be hung before for attempt upon life of good american colleague cuthbert stooped down felt pulse of fallen man be afraid be dead said certainly have intention of killing thought of nothing preventing repeating shot be on point of doing doe not matter in least one of men said be one whether be shot by bullet of versaillais hung killed by blow of englishman fist monsieur le commissaire will draw up proces verbal of affair commissary did not answer in confusion one noticed that have not risen from chair sat leaning back diable what be communist went on believe commissary be dead hurried round to back of table be a said shot fired a man fell have struck in heart have died without cry movement morbleau of communist exclaimed came here to witness comedy have turned into tragedy exclamation from minette who be kneeling by arnold called cuthbert attention to american have opened eye what have happened minette asked a laid head down on breast burst into fit of passionate sobbing be out of luck arnold cuthbert said cheerfully villain have fired at have got off time more lightly than last think be nothing more than broken collar bone be not very serious business know be quiet for little time will have surgeon here directly of course minette be terribly upset for thought for moment that be killed arnold lay still stroking minette head gently with right hand gradually sob ceased cuthbert then left to two body have by time be carried into room one of delegate took seat at table drew out formal report of occurrence have taken place be signed by others present by cuthbert surgeon presently arriving confirmed cuthbert view that collar bone have be broken proceeded to bandage a soon a be done arnold stood up unsteadily citizen rigaud presume that a high official of commune can replace citizen who have fallen complete ceremony

benefit cuthbert returned to passy chapter xxiv mary be greatly shocked upon hearing tragic circumstance have occurred at wedding who be man fired cuthbert name be jean diantre heard from dufaure that have be lover of minette said have never given encouragement acknowledged that believed might have taken at last if have not met dampierre said that have be uneasy for time for man have become so moody savage that have feared ill must come of be same man who nearly stabbed three month ago taking for dampierre be shocking to think that have killed man cuthbert may be shocking to mary matter doe not weigh on conscience at in first place have idea of killing in second if have not hit hard quickly must have fired again killed arnold lastly regard communist a better than mad dog chance be ten to one that must have be shot at barricade afterwards if have not died when did be very terrible mary sighed have be terrible from beginning to end mary a hundred of men be killed day there will probably be thousand shot when troop enter paris can not regard death of must be murderer a matter will weigh on mind for moment now what have be going on here hardly have time to notice whether firing be heavy have be tremendous said several house have be struck set on fire lower down shell have come way have doubt troop imagine that house down near pont du jour be crowded with communist in readiness to repel assault might be made army be doubtless furious at destruction of column of vendome be in commemoration not only of napoleon of victory won by french army moreover know from newspaper have be brought in from outside have seen at cafe that be incensed to last degree by being detained here when for insurrection must have be given furlough to visit family when returned from german prison so can quite understand artilleryman taking shot occasionally at house believe to be occupied by insurgent may be sure of one thing be very little quarter will be shown to communist by troop even now can not hope that seeing impossibility of resisting many day longer certainty of terrible revenge if troop have to fight way through street communist will try to surrender on best term can get thiers have all along shown such extreme unwillingness to force fighting be sure must give far better term than must have right to expect rather than paris must be scene of desperate struggle if communist fulfil threat of wholesale destruction ruin two more day passed cuthbert went down day to old lodging found that arnold be doing well on second day indeed be out of bed with arm in sling sitting partly dressed in easy chair martin dufaure have left that morning for own lodging having slept for last two night on sofa minette have made everything about room tidy fresh window be open distant roar of

going on have taken quite enough part arnold own think wound at present moment be fortunate one for will keep out of mischief when surgeon come next must strongly advise to get to write certificate certifying that have be wounded by pistol ball so that if a be probable there will sooner later be general search for communist can prove injury be not received in fighting outside wall can refer to goude a to fact that be art student here document have better be made out in name than own for unfortunately yours have be rendered familiar to by frequent notice of doings speech in paper here will see about arnold said know can bring to that will be very foolish wrong not to do so arnold be married man now have wife to think about a well a may be sure that there be not single leader of insurrection here who will not endeavor to escape under false name besides even granting that a believe cause be righteous one certainly can not benefit in slightest by sacrificing life wife be communist vivandiere few day ago now be quiet little wife nursing sick husband glancing at minette saw angry flush on face look of dogged determination made remark however after chatting with arnold for time returned to passy woman will bring destruction on be mistaken said to mary fond a may be of dampierre enthusiasm for commune will take from side when last struggle begin do know mary presentiment about have turned out marvellously correct opened sketch book look at that said at time sketched be poised a spanish dancer have castanets in hand attitude be precisely that in stood a model struck at moment that knife must be more appropriate to than castanet see drew so be precise attitude stood in dagger in hand when caught wrist prevented from stabbing man at foot show to cuthbert frightens when talk of must remember that be mixture mary be like panther a graceful a supple charming beast when purr rub against leg of keeper terrible when in passion hurl upon in early day student be to man fascinated with stood quite alone in disapproval seeing a saw to day admit that be charming can not forget fury a bounded knife in hand upon man have knocked down listen do hear that rattle of musketry down by pont du jour troop must be working way up towards gate possibly be beginning of end presently communist with red sash rode furiously past in quarter of hour returned with battalion of national guard who have be stationed near arc de triomphe evidently there be sharp business going on mary be hardly likely troop can be attacking at time of day must be sure to choose early morning mass force under cover of darkness go at gate at daybreak still there be doubt from musketry firing must be trying to establish nearer gate than before battery have day be playing upon pont du jour have suddenly ceased firing rattle of musketry in direction continued a hotly a ever for two hour number of field gun joined in conflict on side of communist really must go find out what be about cuthbert said if must get up near viaduct must be able to look down into bastion at pont du jour be away long mary urged will be feeling very nervous till get back wo be long sha stay to watch affair only just to find out what situation be fact that communist have brought up field artillery show that be something more than ordinary although why battery opposite must have ceased to play can not make out be hard at work everywhere else cuthbert made way towards viaduct a approached saw that of field gun have heard have be placed there that parapet be lined with national guard who be keeping up incessant fire shell from meudon fort issy be bursting thickly over near bridge cuthbert seeing that must not get further without being exposed to fire might moreover get into trouble

garden greater part fell back behind viaduct afforded shelter somehow other troop in sap have be pushed forward to within fifty yard of gate must have come to conclusion that bastion be not tenanted trying experiment found inside wall without shot having be fired more must have followed at rate considerable force must have gathered there before communist found out have entered there can be doubt that be surprise not preconcerted movement for battery continue to fire on place for time after have entered in short time small body of soldier ran across open where shell be still bursting thickly established in ruin of village a received reinforcement gradually worked way forward communist have brought up strong force so far have be unable to drive back troop of course chance of doing so grows

of barricade there insurgent never intended to hold outlying suburb even battery on trocadero be built to aid fort not for fighting inside wall see yard troop gain now drive communist closer closer together render defence more easy may be week yet before commune be finally crushed must think that before troop advance much further on side will storm montmartre whose battery must otherwise take in

mary went out to trocadero flash of fire from loyal communist battery be incessant away on south side be constant flicker of musketry a cissey troop struggled with defender of barricade incessant fire played along end of champ elysees flashed from window of tuileries fringed parapet of south side of river facing palais fire be blazing in various part of paris result of bombardment city looked strangely dark for men at gas work be for most part fighting in rank of insurgent sky be lined with spark of fire moving in arc marking course of shell a traversed to fro from battery to battery fell on city be wonderful sight mary wonderful very terrible replied be very well to look at from here only think what must be for within circle of fire have pity for communist cuthbert said not one spark must not pull trigger risk scratch for defence of paris against german now be fighting like wild cat against countryman look there exclaimed suddenly there be fire broken out close to place de la concorde shell must have fallen there fancy must be within barricade none of battery on side must have be likely to send shell there at night a be so close to line of division that missile must be a likely to strike friend a foe higher higher mounted flame spreading a went till huge mass of fire lighted up that part of paris must be great public building of sort cuthbert said see building be on fire short distance away from look cuthbert look be that reflection of flame in window of tuileries be on fire be fire cuthbert exclaimed after minute pause see flame have burst through window on first floor good heaven communist be carrying out threat to lay paris in ash before yield in five minute doubt be at end flame be pouring out from window on first floor of palais be evident fire must have be lighted in dozen place simultaneously by time trocadero be thronged with spectator attracted by light in sky by report that one of public building be on fire exclamation of fury grief

locate be declared that palace of court of account ministry of war finance palace of legion of honor of council of state prefecture of police palace de justice hotel de ville palais royale be on fire a night went on scene became more more terrible paris be blazing in at least twenty place most of conflagration be upon enormous scale scene be too fascinating terrible to be abandoned be not until morning began to break that spectator on trocadero returned to home chapter xxv armed with pas cuthbert started for city at ten o'clock next morning dense pall of smoke hung over paris on south side of river conflict be still raging a be also on north east insurgent shell be no longer bursting up champ elysees firing have ceased at place de la concorde be evident that insurgent after performing work of destruction have evacuated position there on reaching bottom of champ elysees found that breach have be made in barricade that considerable number of troop be bivouacked in place de la concorde fire engine from versailles st denis other place round be already at work effort seemed futile indeed in face of tremendous body of fire with have to cope just a cuthbert after passing through breach in barricade on presentation of pas to sentry arrived at end of rue rivoli mounted officer dashed up to two engine at work opposite building have first be fired said can do good here take engine to courtyard of tuileries aid troop in preventing fire from spreading to louvre be only place where there be hope of doing good now monsieur said to cuthbert must fall in aid pompiers order be that able bodied men be to help in extinguishing fire cuthbert be glad to be of use joining fireman ran along with engine down rue rivoli turned in with into courtyard of palace western end

cuthbert showed pas to officer be permitted to pas on large number of citizen being by time available for work having be fetched from suburb occupied by troop before going very much farther cuthbert be stopped by line of sentry across street can not pas here officer in charge said a cuthbert produced permit island be still in hand of communist fire from barricade across bridge sweep street twenty yard farther on must be certain death to show there besides be still in force beyond hotel de ville can of course work round by left must strongly advise to go farther there be desperate fighting going on in place de la bastille insurgent battery be shelling boulevard hotly worst of be liable to be shot from upper window cellar there be score of scoundrel still in house there have be time to unearth yet good many men have be killed by fire thank sir will take advice cuthbert said found indeed that there be seeing anything be going on in way of fighting without running great risk accordingly made way back to trocadero here must see that number of fire have broken out at various point since morning even in part of town occupied by troop though of might be caused by communist shell be more probable that be work of incendiary have indeed heard from of citizen to whom have spoken while at work at pump that order have be issued that grating window giving light to cellar must be closed by wet sack being piled against must then be covered thickly with earth a several woman have be caught in act of pouring petroleum into cellar then dropping lighted match down upon wretch have be shot instantly fresh fire continually springing up showed that work be still going on be strangely silent in street with exception of sentry at corner there be few person indeed abroad many be looking from window few indeed ventured out knew not what order have be given to sentry feared arrest be to stir beyond door moreover occasional crash of shell from insurgent battery whistling of bullet frequent discharge of musket shot still kept up by group of desperate communist who have taken refuge in house be sufficient alone to deter from making attempt to learn what be going on in absence of footfall in street of sound of vehicle distant noise be strangely audible rustle of flame at hotel de ville great fire across river crash of falling roof wall incessant rattle of distant musketry boom of cannon formed weird contrast to silence prevailed in quarter cuthbert felt that breathed more freely when issued out again into champ elysees next day did not go down advance continued progress be slow on following morning paris be horrified by news published in paper at versailles statement of prisoner left doubt that archbishop of paris many other priest in hundred person have be massacred in cold blood method of first revolution being closely followed prisoner made to walk out one by one from gate of prison being shot down a issued out statement of scarcely le appalling nature be that female fiend of commune not only continued work of destruction by fire be poisoning troop several instance of occurred in one case ten men be poisoned by one of fury who came out a passed expressing joy at defeat of commune offered wine drank unsuspectingly within hour be dead order be consequently issued that soldier must on account accept drink food of kind offered by woman horrible massacre of archbishop other prisoner be next door to madness cuthbert said a read account at breakfast communist must have personal feeling of hostility against victim indeed archbishop be know most popular upon other hand seal fate of thousand fury excited by such deed will be so great that troop will refuse to give quarter prisoner taken will have to suffer to utmost for crime committed by perhaps handful of desperate wretch omnibus began to run yesterday from sevres propose mary that go over to versailles to day get out of sound of firing say there be fully prisoner there want to see prisoner mary said with shudder must like to go to versailles let keep away from horror so for day left sound of battle behind wandered together through park at versailles carefully abstained from allusion to public event of past six month next day cuthbert returned to paris made way down to place de la bastille where for sum of napoleon obtained permission to ascend to upper window of house scene here be terrible on side on be standing great drapery establishment known a bon marche embracing dozen house be in flame in square three battery of artillery belonging to ladmirault division be sending shell up various street debouching on place most of house on opposite side be in flame insurgent battery on butte de chaumont be replying to gun of troop infantry be already pressing way upwards of barricade be so desperately defended that method by alone troop on south side have be able to capture defence be adopted troop taking possession of house breaking way with crow bar pick axe through party wall so step by step making way along under cover until approached barricade be then able to make untenable by musketry fire from window cuthbert remained here for hour two then making detour came out on boulevard higher up theatre of porte st martin be in flame a be many other building large number of troop with piled arm occupied centre of street taking turn to rest before relieved comrade in work of assault presently saw down side street party of soldier with prisoner turned down to see what be going on officer in command of party came up to monsieur have doubtless pas said politely cuthbert produced ah be english monsieur be well for that country doe not breed such wretch a one of have be caught in course of last hour in act of setting house alight be now to be shot be unpleasant duty monsieur cuthbert said must be horrible at other time officer said can not consider creature a human being be wild beast verily believe woman be worse than men there be only one must spare though be worst of at barricade where fighting have be fiercest for last four day have be conspicuous troop got to know by red cap dress have be seen to shoot down men who attempted to retire have led charmed life must have be killed thousand time when be taken have on old dress over red one hideous bonnet in place of cap be caught just a have dropped lighted match into cellar flame flashed up at once two soldier near ran up arrested stabbed one other broke wrist with blow from butt of musket then came curious thing man who have be standing in doorway on opposite side of street ran out declared that be sharer in crime air be that of madman men must have pushed away exclaimed ' be arnold dampierre one of leader of commune be wife ' then woman said man be mad have never seen before know arnold dampierre everyone know doe not resemble man whose proper place be lunatic asylum ' so contended be brought before drumhead court martial man have so wild air that must not have believed story on being searched american passport be found upon then woman threw into arm will die together then ' said ' must have saved if must have let ' then turned to 'yes be guilty have fought against on barricade tore off outer dress bonnet ' have kindled twenty fire in be guilty alone stood by on barricade must have nothing to do with firing house be parisian be daughter of martin dufaure who be killed hour since duty be to commune first to husband afterwards hate despise slave of tyrant have conquered have taught lesson to men who fatten on suffering ' of course be ordered to be shot have given five minute time be up range by wall men said turning to soldier cuthbert glanced for moment then turned away other woman be mostly old at least middle aged stood scowling at soldier of pouring out foulest imprecation upon minette stood in centre of line conspicuous by red dress one hand grasped that of arnold who be gazing upon a if oblivious to else head be held erect looked at executioner with air of proud defiance cuthbert hurried away filled with intense feeling of pity regret heard minette cry in loud clear voice vive la commune then there be sharp volley be over minute later soldier passed on way to join comrade stood for time at corner of street irresolute have seen score of dead in street have thought must see nothing worse than have witnessed felt that must not go back a have first thought of doing to scene of execution comrade have fallen by side in fight at champigny have not felt for a for comrade who lay behind for girl who with talent might have have bright future before have be thrown amid other surroundings wondered whether must obtain body for burial did not seem to possible vehicle must not be obtained at price very request must seem suspicious suspicion at hour be enough to condemn man unheard difficulty in way must be enormous indeed must matter nothing arnold minette have fallen together must lie together in one of great common graf in dead must be buried must be little short of mockery to have burial service read over have arnold be consulted must have preferred to lie beside to being laid in grave apart so after pause of five minute cuthbert moved away without venturing single look back at group huddled down by wall walked away feeling crushed overwhelmed by untimely fate have befallen two person of whom have seen so much during past year feeling a feeble a did when first arose from bed in american ambulance several time have to pause lean against wall when have passed barricade at place de la concorde towards have almost instinctively made way sat down on one of deserted seat in champ elysees burst into tear have hardly come upon a surprise for have felt that conspicuous a have made chance of arnold making escape be small indeed especially a minette must cling to commune until very end still never struck a being possible that might witness end have thought that same obscurity that hung over fate of most of other leader of commune must envelop that of arnold must have fallen how when must never have be known must simply have disappeared rumor must have mentioned name for few day rumor be already busy with fate of other leader of insurrection have never dreamt that must be brought home to in fashion after time cuthbert pulled together waited until fiacre came along for on side of paris thing be gradually regaining usual aspect then drove back to passy what be matter cuthbert mary exclaimed a caught sight of face be ill look terribly pale quite unlike have happened have have shock mary said with faint attempt at smile very bad shock ask about just at present please get brandy have never fainted in life feel very near just at present mary hurried away to madame michaud who now always discreetly withdrew a soon a cuthbert be announced returned with cognac tumbler water poured out glass seemed to herself to be almost alarmingly strong drank at draught be alarmed mary said with smile at consternation in face wo often see do can assure that spirit drinking be not habitual vice with really wanted then be still fighting fiercely from porte st martin down to place de la bastille believe resistance have be crushed out on south side of river in couple of day whole thing will be over fancy week of fighting be awful to think of cuthbert how many do suppose will be killed altogether have not least idea suppose will ever be known if resistance be a desperate for next two day a have be for last three must say fully will have fallen besides taken with arm in hand tried shot hear there be two general court martial sitting permanently that seven eight hundred prisoner be shot day then there be eighteen twenty thousand at versailles a will not be tried until fighting be over men blood cooled down somewhat doubt much greater leniency will be shown there be terrible cloud of smoke over paris still yes fresh fire be constantly breaking out louvre be safe fireman have checked spread of flame at public building there be street where house be alight for distance of quarter of mile yet except at spot damage be le than must expect considering how fierce battle have be raging there be street where scarce bullet mark be to be seen on wall broken pane of glass in window while at point where barricade have be defended scene of ruin be terrible two day later strange stillness succeeded din uproar have for week gone on without cessation night day paris be conquered commune be stamped out chief dead fugitive rank file slaughtered prisoner awaiting trial france breathed again have be saved from danger infinitely more terrible than german occupation in short time hotel be opened visitor began to pour into paris to gaze at work of destruction wrought by orgie of commune one day cuthbert who be now installed in own lodging went up to passy hear that english church be to be open to morrow mary called on clergyman to day told must probably require service next week cuthbert mary exclaimed in surprise can not mean flush of color completed sentence yes be just what do mean mary have kept waiting three year be not going to wait day longer have given up much of belief in woman right cuthbert there be still maintain one of be that woman have right to be consulted in matter of kind quite so dear therefore have left matter open will leave to fix day can
