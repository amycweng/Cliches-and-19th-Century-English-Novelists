have look at map be taken out from wash leather case in have be sewn dave carrying under shirt by string went round neck be first time that boy have seen a dave opened examined with much curiosity be divided in two upper one appeared to be general map of country lower one plan of immediate locality of spot look very confusing dick said a examined see chap a made did not do for other people so that must find way back by line run along bottom of other map take to be gila be big river run right through indian country fall into rio grande have gone up from side two three hundred mile be strong party have to fight way back again lost pretty near half number see by map lie on north side of gila a gila be eight nine hundred mile long that help great deal map must be good to if be not for mark here up near top see thing be meant for mountain a one mountain on map be just like must be downright done if be not for mark do see there be three little jag here close together now take three jag be meant for mountain indian call three sister be mountain with three peak close together never saw have spoken with miner who have seen from north now here see to south of three sister be cross take be mine see there be black line waving about among mountain stop at point guess be line traveled by there be nothing to tell scale map be on dave tom said may mean five hundred mile from end to end may mean fifty if be five hundred must be seventy eighty mile from peak to cross if be fifty be only seven eight be so dave agreed have idea how far be from three peak to river yes have heard be about fifty mile north of gila well must make spot marked from fifteen to twenty mile from length of map must be about two hundred mile a peak be about quarter of distance from right hand side map begin about hundred fifty mile to west of peak must think must be at well known place that maker of map began place that knew must find again without difficulty be so will see line begin at stream running north south there be mark here side of path line of course might mean anything might mean tree rock then look here there be two more dot out here if be to draw line straight through must come to other dot one must be three four mile off other twelve fifteen farthest one may be peak one nearer conspicuous tree rock in line with yes be what make out to be boston joe said have choice of going up gila valley mounting side stream till come upon something agrees with four mark of keeping along from west by valley about right distance from gila must not think can trust much to distance dick said man be merely sketching out plan to help on way up again must ever make up party to return to mine though probably bending turning of road be to be depended upon map can not be done to scale here peak be made twice a far from left side a be from river may be really four time a far may be only same distance there be saying at a have drawn point where road begin be good deal more to south than peak be if scale be correct be not more than thirty mile at most north of gila that path begin see about halfway between point river be five six little mark like v upside down see there be other mark like at different place on map must say be meant for indian village be so no doubt dave agreed here be thing beside what do make out to be dick look to like tiny bird be very small very badly done be pretty sure that be what be meant what in world can have put bird there for let look at other village examined carefully two of have got figure one look like cat be snake at least must think so have got dave exclaimed be name of chief know name of good many of chief there be rattlesnake mountain lion among there be crow too dave boston joe put in so there be know be chief of tribe whose country lie side of arizona doubt be village now have know pretty well where place be for have be further among hill than can find way there easy enough when get to stream village be built on have got to hunt along till find mark then follow on line took crow village be about thirty mile north of gila will put stop sixty mile from river yes straightens out distance pretty considerable for must say that from to three peak must be nigh three hundred mile think be more than hundred from here to crow village must be easy thing following that marked line wo matter if miss course will be pretty nigh due east not a make north for know sister be not more than eighty mile from gila when get near ca help seeing then have only got to follow direction of map below there be peak well right in front of be lower hill with tree on top tree exactly in line with middle peak give line a tree just touch bottom of peak will give distance to within mile here be two line one on side of line from peak through tree know what mean guess mark canyon when go up that can hardly help striking mine wherever be think have got thing pretty well down to point if go wrong be own fault will have to come back way dick asked that must depend upon circumstance dave replied might make straight north come down on pas cross mountain about hundred fifty mile north of sister reckon must be terrible journey to undertake with loaded mule then again might strike east make for albuquerque socorro like enough may find that best way chapter vii scarcity of water five day later reached stream miner have recognized point that have

grass now for landmark went on until reached spot where stream fell into river ca do better than camp here dave 'zekel said have be rough journey for pony will be better for good feed right dave agreed see sign of landmark may be somewhere about will unsaddle pony boy may a well walk up stream bit keep eye open go very far away keep rifle ready for use there be saying what prowling indian may not have caught sight of a came along boy unslung rifle be strapped tightly to back be already loaded started up valley in quarter of mile passed through low wood filled bottom of valley in front of be open space bright with long grass flower in center of stood two large tree one on side of stream hurried on when reached tree saw to northwest two peak one nearer lower than other in exact line a direction be exactly that of two dot on map have doubt that have hit right spot returned at once with news to men dave have already lighted fire for in sheltered valley there be little fear of slight smoke made being seen broken up a be in passage through leaf overhead have found mark dick said a arrived think there can be mistake about have be good three men at once went on to two tree there be doubt be what be meant boston joe said wall be glad to see show anyhow that be right in guess work a to map never felt quite sure of before seeing three peak war only thing have to go on mark might not have be meant for arter now matter air clear fixed have only got to go ahead yes will stick to line have traveled a shown in map if miss be great odds know where have got to go to can find way there guess anyhow still line may be best may have have redskin a guide who knew country took best way anyhow ca do better than try follow chapter viii golden valley be nearly month later that gold seeker arrived at point due south of three peak journey have be toilsome one at time made way through deep gorge at others have to climb rocky hill where horse must scarce obtain foothold one of pack pony have be lost having slipped fallen over precipice many hundred of foot deep have lost day making long detour to reach spot where fell in order to recover article have carried for first half of distance have believed followed track marked on map then found at head of deep valley from must discover egress be therefore clear that must have misunderstood mark have taken wrong turning somewhere from time have put aside map made way a nearly east a inequality of ground permitted have difficulty a to forage for horse in many of valley there be abundance of coarse grass among rock aloe cactus grew thickly when a be sometimes case water be to be found peeled thorny skin from thick juicy leaf gave pulp to animal for shot three bear several small mountain deer there be little fear of sound of rifle being heard in mountain gorge must report have reached ear of indian must have supposed that be gun of red hunter there be indeed only two village marked on map anywhere near line be following a great bulk of indian lived on slope of hill on side of gila whence must make raid into mexico to south to new mexico to east here among mountain must subsist on proceeds of chase little plantation tended by woman offered small attraction to restless warlike indian who preferred depending upon plunder that must always gather by raid upon defenseless mexican village thus during whole journey have not once caught sight of indian though have two three time made out with aid of telescope tom have brought with little cluster of wigwam far away among hill there will be more danger when get near place 'zekel said one evening when be talking over redskin know well enough that be gold white who come into mountain be in search of guess know place where be to be found redskin always have eye open broken branch stone newly rolled down on path ash of fire slightest thing be new be sure to notice glitter of gold whether in stream in vein must be certain to catch eye if place be specially rich be safe to know of must keep sort of watch to see that be not found out by white be so dave agreed of course know how party mexican got map from got wiped out may have be on way back be more likely be at mine may find sign of when get there hope have be at work time before be attacked if so may like enough find store of gold without trouble of working for be use to redskin do trade with white wear gold ornament be wise enough to know that if be to show much gold about must make white more eager than ever to come in among mountain in search of so if mexican party gathered up afore went under like enough will find be with deep satisfaction that at last caught sight of mountain with three sharp peak be four day after first saw that reached point due south of be now in wide valley running east west to south wall of rock rose in seemingly unbroken line on northern side of valley hill sloped away rising one above with peak of sister visible above have left animal in charge of boston joe in clump of tree four mile back a miner be of opinion that indian village might lie somewhere in neighborhood that must be safer to make way on foot one of many branch of gila ran along center of valley except in deep pool be now dry now must keep sharp lookout for mark on hill dave said know be about right a to line may have to go two three mile north a much south before get mark just bearing on middle peak stop broke off suddenly look up there just beyond shoulder of hill there be wigwam sure enough tom brought telescope to bear yes there be about twenty of never can see at distance make mistake young fellow there aint saying what indian can see what ca see reckon eye be a good a glass of yours must not guarantee must not see rabbit run at distance there get among rock at foot of cliff will make way along hiding a much a can suppose be horse away there on hillside to right of village ca be nothing else yes be horse dave for half hour made way among rock then dick exclaimed suddenly look dave there be tree standing by at top of hill believe in fifty yard will just be on line of peak think be right dick have hit very point at first try if be right there must be break in wall above chapter ix tree on peak hastened on now with eye fixed on tree minute later exclamation broke from dave who be ahead others on joining saw that great wall of rock have be split a if by earthquake opening be not more than ten yard wide on looking up narrow line of sky appeared between wall of rock looking other way saw that tree on hill bore exactly on middle peak indian village lying just in same line halfway up hill here be place sure enough dave said there ca be mistake about be just a map made tree on middle peak line from going right into canyon look boy there be stream come down here in wet season run into one in middle of valley see can make out gold sparkling in sand be how be place be found be prospecting along valley came upon gold traced up to mouth of canyon will go in now dave dick asked excitedly for be still standing among rock broke off abruptly opposite mouth of canyon in front of evidently having be swept away by torrent flowing down go step forward dick let risk nothing by showing ourselves now will make way back a came to boston bring up horse after dark have not got chance to throw away can tell at night returned with horse two blanket have be cut up foot of animal muffled if one of redskin be to come upon track saw print of horseshoe must be up with zeke said have best do same ourselves heel of boot must be a ugly mark a horseshoe must keep well along at edge of fallen rock like enough come down here to fetch water up to village further keep away from stream better moon be half full be fortunate a must otherwise have have great difficulty in finding narrow gap in cliff light too enabled to avoid rock have rolled out farther than rest once inside gorge be pitch dark have to feel way along in about hundred yard began to widen soon found in narrow valley with perpendicular side seemed to widen farther up horse be at once unloaded now do lie down dave said will keep watch at mouth think there be danger still may a well begin a will have to go on well call up in couple of hour then zeke said will begin to get light in about four a soon a doe will cover up track with first dawn of light three miner taking blanket went down to mouth of canyon boy accompanied to watch operation be only in sand gravel swept down by flood from gorge that footmark must be seen be first leveled then with blanket surface of sand be carefully swept so a to erase sign of disturbance before sun be up operation be completed twenty thirty yard up canyon be enough for present dave said be safe from anyone passing now let have look round up above must have be awful careless if be surprised in here zeke said dozen men ought to hold place against hull tribe of redskin be so boston joe agreed greaser be mighty bad watchman doubt thought be safe in here that indian village must not have be over on hill opposite then must have be put down on map like enough have be followed dave said if redskin have caught sight of might have followed on trail for week till found where be going then made off to bring tribe down on may be that one have be hanging behind just in same way be very unpleasant idea tom said redskin way aint pleasant dave said well let be moving up first thing have got to look for aint gold there be doubt about being here somewhere what have got to look for be if there be way out of hole because be regular trap if be caught here might hold gorge for long time must have at last certain besides must shoot down from top proceeded few hundred yard up valley then stopped suddenly on cleared space of ground in center lay score of skeleton separately in group of two three remnant of rag still hung on showed that have be mexican two lad felt thrill of horror at proof of fate have befallen predecessor wall zeke exclaimed that be something like surprise there aint sign made fight of be just caught in sleep never even gathered for resistance well well what fool men be to be sure must have believed a even mexican must have be such fool a to sleep here without putting guard at entrance reckon redskin must have come down from above somewhere so caught unawares well let be moving on chapter x watched little higher up valley narrowed again side came closer closer until closed in abruptly in rounded precipice down in wet season be evident that waterfall leaped from height above did come down here dave said if be anywhere be near where attack be made side slope away bit there now keep eye skinned see if can make out place where man might climb up down life may depend on just a reached old encampment dick said look dave there be ledge running up behind bush seems to that join ledge halfway up tom be accustomed to climbing will go up bit see if go anywhere two lad stopped a got behind bush look like path here dave have certainly be trodden miner came to spot be right dave said be path sure enough animal of sort come up down bear must say maybe goat lot of like enough be only way can get down from top into valley come down to drink ridge be wider than looked being where started fully two foot across boy at once set off up a dick have supposed met ledge running along halfway up face of hill from below ledge seemed mere line be really two foot wide in most place even at narrowest be not le than foot two hundred yard along ascent be met with after hour climbing found on level plateau from must see across to three peak path be everywhere worn smooth showing that have be used for age by animal of kind one must almost think have be cut by hand dick said who must have thought from below there be such way a out of valley best of be that be good enough for horse to get up a well a well thank goodness have found back door to place be not pleasant idea that might be shut up there with option of being shot starved must take time to starve dick nine horse must last for long time yes must come sooner later tom anyhow will feel great deal more comfortable now know that there be way out indian know of too dick if a dave think came down way to attack mexican yes be not such comfortable idea well lad what do make of dave shouted to a approached bottom have be right up to top pony must go anywhere be narrow in place have passed many worse on way cliff never close up so even at worst place there be room for to get along with load what be like at top level ground along to drop of cliff hill behind to south well be comfort there be way down into valley anyhow since have be gone have be fossicking about there be doubt about gold be richest place of have ever seed have found water dave be one thing bad will have to go out to fetch water maybe if dig in center of channel will find best place to try will be at end right under where waterfall come down in winter there be most always deep hole in rock there where water stone so on have come down pounded away bed rock found where gold come from too there be big quartz vein running right up face of cliff there be just full of gold can see sparkle everywhere day when indian be wiped out fellow will bring machinery powder will have one of richest mine in world however concern reckon there be enough in gravel under foot to make hundred men rich now boston what do think be best thing to do first see if can get water dave if be shut up here without water must have in twelve hour so have got to get enough for ourselves horse to drink if can even if have to fetch up what want for gravel when have got water next job will be to make cradle there be plenty of tree here have got hatchet have brought zinc screen so have got everything want say might pick up lot in nugget still have got dozen already making must say over ounce between still others be real thing to depend on there be thing dave zeke put in must have watch have intended that thought must have only one place to watch now have found track up hill have two be so dave though be pretty hard on having two out of five idle still have got lesson there boston said pointing to spot where have found skeleton aye aye have got to be done dave said well lad will take watch to day one above one at mouth will set to work at water hole will toss up go up hill again dick spin head tail be then will choose mouth here go up to mouth head be walking about when get to top dave said find place where can get clear view round then lie down choose bit of shade if can find when knock off work have have bit of grub will come up take place be just getting dusk when dave came up relieved dick be going to stay here night dick yes have agreed will keep watch here to night boston to morrow night then go on again zeke will take watch below regular sleep like dog least noise in world will wake so will do very well can make out indian village across there from here yes quite plainly have not be using glass hope dave said in alarm forgot to bring up with why must because if sun be to flash on glass brasswork must be sartin to catch eye of someone in village if did may be sure must send up to see what be still if can make out village will save need for keeping watch in daytime down below be from there have got to expect attack most if saw moving out strong must shout down to must be ready for at night in course must watch place for there may be for anything know big village mile from here attack might come from one way other expect must rather work than watch dick so have better arrange to change place with tom in middle of day then can work day will find that plenty warrant did find water dave yes plenty of enough for horse washing too chapter xi hard at work tom took first watch in morning dick rendered assistance must to men who cut down couple of tree stood in gorge chopped into eight foot length then with wedge split into board smoothed up with adze be accustomed to work by deep trough be constructed resting upon rocker like cradle next morning work began two men threw gravel sand into cradle third kept in motion while whichever of boy be off watch brought water in two of pail from hole horse be trouble finding plenty of coarse grass among rock only requiring watering night morning thrice day content of cradle be cleared entirely out gold have sunk to bottom collected much of be in fine dust there be also large number of nugget varying in size from pea to marble clear up obtained on average eight nine pound of gold fourth day tom have come down from above at twelve o'clock found that men have only just finished clear up have sat down to have food having nothing to do strolled away to spot where mexican have be massacred short distance away on ground at side of valley three four foot above ground level of bottom saw charred stump of pole sticking up went across to suppose be where leader of party have tent rough hut said be confirmed in belief by number of bit of charred wood lying round pole be sort of arbor suppose said to there be several relic lying about two boot shriveled by fire tin cup flattened by weight have fallen on pistol with stock blackened by fire called men to spot yes like enough be a say dick be scarcely worth getting up to look at there be not much to look at dave have be wondering ever since came that have not come upon of gold must have gathered said did believe indian have taken away now if be hut of leader of party struck that must most likely be kept here that may be buried somewhere under circle of ash tom be right mate dave said be just where gold must be kept there aint much doubt that must bury a got so a to prevent anyone from taking of till be divided up let fetch pick boston will soon see if be here let try round post first went on when three men fetched pick will be either close to middle of hut else on one side under where made bed ground be sand have be washed up by eddy in one of flood have struck three four blow with pick when dave exclaimed here be something boy have brought shovel with throwing aside sand saw piece of leather be bag joe said be hoard sure enough going down on hand knee pulled up bag after bag about fifty pound in weight until have pile on surface of eight bag eureka dave exclaimed a lifted last bag out of hole have made something like pile doubt be strong party even with must have be here couple of month to have got lot together well boston held out hand can go east again have struck rich at last bet joe said briefly how much be dick asked of bag weighs about fifty pound dick dick looked incredulous stooped to pick up one of bag be astonished at weight fifty pound if weighs ounce there be eight of four hundred pound of gold think of lad be pretty nigh eighty pound apiece aint good at reckoning put rough at two hundred fifty dollar pound be somewhere like two hundred thousand dollar forty thousand pound dick exclaimed doe not seem possible aint got to settlement yet zeke said quietly chap have lost let figure up much till get beyond sound of apache war whoop well will go on watch at mouth dick said then can talk thing over together do dick there be lot more to look after than there be before make one feel one ca be too careful anyhow wo stay day longer in place will be off to night dick went nearly down to mouth of narrow gorge have expected must find treasure although far exceeded anticipation did not feel excitement men have shown at discovery of treasure sat down on rock amused with thought of wonder there must be at home suddenly heard sound of horse hoof grasping rifle stooped down behind fallen rock moment later mounted indian dashed past mouth of rift be scarce twenty yard away dick noticed eagle feather of head dress rifle slung across shoulder legging decorated with tuft of hair be moment then be gone dick waited minute two then ran in to tell miner uttered exclamation of alarm went right on dick said did check speed of horse glance way be sign zeke said chance be that fellow have happened on trail maybe mile maybe fifty back have just be following why must be riding so close to cliff if be not tracking did look in dick persisted war such fool lad knew well enough that if glanced round there be anyone on watch there must have bullet through sartin what will do will saddle up at once dave boston joe asked may a well pack horse anyhow boston ca go till be dark if party like ours be to show up there must see from village sure do run up dick keep lookout with tom at village can crawl along if like nearer to edge make out if fellow be riding there if see go there come down with news tell tom to hurry down a quick a can if see party setting out will have horse saddled up by time be down again chapter xii retreat dick sprang up hill a soon a joined tom astonished with account of discovery of treasure collected by other party also by news that be probable that indian must be speedily upon told a be crawling forward towards edge of cliff there go exclaimed when neared do see going up slope toward village how clear air be dave say be six mile there if be foot doe not look more than one well must go tell below mind tom moment see party issue out from there crawl back to path then hurry down a quick a can mind tumble in haste that settle dave said when heard news if have be going to village must have made for straight not come along under cliff until be opposite to have got to fight be sartin if be to mount path at once dave must keep from climbing up if there be hundred of be so lad must not stay there forever might be took in rear by party besides a soon a find out that have left will do pretty soon will be straight after have be talking over while have be away have agreed that must hold canyon until get dark then make off doubt know of path wo think a have found out will fancy that have got sure like enough a soon a find be ready for here will send messenger off to village up behind there be one thing will have good way to go for have seen break in cliff for last twenty mile maybe go much farther anyhow have got to risk must think dick said that anyhow might a well get horse up to top of path ready to push on a soon a get dark can do easily enough in daylight must be very awkward job at night right be lad be capital plan will do at once have got everything wrapped up ready one of will stay up there with tom so a to guard top of path in case of redskin must come down before be ready to go forward three will be enough to hold canyon will undertake horse job boston joe said a say three be enough here will think be going to take by surprise a soon a find be ready for will draw off fast enough reckon that fellow have counted number redskin will try to force pas with five western rifle facing just a joe began to mount path leading horse with others tied head to tail in long line behind tom appeared on path high up shouted thirty forty horseman have just left village be coming way right tom dick shouted back be not to come down joe be coming up with horse have got plenty of time yet dave said a soon a string of horse have started on way up aint much past two o'clock yet will be pretty nigh six hour afore can make start there be good fire have kept down thirty pound of flour will have time to bake into bread before start sha have much time for baking when be once off can bet boot dick looked on with wonder at quiet deliberate manner in dave mixed dough by way dick latter said looking up have divided that lot of gold got here into five lot put one lot into blanket on of riding horse be like enough that if carry own scalp back to settlement sha get of four baggage pony there with there be about twelve pound of gold in blanket so suppose have to let other pony go sha have made bad job out of journey after have filled water skin dave filled five small skin carry one of others dare carry of horse have got two sack of gold one of have got water skin two others have got twenty pound of flour will be enough to last with loaf be baking here till get out of indian country others have got tea sugar one with skin will be heaviest load at first water will soon go so that make even everything else have got to leave behind except kettle baking pan will take up a go now that loaf be fairly under way will get ready for redskin chapter xiii redskin took post behind rock in front of bottom be composed of sand gravel only rock being that behind dick have crouched close to entrance mind must all fire at once dave said one must always be loading will take in turn to fire of course if make rush must take to six shooter aint likely to do will fire first zeke follow reckon aint likely to miss of quarter of hour passed then suddenly mounted indian appeared at mouth of canyon checked horse sat gazing up dave rifle cracked indian fell backward from saddle sudden yell of anger surprise rose outside moment dozen figure appeared at entrance zeke fired now dick dave said moment later lad whose rifle be resting on rock in front of pulled trigger almost immediately dave fired again moment mouth of canyon be clear indian lay by side of first who have fallen reckon shot told dave said must hardly miss that clump now think will see more of know be here know be ready for aint in indian nature to throw away life charging up place like have reckoned five first must go down anyhow then will guess that have got pistol redskin hate six shooter like poison time passed slowly quiet in canyon remained undisturbed expect be a said zeke wo attack again by daylight though say a wo try crawl up when get dark think a will if there be village up in hill behind will send round to wait here till hear fight begin inside if there aint village half of will ride round to come down on however wo set about at once injun be never in hurry think that have got safe in here can take thing easy if be long way round aint quite sure of path like enough wo start until calculate will get there at daybreak when will guess that will be pretty well worn out with keeping watch here guess be about dave anyhow can push out a soon a begin to get too dark for to see from village across there be a soon a sun have gone down behind hill to south dave have from time to time left post gone to keep up fire to put fresh batch of dough in pan a soon a shadow fell across valley said now will be off reckon there be fear of redskin getting round for time tell that gold make one mighty fidgety six loaf have be baked taking two while dave in addition took pan kettle mounted path when reached tail of string of horse dave hailed boston joe moment later miner head appeared on edge of cliff above be clear aye have seen nothing of ne'er thing moving well will go at once joe even redskin eye must not make out from village now horse be at once set in motion a soon a have left path cord be unfastened five mounted way dave boston joe asked have better make west be lucky will have moon for there be traveling over hill in dark if know way anyhow will make straight back at present may come upon fellow riding round will go in indian file will go first with pony tied to mine two lad will follow then zeke joe can take last pony other one ride in rear so that can keep well in sight yet be far enough off to use ear for hour continued course south ground rising a went then reached dip running west will follow dave said be right direction anyhow be a likely to take down into valley again in time a proceeded dip became more decided after two hour riding side narrowed in will strike water course soon dave said turning round to speak to tom who be riding next to water fall here have got to make way out somewhere be only way a can go not that there be much water for be often month without rain presently found that ground be covered with pebble there be water course see dave said fall became steeper steeper ground more stony low tree bush rose on slope on side have best dismount here dave said be growing mighty steep may come upon sudden fall anywhere be mighty difficult to judge about depth in moonlight lad be heartily glad at order for have for time be momentarily expecting that horse must come down over bowlder will go twenty yard ahead dave said have better loose baggage pony let pick own way throw bridle on horse neck will go deal safer so than if be leading critter can pick way anywhere if have got time can look about luckily moon be still high shot full down upon path be traveling even on foot lad found difficult to make way down sometimes have to climb over heap of bowlder sometimes to slide down face of rock so steep that must not keep foot upon often seemed so perilous that must have hesitated to attempt have not seen that dave with two horse kept steadily on below chapter xiv in ravine lad be surprised at way own horse followed sliding on haunch down steepest place picking way among rock bowlder six hour after starting found in deep ravine whose side be covered with tree have now lost moon be far too dark for to progress further will give four hour rest dave said that long halt on path be worse than traveling will go three time a fast when get light to help a in dark besides have got to look for place where can double on sha find till be out of valley will have to be pretty spry if be going to get away from will come along fast when once take up trail have taken six hour to get down here wo take three well hope will get on move hour two before do if wait until daylight before advancing there will be lot of hubbub talk before really make up mind that have really slipped through finger arrange for start still by midday will be having behind if ca find way to throw off 'd willingly take twenty ounce for share of gold to be paid to at santa fe boston joe said so must joe there ai no denying be in tight place unless find way out of in morning own opinion be that have only got one chance be to leave horse behind to take rifle loaf of bread to start back on foot must not wonder if came to zeke said will hold on for few hour anyhow before leave will hide bag possibly might come back day anyhow must tote along what have got in blanket aint a if be going to run way from here to settlement twelve pound weight aint nothing one way other twenty boston agreed vote if do have to leave horse slip open one of bag take eight pound so twenty pound aint much for man to carry besides gun ammunition chunk of bread well let rest of lie down get couple of hour sleep be off once last night all right wake directly see change in sky must give horse chunk of bread drink before start seemed to lad that have be asleep for five minute only when be roused be work of few minute to adjust load again to give horse bread water be still hardly light in ravine when be ready to start be too anxious to get on to delay moment a soon a day have broadened little be able to pick way along on comparatively level ground beyond edge of water course horse be put into trot if can keep on like joe said apache wo be up to before night will know that have got nigh twelve hour start of though may start off fast at first will soon settle down into pace that can keep up day after journeying for three hour came upon spot where two other ravine fell into along be journeying let hold council dave said now what do think have best be done push straight forward take one of other gulch seem to run back almost same line a ye have be following dick said better lad will be le inclined to think that have taken what do say zeke think have better push straight on dave if be coming along in dark must be different thing must not go horse length afore missed track even if muffle critter foot be strong enough to send party way so be zeke must be sight better to fight third of than hull lot think that must be better to push on dave boston joe said there ai no saying where narrow valley lead wind double way besides be dry so say let push on till get into one of main valley well will do joe anyhow may a well do a say muffle foot injun will know what have done when see track stop here a say wo know whether have gone straight on turned up one side other guess most likely will think that have turned up anyhow be sure to divide further talking be necessary blanket be cut up bunch of dry grass be laced under horse foot to form pad strip of blanket wound round round securely fastened now on go again lad dave said setting example rode straight down ravine ahead of two hour later blanket be taken off thrown among bush rock having cut through be useless longer to conceal track incommoded horse mouthful of water be given to animal again started at brisk pace side of valley be now narrowing in again becoming much steeper tree have ceased bare rock rose in place almost precipitously water rise high here when there be storm zeke said see be pretty nigh closed up somewhere in front here better dave said can make fight for in place like hold till dark ca be far behind now stop horse moment listen faint sound be heard be dave said aint above mile behind push on till find good place to make stand chapter xv rifle shot five minute entered gorge so blocked with rock have fallen from above that have greatest difficulty in leading horse over must not be better dave said can stop here zeke do go on with dick see how far go what chance be when get out of if can see way of climbing side of valley come back tell then reckon best thing will be for to take horse down go straight up leaving dick to tell exactly where have gone up then a soon a be quite dark will be off follow wo be able to pick up trail will guess have gone straight down valley anyhow will give twelve hour start zeke nodded may a well take critter down at once said may be two three mile before can find place where can get out of valley there aint use making two journey of somewhat reluctantly dick followed zeke driving horse before have be gone five minute when heard crack of rifle behind do think be sure to be able to hold place be safe for time anyhow zeke said a soon a redskin see be brought to stand will draw off wait till band have gone up other valley join doubt a soon a have made out track again sent kipple of men off to fetch back reckon must have seen till got four five mile down by time other band must have be a much farther up side valley messenger must have long ride before overtook ten twelve mile maybe must have to come down again so must be pretty well four hour before have joined first band in four hour will be dark enough for dave to draw off there go again shot after shot echoed among cliff gorge extended for mile then widened rapidly mile half farther side be clad with tree slope although still steep be zeke said possible for horse to scramble up will go up there safe enough said five of with nothing to carry other four ai heavy loaded see two tree standing alone on crest there see zeke well be to be mark will make out plainly enough in moonlight will be just down beyond need not tell to be keerful how go when get beyond shelter of tree below dave will know about now can be off back again dick started back at run in le than hour joined other three among rock found place lad yes have started up be glad be back fellow look a if be going to make attack on be about five twenty of guess know a well a do that will be dark before friend join however think will make rush will lose heart when three four of number get shot weaken when come to climbing rock in face of six shooter now do two lad keep below get down right among rock so that can fire out through hole between directly have fired get out of line for stray bullet might come in scarcely have boy taken position looked along barrel when saw dozen dark figure spring up among rock fifty yard away two shot be fired by miner two of indian fell forward then one after lad fired a felt sure of aim while at same moment two sharper crack sounded close to for colt at forty yard be a deadly weapon a rifle three more of indian fell rest sank down behind rock opened fire at position held by white reloaded rapidly now keep sharp lookout dave said fire unless rise again joe will make hot for a raise head to take aim rifle be fired twice then fire of indian ceased think have accounted for two more joe said sha hear more of seven out of twenty five be sharp lesson first man who fell be chief reckon will wait till sub chief with other band come up now sooner sun go down better there be one thing will be dark down here hour before be on hill top why must fall back at once tom asked because like enough will open fire occasionally if did reply must think have made off must follow pick up trail where horse left valley have got to wait here until be too dark for to follow trail moment be dark enough for be off be just getting dusk when dave said suddenly there be one of other band coming up be good bit away yet can hear dick must only make out low continuous murmur sounded to like distant waterfall what do think joe dave said must be safe to make run for might beat off first attack of be safe to get killed hurt too badly to travel will talk for quarter of hour at least after come up by time find have gone got horse over rock got down to mouth of gorge will be too dark for to follow track be with dave joe said a discharged rifle be one more wiped out be just going to fire to see whether be here still have answered question now let be off go a quiet a can lad make slightest noise just creep along until be three four hundred yard away may be sure that be listening for quarter of mile moved very cautiously now think be safe dave said breaking into run at steady trot kept on down gorge just a reached mouth heard faint yell in distance have found be off will be five minute more before have brought up horse got over rock will go pretty cautious because will be expecting to be ambushed be getting pretty dark now will be in among tree before be out chapter xvi on return tree began fully mile above point where zeke have made way up with horse running now at top of speed be among before indian issued from gorge fugitive went on at slower pace among tree until heard war whoop knew that leading indian have passed out now throw yourselves down dave said just lie a still a mouse slightest noise must tell have taken to wood want to go straight on for bit in four five minute heard tramping of horse party of indian rode down valley there be over fifty of dave whispered expect other two band must have come up together now let get up a high a can a long a be galloping
