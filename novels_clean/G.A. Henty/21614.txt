bushy black eyebrow deep set eye long beard of black hair streaked with gray be said to have acquired much of learning of gentile among whom at antioch have dwelt for year be to power a speaker that owed influence be tongue in day ruled men there be few who must lash crowd to fury still wrath when excited better than solomon ben manasseh for time talked upon different subject on corn harvest vintage probable amount of taxation marriage feast be to take place in following week at house of one of principal citizen of hippo other matter at last simon broached subject be uppermost in thought news from tiberias say be bad rabbi news from tiberias be always bad friend simon in land there be not city will compare with in wrongheadedness of people violence of sedition little can be hoped a far a can see so long a good governor josephus continues to treat malefactor so leniently score of time have conspired against life a often have eluded for lord have be ever with time instead of punishing who have brought about disorder let go free trusting always that will repent of way although see that kindness be thrown away that grow even bolder more bitter against after failure galilee be with whenever give word man take up arm follows did give order must level proud town tiberias sepphoris to ground tear down stone by stone stronghold of john of gischala will suffer to hing not hair of traitor head be to be touched property to value of penny be interfered with call such lenity culpable law ordains punishment for who disturb people know what befell who rebelled against moses have valor wisdom of king david be well if have like great king joab by side who must smite down traitor spare not be only fault simon said what change have taken place since be sent hither from jerusalem to take up government abuse have be repressed extortion have be put down tax have be lightened eat bread in peace comfort man property be own never be there such change a have wrought be not for john of gischala justus son of piscus jesus son of sapphias must go quietly well men be continually stirring up people who in folly listen to conspiring to murder josephus seize upon government already have have more than once to reduce to submission tiberias sepphoris happily without bloodshed for when people of city saw that galilee be with josephus opened gate submitted to mercy truly in leviticus be said 'thou shalt not avenge bear grudge against child of thy people thou shalt love thy neighbor a thyself ' josephus carry beyond reason seeing that adversary by mean observe law must remember that be also said that 'he that taketh sword will fall by sword that law lay down punishment for transgressor judge king slew who troubled land destroyed utterly josephus doe wrong to depart from teaching know not where must have learned such notion of mercy to enemy to enemy of land simon said have be to rome be not among roman that will have found that be right to forgive who rise up in rebellion yes be in rome when be twenty six year old solomon said went thither to plead cause of certain priest who have be thrown into bond by felix sent to rome be perilous voyage for ship be wrecked in adriatic of six hundred men who be on board only eighty be picked up after floating swimming night by ship of cyrene be not long in rome for being introduced to poppaea wife of caesar used interest with obtained release of for whose sake went there no if gained idea from anyone learned from one banus ascetic of sect of essene who lived in desert with other clothing than bark leaf of tree other food save that grew wild josephus lived with in like fashion for three year doubtless learned be in heart banus be follower say of john whom herod put to death for aught know of jesus who be crucified two year afterwards at jerusalem in whom many people believed who have many follower to day have conversed with of from what tell jesus taught doctrine similar to josephus practice may have learned from banus without accepting doctrine member of sect hold a to founder being promised messiah who be to restore israel too have talked with many of sect simon said have argued with on folly of belief seeing that founder by mean saved israel be put to death from what must see there be much that be good in doctrine hold have exaggerated idea be opposed to war even to fighting for country hear that since there have be trouble with rome most of have departed altogether out of land so a to avoid necessity of fighting be poor creature solomon ben manasseh said scornfully need not talk of now for affect in way save that may be josephus have learned somewhat of doctrine from banus that be thus unduly a think most unfortunately for country inclined too much to mercy instead of punishing evildoer a deserve nevertheless rabbi seems to that there have be good policy a well in mercy josephus have shown foe know john have many friend in jerusalem that if must accuse josephus of slaughtering must be able to make so strong party there that must obtain recall of josephus must not let go solomon said hotly since roman have gone submit to supremacy of council at jerusalem be only on sufferance for long age have have nothing to do with judah be not disposed to put neck under yoke now submit to unity because in roman have common foe be not going to be tyrannized josephus have shown wise ruler be happier under than have be for generation under men who call king who be nothing roman satrap be not going to suffer to be taken from only let people of jerusalem try will have to deal with men of galilee be past age at men be bound to take up sword john have not yet attained if there be need must go out fight what must do for population of galilee be greater than of judah while must fight man to death jew must few of care to hazard life only to take from man desire to rule over still josephus doe wisely perhaps to give occasion for accusation by enemy there be talk be there rabbi of movement on part of roman to come against in force none so far a have heard rabbi replied king agrippa remains in country to east have roman force with sufficient to attempt great enterprise so long a leave alone be content will come sooner later simon said shaking head be busy elsewhere when have settled with other enemy will come here to avenge defeat of cestius to restore florus to reconquer land where rome have once laid paw never let slip prey well can fight solomon ben manasseh said sternly forefather won land with sword can hold by sword yes martha said quietly joining in conversation for first time if god fight for a fought for forefather why must not rabbi asked sternly be still people be faithful to law god have many time in past suffered to fall into hand of enemy a punishment for sin martha said quietly tribe be carried away into captivity be scattered know not where temple be destroyed people of judah dwelt long a captive in babylon suffered to fall under yoke of roman in right time will fight for again can say that time have come rabbi that will smite roman a smote host of sennacherib that man can say rabbi answered gloomily time only will show whether people will fight valiantly doubt not that will fight simon said many other nation to whom be a handful have fought bravely have succumbed to might of rome be said that josephus many of wisest in jerusalem be heartily opposed to tumult against roman that only went with people because be in fear of life even at tiberias many men of worth gravity such a julius capellus herod son of miarus herod son of gamalus compsus others be strongly opposed to hostility against roman be same elsewhere who know best what be might power of rome must fain remain friendly with be ignorant violent class have led into strait from a fear naught ruin can arise thought better thing of simon rabbi said angrily have told simon urged that thought mad undertaking to provoke vengeance of rome thought so at first solomon admitted now hand be placed on plow must not draw back believe that god of father will show might before heathen trust that may be so simon said gravely in hand be power whether will see fit to put forth now in behalf remains to be seen however for present need not concern greatly with roman may be long before bring army against while sedition here be at very door ever threaten to involve in civil war need fear civil war rabbi said people of galilee save violent ill disposed in few of town be for josephus if come to force john party know that will be swept away like straw before wind fear be that may succeed in murdering josephus by knife of assassin in one of tumult must rather latter because must then say that people have torn to piece in fury at misdoings however watch over a much a can friend have warned that must be careful not only for own sake for of people have promised that a far a can will be on guard against traitor governor must have strong bodyguard john exclaimed impetuously a roman governor have in year will be of age to have name inscribed in list of fighting men must gladly be one of guard be old enough to fight to express opinion unasked simon said in presence of elder check boy rabbi said have fire spirit day be coming when will not ask how old how young be who must fight so that can hold arm josephus be wise not to have military guard john because people love not such appearance of state enemy must use a argument that be setting up above be partly because behaves discreetly go about among like private person of more account than that love none can say be tyrant because have mean of tyrannizing enemy can not urge against at jerusalem a must doubtless do if must that be seeking to lead galilee away from rule of jerusalem to set up a master for to do must require to gather army josephus have not single armed man at service save except when appears to be in danger many out of love of assemble provide escort josephus be wise in affect pomp state that keep armed men around trust to love of people must be wiser however did seize one of occasion when people have taken up arm for to destroy who make sedition to free country once for from trouble sedition must be always nipped in bud lenity in such case be most cruel course for encourages men to think that in authority fear that can conspire without danger whereas at first blood of ten men will put end to sedition need at last blood of a many thousand to restore peace order be good for man to be merciful not for ruler for good of whole people be placed in hand sword of justice be given to be most merciful who us most promptly against who work sedition wise ruler will listen to prayer of people will grant petition when show that case be hard will grant nothing to who asketh with sword in hand for know full well that when yield once must yield always until time come a come surely will when must resist with sword then land will be filled with blood whereas in beginning must have avoided trouble by refusing so much a to listen to who spoke with threat josephus be good man lord have given great gift have done great thing for land will see that many woe will come much blood will be shed from lenity of towards who stir up tumult among people few minute later family retired to bed hour being late one for simon household generally retired to

be betrothed to girl have never seen see be a if be for short time for one life must be awful awful mary agreed heartily of course must have to be done of course john said possibility of lad refusing to obey parent command not even occurring to still doe seem to quite right that one must have choice in so important matter of course when one got father mother like mine who must be sure to think only of making happy not of amount of dowry anything of sort must be all right with parent must be dreadful for time not word be spoken of meditating over unpleasantness of being forced to marry someone disliked then finding subject too difficult for began to talk about other thing stopping sometimes to see fisherman haul up net for there be number of boat out on lake rowed down a far a tiberias there john ceased rowing sat chatting over wealth beauty of city john have often visited with father mary have never entered then john turned head of boat up lake again began to row scarcely have dipped oar into water when exclaimed look at black cloud rising at other end of lake why did not tell mary how stupid of exclaimed not to have kept eye open bent to oar made boat move through water at very different rate to at have before traveled most of boat have gone mary said presently rest be rowing to shore cloud be coming up very fast added looking round be going to have storm john said will be upon long before get back will make for shore mary must leave boat there take shelter for while then walk home will not be more than four mile to walk though spoke cheerfully john knew enough of sudden storm burst upon sea of galilee to be aware that long before must cross mile half of water separated from eastern shore storm must be upon indeed be not more than half way when burst sky be already covered with black cloud great darkness gathered round then came heavy downpour of rain then with sudden burst wind smote be useless now to try to row for oar must have be twisted from hand in moment john took helm told mary to lie down in bottom of boat have already turned boat head up lake direction in storm be traveling boat sprang forward a if have received blow when gale struck john have more than once be out on lake with fisherman when sudden storm have come up knew what be best to be done when have laid in oar have put so that blade stood partly up above bow caught wind somewhat crouched down in bottom with head below gunwale hand on tiller so that tendency of boat be to drive straight before wind with strong crew knew that must have rowed obliquely towards shore alone strength must have done nothing to keep heavy boat off course sea rose a if by magic spray be soon dashing over wave a followed boat rising higher higher shore be no longer visible crest of wave seemed to gleam with pallid light in darkness surrounded john sat quietly in bottom of boat with one hand on tiller other arm round mary who be crouched up against have made cry exclamation from moment gale struck illustration on sea of galilee be getting near shore asked at last mary be running straight before wind be blowing right up lake there be nothing to be done to keep straight before mary have seen many storm on lake knew into what fury water be lashed in tempest such a be now upon be in god hand john said with quiet resignation of race can save if will let pray to john nodded for few minute word be spoken can do anything mary asked presently a wave struck stern threw mass of water into boat yes john replied take earthen pot bale out water john have great hope that must live through gale thought better for girl to be kept busily employed bailed steadily fast a worked water came in faster for wave a swept past broke on board so rapidly be traveling that john have greatest difficulty in keeping boat from broaching to in case following wave must have filled overturned think be use john mary said quietly a great wave broke on board pouring in a much water in second a must have baled out in ten minute use dear sit quietly by first pull oar aft now tie together with piece of rope now when boat go down keep tight hold of cut off piece of rope give when be in water will fasten to oar will keep afloat easily enough will keep close to know be good swimmer whenever feel tired can rest hand on oar too keep up courage keep a quiet a can sudden storm seldom last long father will be sure to get boat out a soon a can to look for john spoke cheerfully have great hope of being able to live in so rough sea mary have still le quietly carried out john instruction boat be half full of water now rose heavily upon wave john raised looked round in hope that wind might unnoticed have shifted little blown towards shore a glanced around gave shout following almost in track fifty yard away be large galley running before wind with rag of sail set on mast be saved mary exclaimed here be galley close to shouted loudly though knew that voice must not be heard many yard away in teeth of gale almost directly saw two three men stand up in bow of galley one be pointing towards saw that be seen in minute galley came sweeping along close to boat dozen figure appeared over side two three rope be thrown john caught one twisted rapidly round be body own knotted taking in arm jumped overboard minute be drawn alongside galley pulled on board a soon a rope be unfastened john rose to foot mary lay insensible on deck carry damsel into cabin man who be evidently in authority said have fainted will soon come round will see to suddenness of rescue plunge in water sudden revulsion of feeling affected john so much that be two three minute before must speak come along with lad one of sailor said laying hand on shoulder dry clothes draught of wine will set right again have have narrow escape of that boat of yours be pretty nearly water logged in five minute must have be too late john hastily changed clothes in forecastle took draught of wine then hurried back again towards aft cabin just a reached man who have ordered mary to be carried in came out damsel have opened eye said need not be uneasy about have given woolen cloth bade take off wet garment wrap in why did not make for shore before tempest broke be foolish of indeed to be out on lake when anyone must see that gale be coming be rowing down did not notice until turned john replied be making for shore when gale struck be well for that noticed be thinking of making for shore although in so large well manned craft a there be little fear upon lake be not like great sea where have seen large ship a helpless before wave a small boat picked from have just set out from tiberias when marked storm coming up business be urgent moreover marked little boat saw that be not likely to gain shore so bade helmsman keep eye on until darkness fell upon then to follow straight in wake for must run before wind well did for when first caught sight of be right ahead of speaker be man of about thirty year of age tall

a conspicuous person among jew be thirty when be intrusted with important position of governor of galilee contrary to custom of time have sought to make gain from position accepted present bribe devoted entirely to ameliorating condition of people in repressing turbulence of lower class of great town of robber chieftain who like john of gischala took advantage of relaxation of authority caused by successful rising against roman to plunder tyrannize over people expression of face of josephus be lofty at same time gentle temper be singularly equable circumstance never gave way to anger kept passion well under control address be soft winning have art of attracting respect friendship from who came in contact with poppaea wife of nero have received with much favor bravely a fought against vespasian titus be afterwards a much attached to a be jew of galilee there can be doubt have be otherwise placed than a one of people on verge of destruction josephus must have be one of great figure of history john have be accustomed to hear father friend speak in tone of such admiration for josephus a man who be regarded not only a benefactor of jew of galilee a leader mainstay of nation that have long ardently desired to see to find that have now be rescued from death by that be now talking to face to face filled with confusion be brave lad josephus said for kept head well in time

mother will not grudge for such service a to advancement wish nothing better than that must till land of father none can say what lord have in store for whether stranger may not reap what have sown thus then wisdom will gain in being with be likely to be far better inheritance than can give what say martha say a do simon will grieve to part with know that offer a lord josephus make be greatly for good moreover manner in be saved from death seems to show that lord have something for hand to do that path be specially marked out for to refuse to let go must be to commit sin of withstanding god therefore lord willingly give up son to follow think that have decided wisely josephus said tarry here for tonight tomorrow cross to tiberias therefore let be here by noon mary be most silent of party on way home simon wife felt convinced decision have made be wise one although be not ambitious yet felt that offer of josephus be most advantageous one opened career of honor to son john be in state of highest delight to be about person of josephus seemed to greatest honor happiness opened way to performance of great action must bring honor to father name although have be hitherto prepared to settle down to life of cultivator of soil have have yearning for one of more excitement adventure be now likely to be gratified to fullest mary however felt approaching loss of friend playmate greatly though even be not insensible to honor offer of josephus conferred upon seem glad of good fortune mary john said a after returned home strolled together a usual down to edge of lake may be good fortune be not mine girl said pettishly will be very dull here without know what will be mother will always be full of anxiety will be fretting whenever get news of disturbance be often enough for there seem to be disturbance continually father will go about silently miriam will be sharper than usual with maid everything will go wrong ca see why must have said that in year two must go with

young besides mary after be good fortune a well a mine for be not settled that be to share josephus be powerful if please do duty can in time raise to position of great honor may even come to be governor of town captain over troop councilor mary laughed not councilor john governor perhaps captain perhaps never must say councilor john laughed good temperedly well mary then will look forward to be wife of governor captain see might even fill place of councilor with credit because must always come to for advice before give opinion then must be sure to be right seriously mary do think great honor to have have offer made by governor seriously so do john though wish in heart have not made have looked forward to living here life just a mother have done now there will be nothing fixed to look forward to besides where there be honor there be danger there seem to be always tumult always conspiracy then a father say above there be roman to be reckoned with of course if be near josephus run risk going wherever doe will never be in greater risk mary than be together on lake other day god helped then brought through have faith that will do so again may be that be meant to do something useful before die at rate when roman come everyone will have to fight so will be in greater danger than one else know john be not speaking quite in earnest be sorry be going be only natural be proud that be to be near great leader believe that god will be shield protector now have better go in father will doubtless have much to say to evening mother will grudge minute be out of sight chapter revolt against rome that evening rabbi solomon ben manasseh came in be informed of offer josephus have made be present rabbi simon said at event took place in jerusalem at defeat of cestius john have be asking to tell more about matter for now that be to be with governor be well that must be well acquainted with public affair will willingly tell history for a say be right that young man must be

governor took part of greek many of people be killed more plundered when felix be recalled to rome sent deputation there with charge against greek by mean of bribery obtained decree against depriving jew of caesarea of right of equal citizenship from constant trouble arose outside caesarea festus kept quiet putting down robber a well a impostor who led people astray then there came trouble in

built high wall to cut off view agrippa demanded destruction on ground that intercepted view of roman guard appealed to nero sent to deputation headed by ismael high priest hilkiah treasurer obtained order for wall to be allowed to stand ismael hilkiah be detained at rome agrippa thereupon appointed high priest joseph soon afterwards nominated anna in place when festus roman governor be away anna put to death many of sect called christian to gratify sadducee people be indignant for men have done harm agrippa deprived of priesthood appointed jesus son of damnai then unhappily festus who be just good governor died albinus succeeded be man greedy of money ready to do anything for gain took bribe from robber encouraged rather than repressed evil doer there be open war in street between follower of various chief robber albinus opened prison filled city with malefactor at completion of work at temple eighteen thousand workman be discharged thus city be filled with men ready to sell service to highest bidder albinus be succeeded by gessius florus who be even worse than albinus man be great friend of cestius gallus who commanded roman troop in syria who therefore scoffed at complaint of people against florus at time strange prodigy appeared in rome sword of fire hung above city for whole year inner gate of temple required twenty men to move opened by chariot armed squadron be seen in heaven worse than priest in temple heard great movement sound of many voice said depart hence ' so thing went on in jerusalem until old feud at caesarea broke out afresh trouble time began about one

headed by john publican subscribed eight talent sent to florus a bribe that might order building to be stopped florus took money made many promise evil man desired that revolt must take place in order that might gain great plunder so went away from caesarea did nothing great tumult arose between heathen people in be worsted went away from city while john with twelve of highest rank went to samaria to lay matter before florus who threw into prison doubtless more to excite people at same time sent to jerusalem demanded seventeen talent from treasury of temple people burst into loud outcry florus

leader commanded to go forth receive with acclamation of welcome two cohort of troop who be advancing from caesarea priest called people together in temple with difficulty persuaded to obey order troop having order from florus fell upon people trampled down driving multitude before entered city at same time florus sallied out from palace with troop party pressed forward to gain castle of antonia whose possession must lay temple open to enable florus to gain sacred treasure deposited there a soon a people perceived object ran together in such vast crowd that roman soldier must not cut way through mass blocked up street while more active men going up on to roof hurled down stone missile upon troop what scene be that john be on portico near antonia saw be terrible to hear shout of soldier a strove to hew way through defenseless people war cry of own youth shriek wailing of woman while roman be still striving people broke down gallery connecting antonia with temple florus seeing that must not carry out object ordered troop to retire to quarter calling chief priest ruler proposed to leave city leaving behind one cohort to preserve peace a soon a have done so sent to cestius gallus lying account of tumult laying blame upon while bernice sister of king agrippa who have tried in vain to obtain mercy for people from florus sent complaint against cestius be moving to jerusalem to inquire into matter a said really to restore florus when fortunately king agrippa arrived from egypt while be yet seven mile from city procession of people met headed by woman whose

about destruction of city temple people exclaimed have taken up arm not against roman against florus agrippa urged to pay tribute repair gallery be willingly done sent out leading men to collect arrears of tribute soon brought in forty talent be going on well until agrippa tried to persuade to receive florus till emperor must send governor at thought of return of florus mad rage seized people poured abuse upon agrippa threw stone at ordered to leave city did retired to own kingdom upper class who possessed wisdom enough to know how great be power of rome still strove for peace people be beyond control seized fortress of masada very strong place near dead sea put roman garrison to sword what be even worse eleazar son of chief priest persuaded priest to reject offering regularly made in name of emperor to god of hebrew to make regulation that from time foreigner must be allowed to sacrifice in temple chief priest with head of pharisee addressed people in quadrangle of temple before eastern gate myself be one of who spoke told that temple have long benefited by splendid gift of stranger that be not only inhospitable impious to preclude from offering victim worshiping god there who be learned in law showed that be ancient immemorial usage to receive offering of stranger that refusal to accept roman gift be nothing short of declaration of war must do say availed nothing influence of eleazar be too great madness have seized people rejected word party of peace made one more effort sent deputation headed by simon son of ananias to florus to agrippa praying to march upon

upon slew metilius being alone spared after terrible massacre sadness fell on city felt that there be longer hope of making condition with rome have placed beyond pale of forgiveness be war to death with rome up to time a have told be one of who have labored to maintain peace have fought in palace by side of ananias have left only when troop of party be permitted to march out when surrendered from time took part hope of peace of concession of condition be at end there remained nothing now to fight a vengeance of rome must fall on whole jewish people be for whole jewish people to unite in struggle for existence on very day hour in roman be put to death retribution began to fall upon nation for greek of caesarea rose suddenly massacred jew twenty thousand be slain in single day news of

sohemus joined with four thousand men third of whom be rest archer thus have ten thousand roman troop thirteen thousand ally besides many volunteer who joined from syrian city after burning pillaging zebulon wasting district cestius returned to ptolemais then advanced to caesarea sent forward part of army to joppa city be open resistance be offered nevertheless roman slew to number of eight thousand five hundred city of galilee opened gate without resistance cestius advanced against jerusalem when arrived within six mile of town jew poured out fell upon with such fury that if horse light troop have not made circuit fallen upon in rear believe must have destroyed whole army be forced to fall back having killed over five hundred a roman moved forward simon son of gioras with band pressed closely in rear slew many carried off number of beast of burden agrippa now tried once more to make peace sent deputation to persuade to surrender offering in name of cestius pardon for have passed eleazar party fearing people might listen to fell upon deputation slew drove others back cestius advanced within mile of jerusalem after waiting three day in hope that jew must surrender knowing that many of chief person be friendly to advanced to attack took suburb of bezetha encamped opposite palace in upper city people discovered that ananias friend have agreed to open gate so slew threw body over wall roman for five day attacked on sixth cestius with flower of army made assault people fought bravely disregarding flight of arrow archer shot against held wall poured missile of kind upon enemy until at last just a seemed to that roman must succeed in mining wall firing gate cestius called off troop have not done so must speedily have taken city for peace party be on point of seizing one of gate opening no longer belonged to party for seemed to that be altogether too late now to make term must expect that roman must keep to condition after have set example of breaking faith cestius fell back to camp mile distant have rest there exultant at seeing retreat from wall people poured out fell upon roman with fury next morning cestius began to retreat swarmed around pressing upon rear dashing down from hill upon flank giving rest heavy armed roman must hing against marched steadily on leaving number of dead behind till reached former camp at gabao six mile away here cestius waited two day seeing how hill around swarmed with people who flocked in from quarter gave word for further retreat killing beast of burden leaving baggage behind taking on only animal bore arrow engine of war then marched down valley towards bethoron multitude felt now that enemy be delivered into hand be not in bethoron that joshua have defeated canaanite while sun stayed course be not here that juda maccabean have routed host of nicanor a soon a roman entered defile jew rushed down upon sure of prey roman horse be powerless to act men of legion must not climb rocky side from point javelin stone arrow be poured down upon must have be slain have not night come on hidden from enabled to reach bethoron what rejoicing be there not on hill night a looked down on camp there thought that in morning must be ours fire burned on crest hymn of praise exulting cry arose everywhere in darkness watch be not kept strictly enough cestius left four hundred of bravest men to mount guard keep fire alight so that might think that army be there then with rest stole away in morning saw that camp be well nigh deserted furious at escape of foe rushed down slew four hundred whom cestius have left behind then set out in pursuit cestius have many hour start though followed a far a antipatris must not overtake so returned with much rich spoil roman engine of war to jerusalem having with scarcely loss defeated great roman army slain five thousand three hundred foot three hundred eighty horse such be history of event have brought about present state of thing a see there be hope of pardon mercy from rome have offended beyond forgiveness madness against fought so hard at first be still upon people provoked power of rome then by breaking term massacring roman garrison went far beyond first offense of insurrection by destruction of army of cestius struck heavy blow against pride of roman for generation such misfortune have fallen upon arm what then must sane people have done since surely must have spent moment in preparing for struggle man must have be called to arm pass must have be fortified for be among hill that can best cope with heavy roman troop city best calculated for defense must have be strongly walled preparation made for place of refuge among mountain for woman child large depot of provision gathered up in readiness for strife that must ever in long run hope to resist successfully might of rome be out of question might so sternly valiantly have resisted a to be able to obtain fair term on submission instead of men go on a if rome have existence only show energy in quarreling among ourselves at bottom must seem that people rely upon god doing great thing for a did when smote assyrian army of sennacherib such be hope also seeing that so far wonderful success have attended yet how can one expect divine assistance in war so begun so conducted for people who turn sword against other who spend strength in civil feud who neither humble repent of wickedness of way ala son though speak brave word to people heart be very sad fear that trouble like fell upon when be carried captive into babylon await now there be silence a rabbi finished john have of course heard something of event have be taking place a now heard in sequence gravity danger of situation came freshly upon what can be done asked after long pause nothing save to pray to lord rabbi said sorrowfully josephus be doing what can towards building wall to town be not wall soldier be wanted so long a people remain blind indifferent to danger thinking of naught save tilling ground laying up money nothing can be done then will destruction come upon john asked looking round in bewildered hopeless way may hope not rabbi said here in galilee have have share in event in jerusalem many town even now be faithful to roman therefore may be that in province will not be involved in lot of jerusalem there can be unless mighty change take place general resistance to roman may be therefore that general destruction will fall upon people a to none can say vespasian roman general who have be charged by nero with command of army be gathering against be said to be merciful man a well a great commander roman mercy be not tender may be that very worst may not fall upon province men of spirit courage will doubtless proceed to jerusalem to share in defense of holy city if can not fight with success here be far better that men must fight at jerusalem leaving wife family here doing naught to call down vengeance of roman upon province in galilee there have a elsewhere be rising against roman will count for little in eye in comparison to terrible deed at jerusalem pray for sake of friend here that roman may march through land on way to jerusalem without burning wasting country here on eastern shore of galilee there be much more hope of escape than there be across lake not only be out of line of march of army there be few important city on side disposition of people have not be so hostile to roman own opinion be that when roman advance will be duty of jew who can bear arm to go down to defense of holy city position be one of vast strength will have number courage though order discipline may be at last lord will defend sanctuary save from destruction at hand of heathen must not be so can die how must jew better die than in defense of god temple must have be better simon said have not by evil doings have brought god temple into danger have suffered rabbi said way be not way of man may be that have suffered such madness to fall upon in order that name may at last be glorified may be so simon said piously now let to bed for hour be growing late following morning simon wife whole household accompanied john to shore a simon have arranged with one of boatman to take lad to hippo distance be short simon when wife have expressed surprise at sending john in boat said be not distance martha half hour walk be naught to lad have reason altogether apart from question of distance john be going out to play man part be young since lord josephus have chosen to place among who form bodyguard have right to claim to be regarded a man being so must not accompany to hippo for must seem like one leading child be best to let go by again be better to have one parting here will receive blessing say goodbye to doubtless will often be with for tiberias lie within sight so long a josephus remains in galilee will never be more than long day journey from home lad love will come a often a can surrounded a josephus be by danger boy will not be able to get away on own business must take duty a well a honor of office must not blind to fact that in one of popular tumult great danger even death may come upon seems to terrible went on in answer to exclamation of alarm from martha doe not seem so terrible to go on planting gathering in a if danger threatened evil day be far off be not so roman host be gathering be wasting strength in party strife be doing naught to prepare against storm have gone to war without counting cost have affronted put to shame rome before whom nation bow assuredly will take terrible vengeance year who can say who will be alive who dead who will be wandering over wasted field of people who will be slave in rome in time be at hand man life will be worth anything therefore say wife though there be danger peril around lad let not trouble overmuch for be like of in god hand therefore parting took place on shore simon solemnly blessed john mother cried over mary be little surprised at demonstration at what regarded a very temporary separation merry spirit be subdued at sight of aunt tear although saw nothing to cry about brightened up however when john whispered a said goodbye to will come across lake a often a can to see how be getting on mary then took place in stern of boat fisherman dipped oar in water boat drew away from little group who stood watching a made way across sparkling water to hippo upon landing john at once went to house where josephus be lodging latter gave in charge to leader of little group of men who have attached to a bodyguard joab said youth will henceforth make one of party be brave think ready quick witted give arm see that have be needful being young will be able to mingle unsuspected among crowd may obtain tidings of evil intended when men must not speak maybe before others whom might judge friend will be able to bear message unsuspected may prove of great service to cause john found at once that there be nothing like discipline regular duty among little band who constituted bodyguard of josephus be simply men who from affection for governor hatred for who by plot conspiracy must undo good work be accomplishing have left farm occupation to follow guard jewish boy received certain training in use of weapon in order to be prepared to fight in national army when day of deliverance must arrive beyond that jew have military training army must be simply gathering of men capable of bearing arm throughout land ready to give life for faith country relying like forefather on sword of lord israel without slightest idea of military drill discipline tactic such army might fight bravely might die nobly must have little chance of victory over well trained legion of imperial rome at noon josephus embarked in galley with little band of follower eight in number sailed across lake to tiberias here landed went up to house in josephus always dwelt when in city stay there be generally short tarichea being general abode for there felt in safety inhabitant being devoted to while of tiberias be ever ready to follow advice of disaffected section be eager for return of roman renewal of business trade have brought wealth to city before trouble began that evening josephus sent for john said purpose in two day to go to tarichea where will spend sabbath hear that there be rumor that many of citizen have privately sent to king agrippa asking to send hither roman troop promising good reception men with be known to many in city must be shunned by enemy so must hear naught of what be going on therefore purpose to leave here in morning go early to house of samuel son of gideon dwells in street called that of tarichea for leadeth in direction of town be tanner by trade will have difficulty in finding have be here evening have spoken to about when present to will take in thus one will know that be of company pas time in street when see group of people assemble join to gather what be saying if be ought be important for to know come here tell if be after have departed for tarichea bring news there be thirty furlong distant john followed up instruction given be hospitably received by samuel tanner in course of day number of citizen called upon josephus begged at once to set about building wall for town a have already built for tarichea when assured that have already made preparation for doing so that builder must set to work forthwith appeared satisfied city remained perfectly tranquil until josephus left next morning for tarichea chapter lull before storm galley carried josephus from tiberias be scarcely out of sight when john who be standing in marketplace watching busy scene with amusement heard shout raised roman be coming at once people left business ran to outskirt of city john ran with on arriving there saw party of roman horseman riding along at great distance people began to shout loudly to to come into town calling out that citizen be loyal to king agrippa roman that hated traitor josephus roman halted made sign of entering town fearing that treachery be intended remembering fate of comrade who have trusted to jewish faith when surrendered tower of hippicus phasaelus mariamne movement however spread through city people assembled in crowd shouting death to josephus exclaiming for roman king agrippa such a be loyal to josephus did not venture to raise voice so numerous furious be multitude whole city be soon in open revolt citizen arming in readiness for war a soon a saw course affair be taking john made way out of town ran at top of speed to tarichea where arrived in little over hour be directed at once to house of josephus who rose in surprise at table at be seated writing at john entry scarcely have left lord than roman horseman approached near town whereupon whole city rose in revolt shouting to to enter take possession in name of king breathing out threat against roman have not entered a came away populace be in arm friend did not venture to lift up voice tiberias have wholly revolted to roman be bad news indeed josephus said gravely have seven armed men who accompanied from tiberias here who be assembled in city bade disperse so soon a arrived in order that might go to town village for sabbath be to send round country must speedily get great force together in few hour sabbath will begin be contrary to law to fight upon sabbath even though necessity be great yet if people of tiberias march hither can hardly hope to resist successfully for men of town be too few to man full extent of wall be most necessary to put down rising before king agrippa can send large number of troop into tiberias yet can hing until sabbath be past must shed blood if can be avoided hitherto have put down rising caused sepphoris tiberias other city to expel evildoer return to obedience by tact by great force must bring against without need of bloodshed time fear great trouble will come of since can not take prompt measure enemy will have time to organize force to receive help from john of gischala other robber to say nothing of roman josephus walked up down room in agitation then stood looking out into harbor ah exclaimed suddenly may yet frighten into submission call in joab when joab entered josephus explained to in few word condition of thing at tiberias then proceeded send quickly to principal men of town bid put trusty men at of gate let none pas out order fighting men to man wall in case of tiberias must come hither at once then let one two able fellow embark on board of boat vessel in port taking with two three of infirm aged men send fast galley across to hippo bid fisherman set out at once with boat join off tiberias will not approach close enough to city for people to see how feebly be manned when perceive ship making towards will think have with great army with purpose to destroy city order be very quickly carried out josephus embarked with eight companion in one ship followed by two hundred thirty vessel of various size sailed towards tiberias a approached town saw great movement among population men woman be seen crowding down to shore men holding up hand to show that be unarmed woman wailing uttering loud cry of lamentation josephus waited for hour until ship from hippo also came up then caused to anchor off town at distance that number of on board must not be seen then advanced in own ship to within speaking distance of land people cried out to to spare city wife child saying that have be misled by evil men regretted bitterly what have done josephus told that assuredly deserved that city must be wholly destroyed for now when there be so much that have to be done to prepare for war rome must make against country troubled country with sedition people set up doleful cry for mercy josephus then said that time must spare that principal men must be handed over to to people joyfully agreed boat with ten of senate came out to vessel josephus have bound sent on board one of other ship boat load came off until member of senate many of principal inhabitant be prisoner of men have be drawn from other ship put on board with prisoner then sailed away to tarichea people of tiberias terrified at seeing so many taken away not knowing how many more might be demanded now denounced young man named clitus a being leader of revolt seven of bodyguard of josephus have gone down lake with prisoner one levi alone remained josephus told to go ashore to cut off one of hand of clitus levi be however afraid to land alone among such number of enemy whereupon josephus addressed clitus told that be worthy of death that must spare life if two hand be sent on board ship clitus begged that might be permitted to keep one hand to josephus agreed clitus then drew sword struck off left hand josephus now professed to be satisfied after warning people against again listening to evil adviser sailed away with whole fleet josephus that evening entertained principal person among prisoner in morning allowed to return to tiberias people there have already learned that have be duped with time have come reflection knowing that in day two josephus must have assembled whole population of galilee against have destroyed before help must come there be few who be not well content that revolt have be so easily bloodlessly repressed josephus rose in estimation by quickness boldness of stratagem by have without bloodshed save in punishment of clitus restored tranquillity through winter josephus be incessantly active endeavored to organize army enrolled hundred thousand men appointed commander captain strove to establish something like military drill order people be averse to leaving farm occupation little progress be made moreover great part of time of josephus be occupied in suppressing revolt be continually breaking out in sepphoris tiberias gamala in thwarting attempt of john of gischala other enemy who strove by mean of bribery at jerusalem to have recalled must have succeeded have not be that galilean save of great city be always ready to turn out in force to defend by sending deputation to jerusalem counteracted effort there of enemy john be incessantly engaged a accompanied josephus in rapid journey through province to suppress rising to see to work of organization only once twice be able to pay short visit to family look worn fagged john cousin said on occasion of last visit when spring be close at hand be well in health mary doe try one to see how effort of josephus be marred by turbulence of people of tiberias sepphoris thought time be occupied in keeping order work of organizing army make little progress vespasian be gathering great force at son titus will soon join with legion will together advance against hear that walling of city be well nigh finished be so mary doubtless many of will be able to make long defense after taking of city be mere question of time roman have great siege engine nothing can withstand even if wall be so strong that must not be battered down city must in time be reduced by famine be not for who be boy to judge doings of elder seems to that walling of city be altogether wrong can give aid to other one by one must fall within perish be made slave for roman give quarter when capture city by storm seems to that must be far better to hold jerusalem only with strong force of fighting men for rest of men capable of carrying arm to gather among hill there to fight roman when legion of cestius be destroyed showed that among defile on rocky ground active lightly armed men be match for roman soldier in heavy armor in way think that might check even legion of vespasian woman old men child must gather in city admit roman when approached in case must suffer harm for roman be clement when not opposed a be seems to that in end destruction will fall on alike here in galilee have leader be hampered by dissension jealousy samaria stand neutral jerusalem ought to take lead be torn by faction there be war in street think only of herself naught of country although must know that when roman have crushed down opposition elsewhere must sooner later fall country seems possessed with madness see hope in future save in god of israel mary said gently be what simon martha say save in john assented dear suffered to be carried away into babylon how be to expect aid now when people do naught for when city be divided in when street be wet with blood very altar defiled by conflict when evil men be made high priest rule authority be at end what right have to expect aid at hand of jehovah greatest comfort mary be that lie here on east of lake that be within jurisdiction of king agrippa on side authority have never be altogether thrown off though of city have made common cause with of other side still may hope that on side of jordan may escape horror of war be out of spirit john take gloomy view of thing know that simon too think that everything will end badly have heard say that too be glad that farm lie on side of lake that wish gamala have not thrown off authority of king so that there might be naught to bring roman across jordan mother be more hopeful trust in god for a say though wealthy powerful may have forsaken people still cling to will not let fall into hand of enemy hope will be so mary own be out of spirit look at matter in worst light however will have talk with father tonight evening john have long conversation with simon repeated foreboding have expressed to mary at rate father hope that when roman approach will at least send away mother mary woman to place of safety be few mile from gamala if roman come there besiege will spread through country will pillage even if slay in village if a trust god will give victory to arm can return in peace if not let at least be free from danger be threatening have be thinking of john fortnight since sent old isaac to mother brother whose farm a know lie upon slope of mount hermon few mile from neve very near boundary of manasseh to ask if will receive martha mary woman until trouble be over will gladly do so purpose sending away a soon a hear that roman have crossed frontier be indeed rejoiced to hear father let tarry for let go a soon a snow have melted on mount hermon for roman cavalry will spread quickly over land let go a soon a road be fit for travel will feel weight off mind when know that be safe doe mother know what have decided know john in truth be reluctant to go say at present that if stay also will stay trust father that will overrule mother that will either go with if stay will insist upon going must not overcome opposition finally suffer with miriam older woman to remain with hope that will send mary young one to uncle danger with be vastly greater roman unless blood be heated by opposition may not interfere with old people who be valueless a slave young one stopped have thought over son even if mother remains here with will assuredly send off mary young maiden to mountain make mind easy on score old people have taken root on land be father will not leave may befall may be that mother will tarry here with young woman will assuredly be sent away until danger be over not that think peril be a great a seems to people have ever shown courageous in great danger know fate awaits after provoking anger of rome know be fighting for faith for country family will fight desperately greatly outnumber roman at least army by will first be attacked maybe if can resist that may make term with rome for assuredly in long run must overpower must think with father john said shaking head if saw anything like union among people lose heart when see how divided be how blind to storm be coming against how careless a to anything trouble of day how intent upon work of farm business how disinclined to submit to discipline to prepare for day of battle be young son full of enthusiasm be hard to stir men whose life have traveled in one groove from ordinary course in history although have be ready to assemble meet foe have ever be ready to lay by sword when danger be past to return to home family have be nation of fighting men never nation with army yes father because trusted in god to give victory on day of battle be army when fought with conquered when abstained be beaten suffered to fall into hand of roman instead of repenting of sin have sinned more more news from jerusalem be worse worse there be civil war in street robber be master worst of people sit in high place be so son god anger still burn fiercely people perish yet may be that will be merciful in end hope so father for assuredly hope be only in early in spring vespasian be joined by king agrippa with force advanced to ptolemais here titus joined father having brought troop from alexandria by sea force of vespasian now consisted of fifth tenth fifteenth legion besides have three cohort ten of numbered thousand footman rest six hundred footman hundred fifty horse allied force contributed by agrippa others consisted of two thousand archer thousand horse while malchus king of arabia sent thousand horse five thousand archer total force amounted to sixty thousand regular troop besides great number of camp follower who be trained to military service must fight in case of need vespasian have encountered resistance on march down to ptolemais inhabitant of country through passed forsook village farm retired according to order have received to fortified town there be army to meet roman in field effort at organization josephus have made bore fruit whatever sooner have invader entered country than lay at mercy save only walled city into people have crowded in range of mountain stretching across upper galilee be three place of great strength gabara gischala jotapata last named have be very strongly fortified by josephus here intended to take up own position be pitiful sight truly joab remarked to john a saw long line of fugitive men woman child with such belonging a must carry on own back of beast of burden be pitiful sight be not be pitiful sight joab one fill with foreboding a well a with pity what agony may not poor people be doomed to suffer when roman lay siege to jotapata can never take joab said scornfully wish must think so joab when did roman ever lay siege to place fail to capture once twice three time may fail in end assuredly will take look at position see how wild be country through will have to march have made road over world joab will make very short work of difficulty here may take roman week month to besiege of strong place will assuredly carry in end then better thousand time that men have in first place slain woman rushed to die on roman sword seems to john joab said stiffly that be over bold in thus criticising plan of general may be so john said recklessly methinks when be risking life man may have right to opinion be ready like rest to die when time come that doe not prevent having opinion besides seems to that there be heresy in questioning plan of general love josephus must willingly give life for have shown wise ruler firm to carry out what be right to suppress evildoer after have not served in war be full of resource will doubt not devise mean to check roman even so may not be able to cope in war with such general a theirs who have won experience over world may general plan of defense have adopted be best suited for occasion must have fight roman in open joab said scornfully what have be done in south see how people marched out from jerusalem under john essene niger of peraea silas babylonian to attack ascalon held by one cohort of roman foot one troop of horse what happened antoninus roman commander charged army without fear rode through through broke up into fragment slew till night time when ten thousand men with john silas lay dead not satisfied with defeat in short time niger advanced again against ascalon when antoninus sallied out again slew eight thousand of thus eighteen thousand men be killed by one weak cohort of foot troop of horse yet say ought not to hide behind wall to meet in open must not meet in open where roman cavalry must charge at rate not until people have learned discipline must harass attack in defile a cestius be attacked harassing night day giving peace rest never allowing to meet in plain moving rapidly hither among mountain leaving woman in city must offer resistance so that roman must have point to strike at until at length when have gained confidence discipline order must be able to take bolder measure gradually fight hand to hand maybe be right lad joab said thoughtfully like not being cooped up in stronghold myself methinks that mountain warfare such a speak of must suit genius of people be light limbed active inured to fatigue for be nation of cultivator brave assuredly ready to give life say that in fight near ascalon not jew fled fight must not be powerless against rush of heavy roman horse died a stood destroyed not defeated gabara gischala jotapata may fall lad will be only after defense so desperate that haughty roman may well hesitate for if such be resistance of little mountain town what will not be task of conquering jerusalem garrisoned by whole nation be true john said if death here be for safety of jerusalem will not have died in vain doubt whether such men a who have power in jerusalem will agree to term however favorable that may be offered may be that be god will that must be so two day ago a journeyed hither after going down to sepphoris with message from general to of principal inhabitant there met old man traveling with wife family asked whether be on way hither said 'no ' be going across jordan through manasseh over mount hermon into trachonitis said that be follower of christ who be put to death in jerusalem thirty five year since whom many people still believe be messiah say that foretold destruction of jerusalem by roman warned follower not to stay in walled city to fly to desert when time came messiah be to save israel joab said scornfully christ must not save even know not john said simply have heard of from others father heard preach several time near lake say that be man of wondrous power that preached new doctrine say that did not talk about claim to be messiah that simply told people to be kind good to other to love god do will father said that thought be good holy man full of spirit of god did work of great power too bore meekly like other man father always regard a prophet said that grieved when heard that have be put to death at jerusalem if be prophet what said about destruction of jerusalem must have weight with who heard agreed that be good man joab assented have never known one of who heard say otherwise maybe be prophet certainly called upon people to repent turn from sin have done a taught evil might not have fallen upon god must doubtless have be ready to aid people a of old however be too late to think about now want thought for matter have in hand have done that can to put town into state of defense methinks if roman ever penetrate through mountain forest will see that have task will tax power before take position of town be indeed immensely strong stood on summit of lofty mass of rock on three side fell abruptly down into deep almost impassable ravine surrounded on north side alone where ridge sloped more gradually down must be approached town extended part of way down declivity at foot josephus have built strong wall on side be lofty mountain covered with thick forest town must not be seen by enemy until be close at hand a soon a vespasian have arrived at ptolemais on site of city stand modern acre be met by deputation from sepphoris that city have only be prevented from declaring for roman by exertion of josephus knowledge that galilee must follow to attack must revolt a soon a vespasian arrived at ptolemais be scarce twenty mile away sent deputy with submission to begging that force might be sent to defend against attack by jew vespasian received with courtesy sent placidus with thousand horse six thousand foot to city infantry took up quarter in town horseman made raid over plain burning village slaying men capable of bearing arm carrying off rest of population a slave day after conversation between joab john man brought news to jotapata placidus be marching against josephus at once ordered fighting men to assemble marching out placed in ambuscade in mountain on road by roman must approach a soon a latter have fairly entered pas jew sprang to foot hurled javelin shot arrow among roman in vain endeavored to reach assailant number be wounded a tried to climb height few be killed for be so completely covered by armor shield that jewish missile thrown from distance seldom inflicted mortal wound be however unable to make way further placidus be obliged to retire to sepphoris having failed signally in gaining credit have hoped for from capture of strongest of jewish stronghold in upper galilee jew on part be greatly inspirited by success of first encounter with roman returned rejoicing to stronghold being ready at jotapata josephus with considerable number of fighting men proceeded to gari not far from sepphoris where army have assembled sooner have news arrived that great army of vespasian be in movement than dispersed in direction josephus be left with mere handful of follower with whom fled to tiberias thence wrote earnest letter to jerusalem saying that unless strong army be fitted out put in field be useless to attempt to fight roman that must be wiser to come to term with than to maintain useless resistance must bring destruction upon nation remained short time only at tiberias thence hurried up with follower to jotapata reached on th of may vespasian marched first to gadara be undefended fighting men having gone to jotapata although resistance be offered vespasian put male to sword burned town village in neighborhood then advanced against jotapata for four day pioneer of roman army have labored incessantly cutting road through forest filling up ravine clearing away obstacle on fifth day road be constructed close up to jotapata on th of may placidus ebutius be sent forward by vespasian with thousand horse to surround town cut off possibility of escape on following day vespasian with whole army arrived there defender of jotapata must scarcely believe eye when saw long heavy column with baggage siege engine marching along straight level road where have believed that must be next to impossible for even infantry of enemy to make way if marvel have be accomplished in five day what hope be there that city must be able to withstand force have so readily triumphed over defense of nature chapter siege of jotapata well joab what do think now john said a stood on wall with older companion watching seemingly endless column of enemy seems to that be caught here like rat in trap that must have done better thousand time in maintaining freedom of movement among mountain be one thing to cut road must be to clear off forest from anti libanus so long a there be forest to shelter roman must never have overtaken here there be nothing to do to die be so john own that counsel urged must have be wiser than here be best fighting men in galilee shut up without hope of succor of mercy well lad can at least teach roman lesson that jew know how to die capture of mountain town will cost a much a reckoned must suffice for conquest of whole country jotapata may save jerusalem yet john be coward be prepared to fight to last be young love of life be strong within thought of old father mother who have child of pretty mary far away now hoped on slope of mount hermon of grief that death must cause to resolved that although must do duty must strain nerve to preserve life so dear to have no longer duty to perform other than common to able to bear arm when roman attacked place must be near josephus be sally ordered must issue out with general until then time be own there be mission to be performed now fear of plot against life of general therefore be free to wander where liked save newly erected wall across neck of rock below town there be defense for be deemed impossible for man to climb cliff fell sheer down at other point john strolled quietly round town stopping now then to look over low wall bordered precipice erected solely to prevent child from falling over depth be very great seemed to that there must be escape anywhere save on side be now blocked by wall must ere long be trebly blocked by roman town be crowded at ordinary time might contain near three four thousand inhabitant now over twenty five thousand have gathered there of more than half be men many have brought wife child with vacant foot of ground be taken up inhabitant shared home with stranger accommodation be altogether insufficient greater part of newcomer have erected little tent shelter of cloth blanket in upper part of town there be at present comparatively few people about for greater part have gone to slope whence watched with terror dismay great roman column a poured down in unbroken line hour after hour news of destruction have fallen on gadara have be brought in by fugitive knew that although resistance have be offered there male have be put to death woman taken captive there be naught then to be gained by surrender even have anyone dared to propose a for victory over host a be marching to assault none must hope for for hold out a might repel assault on wall there be enemy within must conquer for jotapata possessed well water have daily to be fetched by woman from stream in ravine although store of grain have be collected sufficient to last for many month supply of water stored up in cistern must scarce suffice to supply multitude gathered on rock for fortnight death then certain inevitable awaited yet occasional wail from woman a pressed child to breast alone told of despair reigned in heart greater portion looked out silent a if stupefied have relied absolutely on mountain forest to block progress of invader have thought that at worst must have have to deal with few company of infantry only thus sight of sixty thousand roman troop swelled to nigh hundred thousand by camp follower artificer with cavalry machine of war seemed like terrible nightmare after making circuit of rock wandering for time among impromptu camp in street john returned to group of boy whom have noticed leaning against low wall with carelessness a to danger of fall over precipice proved that must be native of place if there be possible way of descending precipice said to will be boy who will know of where goat must climb boy born among mountain must try to follow if only to excel other in daring to risk breaking neck thus thinking walked up to group who be from twelve to fifteen year old suppose belong to town began there be general assent from five boy who looked with considerable respect at john who although two year senior of eldest among wore man garb carried sword buckler be one of bodyguard of governor john went on dare say can tell sort of thing about country may be useful for to know be quite certain that one must climb up rock from below that there be fear of roman making surprise in way boy looked at other one volunteered to give information come john went on have only just left off being boy be always climbing into sort of place when got chance have doubt be same with when have be down below there have tried how far can get up did ever get up far did ever hear of anyone getting up far expect have be up a far a anyone eldest of boy said went up after young kid have strayed away from mother got up long way half way up must say must get further be barefooted too be sure one with armor on must have got up anything like so far believe must get up fifty foot have of ever tried to get down from above shook head jonas son of james did once one of smaller boy said have pet hawk have tamed flew away perched good way down clambered down to fetch have rope tied round of others held in case must slip know went down good way got hawk father beat for doing know be here now john asked yes be here boy said that be father house one close to edge of rock know whether will find there now ai indoors more than can help own mother dead father got wife get on well together well will have chat with one of day be quite sure that there be possible path up from below wo say there be possible path eldest boy said feel quite sure there be not have looked hundred of time when have be down below feel pretty sure that if there have be place where goat must have got up must have noticed see rock go down almost straight in most place anyhow have never heard of anyone who ever got up if anyone have done must have be talked about for year year doubt must john agreed so will tell governor that need not be in least uneasy about attack except in front so saying nodded to boy walked away again in evening whole of roman army have arrived vespasian drew up troop on hill le than mile to north of city there encamped next morning triple line of embankment be thrown up by roman around foot of hill where alone escape issue be possible entirely cut off within town from possibility of flight jew looked on at preparation a wild animal might regard line of hunter surrounding dull despair of previous day have now be succeeded by fierce rage hope there be none must die doubtless must die fighting fiercely till last disdaining to be pent up within wall many of fighting men encamped outside boldly went forward to meet enemy vespasian called up slinger archer poured missile upon jew while with heavy infantry began to mount slope towards part of wall appeared weakest josephus at once summoned fighting men in town sallying at head through gate rushed down flung upon roman side fought bravely roman strong in discipline skill with weapon defensive armor jew fighting with valor of despair heightened by thought of wife child in town above roman be pushed down hill fight continued at foot until darkness came on when party drew off number of killed on side be small for buckler helmet defended vital point roman have thirteen killed very many wounded jew seventeen killed six hundred wounded john have fought bravely by side of josephus joab two others of little band be killed others be wounded more le severely for josephus be always in front chosen follower kept close to in heat of fight john felt spirit rise higher than have done since trouble have begun have fought at first so recklessly that josephus have checked with word steady brave lad fight best who fight most coolly more guard more will kill more than once when josephus whose commanding figure evident leadership attracted attention of roman soldier be surrounded cut off john with three four others made way through to brought off when became dark party drew off roman sullenly for felt disgrace to have be thus driven back by foe despised jew with shout of triumph for have proved match for first soldier in world dread with glittering column have inspired have passed away following day jew again sallied out attacked roman a advanced for five day in succession combat raged jew fighting with desperate valor roman with steady resolution at end of time jew have be forced back behind wall roman established in front of vespasian seeing that wall must not be carried by assault a have expected called council of war be determined to proceed by regular process of siege to erect bank against part of wall offered greatest facility for attack accordingly whole army with exception of troop who guarded bank of circumvallation went into mountain to get material stone timber in vast quantity be brought down when be in readiness work commenced sort of penthouse roofing constructed of wattle covered with earth be first raised to protect worker from missile of enemy upon wall here working party labored securely while rest of troop brought up earth stone wood for use jew did best to interfere with work hurling down huge stone upon penthouse sometimes breaking down support of roof causing gap through poured storm of arrow javelin until damage have be repaired to protect workman vespasian brought up siege engine of have hundred sixty from vast quantity of missile be discharged at jew upon wall catapult threw javelin ball of fire blazing arrow while ballista hurled huge stone swept lane through rank of defender at same time light armed troop arab archer of agrippa antiochus kept up rain of arrow so that became impossible for jew to remain on wall be not inactive sallying out in small party fell with fury upon working party who having stripped off heavy armor be unable to resist sudden onslaught driving out slaying before jew so often applied fire to wattle timber of bank that vespasian be obliged to make work continuous along whole extent of wall to keep out assailant in spite of effort of jew embankment rose steadily until almost equaled height of wall struggle now went on between combatant on even term being separated only by short interval between wall bank josephus found that in such conflict roman with crowd of archer slinger formidable machine have advantage that be absolutely necessary to raise wall still higher called together number of principal men pointed out necessity for agreed with urged that be impossible for men to work exposed to storm of missile josephus replied that have thought of number of strong post be prepared at night be fixed securely standing on wall along top of strong rope be stretched on be hung touching other hide of newly killed ox formed complete screen hiding worker from sight of on embankment illustration heightening wall of jotapata under shelter of ox hide hide when struck with stone from ballista gave way deadened force of missile while arrow javelin glanced off from slippery surface behind shelter garrison worked night day raising post screen a work proceeded until have heightened wall no le than thirty five foot with number of tower on summit strong battlement facing roman besieger be much discouraged at want of success enraged at finding effort of so large army completely baffled by small town have expected to carry at first assault while jew proportionately rejoiced becoming more more confident continually sallied out in small party through gateway by ladder from wall attacked roman upon embankment set fire to be desperation with men fought even more than success in defending wall discouraged roman for jew be utterly careless of life be well content to die when saw that have achieved object of setting fire to roman work vespasian at length determined to turn siege into blockade to starve out town must not capture accordingly contented by posting strong force to defend embankment withdrew main body of army to encampment have be informed of shortness of supply of water have anticipated that in very short time thirst must compel inhabitant to yield john have taken full share in fighting have frequently earned warm commendation of josephus spirit have risen with conflict must not shut eye to fact that sooner later roman must become master of place one evening therefore when have done share of duty on wall went up to house have be pointed out to a in lived boy who have descended face of rock for distance at short distance from door lad of fifteen year old with covering piece of ragged sackcloth round loin be crouched up in corner seemingly asleep at sound of john footstep opened eye in quick watchful way showed that have not be really asleep be jonas son of james john asked yes be boy said rising to foot what do want with want to have talk with john said be one of governor bodyguard think perhaps may be able to give useful information well come away from here boy said else will be having nodded to house coming out with stick have rather hard time of from what hear john began when stopped at wall short distance away from house have that boy said look like do john agreed looking at boy thin half starved figure yet there be plenty to eat in town there may be boy said anyhow get share father be away fighting on wall so be worse than ever be always beating dare not go back now told morning sooner roman came in better must be pleased must only kill there must be end of must send to rome for slave then must see how liked being cuffed beaten day be hungry now john asked be pretty near always hungry boy said well come along with then have got little room to myself will have a much to eat a like room john occupied have formerly be loft over stable in rear of house in josephus now lodged be reached by ladder from outside have shared at first with two of comrade have fallen during siege after seeing boy up into went to house procured abundant meal took with small horn of water back to quarter here be plenty for to eat jonas not much to drink be on short allowance same a rest of people be afraid that wo last long there be twinkle of amusement in boy face without word set to work at food eating ravenously that john have brought latter be surprised to see that did not touch water for thought that if stepmother deprived of food of there be abundance must all more deprive of water of ration to person be so scanty now john said have better throw away bit of sackcloth take garment belonged to comrade of mine who have be killed there be too much of boy said if mind tearing in half will take do a like with john replied boy tore long strip of cotton in two wrapped half of round loin now said what do want to ask tell jonas that be first rate climber can go anywhere boy nodded can get about can have be tending goat pretty well ever since must walk where can go can want to know in first place whether there be possible way by one can get up down from place except by road through wall boy be silent now look here jonas john went on feeling sure that lad must tell something if must if must point out way down governor must be very pleased a long a siege last can live here with have a much food a want not go near stepmother of yours at nobody will beat for telling boy asked certainly not jonas must take beyond roman have got guard round might enable to get down to water john urged sight of unemptied horn causing thought to flash through mind that boy have be in habit of going down getting water well will tell boy said like to tell because think there be anyone here know found out never said word about because be able to slip away when liked one know anything about doe make much difference now because roman be going to kill so will tell at end of rock have to climb down about fifty foot be very steep there be a much a can do to get down when have got down far get to head of sort of dried up water course ai very difficult to go down there way can get right down to stream look from below a if must do roman have put guard on stream just there know because go down morning a soon a get light never tried to get through roman sentry expect one must if one tried see how be to bring water up here if be what want tell be a much a can do to get up down want hand foot must go down bring up little water for in skin hanging round neck if like be afraid must be much good jonas john said might be very useful to send message out way yes boy said see have always intended when roman took place to make off way if other people go be pretty sure to be found out before long then roman will keep watch much matter know place where must lie hidden time if have got enough to eat drink will show mind must promise not to tell anyone else there be room for more than two mean to tell unless promise will promise jonas promise faithfully not to tell anyone well way down ai far from other one will show one of day went down there once to get hawk have taken from nest tamed went down first with rope tied round found must have done without did tell of others a wanted to keep place to myself climb down about fifty foot then get on sort of ledge about three foot wide six seven foot long ca see from above because be hollow a if bit of rock have fallen out of course if stood up might be seen by someone below on hill opposite be so high be not likely anyone must notice anyhow if lie down there one must see have be down there often often since when get too bad to bear go down there take sleep lie there laugh when think how be hunting about for to carry down pail to stream for water will say nothing about jonas may be quite sure that place may save life other path will tell josephus about may find of great use josephus be indeed greatly pleased when heard that way existed by must send out message two three active men be chosen for work must not venture to descend steep precipice by jonas made way down to top of water course be lowered by rope to point before starting be sewn up in skin so that if roman sentry caught sight of making way down water course on hand foot must take for dog other animal once at bottom lay still till night then crawled through line of sentry in way josephus be able to send out dispatch to friend outside to jerusalem imploring to send army at once to harass rear of roman to afford opportunity for garrison of jotapata to cut way out message came back by return for three week communication be thus kept up until one of messenger slipped while descending ravine a rolled down attracted attention of roman who after placed strong guard at foot of water course until discovery be made jonas have gone down regularly morning drank fill have brought up small skin of water to john who have divided among child whom saw most in want of for pressure of thirst be now heavy roman from rising ground at distance have noticed woman going daily with jug to cistern whence water be doled out besieger directed missile to point many be killed daily while fetching water dull despair now seized jew so long a be fighting have have little time to think of situation now that enemy no longer attacked there be nothing to do to sit down suffer hopelessness of position stared in face there be thought of surrender knew too well fate awaited at hand of roman be therefore seized with rage indignation when heard that josephus of principal men be thinking of making endeavor to escape john who have hitherto regarded leader with passionate devotion although thought that have be wrong in taking to fortified town instead of fighting among mountain shared in general indignation at proposed desertion be who have brought here said to jonas who have attached to with dog like fidelity now proposes to go away leave everyone here to be massacred can not believe news be however well founded for when inhabitant crowded down to house woman weeping wailing men sullen fierce to beg josephus to abandon intention governor attempted to argue that be for public good that must leave might said hurry to jerusalem bring army to rescue people however be in way convinced if go said roman will speedily capture city be ready to die together to share one common fate leave a josephus saw that if did not accede to prayer of woman men must interfere by force to prevent carrying out intention told must remain with tranquillity be at once restored men however came again again to asking to be led out to attack roman let die fighting be cry let die among foe not with agony of thirst must make come up to attack again josephus said will fight to far greater advantage so than if sallied out to attack in own intrenchment when must be shot down by archer slinger before ever must reach how be to make attack want nothing better will think over josephus said tell in morning in morning to surprise of men be ordered to dip large number of garment into precious supply of water to hang on wall be outcry of woman a saw scanty store of water upon life depended so wasted order be obeyed roman be astonished at seeing long line of dripping garment on wall stratagem have effect vespasian thought that news have received that place be ill supplied with water must be erroneous ordered troop again to take station on wall renew attack great be exultation among jew when saw movement among troop josephus ordering fighting men together said that now be opportunity there be hope of safety in passive resistance therefore have best sally out if must die leave at least glorious example to posterity proposal be joyfully received placed at head gate be suddenly opened poured out to attack so furious be onslaught that roman be driven from embankment jew pursued crossed line of circumvallation attacked roman in camp tearing up hide penthouse behind roman defended setting fire to line in many place fight raged day jew then retired to city only to sally out again following morning for three day attack be continued jew driving in roman day retiring when vespasian brought up heavy column who be unable from weight of armor to follow lightly armed assailant vespasian then ordered regular troop to remain in camp assault being repelled by archer slinger finding that courage of jew be unabated that troop be losing heavily in irregular fighting determined to renew siege at hazard bring matter to close heavy armed troop be ordered to be in readiness to advance against wall with battering ram be pushed forward by great number of men being covered a advanced with great shield constructed of wattle hide a be brought forward archer slinger covered advance by shower of missile against defender of wall while war machine poured in terrible shower jew unable to show above battlement to oppose advance of terrible machine crouched in shelter until battering ram be placed in position then rope by swung from framework overhead be seized by number of soldier first blow be delivered at wall quivered beneath terrible shock cry of dismay arose from defender again again heavy ram struck in same place wall tottered beneath blow must soon have fallen have not josephus ordered number of sack to be filled with straw let down by rope from wall so a to deaden blow of ram for time roman ceased work then fastening scythe to end of long pole cut rope jew be unable to show above wall to interfere with men at work in few minute sack be cut down ram recommenced work of destruction chapter fall of city roman soldier seeing wall of jotapata tremble beneath blow of battering ram whose iron head pounded to powder stone against struck redoubled effort when suddenly from three sally port have prepared jew burst out carrying weapon in right hand blazing torch in left a on previous occasion onslaught be irresistible swept roman before set fire to engine wattle palisade even to woodwork of embankment timber have by time dried a bitumen pitch have be used a cement in construction of work flame spread with great rapidity work of many day be destroyed in hour engine breastwork of fifth tenth legion be entirely consumed just a attack began son of sameas galilean with immense stone from wall struck iron head of battering ram knocked off then leaped down from wall seized iron head carried back into city be pierced by five arrow still pressed on regained wall held up iron head in sight of then fell down dead such be spirit with jew be animated roman soldier trained a be to conflict among many people be yet astounded by valor displayed by race that have considered a unwarlike peasant roman be not discouraged heavy mass of troop be brought up jew be driven within wall towards evening ram be again in position while vespasian be directing attack be struck by javelin in heel roman ceased from attack crowded round general a soon a ascertained that wound be not serious returned to attack with redoubled fury night contest raged unceasingly roman engine swept wall with missile tower came crashing down under blow of huge stone while javelin arrow stone from sling created terrible havoc among defender of wall a fast a fell fresh combatant took place continued hurling down stone blazing brand upon freshly erected wattle round battering ram roman have advantage in strife for while fire on wall at jew lighted brand boiled pitch sulphur in be dipped enabled to aim accurately worked in deep shadow at foot of wall night be terrible one bolt stone arrow passed over wall spread ruin death over town din be unceasing thundering noise of great stone dull deep sound a ram struck wall fierce shout of combatant a fought hand to hand for corps be in place piled so thick that assailant must mount upon to top of wall shriek of woman scream of child combined in one terrible confused noise be echoed back multiplied by surrounding mountain morning be just breaking when shaken wall gave way fell with crash vespasian called off weary troop allowed short time for refreshment then prepared to storm breach brought up first number of bravest horseman dismounted clad in complete armor be provided with long pike be to charge forward instant machine for mounting breach be fixed behind be best of infantry while in rear be archer slinger other party with scaling ladder be to attack uninjured part of wall to draw off attention of besieger rest of horse extended over hill round town so that none might make escape josephus prepared to receive attack placed old infirm wounded to repel attack on uninjured part of wall then chose five strongest bravest men with took place to form front line of defender of breach told to kneel down cover head with buckler until enemy archer have emptied quiver when roman have fixed machine for mounting be to leap down among enemy fight to last remembering that there be now hope of safety naught to revenge fate be impending over wife child a roman mounted to assault terrible cry broke out from woman saw roman still manning line cut off escape believed that end be now at hand josephus fearing that cry must dispirit men ordered to be locked up in house then calmly awaited assault trumpet of legion sounded whole roman host set up terrible shout while at same moment air be darkened by arrow of bowman kneeling beneath buckler jew remained calm immovable then before roman have time to set foot upon breach with yell of fury rushed upon threw into midst of assailant for time roman must make way against desperate courage of jew a fast a leading file fell fresh troop took place while jew who be vastly reduced by loss have fresh men to take place of who died at last solid phalanx of roman drove back defender entered breach a did so from wall above from breach in front vessel filled with boiling oil be hurled down upon roman rank be broken men in agony rolled on ground unable to escape burning fluid penetrated through joint of armor who turned to fly be pierced by javelin of jew for roman carried defensive armor on back be never supposed to be turned towards enemy fresh troop poured up breach to take place of agonized comrade jew threw down upon plank vessel filled with sort of vegetable slime unable to retain footing upon slippery surface roman fell upon other in heap rolling down carried others with terrible confusion ensued jew never ceasing to pour missile upon when evening came vespasian called off men saw that to overcome desperate resistance of defender fresh step must be taken before assault be repeated accordingly gave order that embankment must be raised much higher than before that upon three tower fifty foot high strongly girded with iron must be built great work be carried out in spite of effort of besieged in tower vespasian placed javelin men archer light machine a now looked down upon wall be enabled to keep up such fire upon that jew must no longer maintain footing contented with lying behind making desperate sally whenever saw party of roman approaching breach in meantime terrible calamity have befallen neighboring town of japha emboldened by vigorous defense of jotapata have closed gate to roman vespasian sent trajan with two thousand foot thousand horse against city be strongly situated surrounded by double wall instead of waiting to be attacked people sallied out fell upon roman be however beaten back roman pressing on heel entered with through gate of outside wall defender of gate through inner wall fearing that too must be carried by mob closed who have sallied out be butchered by roman trajan seeing that garrison must now be weak sent to vespasian asked to send son to complete victory titus soon arrived with thousand foot five hundred horse at once assaulted inner wall defense be feeble roman effected entry inside town desperate conflict took place inhabitant defending street with energy of despair while woman aided effort by hurling down stone missile from roof battle lasted six hour when who must bear arm be slain rest of male population be put to death woman taken a slave in fifteen thousand be killed two thousand one hundred thirty taken prisoner in direction heavy blow have also be struck by roman samaritan have not openly joined revolt have gathered in great force on mount gerizim cerealis be sent by vespasian with three thousand infantry six hundred horse against surrounded foot of mountain abstained from assault until samaritan be weakened by thirst many dying from want of water cerealis then mounted hill sent to to throw down arm on refusal charged from side put soul in number eleven thousand six hundred to sword situation of defender of jotapata be now pitiable indeed scarce man have received wound more le severe in desperate combat be utterly worn out with fatigue for be under arm day night in readiness to repel expected attack number of woman child have died of thirst terror save armed men lying in group near foot of wall in readiness to repel assault scarce soul be to be seen in lately crowded street house be now ample to contain vastly diminished number here woman child crouched in utter prostration power of suffering be almost gone few cared how soon end came siege have now continued for forty seven day roman army strong in number in discipline in arm commanded by one of best general have yet failed to capture little town have expected to take within few hour of appearance before so fierce be valor of besieged vespasian did not venture to order legion forward to renew assault now deserter informed that garrison be greatly exhausted that men on guard must not keep awake that breach must be carried at night by sudden assault vespasian prepared for assault be to take place at daybreak thick mist enveloped town sleeping sentry be not aroused by silent step of approaching roman titus be first to enter breach followed by small number of troop killed sleeping guard main body of roman then poured in before jew be conscious of danger whole of roman army be upon then slaughter commenced many of jew killed other rather than fall into hand of roman many threw over precipice number took refuge in deep cavern under city day in street house be killed next roman searched cavern underground passage slaughtering men boy sparing none infant woman during siege capture forty thousand men fell only twelve hundred woman child be spared so complete be surprise so unresistingly did jew submit to slaughter that only one roman be killed be antoninus centurion came upon jew in deep cavern told must spare life if must surrender jew asked to give hand a pledge of faith to help out of cave antoninus did so jew at once ran through with spear john be asleep when roman entered be aroused by jonas rushing into room boy be at time restless suffered le than most of within wall for there be abundance of grain up to end of siege until roman have discovered way down to water have not suffered in way from thirst be considered too young to take part in actual fighting have labored with rest in repairing defense carrying food to men on wall carrying away dead wounded get up john exclaimed in mist have just run upon mass of roman soldier ranged in order town be taken quick before scatter begin to slay john caught up sword ran out just a did so terrible shout be heard followed by shriek cry work of butchery have begun john plan have be laid for time at night jonas have frequently descended to ledge taking with food jar of water brought up from below once twice john have descended jonas fastening rope round body lowering gradually for active a be john must not get down without such assistance indeed to one who looked casually over top descent appeared absolutely impossible at top of speed lad ran to spot at descent have to be made rope be hidden close at hand john slipped noose at end over shoulder jonas twisted rope once round stunted tree grew close by allowed to go out gradually a soon a strain upon ceased knew john be upon ledge loosened rope dropped end over then began to descend bare foot hand clinging to inequality however slight in rock presently stood by side of john latter have coiled up rope laid by have then thrown down be sobbing bitterly jonas sat down quietly beside till have recovered composure be use fretting said philosophically there be one care about particularly up there be sure there be one care about only must like to have peeped in have seen face when roman burst open door suppose be very sorry though for will be better to be roman slave than to be going through what have be for last month be horrible john said horrible however jonas let thank god for having thus preserved life when besides be in such terrible danger of death for time two lad sat silent john be first to speak be thankful said that owing to being down face of rock sound be carried away above head can hear little of what be going on there seems confusion of sound come to rather a echo from hill yonder than directly from above sometimes indeed thrilling scream shout be heard for most part sound be so blended together that must not be distinguished one from a soon a mist cleared off lad lay down a far back from ledge a must get must not lift up head today john said guard below on hill will have eye fixed on rock on lookout for fugitive until nighttime must not venture to sit up fortunately that outer edge of shelf be good deal higher than be back here think that even on mountain opposite must see a lie must think good many may escape like jonas said presently there be number of cavern passage from have dug stone for building of house lot of people be sure to hide away there daresay will john agreed fear roman will hunt out how long do think will have to stay here john till roman go whether be one week two think will stay here many day town be so full of dead that in hot weather will be unbearable before long at rate will be able to pas good deal of time in sleep have not have much of lately till last night have not be in house at night for over fortnight felt last night a if must have sleep came of suppose guard at breach must have felt same roman must never have got in without alarm being given for few minute john lay thinking of terrible scene must be passing on rock above then drowsiness overcame be soon fast asleep be dark when woke a moved jonas spoke be awake john because if be let have something to eat have be awake last four hour have be wishing must stir there be occasion to wait for waking jonas there be grain water close at hand cooking be required be going to eat till woke if have be all night jonas said still be glad be awake be quiet now up above have heard roman trumpet sounding expect that most of have marched back to camp next day passed like first occasionally cry of agony be heard sometimes body be hurled from top of rock short distance from where be lying next two day passed more quietly upon following murmur a of multitude of men working be heard from time to time there be heavy crash a mass of stone hurled down precipice struck against face a fell then bounded far out beyond stream at foot sound be echoed back by surrounding hill until seemed a if storm be raging far away in heart of mountain be destroying town john said in answer to companion question a to cause of uproar be best thing possible for have remained standing might have left garrison here to prevent people reoccupying if destroy be sign that intend to march away altogether several time jonas wished to climb up at night to ascertain what be going on john must not hear of there be nothing to find out jonas know what did at gadara where slew male carried off woman although resistance be offered may be sure that there will be no more mercy shown at jotapata have affronted roman power by keeping great army at bay for nearly seven week whose capture have cost thousand of men know what have happened have slain soul save few young woman who be worth money a slave now be leveling town to foundation place defied will cease to exist yet talk of roman magnanimity must have five thousand fighting men hidden here with must climb then jonas fall upon in night take mighty vengeance for woe have inflicted being alone will remain here till have reason to believe that last roman have left did one of catch sight of fate must be sealed have boy among slightest glimpse of figure must be enough to tell that be jew who have be in hiding in fear that one man must escape vengeance must hunt down a pack of wolf might hunt down solitary lamb must never get down here john not by way came must lower cage full of armed men from above slay without pity if be found out john must not lead here must throw over precipice rather than risk must come to want to throw over precipice jonas want to keep with in first place because be great friend now in second because if be killed might a well throw over at once for think must ever climb up rock without assistance be much easier going up than coming down john may be indeed have doubt be so must rather not put matter to test have provision water here enough to last for ten day until be consumed be best not to stir from here four day later however heard sound of roman trumpet on raising head carefully few inch saw that guard on opposite hill have be withdrawn having now le fear of being seen raised head still further looked up valley to great camp on hillside where at night have seen fire of roman blazing high be going jonas exclaimed joyously look at sun sparkling on long line of arm armor not sound be to be heard above work be done be about to march away let expose further john said may be that have left few watcher to see if who have eluded search may show believing that have gone have doubt be going by tomorrow will be safe for to move day heard sound of trumpet for great host took long time getting into motion gradually sound grew fainter fainter a rear guard of army took road have cut through mountain eight week before night when darkness fell two lad sat up on ledge looked round not light be to be seen not sound broke silence of night at daybreak tomorrow jonas a soon a becomes light enough for to see way will go up look round may have left guard behind must hardly think so after wholesale slaughter at gadara here hatred of roman will be so intense confident a be in arm discipline must hardly venture to leave small body of men in heart of mountain a soon a be daylight jonas prepared to climb up to plateau above took with rope arranging that if found that place be absolutely deserted must lower one end to john fasten other to tree above that must then aid john a much a strength must permit in making way up rock john watched companion making way up observed exactly where placed foot hand until be out of sight then waited in about quarter of hour end of rope fell in front of fastened securely under arm then taking off sandal began ascent be not so difficult a have looked steady strain jonas kept on rope from above aided gave confidence in three four minute gained top of rock there be not soul to be seen jonas said town have gone people roman be desolation scene be indeed changed since john have last looked upon not wall in so lately busy little town have be left standing whole area be covered three four foot deep with chaos of stone mortar beam forming great grave below lay body of forty thousand of defender of place wall so bravely defended have disappeared embankment whose erection have cost roman so much labor bloodshed have be destroyed by fire dead silence hung over place air be tainted with terrible odor of corruption desolation solitude of scene overpowered john sat down on fragment of masonry wept unrestrainedly for time roused at last a jonas touched will go down again get what grain there be left boy said there be chance of finding anything to eat within day march of here roman horse will have destroyed village within wide circuit can not let go down again jonas danger be too great have be up down lot of time jonas said that may be jonas might be dashed to piece time well if like will fasten rope round then if must slip will be safe john consented with reluctance be so nervous shaken that walked distance away did not turn round until heard jonas ' footstep again approaching now can start boy said have got grain here enough for three day tonight will crush cook have have enough of eating raw grain for long time to come boy cheerfulness restored tone of john nerve making way with difficulty over chaos of stone timber until arrived at pile of charred timber marked spot where roman embankment have stood stepped out briskly descended hill crossed deserted line of circumvallation then began to ascend mountain have for distance be stripped of timber for purpose of siege in hour walking reached forest pressed on until afternoon not that there be need for speed now john felt longing to place a wide gap a possible between great charnel ground alone marked spot where jotapata have stood at length jonas urged necessity for halt for rest food chose spot at foot of great tree then set to work to collect store of firewood john took out box of tinder in day everyone carried about with fire be soon lighted jonas then looked for two large flat stone set to work to grind grain halting place have be chosen from vicinity of little spring rose few yard distant with pounded grain be moistened after kneading up jonas rolled in ball placed in hot ash of fire in hour be cooked meal be eaten with something like cheerfulness day walking brought to little village nestled in forest here be kindly received though people scarce believed when said that be survivor of garrison of jotapata news of capture of town destruction of defender have already spread through country john now learned for first time fate have befallen japha samaritan on mount gerizim event filled with consternation folly of tactic have be pursued of cooping fighting men up in walled city to be destroyed one after other by roman be more than ever apparent have never from first be very hopeful of result of struggle seemed now a if must end in nothing total destruction of jewish race of palestine john stayed for two day in little mountain village then with store of provision sufficient to last for day pursued way following line of anti libanus until range of hill joined range of mount hermon north of source of jordan have stopped for day at dan high up among hill here people have fear of roman vengeance for insurrection have not extended so far north roman garrison of caesarea philippi overawed plain near upper water of jordan determined however to run unnecessary risk john companion pursued way on lower slope of hill until after six day walking arrived at neve here learned where farm of john kinsman be situated made way a came up to house woman came out gazed intently at john with scream of terror ran back into house be one of martha maid john stood irresolute fearing that sudden appearance might startle other inmate when suddenly mary appeared at door looking pale resolute too gazed fixedly at john lip moved sound came from know mary john said girl gave scream of joy threw into arm moment later martha followed by miriam other servant came out be spirit mother be john mary exclaimed next moment john be clasped in mother arm be not surprising that first who saw john have thought that be spirit news have already be received that whole of garrison of jotapata have be put to sword john appearance be changed so greatly within last three month that must scarce have be known fatigue anxiety loss of blood from several wound have received in course of siege have so pulled down that be shadow of former self clothes be in rag have washed at village where have first stopped for before have be stiffened with blood even now stained ragged a be gave appearance of mendicant jonas have held back little while first joyful greeting be going on john soon turned to mother said must be a son to for next to protection of god be to owe life martha welcomed young stranger affectionately before tell aught have befallen john go change garment wash while prepare meal for clothes of uncle son silas who be about age will fit of younger brother will do for friend be last news of father good john asked lord be praised be well when heard of week since traveler be at once conducted to room supplied with water clean garment by time have changed returned to general room john uncle cousin have be fetched in from farm received hearty welcome almost seemed to a sat down to comfortable meal with mary mother waiting upon that event of past two month have be hideous dream that have never left comfortable home on shore of lake of galilee a to jonas unaccustomed to kind treatment to luxury of kind be too confused to utter word when meal be over john be asked to tell news related stirring incident of siege manner in companion have effected escape be doubt concluded sole male survivor of siege not so son martha said there be report josephus have survived siege that be prisoner in hand of roman may be that have spared to grace vespasian triumph at rome john said be custom believe to carry general may take in war to rome to be slain there be not until time afterwards john learned particular of capture of josephus when saw that be lost josephus have leaped down shaft of dry well from bottom of long cavern led off entirely concealed from sight of above here found forty of leading citizen who have laid in store of food sufficient to last for many day josephus at least who give account of circumstance say that quite unexpectedly found forty citizen in hiding there be improbable in extreme there can be little doubt that have long before prepared refuge with when found that people must not allow to attempt to make escape from city at night josephus came up from well tried to make escape finding roman everywhere vigilant returned to place of concealment on third day woman who be aware of hiding place informed roman of probably in return for promise of freedom for roman be searching high low for josephus who must not be convinced have escaped through line vespasian immediately sent two tribune paulinus gallicanus to induce to surrender by promise of life josephus refused to come out vespasian sent tribune nicanor personal friend of josephus to assure of safety if must surrender in account josephus give of transaction say that at moment suddenly remembered dream in be revealed to that calamity must fall upon jew that must be saved that vespasian must become emperor that therefore if passed over to roman must do so not a renegade in obedience to voice of god be certainly happy coincidence that dream must have occurred to at moment at once announced readiness to surrender forty companion did not see matter in same light moment josephus left roman soldier must throw combustible down well suffocate if did not come out submit to slaughter urged upon josephus that be leader that have followed order cast in lot with that must be treacherous base in extreme for now to save life by going over to roman when inferior people have slain have submitted to slaughter rather than beg life of roman josephus argued with at length be not convinced drawing sword threatened to kill if tried to leave must die together said josephus then proposed that in order to avoid sin of suicide must draw lot must kill other to assented continued to draw lot a to must slay other until only josephus one other remained alive be story josephus tell be of course endeavoring to put own case in best light to endeavor to prove that be not a jew universally regarded traitor to country need hardly be said that story be improbable in extreme have one of forty men survived written history must probably have told very different tale conduct of josephus from first outbreak of trouble showed that be entirely adverse to rising against roman having be to rome have seen power might have be received with great favor by poppaea wife of nero have made many friend there have therefore at outset opposed a far a be able without going so far a to throw suspicion on patriotism rebellion against roman during event in galilee have shown anxious to keep in favor with roman have rebuked who have attacked soldier traveling a escort with large amount of treasure belonging to king agrippa must have sent back spoil taken have not people risen against affected great indignation at plunder of agrippa palace at tiberias gathering must of spoil have handed over to care of chief of agrippa friend there have protected two officer of agrippa whom jew must have killed have released sent back to king when john of gischala wished to carry off large quantity of grain stored by roman in upper galilee josephus refused to allow to do so saying that must be kept for owner be almost certain that josephus must in way have entered into communication with roman for how otherwise must with principal inhabitant have proposed to make escape when avenue be closed josephus be man of great talent energy full of resource of great personal bravery at least if own account of conduct during siege be to be believed one can read labored excuse for own conduct without feeling sure that have along be in correspondence with roman that have beforehand be assured that life must be spared have from first despaired of successful resistance to roman conduct in throwing at last moment into town about to be besieged a must have known captured for want of water alone rendered fall mere question of time when presence leadership be so urgently required among people to whose command have be appointed seems to prove that wished to fall into hand must not be just to brand josephus a traitor have done best to induce galilean to form into army to defend province be only when army dispersed at approach of roman that went to jotapata be leadership enabled city to continue heroic defense can not therefore be said that josephus in way betrayed trust confided to by council at jerusalem conclusion can hardly be avoided that from first foreseeing that utter ruin destruction must fall upon jew have set to work to prepare way of pardon escape for that thought position of honor among roman vastly preferable to unknown grave among mountain of galilee upon being taken out of well josephus be taken to vespasian in presence only of general son titus two other officer announced that be endowed with prophetic power that be commissioned by god to tell vespasian that must become emperor that must be succeeded by son titus prophecy be one required more penetration than for person in present day to predict that most rising man in great political party must one day become prime minister emperor be hated be morally certain that fall must not long be delayed in case most popular general in roman army must almost certainly be chosen to succeed vespasian be not greatly affected by prophecy josephus declared that have along predicted success of roman fall of town after forty six day siege own safety a of female captive be brought up on josephus appealing to whether be not so naturally replied in affirmative josephus say that vespasian be then satisfied of prisoner divine mission henceforth treated with great honor be much more easy to believe that agreement already existed between vespasian josephus that latter only got up story to enable to maintain that be not traitor to country acting in accordance with order of god certain be that similar act of clemency be shown by vespasian to other jew that other thought of pity mercy entered mind during campaign that spared man who fell alive into hand that more ruthless wholesale extermination than inflicted upon people of palestine be ever carried out by most barbarous of conqueror to day memory of josephus be hated among jew chapter massacre on lake john remained for three week at uncle messenger with news of safe arrival there have be sent off to father who came up to see three day later formal act of betrothal between john cousin took place simon martha must have be willing that full ceremony of marriage must take place latter even urged upon son be now more than seventeen john have taken place among men may well take to yourself wife mary be nigh fifteen many maiden marry earlier love other why then must not be married must cheer old age of father to see grandchild growing up around have time be different mother must gladly have have so with land torn by war with brother being slaughtered everywhere with jerusalem temple in danger be time for marrying giving in marriage besides law say that for year after marriage man will not go to war journey upon business will remain at home quiet with wife must not do now did news come tomorrow that roman be marching upon jerusalem assuredly must do duty take up arm go to defense of holy city maybe mary must be left widow before day of rejoicing for marriage be over mother life of man who can wield weapon be own at present defense of temple be first greatest of duty if fall there will adopt mary a child marry to someone who will take place be son to mary will grieve for doubtless for time will be grief of sister for brother not that of wife for husband in time will marry man to whom will give will be happy even for must rather that be so left will feel more free from care responsibility though if father lay order upon will of course obey pray that in matter will suffer to have way martha talked matter over with husband agreed that john wish must be carried out that marriage must be postponed until trouble be over of believed that john must fall in struggle regarded escape from jotapata a well nigh miraculous felt assured that god having specially protected through such great danger must continue to do so to end contrary to expectation vespasian have not followed up success at jotapata by march against jerusalem army have suffered very heavy loss in siege desperate valor defender of town have shown have doubtless impressed upon mind formidable nature of task have undertaken if little mountain town have cost so dearly what must not be loss must be entailed by capture of city like jerusalem with position of vast natural strength solid massive fortification defended a must be by whole strength of jewish nation fighting with fury of religious fanaticism despair army strong a be must doubtless capture city at cost that might be crippled for further action vespasian be keeping one eye upon rome wished to have army complete in perfect order in readiness for anything might occur there therefore after fall of jotapata marched first to caesarea after short halt there passed north to caesarea philippi where climate cooled by breeze from mountain be pleasant healthful here gave army twenty day to rest recover from wound fatigue then marched south again to scythopolis bethsan lying just within border of samaria not far from jordan here titus with detached force joined prepared to reduce city near lake simon have by time returned home accompanied by john jonas simon tried to persuade son to remain with mother john have entreated that might accompany war may last for long time father land must be tilled else why must return home be in province of king agrippa after have befallen jotapata japha be not likely that people of hippo of other town will venture to show disaffection therefore there be reason why roman must carry fire sword through agrippa country east of jordan be well that mother mary must not return for if evil day must come must not save by rapid flight besides risk death death be thousand time better than slavery among roman if find that be approaching be wasting land can fly boat be close by can take to lake land where will make way back here will not seek john when roman approach to enter tiberias gamala other city may hold out against roman father have have share of defending walled city save for jerusalem will fight more in city place must fall sooner later if roman sit down before will not be cooped up again if leader arises draw together band in mountain to harass attack roman will join for have always seemed to that in way only can successfully fight against if not will aid in labor of farm until roman march against jerusalem simon yielded to son wish for event of last year have aged much felt need of assistance on farm men who have worked for have save isaac one two of older men gone away to jerusalem to gamala one other of fortified town time for harvest be at hand there must be few to gather in martha must fain have accompanied simon must not hear of be in safe refuge here wife rather than that must leave must abandon farm altogether if come mary woman must come also even for men danger must be greater than be alone mary also tried power of persuasion simon be not to be moved three set off together for jonas a matter of course accompanied john wherever went three week kindness rest good feeding have done wonder for wild reckless expression john have noticed when have first met have well nigh disappeared bone have become better covered cheek filled out comfortably clothed a now be few must have recognized in wild goatherd of jotapata simon be mounted on donkey others walked be well that be off again jonas said month there must have got fat lazy must have almost forgotten how to run climb must have grown like dweller on plain there will be plenty of work for on farm jonas simon said need not be afraid of growing fat lazy there think be fond of work jonas said thoughtfully not of steady work will work hard now simon have be so good to must work till dropped for must have worked before not if have beaten ever so much because be always unkind to why must one work for who hing for beat ill use must always do duty jonas simon said if others do duty to so much worse for be excuse for not doing duty a far a can jonas being little behind simon made little face expressive of disagreement with opinion said nothing followed course of river hieromax down to capitolias where slept that night in house of friend of simon on following evening arrived at farm john received hearty greeting from isaac other men several of fisherman when heard of return came in to see for next fortnight john jonas worked from daylight till dark by end of time greater part of corn be gathered in granary portion be stored away in deep pit straw being laid over when hole be nearly full earth being thrown in level to surface so must roman come sack granary there must still remain store must carry on until next harvest then news came from across lake that roman be breaking up camp at scythopolis be moving towards tiberias resistance be expected to be offered there greater part of inhabitant have along be well affected to roman have only be compelled by small faction in city by fear of country people of galilee to join in insurrection be too richest city in dominion of king agrippa for although lay for most part east of jordan town of tiberias tarichea be included in tiberias be in fact chief city here have richest palace city greatly benefited by being seat of government be roman rather than jewish in hope feeling so confident be vespasian that resistance must be offered that when arrived within mile of town sent forward officer with fifty horse to exhort people to open gate when got near town officer dismounted went forward to speak when party of war faction headed by jesus son of shaphat charged out upon officer having have order to fight jew fled on foot with five of men who have also dismounted assailant seized horse carried in triumph into city senate

aid a can give must be useless whether city fall at once whether resist vengeance of roman will fall upon in few hour horseman can ride round shore of lake cut off who be absent from returning to home give village to fire sword who can point to boat drawn up at side of lake will be able to give proof to roman that have not taken part against so far have escaped horror of war on side of jordan if strong city of galilee can not resist roman arm what hope must have on side where population be comparatively scanty where there be few strong place let provoke roman friend if go up against jerusalem let who will go die in defense of temple must be worse than folly to provoke wrath of roman by thrusting yourselves into quarrel here warmly did fisherman congratulate when saw combat proceeding on lake when strong body of roman horse rode along shore leaving party at regular interval to cut off who might try land body of twenty be posted down by boat two came into village demanded food for party simon when saw coming ordered able bodied men to retire remain in olive grove on slope at distance from lake until roman have gone while isaac other old men went down met soldier be of people of

young men left avocation started for gamala relying upon strength of position be even stronger than of jotapata be resolved to resist to last several of young men of village many from village near be determined to take course maddened by slaughter of many friend relation john be a furious a especially when news came of violation of faith at tarichea of selling of nigh forty thousand men into slavery father said that evening have thought to stay quietly with until roman advanced against jerusalem find can not do so massacre at jotapata be bad enough slaughter of defenseless men on lake be worse pray let go must go into gamala die there john simon asked better to die at temple than to throw away life here intend to go into gamala father to throw away life though care little for except for sake of mother mary must do something must save son of neighbor others from fate assuredly wait if enter gamala know not a do how surely wall will go down before roman engine even did know so determined be to fight slayer of countryman that must still go what propose to do be to carry out what have always believed to be true way of fighting roman will collect band take to mountain harass whenever may find opportunity know young men from village will follow if will lead will be able to get friend along shore to do like in way danger will not be so great for in mountain roman must have chance of overtaking while if be successful many will gather round may do good service will not stay john if feel that lord have called upon to go indeed may save a say life of many of neighbor by persuading to take to hill with instead of shutting up in gamala go down then to village talk to see what say to plan john have little doubt a to proposal being accepted by younger men of village fact that have be chosen a one of bodyguard of josephus have at once given importance in eye of neighbor that must have passed through siege of jotapata have escaped have caused to regard not only a valiant fighter a one under special protection of god since return scarce evening have passed without party coming from one other of village along shore to hear from lip story of siege a soon then a went down to fishing village told young men who have determined to leave for gamala that thought badly of such action that intended to raise band take to mountain harass roman eagerly agreed to follow to obey order there be eight of john at once made take oath of obedience fellowship swearing in thing to obey order to be true to other to death to be ready to give life when called upon for destruction of roman never if fell into hand of enemy to betray secret of band might be torture to be exposed john must have obtained more than eight men in village must only take quite young men want only men who can undergo fatigue watching who can climb mountain run a fast a roman horse can gallop besides for work like be necessary that there must be one leader that must be promptly obeyed if take older men will naturally wish to have voice in ordering of thing have seen enough of military matter to know for prompt decision swift execution one head one head only be necessary besides may find difficulty in way of getting food at first wish for only small band if success attends will increase rapidly twenty will be quite enough to begin with a soon a eight young men of whom two be under twenty year old have taken oath started at once to village round do of gather in two more john said let be whom know to be strong active bring more if four of bring one so much better if find many more eager to join can tell that will send for when time come to increase number pray to abide here not to go into gamala let bring arm bag of meal meet tomorrow evening at sundown on hieromax

not take must come upon for men going thither to aid in defense of town young men started at once on mission full of confidence in john feeling certain that under leadership must soon come to blow with roman being also in heart well satisfied that warfare must be in open country must not be called upon to fight pent up in wall from there be escape having seen follower off john returned home told simon progress have made old man sighed seek to keep john for duty to country stand now in first rank of may be that lord preserved at jotapata because intends to do great deed for here say spare avoid danger for sake only say throw away life by rashness remember young a be be leader be prudent a well a brave after gamala have fallen a fall fear will roman have moved away from part a will then do for there be resistance to on side of jordan save at town will bring mother mary back again will find waiting here to welcome if return if not son will mourn for a jacob mourned for joseph more seeing that be only prop of old age will have consolation of knowing that died for country will find in mary daughter father must find husband for who will take place may be that if roman march not direct upon jerusalem say that vespasian have arranged that two of legion will winter on sea coast at caesarea third at scythopolis be probable that will not move against jerusalem till spring in case may be often here during winter for will not go down to jerusalem until last thing for there be turmoil disturbance until time come when must lay aside private feud unite to repel invader will not go down father son talked until late in night in morning john made preparation for departure have told jonas of intention boy listened silently only saying wherever go john be ready to go with make difference to afterwards went down to lake side where filled pouch with smooth pebble of selected with great care for when herding goat among mountain jonas have be always practicing with sling many cony have fallen before unerring aim lad in mountain be accustomed to use of sling none in jotapata have approached jonas in skill with weapon during siege have often astonished john by accuracy of aim have several time compelled roman to cease working one of machine specially harassed defender of wall by striking down one after of who directed stone seldom failing to strike full in face only spot unprotected by armor in morning john prepared to start jonas carried small sack supported by strap passing over shoulder containing eight pound of meal gourd of water jonas carried weapon save long knife hidden under garment sling pouch of stone john carried sword buckler horn before started john knelt before father received blessing simon a bade adieu gave small bag of money will need to buy thing in mountain lad must not that must be driven like robber band to take food by force be true that who go not to war must support who risk life for country there be many aged men who like can not fight there be many woman whose husband be away in gamala jerusalem may not be able to afford to assist others therefore be well that must have mean of paying for what require otherwise curse of widow fatherless may fall upon now farewell son may god have in keeping send home safe to mother chapter among mountain jonas be in high spirit a started from farm be leaving friend behind so long a have john with be perfectly contented be delighted to be on move again for although have worked steadily in getting in harvest regular labor be distasteful to accustomed a have be to wander for week free unchecked with goat among mountain regular life order of farm be irksome to john on other hand be silent replying briefly to boy question felt danger of enterprise upon have embarked responsibility a leader thought of grief father mother must feel did ought befall weighed on mind presently however roused now jonas must keep sharp lookout round for if see roman soldier in distance must hide sword buckler before discover must stow away sling pouch then will walk quietly on if question be going to stay with friend at capitolias a there will be nothing suspicious about will not interfere with after have passed on will go back for arm be not traveling in direction of gamala will have reason to doubt story did not however meet of party of roman horse who be scouring country carrying off grain cattle for use of army arrived in afternoon on bank of hieromax upon other side of river rose steep slope of mount galaad high up on whose side be perched little town of abila here can wait jonas be nearly opposite town others will doubtless soon be here be not long before band made appearance coming along in two three a have met on river bank by sunset last have arrived john found that of first recruit have brought two others looked with satisfaction at band greater part of have be fisherman be strong active john saw that order that young men only must be taken have be obeyed for not one of be over age of twenty three a have laid down a absolute rule be unmarried be like armed with sword buckler several have brought with bag with javelin head to be fitted to stave later on face bore look of determination at same time of gladness massacre on lake have excited inhabitant of shore to fury even who have hitherto held back from national cause be now eager to fight against roman many shrunk from going to gamala be indeed already a full of fighting men a must hold john proposal to form band for warfare in mountain have exactly suited more adventurous spirit present be known to john personally many of be son of friend of simon others have met at village gathering when fishing on lake there be warm greeting a accession to party arrived member of band felt spirit rise higher at finding so many of knew personally be to be comrade in enterprise when last comer have arrived john said will now be moving forward have best get well up mountain before night fall matter not much where camp tonight tomorrow can choose good spot for headquarters being now height of dry season river be low have difficulty in wading across then struck up hill to right of abila until have fairly entered forest clothed lower slope of mountain then john gave word for halt dead wood be soon collected fire made cake of meal be baked in ash after have be eaten party lay round fire few minute later john rose to foot illustration john incites countryman to harass roman know reason for be gathered together here all long for vengeance on oppressor of country murderer of kinsman friend men who carry off woman to shame slavery in rome be ready to die for country god must fain die doing a much harm to roman a can fighting like freeman in open instead of rat slaughtered in cage be why instead of going into gamala have gathered here be youngest among have so far assumed leadership because in first place have be much with josephus who although may now most unworthily have gone over to roman to save life be yet wise governor great leader from have learned much of roman in second place have seen more of warfare than of having passed through terrible siege of jotapata lastly believe that god having saved almost alone of host defended town have intended a instrument for service therefore have taken upon command in first place of band at same time if think that be too young must rather place at head will stand aside release from oath who have already sworn be not self seeking crave not leadership over will obey whomsoever may choose for chief to be leader prompt obedience must be given for there must even in band like be order discipline work for common good must yield to direction of one will one head now what say will walk away to leave free to consult one with will abide by decision whatever be only decision once made must be adhered to there must be no after grumbling hesitation drawing back must have absolute confidence give absolute obedience to whom choose for only so can hope to succeed in enterprise john have gone short way among tree when be called back again have come prepared to follow father have always be man of weight position among villager on shore democratic a be jewish institution there be yet certain respect paid to of position above fellow john experience especially escape from jotapata seemed specially to mark a one destined to play important part quiet resolute bearing now feeling that knew what be to be done how to do that be in fact natural leader came home to be with sincerity that assured that accepted a leader very well john said quietly then let who have not already taken oath stand up do so be done john then said now will tell more of plan although of course can not be in way settled until see how thing turn out be by watching for opportunity seizing right moment only that can hope for success be ready to give life for country wish to throw away want of to do a much a possible want to live so a to share in defense of temple therefore have to combine prudence with daring a for attack upon strong body of roman troop must be impossible unless attempt to follow among mountain one of first duty will be to learn country well so that may know where to defend must come up after where from eminence can cast down rock upon where there be crag can climb up heavy armed soldier can not follow be first task for a yet have not commenced siege of gamala when do so must draw down near hide mark position of camp see how tent be arranged where sentry be placed then can begin work sometimes falling upon guard at other time creeping in past sentry scattering through camp at given signal firing tent with brand from fire slaying who first rush out then making off again to hill then too will be sending great number of men up hill to cut timber branch for embankment breastwork construction of wattle to protect machine will be in hiding when party of men separate from rest will fall upon will harass worker from distance always avoiding regular combat hindering work wearing out thus may do better service to defender of gamala than if be within wall at present have only sword must get bow arrow must not have be safe to have carried across plain can procure at abila jabez galaad fear that will not be able to interfere with provisioning of army for upon plain will have chance with cavalry here in mountain stretching away over peraea into arabia moab can laugh at pursuit by roman even agrippa light armed arab will have difficulty in following of need have little fear at jotapata proved match for roman light armed troop will not care to venture against alone a will not know number will fear being led into ambush there be one question have to consider be food a to flesh will have in abundance there will be many flock of goat belonging to in gamala straying among mountain without owner therefore of goat milk flesh can take abundance there will be scarcity of grain have money with with can purchase at abila village a for jabez galaad be too close to gamala roman will probably ascend hill destroy place guard there at rate money will be sufficient to purchase meal for for time much longer probably than gamala will be able to hold out when have fallen will be time to arrange about future only let take nothing without payment let not be like robber band prey upon people until long for roman a master only must remember that while desire now to do roman a much harm a possible be beginning of work that must save for future gamala be one town will have plenty of opportunity for striking at enemy in future have put hand to plow now so long a war last will not look back may be that example may lead others to follow in case roman difficulty will thicken day be there score of band of determined men like hanging around ready to attack small body whenever venture away from camp to gather in provision forage to harass at night by constant alarm must wear out only must always avoid pitched battle in irregular fighting be a good a better for can move more quickly when come to fighting in order of battle have chance with cavalry other day outside tarichea be like wolf among flock of sheep nothing disaster can come of fighting in plain people must fight in way that suit best attempt to meet enemy in own way of fighting be sure to lead to disaster let roman keep plain with cavalry heavy infantry let jew light footed swift keep to hill be a much superior there a be roman in plain now must establish signal will get horn at abila will fix upon signal one long note will mean gather to two fall back gradually three retire at once with speed to spot agreed upon before setting out in morning two short note will mean advance attack in manner arranged one short note oft repeated will tell roman be advancing sound horn for be well that provided with cow horn so that signal can be repeated if be scattered over hillside among tree roman hear horn sounded in many quarter will think that there must be large body of men assembled will make slow cautious in movement will force many to stand prepared with arm to guard at work will altogether confuse puzzle now will lie down sleep a soon a be dawn will be on foot again next two day be spent in exploring that part of mountain examining direction extent of valley ravine seeing where steep precipice afforded opportunity for rolling down rock upon enemy passing along valley trying to storm height in searching for pool in dried watercourse in deciding upon spot favorable for camp fixed upon spot high up on mountain two mile east of abila a headquarters be in pas between two peak gave option of descending to north south of skirting along mountain towards source of jabbok river thence crossing hermon range beyond limit of peraea jonas be sent first thing to discover whether roman have taken possession of jabez galaad lay five mile from gamala on southern side of range of hill on whose western spur gamala be built returned in short time saying that have found inhabitant in state of great alarm for roman force must be seen coming up road from plain most of fighting men of town be in gamala rest with young woman be leaving so that only old people child must be found in town when roman arrived jonas also brought word that vespasian whole army be moving against gamala john have given jonas money before started to purchase bow arrow have brought back bow for whole party a many arrow a must carry paid nothing for said a threw down man who sold be praying who be leaving town to take for thought that if roman found in house must destroy one listened be too busy in carrying off such of household good a must take to burden further so gladly gave a many a must take carried off nearly bow left breaking up rest store of arrow in order to burn before roman arrived boy carrying bag of arrowhead came with little distance paid man for be now hidden in forest can fetch when will must not carry more with than have got have done well jonas john said a men seized bow divided arrow among then stood waiting expecting order from john to proceed at once to harass roman column a ascended hill john said in answer to look will not meddle with today did shoot at must suppose that belonged to jabez galaad must in revenge destroy town may find within first essay against must bring destruction upon thousand of countryman others saw justness of reasoning faith in a leader be strengthened by calmness readiness of decision be bag of arrowhead heavy jonas be a much a boy who be about own age must carry jonas replied then do phineas simeon go with jonas to place where bag be hidden carry to place have fixed upon for camp if on way come across herd of goat shoot two three of take with get fire ready day be getting on will go across mountain see where roman be pitching camp by sunset will be with making way along mountain band came after hour walking to point where must obtain view of gamala city stood on western extremity of hill after sloping gradually down rose suddenly in sharp ridge like hump of camel from town have name gamala on side rock ended abruptly in precipitous chasm in ran two branch of hieromax met at lower end of ridge ran together into end of lake at tarichea three mile away thus gamala be only accessible from behind where ridge joined mountain across neck of land deep fosse have be dug so a to cut off approach house be crowded thickly on steep slope of ridge be so abrupt that house seemed to overhang one on southern crag be of immense height be citadel of town there be spring supplying abundance of water within wall have be defended by garrison a brave numerous a of jotapata must have be well nigh impregnable cheres joseph who commanded have none of genius of josephus although be brave determined city be crowded with fugitive from part have already for seven month resisted besieging force agrippa have sent against be impossible to blockade whole circuit of town vespasian took possession of neighboring height established camp with of fifteenth legion on hill facing city to east fifth legion threw up work opposite center of city while tenth set to work to fill up ditch ravine in order to facilitate approach agrippa approached wall to persuade inhabitant to surrender be struck on right elbow by stone from sling forced to retire insult to native king who came in character of ambassador enraged roman set about operation for siege with great vigor in spite of effort of jew fosse protected wall on east be speedily filled up roman then began a at jotapata to raise embankment facing wall day after roman have established camp john follower advanced along mountain until must look down upon for long time watched roman at work learned detail of camp must fix in mind john said in order even on dark night may be able to make way about without difficulty so that may be able after striking blow to fly directly to mountain for who get confused miss way will assuredly be killed see enemy have placed strong guard halfway up hillside in order to protect from surprise will be possible by moving down to stream then mounting again to reach camp without passing through by same way must make retreat for if succeed in setting camp on fire flame will enable guard on mountain to see approaching have hoped that might be able to penetrate unobserved to tent of vespasian to slay of general by bustle that see round tower on hillside by strong force of cavalry picketed round be evident that have taken up quarter there indeed from top of tower can look down upon town on be passing there issue direction to troop accordingly so must give up idea time may be more fortunate see great number of troop be ascending hill towards doubtless to cut timber for work a soon a be at work will attack party retired into forest a soon a heard sound of roman ax crept quietly forward moving noiselessly with sandaled foot among tree when within short distance of roman john ordered to halt crept forward with jonas to reconnoiter there be little fear of being heard for several hundred men be at work felling tree line of sentry at ten pace apart standing under arm to prevent surprise roman be working too thickly to permit of successful action by so small party john saw that idea of attack must be abandoned that must confine for present to harassing sentry rejoining men told what have discovered bade scatter along line crawling up under protection of tree to approach a near a must to line of sentry then to shoot at at workman many of whom having thrown off heavy armor to enable better to work offered more favorable mark for arrow than sentry whose face only be exposed be on account to come to close quarter with roman if latter advanced be instantly to retire approaching again a soon a roman recommenced work so to continue until blew signal for to draw off altogether be not to begin until heard signal for attack after allowing little time to elapse for men to get into position john blew horn moment cry shout be heard along whole roman line sound of chopping instantly ceased roman trumpet blew to arm john have advanced sufficiently near to see roman workman before gave signal jonas be little in advance of a horn sounded saw step out from behind tree whirl sling round head discharge stone almost simultaneously roman sentinel forty pace away fell with crash upon ground roman soldier who have retained armor ran instantly forward to support sentry others hastily buckled on breastplate caught up buckler helmet joined comrade arrow continued to fall among from invisible foe although most of fell harmless from armor several soldier fell in addition to seven eight who have be killed by first volley centurion in command soon saw that number of assailant be small afraid of being drawn into ambush hesitated to give order for advance dispatched messenger instantly to camp contenting with throwing out strong party hundred yard in advance of line now became object of attack while arrow ceased to fall among main body of troop john moved round flank till gained position whence must observe camp trumpet above have be heard there troop have already taken up position under arm a looked on saw messenger run up to party of mounted officer minute later trumpet sounded strong body of arabian archer advanced at run up slope john at once withdrew to first position sounded order for instant retreat then hurrying back mile sounded note for follower to assemble at spot where be standing in few minute have joined be in high spirit at success of first skirmish wondered why have be so suddenly called off when roman have shown sign of advancing against there be fully thousand arab archer in forest by time john said be a fleet of foot a be must be madness to remain have stopped work for time have killed many without scratch to ourselves be well enough for today tomorrow will beat up again at daybreak two of party be sent forward to edge of wood to see with what force roman went out to work brought back report that be accompanied by strong body of archer that a soon a reached forest archer be scattered in front of for long distance that must be impossible to approach unobserved on previous afternoon john have dispatched jonas to abila have returned with number of cow horn round fire in evening men have set to work to pierce point with heated arrowhead have converted into instrument capable of giving deep prolonged sound on return of scout john set men in motion can not fight today can hinder work will scatter through forest a approach be to sound horn continue to do so from time to time roman will think that great force be advancing against be done with effect john have anticipated hearing sound of horn over mountainside roman concluded that great force be advancing to attack archer be at once recalled troop stood to arm for several hour remained waiting attack then after strong body of heavy armed troop preceded by archer skirmishing before have pushed distance into forest without meeting with enemy work recommenced considerable number still standing to arm a protector to rest although certain amount of time have be gained for city by interruption of work of bringing in timber john have undertaken sham attack rather with purpose of accustoming band to work together to give confidence than with view of troubling roman in be perfectly successful band when reached camp that evening be in high spirit have for two day puzzled baffled large roman force have inflicted loss upon forced to desist from work be pleased with leader have lost much of dread of roman capture of jotapata japha tarichea tale of cruelty ferocity have excited among whole population reverse at commencement of work must have be fatal john have felt that however earnest men be in determination to die fighting for country loss of few of number at outset must have so dispirited rest that probability be that band must disperse must at rate be unwilling to undertake desperate operation in present mood be ready for enterprise upon might lead accordingly told that must abstain next day from continuance of attack upon working party at night must carry out design of setting fire to camp accordingly following day roman pursued work unmolested although still continued precaution of keeping force of archer party of heavy armed troop in advance of working in wood john did not move till afternoon then descending hill to right skirted along in lower forest until within two mile of gamala here halted until while waiting for hour of action gave final instruction to men assigned to order in must ascend from river towards rear of camp when approached spot where must probably find roman sentry posted be to advance singly crawling along upon ground who first went through be to keep straight on until reached further end of camp stopping a near a must judge fifty pace apart be then to wait for hour so a to be sure that must have gained allotted position then when saw certain star sink below horizon method of calculating time to be accustomed be to creep forward into roman camp to make way a noiselessly a possible until came within few pace of one of smoldering fire of roman to wait until heard single note from john horn be at once to spring forward seize lighted brand fire nearest tent then to crawl away cutting a went rope of tent so a to bring down create a much confusion a possible then either by crawling if discovered by leaping to foot making sudden rush be to make way down to river again to follow bank for mile then wait in body for hour at end of time be to make way back to camp in mountain certain by time that who be alive must have rejoined must not be with party be at once to proceed to election of leader at about ten o'clock again moved forward descending to river followed bank until arrived at spot have fixed on then in single file began to climb hill john placed in middle of line in order to have central position when attack began a soon a reached top of slope lay down one by one crawled forward into darkness two three minute being allowed to elapse between departure of man must hear call of roman sentry a answered other half hour knew that line be hundred yard so in front of night be very dark sudden shout proclaimed that ahead have be noticed when john turn came to advance jonas be to follow next behind have left bow arrow buckler sword behind carried only knife for have not come to fight knife be required only for cutting tent rope in case of discovery to enable to take life two before fell fighting have sworn to kill if found escape impossible in order to escape death by torture if fell alive into hand of roman john on approaching line of sentry be guided by sound only in trying to avoid must not see figure must hear sound of footstep clash of arm a tramped few yard backwards forward be like comrade stripped to waist having only on short garment reaching halfway down knee a be upon speed activity that life must depend without interruption crawled through line of sentry continued course until be a near a must tell opposite center of long line of tent then lay quiet watching setting of star sound be heard from camp in front although from down hillside beyond came confused noise a of host of men at work glare of many fire reddened sky for there five thousand men be at work raising embankment against doomed city while archer slinger maintained never ceasing conflict of missile with defender on wall star seemed to john a if hung on course so long be in sinking to horizon at last sank john crawling noiselessly forward made way into roman camp be arranged with wide regular street laid out with mechanical accuracy here there in front of tent of commanding officer sentry paced to fro sound of footstep clash of arm time turned giving warning of position in center of street fire round soldier have shortly before be gathered still glowed flickered for although day be hot cold at night rendered fire desirable there be abundance of fuel to be obtained from hill john crawled along with greatest care have fear of being seen have come roughly against tent rope might have brought out wakeful occupant of tent to see who be moving continued course until found opposite fire in of brand be burning brightly while there be sentry on guard within distance of fifty yard so far everything have gone well neither in passing through line of sentry in making way into camp have of band be observed be certain now that at least must succeed in setting fire to tent before be discovered wind be blowing briskly from mountain must speedily spread flame heavy blow must be inflicted upon enemy chapter storming of gamala at last john made sure that follower must have taken up favorable position rising to foot sounded short note on horn then sprang forward seized one of blazing brand applied to tent canvas dried by scorching sun lit in instant a flame leaped up john ran further among tent lighted leaving brand there sprang twenty yard away then threw down by time although not twenty second have elapsed since have given signal sudden uproar have succeeded stillness have reigned in camp sentry have started on post a heard note of horn have stood moment irresolute not knowing what meant then a first flash of flame shot up simultaneous shout have arisen from man on guard rising louder louder a first flame be followed almost instantly by score of others in different part of camp be few second later that first trumpeter who rushed from tent blew alarm before note ceased be answered over camp with start sleeping soldier sprang up caught up arm rushed out of tent startled a be with suddenness of awaking sight of blazing tent there be none of confusion must have occurred among troop le inured to warfare man did duty buckling on arm a best might stumbling over tent rope in darkness amazed by sound of fall of tent here there expecting moment to be attacked by unseen foe troop made way speedily to wide street there fell in together in military array waited for order be not long in coming a soon a general reached spot told off number of men to endeavor to extinguish flame sent other party to scour camp search for enemy while rest in solid order awaited attack might be made upon short a be time have elapsed since first alarm have sufficed to give flame such hold power that be beyond control with extraordinary rapidity fire have leaped from tent to tent threatened to overwhelm whole camp soldier tried in vain to arrest progress of flame rushing among blazing tent cutting rope to bring to ground trying to beat out mass of fire a fell many be terribly burnt in endeavor in vain officer soon called off set to work pulling down tent fire have not yet reached even be useless flake of fire driven before wind fell on heap of dried canvas flame spread almost a rapidly a have done when tent be standing be party in search of incendiary more successful john have lain quiet where threw down for minute two by time tent have emptied of occupant then pausing only occasionally to circle tent cut away rope made way to edge of camp by time sheet of flame have extended well nigh across camp extending high above lighting almost a if by day between fire lay still dark mass of tent for wind be blowing in opposite direction light a be elsewhere in black shadow of tent be still dark in extreme john made way along until came to end of next street then paused already three four active figure have run past at top of speed wished to be last to retreat stayed till heard tramp of troop coming down driven out by spreading flame then sprang across end of road dashed along at full speed still keeping close to line of tent shout rose from leading file of roman column showed that be seen a neared end of next opening roman soldier be pouring out turned in among tent again through made way dashing across open space once rushing through midst of roman column through passed before troop have time to strike at seize at last reached extremity of camp slope down to river be fifty yard away once over brow must be in darkness safe from pursuit already roman have drawn up column of men along edge of plateau to cut off who might try to pas john paused among last row of tent hesitating what course to adopt must not make directly up mountain for space between camp be now covered by roman cavalry greater portion of infantry being still engaged in trying to save at least portion of camp suddenly heard footstep among tent close behind drew back into tent by be standing peered cautiously out roman soldier came hastily along entered next tent doubtless to fetch article of value have left behind a rushed out on first alarm sudden idea flashed across john brain waited till soldier came out followed with silent step then sprang upon at bound hurling to ground burying knife again again in body illustration roman camp surprised set on fire not cry have escaped roman instant be sure be dead john rose to foot placed

different company several other soldier who have like man whom john have killed gone back to tent to fetch armor arm left there be also hurrying to take place in rank therefore special attention be paid to john until be within few yard of opening then centurion at end of line said sternly will be punished tomorrow for not being in place what be name for a john be between sheet of flame rising from camp roman be unable to see face instead of halting a expected john sprang past throwing down helmet buckler dashed through space between company seize cut down centurion shouted john be already descending slope a ran swung loosely buckled breastplate round on to back be well did so for moment later roman javelin rang against force of blow almost throwing on face in moment continued course be in total darkness now though javelin be flying around be thrown at random descent have now become so steep be obliged to pause in course to make way cautiously undid buckle left breastplate behind threw down sword climbed down until stood by side of river must hear shout above knew that roman be searching hillside hoping that have be killed wounded by dart have fear of pursuit swam river for have struck upon deep spot then at full speed ran along on bank knowing that of roman cavalry be encamped upon plain must soon be on spot however be quiet met one until arrived opposite place where have be arranged that party must meet then waded across be that john voice exclaimed be jonas thank god have got back safely how many be with there be loud cry of satisfaction a made way up bank

till hoped that have passed john said one who ran past open space added to danger for roman beyond must not notice a passed space lighted by flame be duty a leader to be last to go six of who be beyond have joined one of men said other six be be missing be what feared john answered felt sure that behind must have got safely away before roman recovered from first confusion danger be of course greater in proportion to distance from edge of slope how did get through john since say that escape be cut off john related how have slain roman soldier escaped with armor recital raised still higher in estimation of follower for modern feeling that be right to kill even bitterest enemy only in fair fight be wholly unknown in day when a be done by roman at jotapata men must cut throat of sleeping

of officer soldier have be burned man have to deplore loss of own a well a destruction of public property more than felt blow to pride there be not soldier felt humiliated at thought that number of enemy for from fire breaking out simultaneously be certain at least score of men must have be engaged in matter must penetrate unseen into midst of camp worse still that after effecting damage must have succeeded in making escape for so far a knew whole of jew got safely away not for moment did relax siege operation troop engaged upon embankment be relieved at usual hour legion went up into mountain a usual to procure timber while four thousand archer divided into party two hundred strong extended over hill searched forest for mile for sign of enemy who be be now convinced comparatively few in number news of daring attack on roman camp spread far wide among town village of plain aroused drooping spirit of people who have begun to think that must be worse than useless to offer opposition to roman power whence came party have accomplished deed who be leader none knew inhabitant of village near hippo who alone must have enlightened be careful to maintain absolute silence for knew that if by chance rumor reached roman of locality from assailant have come must have carried fire sword among village by lake titus be away being absent on mission in syria vespasian went among troop exhorting not to be downcast at disaster have befallen for that bravest men be subject to sudden misfortune of kind exhorted to push on siege with more vigor in order that might sooner remove to camping ground where must not be exposed to such attack by lurking foe soldier replied with cheer next day embankment being completed opened so terrible fire from war engine upon defender of wall that be forced to retire into city roman at once pushed forward battering ram to wall setting to work with greatest vigor speedily made three breach through rushed with exulting jew ran down to oppose desperate conflict took place in narrow street roman pouring in in great number through breach pressed step by step up steep hill jew animated by despair again turned fell upon with such fury that roman must not withstand assault be driven down steep lane path with great slaughter who fled be stopped by crowd of own men pressing up hill from below roman soldier jammed a be between jew above own countryman below took refuge in house in great number be not constructed to bear weight of so many men in heavy armor floor fell in a many of roman climbed up on to flat roof also fell bringing wall down with standing a did almost one above house fell brought down one below thus ruin spread a one house of card brings down until whole of town standing on steep declivity on eastern side be mass of ruin confusion be tremendous dust of falling house so thickened air that men must not see yard in front of hundred of roman soldier be buried among ruin be killed at once others jammed between fallen timber strove in vain to extricate shouted to comrade to come to assistance enveloped in darkness ignorant of ground half suffocated with dust be powerless to aid in confusion roman fell by sword of roman many who must not extricate slew with own sword while exulting jew seeing in terrible disaster miracle effected in favor crowded down from above slaying with sword hurling mass of stone down on foe killing unable to retreat adding to confusion terror with yell of triumph rose high above confused shout of roman vespasian who have entered town with soldier have pushed forward with up hill be nearly involved in common destruction a house came crashing down around shouted loudly to soldier near to gather round to lock shield together to form testudo recognizing voice of beloved general soldier near rallied round sheltered beneath closely packed shield resisted storm of dart stone from above gradually in good order made way down over ruin issued safely from wall loss of roman be great soldier be greatly dispirited by defeat especially by thought that have deserted general in retreat vespasian however be wise enough to see that be time for rebuke accordingly addressed in language of approbation said that repulse be in way due to want of valor on part to accident such a none must foresee have be brought about to extent by too impetuous ardor led to fight rather with desperate fury of jew than with steady discipline that distinguished roman soldier defender of city be full of exultation at success setting to work with ardor soon repaired breach strengthened wall knew that in spite of momentary success position be desperate for provision be almost exhausted store have be laid up be very large siege have lasted for many month before arrival of roman number of people assembled within wall far exceeded usual population roman on part increased height of embankment prepared for second assault in meantime itabyrium have fallen hill of tabor be inaccessible except on north side level area on top be surrounded by strong wall placidus have be sent with six hundred horse against place hill be so steep difficult that hesitated to attack party pretended to be anxious to treat intending to take advantage of other placidus invited garrison to descend hill discus term with itabyrians accepted invitation with design of assailing roman unawares placidus who be on guard feigned retreat itabyrians boldly pursued on to plain when roman horse wheeling round dashed among inflicting terrible slaughter cutting off retreat towards city who escaped slaughter fled to jerusalem town weakened by loss of so many fighting men being much distressed by want of water again opened negotiation surrendered upon promise that life of within must be spared hunger be now doing work among people of gamala inhabitant suffered terribly for provision be taken for use of fighting men rest have to subsist a best must on little hoard might have hidden away on garbage of kind number made escape through sewer passage led into ravine where roman have placed guard still assault of roman be bravely repelled until on night of d of september two soldier of fifteenth legion contrived to creep unobserved to foot of one of highest tower of wall began silently to undermine foundation before morning broke have got in so far that must not be perceived from wall still worked in leaving few stone in place to support tower until last moment then struck away ran for life tower fell with terrible crash with guard upon in terror defender of wall leaped up fled in direction many be killed by roman dart among josephus one of two leader while chares who be lying in height of fever expired from excitement of calamity confusion in town be terrible deprived of two leader with town open to assault none knew what be to be done expected instant destruction air be filled with scream wailing of woman roman mindful of last repulse did not at once advance to assault in afternoon titus who have now returned taking two hundred horse force of infantry crossed breach entered town of defender rushed to meet others catching up child ran with wife to citadel defender fought bravely be driven steadily up hill by roman who be now reinforced by whole strength of army led by vespasian quarter be asked given defender contested foot of hill until last defender of gamala outside citadel have fallen then vespasian led men against citadel stood on rugged rock of great height offering tremendous difficulty to assailant jew stood upon summit rolling down great stone dart upon roman a strove to ascend very heaven seemed to fight against unfortunate jew for terrific tempest suddenly broke upon city so furious be wind that jew must no longer stand on edge of crag oppose progress of enemy while roman sheltered from wind by rock be able to press upwards platform once gained rushed upon jew slaying met men woman child vast number of jew in despair threw headlong with wife child over precipice when butchery be complete five thousand body be found at foot of rock four thousand lay dead on platform above of in gamala when roman entered two woman alone escaped be sister of philip general in agrippa army managed to conceal until carnage be over fury of roman have subsided then showed proclaimed who be gischala now alone of city of galilee defied roman arm people be for most part tiller of soil be anxious to make submission john rival bitter enemy of josephus with robber band have collected be master of town refused to allow talk of submission city have none of natural strength of jotapata gamala vespasian sent titus against with thousand horse while ordered tenth legion to take up winter quarter at scythopolis moved with other two legion to caesarea titus on arrival before gischala saw that city must be easily taken by assault desirous of avoiding more shedding of blood learning that inhabitant be desirous of surrendering sent officer before to offer term of capitulation troop of john of gischala manned wall when summons of titus be proclaimed john answered that garrison accepted willingly generous term be offered that day being sabbath nothing must be concluded without infringement of law until next day titus at once granted delay drew off troop to neighboring town in night john of gischala marched away with armed men followed by many of inhabitant with wife child fearing to remain in city exposed to anger of titus when found have be duped woman child soon began to drop behind men pressed on leaving helpless despairing woman behind in morning when titus appeared before town opened gate to at once people hailing a deliverer from oppression have so long suffered at hand of john band of ruffian titus entered gischala amidst acclamation of people behaved with great moderation injuring one contenting with throwing down portion of wall warning inhabitant that if again rose in rebellion same mercy must not be extended to have at once dispatched troop of horse in pursuit of fugitive overtook slew six thousand of men brought three thousand woman child back into city john with strongest of band be not overtaken made way to jerusalem fame of successful exploit of destruction of roman camp brought large number of young men flocking to hill a soon a roman retired from gamala all eager to join band john must have recruited number to extent now that galilee have fallen roman retired to winter quarter did not see that there be anything to be done until spring must be madness to attack of great roman camp at scythopolis caesarea although doubtless garrison left in tiberias tarichea other town might have be driven out must only have brought upon city anger of roman involved in ruin destruction still le must have be of advantage to go down at present into judea that province be suffering woe a great a roman must inflict upon from action of faction under pretense of punishing who be supposed to be favorable to making term with rome band of armed men pervaded whole country plundering slaying wretched inhabitant law order be at end in jerusalem who claimed for chief authority in country have done nothing to assist countryman in north in struggle with roman not man have be dispatched to galilee leader be occupied in own desperate feud battle took place in street of city peaceful inhabitant be plundered ill treated condition of within wall be a terrible a be that of without anarchy plunder carnage extended throughout judea while destruction of jerusalem be threatened by roman army in north jew made preparation whatever for defense spent whole time energy in civil strife when therefore numerous band who have now gathered round urged to lead down to jerusalem john refused to do so getting upon elevated spot where voice must be heard by said friend have heard a well a what be taking place in jerusalem country round did go down there what good must do must be drawn into strife on one side sword must be kept for defense of temple against roman must be stained with jewish blood moreover must aid to consume food stored away in granary can through winter attempt enterprise against roman here woe of galilee be over ten of thousand have fallen that survive can go about business till field in peace be to renew war here must bring upon fresh outburst of roman vengeance therefore there be naught for to do now in spring when roman get into motion against jerusalem will march to defense have naught to do with evil deed be being performed there have to do duty first duty of jew be to die if need be in defense of temple therefore let now disperse to home when first news come that roman be stirring of who be disposed to follow obey order can assemble here let only such come let rest make way singly to jerusalem be resolved to have only such with who will follow a one man know how faction rage in city compact body of men true to leader can maintain aloof from strife make respected by party single men must take side with one faction other be ill treated by be wanted at home field be lying untilled for want of hand therefore let lay aside arm until spring do duty to family until be called upon to aid in defense of temple when hour come will be ready to lead if be ready to follow john address received general approval gathering dispersed vowing that must assemble in spring follow john wherever chose to lead for be already regarded with almost superstitious admiration in country around deliverance at jotapata success that alone of jewish leader have gained over roman marked in eye a one specially chosen by god to lead to victory in few hour hill above gamala be deserted john follower be on way towards home chapter captive john be received with great joy by father who have already heard story brought by injured member of band from gamala be filled with pride that son must so have distinguished at once agreed to john proposal that must start on following day to fetch woman from neve a there be longer fear of trouble from roman galilee be completely subdued event might take place in judea in north must be unaffected by day after return then john set out with jonas for neve john charged companion on account to say anything of doings at siege of gamala a communication be difficult have not heard from simon since john have left friend at neve be not aware that have be absent from farm martha mary be delighted to see to hear that be well at home have be greatly alarmed at news of slaughter of fisherman on lake fearing john might have gone across to tarichea with of friend in village fear on head however abated a time passed on did not hear from simon who felt assured must have brought news to martha have aught happened to son have mourned over siege massacre of gamala have be filled with joy when news have arrived three day before that roman army have marched away to take up quarter for winter have looked for summons john brought for return home doe father think john that there will be trouble again in spring will have to leave home again a soon a winter be past hope not mother gamala be only town on side of jordan resisted roman authority a territory of agrippa be now peaceful there be reason why roman must enter again indeed galilee have now surrendered a vespasian moved towards sea deputy came to from town village think now that there will be no more trouble there have be terrible enough son what ten of thousand of men have perished what destruction have be wrought have be mourning for month now for woe have fallen upon people have be most terrible mother yet might have be worse nigh hundred fifty thousand have fallen at gadara jotapata japha tarichea gamala besides who be slain in village have be sacked destroyed still considering thing might have be worse be over now did more danger threaten nation might even rejoice that greater evil have befallen for revolt against rome have be done be preparation for siege of jerusalem however let begin to mourn over future storm have for present passed away from misfortune have befallen countryman have happily escaped farm stand uninjured harm have come to of villager have escaped john did none of neighbor go out in boat to tarichea feared when heard of sea fight that must have fallen mother fortunately listened to counsel of father who implored not to put out on lake for did do so must only bring misfortune ruin upon have heard john mary asked anything of champion who say have arisen have heard sort of tale of how harassed roman before gamala with follower burned camp one night well nigh destroyed how when go into fight roman javelin drop off without harming how when strike roman fall before blow like wheat before sickle john burst into laugh wonder mary that report did say also that must fly through air when chose must render invisible to enemy must by wave of hand destroy a host of sennacherib be destroyed roman be harassed somewhat at gamala by john follower who crept into camp at night set on fire have few skirmish with working party when have said that have said that there be to say about be not like john mary said indignantly for tale have circulated through province have fired imagination everyone be talking of what have done alone of leader have checked roman have shown wisdom a well a valor in fighting must have thought must have be one of first to praise everyone be talking about since heard of what have be doing mother pray for daily a pray for father now want to make out have done nothing want to make out that have done nothing mary for doubtless lord have be with have enabled to give trouble to roman be laughing at fable have heard about at report have converted skirmish with roman into sort of marvelous action believe be marvelous action mary said why must what people say be wrong believe in mother yes mary be true that tale have heard may be a john say exaggerated assuredly new champion of people must be man of wisdom valor see not why a god raised up champion for israel in old time must not do so now when need be so great there be reason mother john said more quietly fear that champion of israel be not yet forthcoming have heard of doings of john a said have merely have skirmish with roman band being too small to admit of regular fighting interrupted work gave trouble men creeping down into camp set on fire so caused good deal of loss more than can not be said of at rate mary said disdainfully have done more than josephus john for brought ruin on who took advice went into city have fortified may please to make little of what champion have done others think so everywhere be talked of praised old men be talking of jewish maiden be singing song in honor heard yesterday gathered round well near neve father must rejoice mother be proud of if be alive what do say down by lake jonas of captain be not tale have heard believed there have heard nothing about roman javelin not harming jonas said certainly got safely out of hand of roman when have well nigh taken say that be brave prudent men have great confidence trust in ridiculous jonas john exclaimed angrily mary mother looked at in surprise truly john mother said what mary said be just be not like must have thought must have be one of first to admire new leader seeing that be fighting in way have heard advocate a being that in roman must be fought instead of jew being shut up in city quite so mother doubt be adopting proper way of fighting therefore have naturally have success be only saying that have done nothing wonderful have given roman trouble by refusing to fight by merely trying to harass if there be thousand men who must gather small band together harass roman night day in same manner must render well nigh impossible for to make progress a be merely aided in delaying fall of gamala by day two now let talk of something else father have succeeded in getting in principal part of harvest fear that year will be short of fruit have have time to gather in fig have fallen from tree although have made enough wine for own use there will be little to sell matter not at martha said god have be very merciful towards so that have bread to eat water to drink until next harvest will have nothing to repine about when ruin destruction have fallen upon so many that evening when mary martha have retired to apartment former who have be very silent evening said can not understand mother why john speaks so coldly of doings of brave leader why be almost angry at praise of seems altogether unlike be unlike mary must never be surprised at men like to hear other praised though must have thought from what know of son that be above feeling of jealousy can not think that showed sign of feeling today seems absurd mother can understand john being jealous of one own age who surpassed in exercise though never saw so for when in rowing on lake in shooting with bow arrow in other sport of neighbor son have surpassed never seemed to mind at seems almost absurd to think that must be jealous of great leader who have done brave deed for people doe seem so mary wonder have be ever one of national fault to be jealous of leader from time people vexed moses aaron in wilderness have ever be same grieve to see in john who have distinguished greatly for age of whom be proud one be perfect child must not trouble because find that betrothed husband be not free from weakness expect to be free from weakness mother be one of last weakness must have expected to find in trouble when everything seemed so dark be pleasure to think that hero perhaps deliverer have arisen now john seems to say that have done nothing dear child martha said something may have occurred to vex john on way when men be put out will often show in strangest manner probably john will time speak just a warmly in praise of new leader a must yourself perhaps may be so mother mary assented can hardly believe that john be jealous doe seem so unlike must not speak on subject again mary if be unless brings up wise woman keep silence on subject may lead to disagreement will learn when have married that be easiest best way suppose so mother mary said in tone of disappointment somehow never seemed to before john must have subject on there must be disagreement dear mary martha said smiling john be mortal although may truly love other will trust be very happy a husband wife subject will occur upon will differ then a know wisest plan be for wife to be silent be wife duty always to give way to husband mary gave little shrug of shoulder a if to intimate that did not regard altogether favorably view of wife duty however said more kissed martha retired to bed next morning started early journeyed to capitolias where stayed at house of friend in evening talk again turned upon new leader who have burned roman camp when did so john at once made excuse went out regretted now that have not at once told mother what have be doing have intended in first place to give little surprise have idea of exaggerated report have be spread about when mary broke out into praise of unknown leader seemed to that must have be absurd to say that be person of whom have formed so fantastically exalted opinion not having said so at first did not see how must say so afterwards so left matter a stood until must return home while john be out heard news caused uneasiness be said that party of roman horse from scythopolis have be scouring country burning many village under pretext that roman soldier who have straggled away marauding on own account have be killed by peasant slaughtering people carrying off a slave such young woman men a be likely to fetch good price told mother what have heard asked whether did not think that must be better to stay where be for time return to neve martha be anxious to be at home again friend with whom be stopping said that report be week old doubtless roman have returned to camp determined therefore that must continue journey that maid must remain with friend at capitolias until roman excursion ceased accordingly set out in morning a before two woman riding john jonas walking by side of donkey following road by side of hieromax kept on without meeting anything to cause alarm until reached angle of stream where road to hippo branched off from followed river down to tarichea have gone short distance when saw cloud of dust rising along road in front of sparkle of arm in sun turn aside mother john exclaimed must be roman ahead turning aside rode towards garden orchard at great distance before reached two roman soldier separated from rest galloped after fly john martha said hurriedly jonas can escape must only ensure evil to if did mother will keep together roman soldier rode up roughly ordered party to accompany back to main body consisted of fifty men leader young officer whose garment armor showed that belonged to family of importance rode forward few pace to meet more of accursed race of rebel exclaimed be quiet traveler john said journeying from capitolias to tarichea have harmed one lord be same roman said scowling speak fair one day stab in back next pomponius said to sergeant put two lad with rest ought to fetch good price for be strong active a to girl will make present of to general to send to wife in rome be prettiest jewess have seen since entered country old woman can go be of use to anyone illustration mary hebrew woman in hand of roman martha threw arm round mary must have striven to resist with feeble strength carrying out of order when john said in hebrew mother will ruin lose own life go home quietly trust to to save habit of submitting to husband will martha have practiced life asserted embraced mary passionately drew aside a roman soldier approached then tottering away short distance sank weeping on ground mary shed tear pale a death walked by side of soldier who led to rear of cavalcade where four five other young woman be standing in dejected attitude john jonas be similarly placed with young men in midst of roman soldier hand be tied behind troop resumed way be traveling by road along little party have just come whenever house small village be seen half of troop galloped off flame be soon seen to rise party of wretched captive be driven in when about halfway to capitolias troop halted horse be turned into field of ripe corn to feed men sat down to meal while remainder stood on guard over captive john have whispered to jonas to work hand so a to loosen cord if possible lad whose bone be very small soon said that must slip rope off without difficulty be harder work for john indeed while on march did not venture to exert fearing that movement must be noticed by guard when halted got into middle of group of captive tried best to loosen cord jonas be close beside be of use jonas said cord be cutting into flesh will not yield in slightest let try john stand round close jonas said to other captive in hebrew want to loosen friend knot if can get away will bring rescue to others moved so a to completely cover movement of jonas lad stooping down applied teeth to knot in john cord soon succeeded in loosening will be enough jonas can draw hand through now jonas again stood up when make effort to escape jonas do dash between horseman run for in confusion will get start will not overtake until be across river once on hill be safe if remain behind get away a likely a not one of soldier must send javelin through a being companion after hour halt roman again mounted horse turned to retrace step two roman rode on side of captive who be about fifty in number john gradually made way to front of party between two leading horseman officer talking to sergeant rode few pace ahead in middle of road since cord have be loosened john have continued to work finger until circulation be restored suddenly slipped hand from fastening gave three bound forward vaulted on to back of horse behind officer have drawn knife have be hidden in girdle threw one arm round officer while struck knife deep into horse flank animal reared in air then at second application of knife sprang forward at top of speed before astonished roman knew what have happened john held in arm like vice exerting strength lifted from saddle hurled headlong to ground where lay bleeding insensible john have now time to look round struck with astonishment at sudden incident have passed under eye roman have at first instinctively reined in horse sergeant have be first to recover shouting to five leading soldier on side to follow

higher blood swifter pace than of ridden by soldier own weight too be far le than of heavy armed men in pursuit of with shout of scornful defiance wave of hand continued course before mile have be

belly of horse next to ran at top of speed for river be hundred yard away have gone three quarter distance before of soldier confused at attack upon officer doubtful whether whole of captive be not about to fall upon without order how to act set out in pursuit jonas plunged into stream dived to other side then sprang forward again just a three four soldier reached bank have left javelin be hurled after without effect with shout of triumph sprang up hillside be soon safe from pursuit a soon a saw that roman have turned back john sprang from horse unstrapped heavy armor covered chest side

eaten many question be asked on side simon inquiring about brother in law family life have led at farm martha asking after neighbor who have suffered who have escaped without loss harm when isaac men retired jonas rose also to go simon stopped remain with jonas life have be strangely cast in of john must that henceforth take place a one of family saved life at jotapata will henceforth be a adopted son to martha know that will spare of affection for lad who be a younger brother to john who must believe nay feel sure if need be give life for friend must do so indeed jonas said simply found outcast whom none cared for have treated like brother must gladly die for martha said few kind word to jonas whose quiet somewhat subdued manner whose evident affection for john have greatly pleased mary gave little nod signified that gladly accepted a one of family now martha simon said have not yet told how proud must feel in doings of son friend here be never weary of congratulating truly feel thankful that son of mine must have done such deed that lord must have chosen to use a instrument of will dear father john interrupted have told that there be nothing at out of way in what have done jonas others did just a much a did methinks that of make much more than be needful of skirmish praise because in so doing praise who did a much a did understand simon martha said know that john fought bravely at jotapata that be marvelous that jonas escaped when so many fell be that be speaking of have john said nothing about what have be doing since simon asked in surprise father said nothing about john said before mother must speak thought in first place that must like to tell in next people there have heard such magnified report must not for very shame lay claim to be hero have pictured to what have done martha asked more more surprised while mary at last word sprang to foot stood looking at with intent eager face must have told martha simon said be light thing that son of ours have done young a be eye of people be upon for with small band gathered here harassed enemy several day boldly entering camp destroyed by fire oh john mary said in low voice while martha exclaimed what be john of whom have heard so much young man of whom people speak a future leader boy can not mean simon there be mistake about martha lad came to said thought that with small band must cause much trouble to roman so told must go not knowing whether spoke from restlessness of youth because be will of lord that must go fight for country indeed seemed to many that marvelous escape from jotapata showed that god have need of so did not withstand there be many from village round who be ready to join to follow for fame of escape have made much talked of so went with twenty four follower of course jonas here truly did a men say great thing though saved not gamala a indeed must not have be done save by miracle of god with so small band did much by burning of camp not only struck heavy blow upon roman inspired people with hope before seemed that to resist roman be to bring certain destruction upon who adventured now men see that with prudence united with bravery much may be done in spring john will be followed by great gathering of fighting men from country round martha sat in speechless surprise looking at son dear mother john said what told before when be praising unknown john be equally true now that be john son acted with common sense so far one seems to have exercised in struggle with roman just kept out of reach took good care never to come to actual blow with constantly threatened compelled who knew nothing of number strength to cease working a to burning camp of course there be certain amount of danger in one can not make war without danger crept through sentry into camp in night set on fire then made escape a best must a only one of number be killed from falling over precipice not by sword of roman see peril must not have be very great be just a said that because did not throw away life be prudent cautious succeeded people have made great fuss about because be only success however small that have gained over roman a father say have certainly have good effect have excited feeling of hopefulness in spring many will take field with belief that after roman be not invincible that who fight against be not merely throwing away life be time before martha must realize that hero of have heard so much be quiet lad standing before own son john simon said at last morning night have prayed god to protect of whom heard so much little thinking that be own son be praying for tonight will thank that have so blessed assuredly god hand be with danger have run success that have gained may a say be magnified by report nevertheless have assuredly withstood roman even a david went out against goliath tomorrow will hear more of feel shaken with journey with strange news come mary let to bed mary have already stolen away without having said single word after first exclamation john be at work soon after daybreak next morning for there be much to be done men be plowing up stubble ready for sowing jonas have gone off with isaac to drive in cattle from hill john set to work to dig up patch of garden ground near house have not be long at work when saw mary approaching came along quietly slowly with step altogether unlike own why mary be that said a approached why miriam herself must not walk slower be ill morning child asked with change of voice a saw how pale be looking mary did not speak until came quite close then stopped looked at with eye full of tear oh john began what can say why dear mary what on earth be matter with said throwing down spade taking hand in be so unhappy john unhappy john repeated what be making unhappy child be so dreadful said to think that who ought to have known so well betrothed wife have be thinking that be so mean a to be jealous for did think be that john when made light of doings of hero have be thinking about so much must not allow that have done anything particular thought that be jealous john now know what have done why spoke so feel be altogether unworthy of well mary never thought be little goose before what nonsense be talking be only natural must have thought be jealous must have be jealous if have be anyone else be praising so much be fault for not telling at once concealment be always stupid have thought that must give pleasant surprise when got home to hear about instead of causing pleasure have caused pain be not vexed in slightest be rather amused when answered so curtly think be cruel of john to let go on thinking badly of showing in so unworthy light doe not make le wrong of ought to have believed in be making mountain out of molehill mary wo hear such nonsense heard absurd story a to what someone have be doing naturally made hero of be hurt by speaking slightingly of hero of yours naturally thought be jealous at hearing such praise of from betrothed wife be perfectly natural be not in least offended with put out in way except be vexed with for not telling at once that fable related to cousin john now dry eye think more about go pick two of finest bunch of grape can find will eat together be time before mary recovered brightness change last few month have made almost depressed be year ago john have be boy girl together now have become man have done great deed be looked upon by many a one chosen for deliverance of nation mary felt that too have aged change in be a nothing to in old playfellow be year ago have be gravely advising treating sometimes a if have be elder must have treated now if must have let with something of deference respect jewish maiden must usually pay to betrothed husband one who be shortly to become lord first time detected manner john simply laughed at said dear mary let have nonsense of sort have be always equal friend companion know just a well a do that in matter have have in common have always have quite a much sense a on great many matter more sense nothing have occurred since then to alter have grown into young man into young woman have advanced equally on matter concerning warfare have gained good deal of knowledge in other matter doubtless have gained knowledge if dear be god will pas through trouble danger lie before become man wife trust that will always be friend comrade that have be a boy girl together be very well when young men maiden have seen nothing of other until parent bring together a man wife for bride to affect deep respect have not least doubt be generally far from feeling in heart for man to whom be given happily have not be way with have learned to know other well to know beyond difference in strength man have over woman there be difference between that one will rule house other will rule farm that in thing trust will be companion equal do hope mary that there will be change in way few month have to be together now in spring go up to help to defend jerusalem be use hiding fact from ourselves that there be little chance of returning know what have befallen who have hitherto defended city against roman have happened at jotapata gamala will probably happen at jerusalem for reason let have change let be a brother sister to one a have be along if god brings back safe to become wife there will be plenty of time to settle exactly how much deference will pay will expect that when novelty of affecting wifely obedience be enjoined upon female of race be past will be quite ready to take up equality be after rule in practice will remember word mary said saucily when time come may be will regret expression about equality day so during winter mary tried to be bright cheerful martha whose heart be filled with anxiety a to danger trial lay before jerusalem temple threatened john away engaged in desperate enterprise often wondered to herself when heard girl merry laugh a talked with john saw how completely seemed to put aside sort of anxiety did not know how mary often spent entire night in weeping prayer how hard be struggle to keep up brave appearance be knew pleasure to john be not much at home being often absent for day together stranger came went frequently john have long conversation with sometimes went away with did not return for three four day question be asked by parent a to visitor absence knew that have reference to what considered mission a when returned home evidently wished to lay aside thought of other thing to devote to life with asked question a to what be doing spoke sometimes of thing to mary when be together alone knew that number of young men be only waiting signal to join that party of met among hill be there organized into company with officer of own choice over unknown to roman at scythopolis there be daily held throughout country on side of jordan meeting where men practiced with arm improved skill with bow arrow learned to obey various signal of bugle john have now elaborated john be resolute in refusing to accept men with wife family there be other leader said under whom must fight be determined to have none men who be ready to sacrifice life without care of others dependent upon be ready to accept youth of fifteen a well a men of five twenty believing that in point of courage one be equal to other candidate have to be introduced by others who vouched for activity hardihood courage one of object be to avoid increasing band to too great dimension number of ready to go up to defend jerusalem eager to enroll a follower of new leader whose mission be now generally believed in in part of country be very large john knew that multitude must be unwieldy that must find impossible to carry out with thousand of men tactic dependent for success upon celerity of movement moreover did arrive in jerusalem with so great following must at once become object of jealousy to leader of faction there therefore limited number to four hundred men urging upon others who presented sent message to to form into similar band to choose leader to act a independent body hanging upon rear of roman harassing with frequent night alarm cutting off convoy attacking working party always avoiding encounter with strong body of roman by retreating into hill said that although must not receive more men into own force than thought must be easily handled must be glad to act in concert with other leader so at time band might unite in common enterprise especially that if entered jerusalem might hold together thus be enabled to keep aloof from party of john of gischala eleazar who be contending for mastery of city advice be taken several band similar to own be formed leader felt that needed prestige authority john have gained that follower must not obey order with faith be inspired in member of john own band by belief in special mission representation on subject be so urgent that john at request attended meeting at ten of chief be present be held in farmhouse not far from spot where gamala have stood john be embarrassed at respect men of several year older than paid accepted position quietly for felt that belief existed a to having special mission added greatly to power of utility listened to representation a to want of authority to rivalry jealousy already existed among who have enrolled when have finished said have be thinking matter well over be convinced that be absolutely necessary that none of command will exceed number have fixed upon namely four hundred men divided into eight company with captain at same time see reason why corp must not be nominally under one leader if then think will strengthen position be ready to accept general leadership to appoint a commander of troop then will hold commission will support in command with authority may have at same time will understand that will in reality act altogether independently of save except when seems to that can unite in enterprise if enter jerusalem will then hold together for mutual protection from faction even there will command independently for did assume general command must excite jealousy of leader of faction must be forced to take part in civil strife be devastating city cordial consent to proposition be given by other leader who said that knowledge that be john officer must add immensely to authority must also raise courage devotion of men who must not believe that be being led to victory unless be acting under order of john remember john said that if misfortune befalls have never laid claim to divine commission be agent of god may be that have specially chosen a one of instrument can not say beyond fact that so far have be carried safely through great danger have be enabled to win success over roman set up a specially appointed leader say for two reason in first place that must not think that be claiming authority command on ground may not be justified in second place that if must fall early in fighting others must not be disheartened believe that lord have deserted be lad among recognize that be god who have so strangely brought into eminence having done that much may now choose other instrument if must be so if a may well be one of must obtain far greater success than may attend will be only too glad to lay aside authority over rest with be willing to invest to follow a cheerfully a now propose to follow meeting soon afterwards broke up news that john of gamala a be generally called from success have gained over roman before town have assumed supreme command of various band be being raised in eastern galilee on east of jordan spread rapidly greatly increased popular feeling of hope confidence fresh band be formed leader receiving appointment from before spring arrived there be twenty band formed organized in readiness to march down towards jerusalem a soon a roman legion got into motion chapter tale of civil strife towards spring simon family be surprised by visit from rabbi solomon ben manasseh be year since have last seen

friend be happy indeed in quiet farm free from distraction of terrible time looking round here seeing just a left save that young people have grown somewhat must think that left yesterday have be passing through hideous nightmare look at flesh have fallen away strength have gone can scarce stand upon leg young child must overthrow have wept till tear be dried up over misfortune of jerusalem yet enemy have come within sight of wall dug trench against be devoured by own child ruin desolation have come upon old man be assisted into house food wine placed before then be led into guest chamber there slept for hour in evening have recovered somewhat of strength joined party at meal when be concluded family be alone told what have happened in jerusalem during past year vague rumor of dissension civil war have reached jealous watch be set round city none be suffered to leave under pretext that who wished to go out be deserter who sought to join roman passed through with difficulty rabbi said after bribing john of gischala with worldly mean to grant pas through guard even then must not have succeeded have not known in old time when looked upon a one zealous for defense of country against roman little thinking then that day must come when must grow into oppressor of people tenfold a cruel pitiless a worst of roman tribune last autumn when with band of horseman with steed weary with hard riding arrived before gate of jerusalem saying that have come to defend city thinking not worth while to risk life in defense of mere mountain town like people poured out to meet do honor terrible rumor of slaughter massacre in galilee have reached none knew exact truth moreover john have be enemy of josephus since josephus have gone over to roman name be hated accursed among people thus be favorably inclined towards john think anyone be deceived by story told for be evident that john men have fled before roman still tidings brought be reassuring be gladly received in city told that roman have suffered very heavily at siege of jotapata gamala that be greatly dispirited by desperate resistance have met with number of engine of war have be destroyed that be in condition to undertake siege of strong city like jerusalem though outwardly rejoiced many in heart grieved at news for thought that even occupation by roman must be preferable to suffering be undergoing for month band of robber who called zealot have ravaged whole country pillaging burning slaying under pretense assaulted be favorable to cause of rome thus gradually country people forsook home fled to jerusalem for refuge when country be left desert more plunder be to be gained robber band gradually entered jerusalem a know gate of holy city be always open to jewish people none thought of excluding stranger who entered believing that armed man must add to power of resistance when roman appeared before robber who came singly in small party from part of country soon gathered together in city established sort of terror over peaceable inhabitant men be robbed murdered openly in street house be broken open pillaged none dare walk in street without risk of insult assault antipas levias saphias of royal blood be seized thrown into prison there murdered many others of principal people be slain then robber proceeded to further length took upon to appoint high priest selected family have claim to distinction drawing lot among chose a high priest one phannias country priest ignorant boorish wholly unable to discharge function of office hitherto people have submitted to oppression of zealot desecration of holy office filled with rage indignation ananus oldest of chief priest man of piety wisdom be head of movement calling people together exhorted to resist tyranny oppressed be now desecrating temple for zealot have taken refuge there made holy place headquarters people seized arm before be ready for attack zealot learning what be going on took initiative fell upon people be le accustomed to arm than foe have superiority of number fought with fury at first zealot gained advantage people increased in number behind pressed in front forward zealot be driven back into temple quadrangle of gentile be taken zealot fled into inner court closed gate thither wounded have already be carried whole place be defiled with blood ananus having fear of god before eye did not like to attack there leaving six thousand chosen men on guard in cloister arranging that must be regularly relieved retired such be state of thing when john of gischala arrived at once professed complete agreement with party of ananus be admitted into council time a afterwards learned be keeping up secret correspondence with zealot betrayed to that took place at council there be distrust of in addition to party have entered city with have speedily gathered together many others distracted a already be with trouble none cared to add to number of enemy by openly distrusting john who took many solemn oath of fidelity to cause of order at length volunteered to enter inner temple on mission to zealot to persuade to surrender leave city sooner be among than threw off mask told zealot that offer to allow to depart in peace be blind that must at once be massacred if surrendered therefore advised to resist to send for assistance without recommending especially to send to idumeans eleazar zacharias chief of zealot felt sure that above must be sacrificed if surrendered embraced john counsel sent off swift footed messenger to idumeans urging to come to assistance idumeans have since conquest by hyrcanus be incorporated with jew be fierce warlike people of arab descent immediately messenger of zealot arrived embraced proposal anticipating acquisition of great plunder in jerusalem marching with speed appeared twenty thousand strong before wall of jerusalem although taken completely by surprise for none knew that messenger have gone over to idumeans people manned wall jesus colleague of ananus addressed idumeans asked to take one of three course to unite with people in punishing notorious robber assassin who be desecrating temple to enter city unarmed arbitrate between conflicting party to depart leave city to settle own difficulty simon leader of idumeans answered that came to take part of true patriot against men who be conspiring basely to sell people into hand of roman at answer jesus left wall held debate upon situation before arrival of new enemy felt certain of overpowering zealot ananus must ere long have be persuaded to lay aside scruple attack for a be desecrating sanctuary must be better to shed blood there when wicked men be slain to offer up atonement purify temple a have be done before in day of maccabees after temple have be defiled redoubled guard round temple so that none must issue out thence to communicate with idumeans at night terrible storm set in with lightning thunder rain so that very earth seemed to shake great awe fell upon within without city to all seemed sign of wrath of god at civil discord though doubtless be voice of almighty be rather presage of further evil under shelter of storm drove guard to take refuge of zealot cut asunder bar of gate crept along street to wall then sawed through bar of gate faced idumeans who be trembling with terror in storm unseen by anyone idumeans entered gate marched through city approached temple then fell upon guard while zealot attacked from behind furious at hour have passed exposed to tempest ashamed of fear naturally pitiless cruel idumeans gave quarter terrible carnage took place among ten thousand men who have be placed in outer court of temple fought desperately others threw down from wall into city when morning dawned eight thousand five hundred of best fighting men have be slain a soon a be daylight idumeans broke into city pillaging slaying high priest ananus jesus be among who be slain in terrible night be extinguished last hope of saving jerusalem ananus be man of highest character have labored unceasingly to place city in posture of defense believing rightly that stronger be wall more formidable resistance must offer better chance there be of obtaining favorable term from roman ananus be leader hope of peace party comprised respectable class older wiser men in jerusalem death left conduct of affair in hand of thoughtless rash desperate massacre continued for day idumeans hunting citizen in street vast number be killed without question young men of upper class be dragged to prison be there scourged tortured to force to join zealot not one must do so all preferred death thus perished twelve thousand of best wisest in jerusalem then zealot set up tribunal by proclamation assembled seventy of principal citizen remaining to form court before brought zacharias son of upright patriotic wealthy man charged with entering into correspondence with roman produced shadow of evidence against zacharias defended boldly clearly establishing own innocence denouncing iniquity of accuser seventy unanimously acquitted prisoner preferring to die with to condemning innocent man zealot rushed forward with cry of rage slew zacharias with blow insult turned judge out of temple idumeans at length began to weary of massacre be sated with pillage declaring that have be deceived by zealot that believed treason have be intended left city first opening prison releasing two thousand person confined there who fled to simon son of gioras who be wasting country toward idumea zealot after departure redoubled iniquity seemed a if must leave none alive save lowest of people gorion great distinguished man be among slain niger of peraea who have be leader in attack on roman at ascalon noble true hearted patriot be also murdered died calling upon roman to come to avenge who have be thus murdered denouncing famine pestilence civil massacre a well a war against accursed city have lain hidden with obscure family with whom have lodged during terrible time so great be terror misery in city who lived envied dead be death to bury even relative within without city lay heap of body decaying in sun even among zealot faction arose john of gischala headed one party that more violent over ruled with absolute authority occupied one portion of city other party acknowledged special leader sometimes then faction fought among side ceased from plundering murdering inhabitant such friend be condition of jerusalem when left having a told purchased permission from john of gischala to pas through guard at gate a traveled here learned that danger threatens sect called assassin a know seized strong fortress of masada near dead sea at beginning of trouble until lately have be content to subsist on plunder of adjacent country on night of passover surprised engaddi dispersed who resisted slew seven hundred woman child who must not escape carried off content of granary be now wasting whole region what hope can there be of success friend when with enemy close to gate jew be slaying more of fellow countryman than roman did ever country present so humiliating terrible spectacle be such atrocity ever perpetrated by men upon brother yet madman still believe that almighty will deliver will save from destruction that temple have polluted altar that have deluged with blood when rabbi have finished narration there be long silence martha be in tear at recital of misery be endured by inhabitant of jerusalem simon sat with face covered with hand john have scarce moved since rabbi have begun story sat with heavy frown on face looking straight before while mary anxiously watched to see effect of recital upon simon be first to speak be tale of mourning lamentation woe that have told rabbi not even in day of captivity in babylon be jewish people fallen so low let to bed now thing be too terrible to speak of until have laid before lord asked guidance wonder not now rabbi that year seem to have rolled over head since last met others rose mary a passed john laid hand on shoulder with caressing action be very rare to for generally behaved to a to brother holding exhibition of greater affection unmaidenly until day of betrothal be ended action seemed to recall john from gloomy thought smiled down at anxious face then when others went off to apartment went out into night air stood for hour nearly immovable with eye fixed on star in morning mary joined in garden a have come to be custom being only time in day when be alone together well john asked understood question have thought over mary in way can not see that duty be changed by what heard last night affection for parent must keep here wish must see that duty must go hand in hand with wish have be sorely tempted to yield to resign struggle to remain here in peace quiet must never be happy believe be a so many think specially called to be deliverer though god have assuredly specially protected aided did draw back now must be grievous discouragement to many have put hand to plow can not look back god have permitted misery to fall upon jerusalem doubtless a punishment for sin of people may be yet that wrath will be abated that will remember mercy of old have suffered temple to be profaned may not be purpose to allow to be destroyed utterly evil doings therefore of evil men release from duty have always be held chief duty of jew to die if need be in defense of temple never so long a stand can say that lord have wholly turned face from that purpose period of exile captivity to befall people therefore mary will go on a have intended warring against roman doing what can to hinder advance against jerusalem think that war may last longer than have expected vespasian will have heard from who like rabbi have escaped from jerusalem what be going on within city knowing great strength of wall judging from what saw at jotapata gamala how desperate must be resistance be to appear before may well decide to leave for present suffering population to prey upon other to consume provision waste strength till when march against there will be no longer men left to man wall thought must decide so john mary said quietly much a love for do love must rather part with so never to see again than that must draw back now set up on pedestal before knew that be who be hero must not have said that of whom such high hope be cherished drew back from enterprise have taken up rather must mourn for life than men must say of 'this be of whom said be deliverer who shrank from danger of battle threw down country sword ' thank mary be glad to hear say so thought that be right be very hard so to decide now that agree with chief cause for hanging back be removed henceforth will trouble no more over conscience tell that be right to go say go also therefore now betides will not blame will feel must not have taken other course have faith john that will come back to when trouble be over believe that may happen at jerusalem will be spared to think that be either for country for that life be spared alone of fought at jotapata mean to keep on thinking so will keep up spirit while be away will help to cheer mother if roman move upon jerusalem may be able to be often at home policy will be to strike blow then when roman gather in force to scatter disappear so that may often be home until time come when enemy gather round jerusalem at rate mary will try believe that hope be well founded that in end will return alive to certainly will not spare life for when one take up post of leader of fellow must never hang back from danger must be always in front at same time will never forget that be thinking praying for will never throw away life recklessly if time come when see that be lost that fighting be longer of avail will neither rush into enemy rank to die will throw down arm die unresisting will slay with own weapon will strive in way to save life for sake having done must for country temple be ask john be quite content to wait here until day come that will return then though cause be lost country ruined god temple destroyed can yet feel that god have be good merciful to even if be driven out of home have to become exile in far land week later news came that roman be preparing to take field young men of village at once started a messenger through country at night vast pile of brushwood be lighted on hill above gamala answering fire soon blazed out from other height at signal men left home on shore of galilee in city of plain in mountain of peraea batanaea capitolias gerisa pella sepphoris caphernaum tiberias even town village almost within sight of caesar camp at caesarea sent contingent in twenty four hour eight thousand armed men be gathered on slope of mount galaad man brought with grain sufficient for week consumption have according to mean brought money in accordance with instruction john other commander have issued for john held although a be fighting for country must if necessary live upon country yet that a far a possible must abstain from taking food without payment so run risk of being confounded with band who under cloak of patriotism plundered robbed whole country band assembled under leader be easy to see that have come from different locality tarichea tiberias have sent two company aspect of differed widely from of company of peasant raised in village on slope of hermon among mountain of peraea seemed animated by equal feeling of devotion of confidence in young leader john after carefully inspecting own band visited camp of other company be everywhere received with acclamation addressed company in turn not only urging to show bravery for jew have shown who have fought against roman pointing out that far more than be required while must be ready to give life when need be must be equally ready to shun fight to scatter fly when leader gave order be not by bravery that must hope to overcome roman by harassing night day by attacking camp cutting off convoy giving rest above obedience be required look at roman soldier said have will of own advance retreat attack when know that who first attack must die support hardship fatigue accomplish marvel in way of work give up in fact to obey order given never questioning whether order be best blindly obeying so must be here if be to fight roman with chance of success most useful man here man who will do best service to country be not who be strongest bravest who be most prompt in obedience to order true hero be who give up will if need be life at order of leader have chosen own officer have confirmed choice that have made be for now to give support assistance there will be hardship must be borne without complaint there will be delay must be supported with patience there will be combat danger must be met with confidence courage believing that god will give success that although issue of strife be in hand of must do best by conduct courage to gain success will not act in one great body for must not find food in village for so large number moreover to do so must be to give roman opportunity of massing force against of surrounding destroying on great occasion for great object may gather together unite force at other time although acting upon general plan in concert with other company will work independently so will elude roman when strike at will be gone when try to inclose will disperse when pursue one body others will fall upon when think that be in one part of country will be striking blow in when fancy in security will fall upon will give rest peace john address be received with shout of approval by great majority of present be now seen for first time appearance tone of authority with spoke air of confidence manner in have evidently thought out plan of action prepared for contingency confirmed report have heard of conviction that be specially appointed leader be deepened strengthened how otherwise must one who be mere youth speak with such firmness authority memory of jew be stored with legend of prowess of juda maccabean brother of other leader who have from time to time arisen enabled to clear country of oppressor be thus prepared to accept willingly who appeared to specially sent a leader question of age experience weighed little with moreover a none have be trained a soldier there be none who have to set aside superior claim samuel have be chosen a child saul be youngest of brother david lad when slew champion of philistine such being case youth of john be drawback in eye of follower indeed fact that being still youth have yet escaped from jotapata where elder have died that have inflicted heavy blow upon roman when others who have opposed have perished seemed in proof that be under special protection john probably believed in le than did man among follower piously devoutly brought up saw in two escape that have have from death at hand of roman sign of special protection of god while hoped that might be able to do roman much harm have not conviction that be destined to deliver country have none of fervent enthusiasm of men who be convinced that have divine mission that miracle must be wrought in favor have seen tremendous strength of roman army a defiled from mountain before jotapata have learned power of war engine have evidence of discipline bravery perseverance have idea that force a gathered round must cope with legion of rome still that firm pious belief be so deeply ingrained in heart of jew that god specially interested in that personally directed everything that befell intervened in incident of history have natural effect upon training taught that be instrument in god hand although hardly even hoped that be destined to be deliverer of jerusalem thought that god might intend to do great thing for people at rate while never claiming special authority to have more than around special mission be careful not to damp enthusiasm of follower by disclaiming mission attributed to knowing how much belief added to authority to efficiency of force under command chapter desultory fighting after having gone through camp of whole of company assembled leader round held council a to future operation be agreed that must be best to leave alone for present legion at scythopolis for rumor of gathering must almost certainly have reached that city roman might be on guard against attack be resolved therefore to cross jordan few mile below tarichea to traverse hill between endor gelbus by long march to gain range of hill extending from carmel to samaria forming boundary between latter province galilee must then be looking down upon camp of vespasian at country between hill city be too flat for to engage with hope of success for although by surprise might inflict great damage on roman must be wholly unable to withstand charge of roman horse must therefore maintain lookout from mountain attack roman camp first time be pitched on ground whence rapid retreat must be effected to hill a jordan be unfordable between scythopolis lake who must not swim be ordered to carry with on march down to river log of light wood sufficient to support in crossing who must swim be to assist in piloting over unable to do so must be work of great difficulty for width of jordan be not great be only for short distance in center that must be unfordable a be to be expected company raised near shore of lake contained few men unable to swim while from mountain district be almost wholly ignorant of art band be therefore linked together for purpose of crossing one of from plain company of mountaineer marching down to stream together preparation be complete by afternoon just a be becoming twilight leading band arrived on bank of jordan crossing be effected without difficulty in two hour be over then company formed up under leader started independently men who knew country well being assigned a guide to crossed hill between endor gelbus marched through jezrael then just a morning be breaking ascended slope of mount carmel leaving legio on right be march of about fifty mile men be active vigorous lightly armed sustained by enthusiasm excitement not man dropped behind during journey once among hill threw down for rest of hour from crest of hill be twelve mile down to caesarea blue line of sea extended right left a far a eye must reach in afternoon jonas be sent down to city to learn how matter stood there when vespasian be going to move be to remain there that night return with news on following morning came back however at midnight saying that roman have marched on previous day that have taken southern road skirted mountain for distance must probably cross central range at sichem proceed to scythopolis join legion thence on plain of aulon west of jordan be disappointment at daybreak company be afoot be decided must march separately taking own line to east following unfrequented road keeping among hill a far a possible so that report of passage of large gathering of men must reach roman although time have be lost john when approached jordan learned that vespasian have already joined legion from scythopolis have crossed river into peraea be marching with speed against gadara chief city halting for night near jordan john crossed river by ford next morning then moved forward cautiously to commence operation a soon a roman be engaged upon siege of city ere many hour have passed learned that inhabitant have sent forward deputation to vespasian that war party taken by surprise by rapid advance of roman have hastily evacuated city after slaying many of who be willing to admit roman when vespasian arrived have be received with acclamation by inhabitant who have already destroyed portion of wall to prove that never thought of resistance having thus established roman authority in peraea vespasian left garrison there set out with main body of army for caesarea leaving garrison in town dispatching placidus with five hundred horse three thousand foot in pursuit of fugitive who have fled from gadara before entered a vespasian marched back band under john began work wherever road led through mountain rolled down rock upon column light armed ally of roman be sent out on flank climbing hill attacked assailant a soon however a neared crest be a believed held by small party only of enemy jew rushed upon with fury overthrew drove down hill until heavy armed troop be obliged to advance to assistance upon jew at once fell back to higher slope growing bolder by success even ventured to rush down upon baggage breaking through guard killing great number of animal party of roman horse came up at full gallop be charged just a reached spot by two more company from hill before roman must face about oppose line of long spear to assailant be among stabbing horse leaping up behind soldier slaying with knife throwing whole into confusion then sound of horn be heard on hillside whole of jew instantly relinquished work took to mountain just a large body of cavalry headed by titus came thundering up at night roman be disturbed by constant alarm men crept up to sentry slew in darkness number of enemy penetrated into camp killing soldier a slept hocking horse setting fire to camp in several place be not until whole army got under arm that attack ceased next day be similarly harassed upon march be not until have crossed mountain descended on to western plain that jew drew off highly satisfied with result of first encounter with roman loss have be slight not more than twenty having fallen while have killed more than two hundred of light armed troop have inflicted loss upon roman have slain number of baggage animal have shown enemy however formidable roman soldier might be on plain legion of vespasian be more invincible than be that of cestius among hill regretted however that instead of engaging main army have not followed force under placidus of whose dispatch from gadara have not learned until be too late fugitive of whom placidus be in pursuit have taken possession of village of bethennabris pursued stratagem have already succeeded so well feigned retreat jew sallied out attacked cut off greater part from returning to village at night attacked bethennabris captured put within to sword who have escaped be joined by great number of country people made for jordan intending to cross by ford opposite jericho river be swollen with rain be unable to cross placidus overtook attacked vast number be killed more be driven into river drowned fifteen thousand fell two thousand five hundred be taken prisoner with vast number of animal of kind placidus then reduced whole of peraea coast of dead sea a far a machaerus vespasian soon moved down from caesarea keeping near sea capturing antipatris lydda thamna blocking emmaus then continuing course southward wasted country to frontier of idumea captured town betaris caphartobas putting to sword about ten thousand men then marched back by emmaus sichem descended hill marched to jericho where be joined by placidus with troop from peraea city have be deserted by inhabitant roman army rested here for time until just a vespasian be about to march upon jerusalem news arrived of death of nero unwilling to weaken army by besieging city strong in defended by host vespasian withdrew to caesarea for two year jerusalem have time for preparation submission a vespasian march have except when be crossing mountain from emmaus to sichem lain entirely in plain john have be able to do little force have be sent across jordan operation have greatly added to difficulty placidus have met with in subduing other company have closely followed march of vespasian have made many attack upon party dispatched to pillage country after roman marched north again besieged captured of small place in have left garrison have united when two roman army met at jericho be prepared to defend desperately rugged mountain road leading thence to jerusalem when to surprise saw roman host moving away to north again a soon a ascertained that vespasian have for present entirely abandoned idea of attacking jerusalem that troop have gone into permanent quarter john held council with other commander be in favor of remaining in arm of constantly attacking roman garrison others be for scattering returning to home from have now be absent three month until roman again set in motion against jerusalem opinion be about equally divided john remained silent until have spoken then said think that have better disperse if remained in arm might gain success might surprise slay roman garrison others must speedily prepare against attack by strengthening wall taking precaution did succeed in destroying garrison in one of town have captured of what benefit must be must rather excite roman yet more against people yet more must march through land burning destroying slaying must turn country into desert slay carry away people captive must irritate without seriously injuring roman very people whose suffering must heighten by work must turn against now that whole country have be scoured town have resisted destroyed men who defended put to sword there may be breathing space for land until roman advance against jerusalem may be that in jerusalem may come to term with roman in case there need not be more bloodshed therefore say that seems to that must be wrong to continue war so long a roman rest peacefully in camp must jerusalem have need of in defense one of will again take field john counsel be finally adopted many of men be longing to return to home where knew that must be welcomed honored for deed have performed for although have achieved grand success have done much by compelling roman to keep together have thus saved many town from plunder destruction operation too have created fresh sensation of hope have aroused people from dull despair in be sinking have messenger be now sent out on side great multitude of men must have collected john knew well that number must be of avail that in pitched battle roman must defeat many time number of undisciplined ill armed jew john stood even higher in estimation of follower than did at commencement of campaign own band have be particularly successful have several time encountered party of roman almost equal to in number plan have be always well laid on occasion have roman cut off killed numerous party altogether justness of view have be established by experience men have gained confidence in in now only regretted that have have opportunity of attacking roman in anything like equal number therefore when news spread that john be of opinion that wisest course be for to return to home there to hold in readiness to reassemble whenever roman moved against jerusalem decision be willingly accepted few hour after roman column have marched out from jericho jewish company started for respective home promising to take up arm again when signal be given although success have attended have not be so great a have hoped have be sufficiently marked to inspire with confidence in leader few life have be lost have learned that so long a persisted in tactic leader have laid down there be little chance of roman striking heavy blow at surprise be mingled with joy in greeting john received on return home disaster have befallen band hope john simon asked anxiously heard that roman have reached jericho have be praying lord night day for protection for believing that must doubtless fall upon enemy a marched through mountain towards jerusalem must have done so father already have taken up position on height commanding road there be fighting simply because vespasian have marched away with army to caesarea will not a believe make movement against jerusalem year lord be praised simon said piously there be time yet for city to repent in sackcloth ash for sin to come to such term with roman a may save temple so far a have heard father jerusalem be little likely to repent to negotiate news of what be passing there be even worse than rabbi solomon told will not pain by talking of matter now have heard what have be doing have done great deed have harassed roman sorely so that must not say that held country beyond flight of arrow have taken many city where have left small garrison have cut off very many small party have captured many flock herd have carried off have lost few men while inflicting much damage moreover have gained experience confidence when time come for fighting hand to hand with roman will enter upon struggle without fear what can have induced roman to retire when almost within sight of jerusalem partly doubt because vespasian considered better to let jew go on slaying other than to waste strength in killing partly believe because of news from rome heard rumor that messenger have arrived in roman camp with news that nero be dead vespasian may well wish to keep army together to watch course of event be indeed vespasian main object in retiring for nearly two year kept army in hand waiting for opportunity while galba otho vitellius in turn gained lost imperial crown john remained at home except that went out with company in spring of when vespasian for time set troop in motion a before roman marched down into south of judea reduced country on western shore of dead sea while cerealis entered idumea completely subdued so that there now remained only town of herodium masada machaerus jerusalem still remained unconquered john troop have pursued precisely same tactic a in previous year have contented with harassing roman whenever latter entered difficult country in preventing from sending out small foraging party john must not have called men under arm a saw that real advantage be gained men be eager to go saw that there be considerable advantage in continued practice in arm in quickness with worked together in confidence have in company suffered slight loss in operation john have adventure nearly cost life vespasian with bulk of army be encamped at hebron while titus be at carmelia near dead sea john company be in hill near hebron wishing to examine roman position at carmelia road between two town started by carried a usual buckler two light javelin sword road led down series of precipitous valley john knowing that must instantly gain hill out of reach of danger did not hesitate to descend into be now nineteen strong active sinewy position in have be placed have given habit of command heavy responsibility have devolved upon have added two three year to apparent age be taller than most of countryman broad across shoulder match for single man under command a walked along heard sound of horse footstep coming up valley sprang short distance up craggy hillside then paused a single horseman came in sight a came little nearer john saw by splendor of armor that of horse be riding that be officer of rank distinction john scorned to fly before single foe stood quietly watching till came nearly abreast of horseman reined up charger without word seized javelin hurled at armed figure standing on hillside thirty foot above john sprang lightly aside missile struck rock with sharp clang close to in return threw javelin at roman struck on armor fell blunted well thrown roman said calmly hurled second javelin stroke be too swift to avoid john threw up buckler so a to receive at angle javelin glanced off flew far up hillside time john sprang down rock with activity of goat till within few foot of roman then threw javelin at horse with so true aim that struck at spot unprotected by armor animal fell with exclamation of anger roman threw off a animal sank beneath leg have already drawn sword a john approached stood at once on defensive without moment hesitation john sprang at combat commenced john trusted to activity while roman have immense advantage in heavy armor john being unprotected save by buckler roman stood calm confident while john attacked moving quickly round round springing in to deliver blow then bounding out of reach of sweep of heavy roman sword for time combat continued john have received two three severe wound while although roman be bleeding armor protected from serious hurt suddenly john sprang in at roman throwing with force against partially warded with sword blow roman struck at a came in weapon be beaten down roman blade cut through thick headdress impetus of spring be sufficient roman taken by surprise by sudden attack tottered then fell with crash john falling on top of john be almost blinded by blood streamed down forehead from blow have last received dashed aside seized long knife in moment must have slain enemy have not latter exclaimed strike jew be titus john be confused by last blow have received thousand thought whirled in brain for instant grasped knife more firmly to slay son of chief enemy of country then possibility of carrying away captive occurred to saw that be out of question then thought dashed across brain swear said in greek for be ignorant of latin by god to spare temple will kill there be moment hesitation knife be already descending when titus exclaimed in same language swear to do in power to save temple john knife fell from hand tried to rise to foot then everything seemed to swim round fell insensible titus rose to foot be shaken by fall too have lost much blood panting from exertion looked down upon prostrate foe generosity be prevailing feature of character except when excited in battle mastered by hercules exclaimed that be gallant youth though be jew have well nigh made end of will vespasian say when hears have be beaten in fair fight owe life to mercy of jew how think of temple jew why must not injure be in power to do so have not emperor sent offering there besides war not with god of people conquer ah here come plancus others will be lesson to not to trust alone among mountain again be first time have done so will be last messenger have in fact arrived at carmelia with order from vespasian for to go to hebron a have desire to speak with ordering plancus centurion to follow with troop titus have sprung on horse ridden off at once roman be soon upon spot be loud in exclamation of surprise grief at seeing commander covered with dust bleeding from several wound while horse lay dead beside to inquiry whether be seriously wounded titus replied lightly be more dirty than hurt though have not be for armor there must have be different tale to tell for jew fight like demon a see first slew horse with javelin then fought out on foot be there only one centurion asked in surprise pointing to john body only that one titus said nearly got best of fighting with jew be like fighting with wild cat so fierce be in attack so quick be movement tell that for moment life be at mercy see if be dead plancus no breathes plancus said stooping over let four of men make litter with spear titus said take down to carmelia let own leech attend must gladly save life if can began fray truly have shown so gallant young man must not that must die accordingly when john opened eye found lying in roman tent where old man be sitting by couch roman sentry pacing backwards forward before entrance of tent drink old man said placing cordial to lip need have fear be in camp of titus have ordered that attention will be paid to john be too weak from loss of blood confused from effect of blow on head even to feel sensation of wonder drank potion closed eye again went off into sleep lasted for many hour be not until next day that thoroughly awoke leech continued to attend at end of four day be able to sit up illustration titus brings josephus to see john in afternoon heard clash of arm a sentry gave military salute moment later titus entered accompanied by one whom john instantly recognized a josephus john rose to foot told be young man titus said to josephus now that can see more nearly at rate more calmly can see that be little more than lad yet a have heard say be man of valor defeated in fair fight seem to know face josephus said then addressed john in hebrew who be young man be that john whom saved in storm on sea of galilee who fought with at jotapata be possible josephus exclaimed in surprise thought that alone be saved there lay hidden with boy jonas who told of track down to water john said quietly have since then be fighting roman while while have be prisoner josephus broke in know that countryman be enraged against truly without cause josephus then translated to titus what john have told adding that young man have served with zeal devotion that have affection for then be more glad that have not lost life titus said courteously now antagonist said in greek to john must tell that bear malice though have shed blood brought somewhat of disgrace upon for truly be disgrace for roman soldier in heavy armor to be overthrown by one who carry light buckler a protection love brave man even though be foe honor who be fighting for what believe to be cause of country if let go free will promise not to bear arm again against rome must not promise titus john said quietly even be to order now to be taken out slain be first duty of jew to fight for holy city so long a live holy city be in danger so long must fight for be command of religion can not even to save life disobey will not press to do so titus said though josephus here will tell that rome be not unkind lord even to who have most withstood when be well enough to leave will go unharmed though must have seen way to desist from hostility to must have be good friend to have promoted to post of honor that in country where must not have be opposed to countryman if will not have so be free to go remember at time have friend in titus when war be over peace restored if come to will repeat offer have now made moreover may rely upon that in last extremity will do in power to save temple indeed in case must have injured building so venerable holy titus then left tent josephus remained for time talking with john suppose like others have looked upon a traitor john began not so john replied knew that fought bravely at jotapata risked life many time in defense knew too that from first opposed revolt against roman be not for to judge a to position among be prisoner josephus said be kindly treated indeed vespasian frequently asks opinion of matter connected with country surely be doing more good to countryman by softening heart towards than if have died at jotapata still more if have be like john of gischala scourge to trust even yet that through influence jerusalem may be saved when time come vespasian will hope grant term only fear be that madness of people will lead to refuse accommodation so force into taking city by storm in case can not be terrible misery will fall upon that vast number will lose life now tell how be at home what have be doing since last saw john thought a well not to mention to josephus prominent part have taken among who have so harassed roman said that have joined band raised in galilee have be among who have hung upon roman flank rear wherever marched jew have behaved with prudence valor josephus said now see that must have be far better have trusted more in mountain warfare than in fenced city must have be same in end know jew must have fought bravely for time thought of must have turned to farm vineyard must never have kept field for length of time roman therefore must in end have tired out perhaps fate have befallen city resisted must have fallen upon land now remember that although prisoner have much influence with vespasian at time must fall into hand again will exert influence in favor john remained about ten day at carmelia titus have several interview with at last of said have conceived strong friendship for young man must willingly do service take signet ring at time in place will pas to presence if roman sword be raised to strike show ring will be lowered that must fight against to last be a believe duty a must so fight for rome seek not further to dissuade when resistance be at end be useless longer to hold sword death can not benefit country therefore when time come if not before use ring come to will grant not only own life that of such friend a may wish to save forget that have life in hand that spared be life may yet be valuable to rome though even now when speak of cheek flush with humiliation be none le grateful plea to see that in conversation have have with officer have borne so modestly have made mention of for although hesitate to speak of mishap befell be pleasant for that be not spoken of by others believe then at time will find sincere friend in titus john replied in suitable term thanking titus for promise have made disclaiming merit in success be last effort of beaten man be result of sudden surprise not of skill bravery upon following morning titus furnished with escort far beyond confines of camp then taking to hill john rejoined companion who have long since given up a dead must scarce credit when told that have be lying wounded in hand of roman be still more surprised at hearing that have be engaged in personal encounter with titus of john gave detail beyond fact that after throwing javelin horse of titus have fallen have fought hand to hand until at last have fallen bleeding from severe wound that titus have be wounded how be did not slay be question seems almost miracle especially after wounding titus doubtless lord put into heart to spare john said titus only said that preserved life a of brave foe roman esteem bravery a have withstood titus for time be pleased to think have done well ah if have killed what rejoicing there must have be in land john said earnestly there must have be mourning may be sure that vespasian must have avenged blood upon people must have be misfortune indeed have titus fallen be well that ended a did john be however far too weak to be able to accompany band upon rapid march therefore for time resigned command to one of captain determined to go until strength returned to to small community of have heard a dwelling in almost inaccessible valley on shore of dead sea be told that took part in commotion of time that lived in such poverty even robber of simon have not cared to interfere with practiced hospitality to stranger spent life in religious observance a john have often heard from father of sect be at one time numerous in land have be sorely persecuted by priest pharisee determined to stop for time among learn somewhat of doctrine accompanied by jonas made way across mountain to valley where dwelt a wounded stranger be received without question among little hut similar to in lived be placed at disposal hut be ranged in square in center of stood larger building used a synagogue here john remained nearly month be greatly struck by religious fervor simplicity austerity of life doctrine held learned that more rigorous of sect abstained altogether from use of meat wine that celibacy be strictly enjoined who married did not separate from sect be considered a occupying inferior position in food be of simplest kind only sufficient to sustain life community raised grain vegetable necessary for use be religious doctrine held most greatly surprised john attached importance to ceremonial law of jewish scripture maintaining in first place that scripture have spiritual signification wholly apart from literal meaning alone understood by world that spiritual meaning must only be attained by who after long probation be initiated into inner mystery of sect in second place held that written law have be altogether superseded by coming of great prophet christ who have be put to death by jewish priest john learned that there be already large number of jew who have accepted doctrine taught by christ although did not embrace strict rule mode of life of ascetic john be greatly struck with doctrine although did not hear enough to do more than to dimly understand meaning determined however that if went safely through war must inquire further into mystery at end of four week strength being comparatively restored took leave of community rejoined band chapter test of devotion although john be able to join companion be still far from strong be glad to have valid excuse for handing over command to lieutenant returning home campaign be nearly over must not have followed rapid march through hill enabled band to appear now on one side now on other of roman to keep in constant state of watchfulness at same time be glad of excuse to leave for although have declared to titus that must fight again in defense of jerusalem felt that after kind treatment have met with must not take part in daily skirmish with roman mounting donkey be among many animal captured in attack upon roman baggage train john bade adieu to comrade with jonas now grown into sturdy young fellow started for home journeyed by road to west of jerusalem in order to avoid bandit of simon son of gioras who still scourged neighborhood of masada herodium lying between jerusalem dead sea avoided town in there be roman garrison for bandage on head must have shown at once that have be engaged in fighting traveled slowly be six day before arrived home time son have not come home unharmed simon said truly be shadow of former self will soon be strong again father be honorable scar for have in single combat with titus in valley between hebron carmelia then how be that live to tell tale son simon asked while exclamation of wonder broke from mary martha surely god did not deliver into hand wish not to boast father have told true story to none truly god did deliver into hand be dead simon exclaimed father life for spared spared simon exclaimed what did not avenge misery of people upon son of oppressor father rejoice did not for have done so surely roman must have avenged death upon land thought not of at time be sore wounded bleeding sense be well nigh gone a knelt upon lifted hand to slay thought surely sent by god came into mind said bewear by god that will spare temple slay swore that so far a lay in power must spare temple exclamation of joy burst from hearer simon said verily son god have raised up a deliverer of temple not a hoped by defeating oppressor by binding one of mightiest one to do harm pray father say naught of to anyone be between ourselves titus lord must not that man must know of titus behaved with greatest generosity to victory over be surprise be sorely wounded while be almost unharmed when sprang upon by sudden impulse threw to ground being burdened with heavy armor have strength to hear swear then fell a one dead titus might have slain a lay not only did harm when soldier came up gave into care directed to be carried down to camp placed in tent tended by own leech when recovered let go free truly be marvelous tale john that must have fallen into hand of roman come forth unharmed after discomfiting leader be a marvelous to a daniel coming unharmed from lion den will say naught of story son tell only what told own companion so that may know what to say when be questioned told truth father although not truth said that met titus fought with wounded somewhat that by virtue of armor did great harm while wounded so seriously that fell down a one dead that feeling that have fought like brave foeman have carried to tent tended cared for until be able to go forth when sent away free unharmed truly men say of titus that be clement merciful therein differs much from vespasian father clemency showed to people of gischala other place have taken prof be so deed of to show that must have great heart for few men of rank warlike fame who have be discomfited by one yet scarce man must have left by road to die so that none might know what have happened titus made secret of father john said told josephus in hearing have spared life said naught of oath have taken know that will keep a far a said lie in power what be like mary asked be not of very tall stature stoutly built strong face clean shaved a be custom have pleasant kindly expression that tally with disposition for be greatly beloved by soldier in action say be brave to rashness quick to anger a quickly appeased have be in command of roman legion must have be not le formidable in fight perhaps when passion of titus be roused not le savage must not have wrought such wholesale cruelty destruction a have done be rarely that pity enters into heart of roman simon said yet be hardly for to complain for when crossed over jordan conquered canaan put to sword spared none may be that in future time if war altogether cease in world will be waged in spirit so far from commencement of world until now have ever be same war have brought desolation destruction upon vanquished next morning john went early into garden not that be strong enough for heavy work in order that mary might a usual join there do know john said after first greeting have made happier than have be for time how be that mary seemed to john that be getting away from getting away mary repeated how do mean be becoming great leader john be proud that must be so proud to think that might become deliverer of nation then must have be meet right that must take to a wife daughter of one of great one of land mary john exclaimed indignantly might have be necessary john tiller of soil can marry where please who have power must wed for other reason than of love must make alliance will strengthen position must have be duty to have sacrificed love for sake of country must have be first to bid do so must have be content to make sacrifice too on altar of country content with knowing that deliverer of israel must have chosen from among other woman have only have own pleasure happiness to consult after what told yesterday think perhaps that need not be so that way in be to save temple be not way thought mission have be fulfilled not by great victory must have made hero of israel in contest in valley where eye of god beheld must temple be saved one will know that be savior save who love therefore john once again can look forward to time when can dwell together in house of father mary be so earnest that john did not attempt to laugh out of fancy a be usual way only said quietly perhaps be right mary a to mission think dear that even have be made ruler of israel must have gone elsewhere for wife a say circumstance might have be too strong for at rate be well pleased that there be chance of happiness being set in one scale good of country in now john believe that will come back to even if jerusalem fall be third time life have be spared if count day when be so nearly drowned together on lake may say that four time life have be saved when seemed lost believe now that will be saved to end hope for sake mary for father mother that may be so have so much to make life happy will assuredly do in power to save a know have never held with who must destroy when seemed lost idea be man must fight until last must if possible provide way of escape when fighting be longer of avail fortunately if fall in battle have talisman will bring safe to titus have given signet ring will at time procure access to have promised that at time will be friend must fall into hand of soldier again will let go free will give life of who may be dear to titus must be noble enemy mary said with tear in eye be strong kind generous have such man be raised up a leader of people instead of leader of foe how different might have be yes indeed john agreed truly be sheep without shepherd nay be sheep whose leader be ravening wolf who devour own flock time passed quietly happily save for grief tidings of terrible doings in jerusalem caused two year respite city have obtained when vespasian marched away from jericho instead of being turned to good account have brought even greater evil than before simon son of gioras having wasted country towards idumea began to threaten zealot marched out against be driven back to city simon thinking that idumeans believing to be occupied with jerusalem must have grown careless suddenly entered country at head of twenty thousand men idumeans flew to arm met with twenty five thousand men furious battle ensued in party gained advantage simon retreated idumeans dispersed simon raised even larger force than before advanced with forty thousand irregular troop besides heavy armed soldier took hebron wasted idumea with fire sword zealot in simon absence succeeded in capturing wife carried off to jerusalem hoping by mean to force to come to term on receiving news hurried back with force surrounded jerusalem slew everyone who ventured to leave city except whom sent back having cut off hand to tell within unless wife be returned must storm city slay man within even zealot be alarmed at threat fury restored wife whereupon withdrew have happened in previous year before cerealis vespasian have entered idumea a soon a roman have retired simon again sallied forth from masada collected great number of idumeans drove before into jerusalem then encamped before city slew who quitted protection of wall thus within john of gischala follower tyrannized over people murdering plundering till be sated with blood knew not what to do with booty while simon cut off flight beyond wall at length party of john became divided idumeans who be in considerable number in city rose drove john zealot into palace built by grapte have served a headquarters storehouse where piled up treasure have amassed by plunder of people idumeans attacked here drove into temple adjoined palace took possession of plunder that have amassed zealot however be in great force in temple threatened to pour out destroy whole city by fire idumeans called assembly of chief priest decided to admit simon within gate high priest matthias went out in person to invite to enter amidst joyful greeting of population simon marched through gate with follower took possession of upper city be last most fatal mistake of people of jerusalem sheep have invited tiger to save from wolf now two tyrant instead of one lorded over city a soon a simon entered proceeded to attack zealot in temple commanding position of building enabled to defend with success to obtain still further advantage reared four strong tower on placed military engine bowman so swept approach to temple that simon be forced to desist from attack through winter fighting went on without intermission street of jerusalem ran with blood further division took place among zealot eleazar who have be head before arrival of john of gischala jealous of supremacy of leader got together party suddenly seceded from main band seized inner court of temple now fighting went on within a well a without holy building party of eleazar be well supplied with provision for store in temple be of immense extent be too few in number to sally out to attack party of john be strong enough to defend wall of inner court looked down upon rest of temple enabled to command position of john troop day night struggle went on inner court of temple be desecrated by blood dying men lay on step of altar shout song of savage soldiery rose where hymn of praise of levite have be wont to ascend john troop continued attack upon inner court while successfully resisted assault of simon who tried to take advantage of internecine strife raging between two party of zealot superior height of position held by john men enabled to defend a successfully a did of eleazar against attack yet during terrible strife service of temple be continued in midst of blood carnage free ingres egress be a at time permitted to pious who made way unharmed through fierce combatant passed over pavement slippery with blood laid offering on altar often paying with life for pious service being smitten down even a prayed at altar by missile follower of john poured incessantly into inner court sometimes drunk with wine obtained from abundant store of temple follower of eleazar must sally out against john sometimes john must pour out against simon wasting destroying city a far a troop must penetrate thus temple became surrounded by waste of ruin held in turn by one other of faction even rite of burial so dear to jew be neglected body of slain lay unburied where fell yet force of three faction thus desolated city be comparatively small have wretched population who be tyrannized over by possessed unanimity be led by man of courage must easily have overthrown for simon force amounted to about fifteen thousand that of john to six thousand while eleazar must count two thousand four hundred men yet in jerusalem be gathered population amounting with original inhabitant fugitive from country around to over million people at long interval of suspense be drawing to end at death of vitellius vespasian have be called upon by general voice of people to ascend throne have time before left for rome to assume imperial purple be joyfully acknowledged by whole roman empire who have groaned under succession of brutal tyrant now hailed accession of one who be at once great general upright able man who must rule empire with firm just moderate hand when winter be over vespasian sent titus who have in meantime gone to egypt back to palestine ordered to complete conquest of judea twelfth legion that have be defeated when under command of cestius be ordered to reinforce three already in judea gap made in rank during war by withdrawal of men who have accompanied vespasian to rome be filled by addition of two thousand picked troop from alexandria three thousand from legion stationed on euphrates syrian king sent large contingent tiberius alexander intimate friend of titus man of wisdom integrity be appointed to high command knowledge of country have once governed added to value in roman council a soon a news spread that roman army be collecting for march against jerusalem signal fire be kindled on hill above gamala john after tender farewell to parent mary set out with jonas in twenty four hour band have again assembled when be gathered john addressed pointed out to that campaign that be now about to undertake differed widely from have preceded hitherto said have skirmished around roman have run comparatively little danger now who go with must make up mind that be going to jerusalem to die may be that lord will yet deliver holy city from enemy a delivered in day of old know have be doing in jerusalem for last four year that not only street altar have be flooded with blood of people how jew have desecrated temple how wickedness of kind have prevailed in city thus can judge for yourselves what chance there be that god will interfere on behalf of people who have forsaken insulted if doe not interfere in opinion fate of city be sealed have seen roman at work at jotapata gamala know how strongest wall go down before engine battering ram moreover hear that in war have be raging within gate magazine contain sufficient food to last even great population for year have be entirely destroyed thus who go to defend have to face not roman sword only famine therefore say that who go up to defend temple must make up mind that go to die for temple be for of to ask whether be ready to do ask one to go with let before be too late ask whether be ready to do thing blame none who find sacrifice too great be between conscience therefore pray let tonight disperse among hill by so that may think over what have said let who may come to conclusion that be not called upon to go to certain death in defense of temple depart to home without reproach from comrade man here have done duty so long a hope remained now be for to decide for whether feel called upon to give life for temple silently crowd dispersed john joined captain passed night with fear will have small gathering in morning one of said a sat down by fire many will fight a long a there be hope few will go down to certain death be better so john said misery ruin have fallen upon country a saw for yourselves judea idumea be desert more have fallen by famine misery than by sword must not have nation blotted out a in day after captivity in babylon god again collected people restored land to so may be intention to do now when have paid full penalty of disobedience wickedness therefore must not that must go down to die save who feel that god have called to do so already victim who have fallen in four year be well nigh countless in jerusalem there be million people sufficient if have spirit strength lord be with to defend wall thus then however small number of who may gather tomorrow will be content have roman advanced against jerusalem at commencement of war there be not jew capable of bearing arm must have gone up to defense of holy city now spirit be broken by woe have come upon still more by civil war in jerusalem spirit of hopelessness despair have come upon be not that men fear to die that care to live be that say 'what matter whether live die be lost why must trouble a to what may come upon ' then no longer believe in mission john one of party said gloomily have never proclaimed mission john said others have proclaimed for simply invited score of men to follow to do what must to hinder roman because god gave success others believed be sent a deliverer yet believe that have mission mission have be fulfilled told not before tell now for comfort what happened between titus wish not that must be told to others told that fought with that being wounded insensible be carried into tent be not all when fought although sorely wounded sprang upon fell to ground uppermost drew knife must have slain when lord put thought into mind called upon to swear that must spare temple swore that if lay in power must do so then be in inferior command now be general of army must be able to keep oath thus if have mission to save temple trust have fulfilled that fate may fall upon city temple will yet remain erect unharmed john word gave new life energy to before dispirited men gathered round seemed to not only that temple must be saved that belief in leader mission a deliverer be fully justified feeling of enthusiasm succeeded that of depression why did not tell before why did not let follower know what great thing have done john one of asked presently for two reason john replied did not wish to seem to exalt to boast of success god have given over roman for be assuredly strength not mine for must do naught against strength skill of titus a told be wounded nigh to death while received small hurt in next place thought that if made public must be noised abroad through land that titus when heard that men knew that have be worsted in fight with jew might repent of oath might even ask to be sent to other command so that might not be called upon to keep be companion agreed that second reason be valid one though did not agree that first must have weighed with be not by hiding light under bushel one of said that men gain confidence of follower more men believe in leader more blindly will follow greater effort will make for be belief in mission gathered eight thousand men on mountain to follow proof that have given that belief be well founded that have mission to save temple knowledge that have single handed forced roman general to swear oath to save temple must have so heightened that enthusiasm that must have followed have bidden attack whole roman army agree that for second reason be wise to say nothing of what took place first be think mistaken one at rate said hand of god be plainly marked in matter for have placed titus in full command have thus given power of carrying out oath swore now friend can go up with light heart with john to jerusalem for though may die yet do feel assured that lord purpose to save temple that one day will restore glory of judah in morning a john have expected number of who gathered at sound of trumpet be comparatively small night reflection feeling that sacrifice of life must be of avail dull despair have seized whole nation have have effect of eight thousand men who have gathered there night before six hundred now obeyed summons gathered stern silent with expression of desperate resolution on face at earnest request of captain john allowed to go among men to tell although manner in be done be secret john have given to undoubted proof that have mission from god that believed might happen to jerusalem be lord will that temple must be saved joyous expression of leader face even more than word assured follower of sincerity spirit rose renewed feeling of enthusiasm seized when hour later john took place on rock to address shout of greeting broke forth showed how great be change in spirit friend said greet who have decided to die with if need be in defense of jerusalem blame not who have gone must not have gone have lord required to stay to have spoken have told that have need of service henceforward will act a one band band of men inspired with one thought one aim now though number may not be great yet force so composed of men who hold life a naught may do wonder remember how gideon sent greater part of army away with mere handful defeated host of enemy look not for victory will show roman what men can do to avenge bleeding country what deed jew can perform when fighting for temple will go into jerusalem there will hold aloof from party if be attacked will defend ourselves aim will be to act a body apart from others ready to undertake most desperate service to set example of courage devotion now let count number arrange anew into company be found that band composed of men from tiberias other city of lake have entirely disappeared that who have stayed be principally hardy dweller among hill be again divided into twenty company of thirty men after examining arm seeing that be well provided john gave order band set off keeping on eastern side of jordan stopped at large village near ford opposite jericho here quantity of grain be purchased be made up into sack weighing fifty pound granary remain will be principally in hand of troop of john simon john said be a well that must have own store to depend upon so long a can buy food will do so can fall back upon own magazine if necessary will be best for two three of to go into city first find quarter where can lodge close together a far removed a possible from faction simon hold upper town john temple therefore will establish in lower town will not go in in body for might refuse admittance a roman approach there will be stream of fugitive entering city will mingle with pas in unobserved many of fugitive will be carrying good most value many doubtless will take in provision with therefore sack of grain will not excite attention be five year since john have journeyed up with parent to jerusalem therefore knew little of city of follower however have be there more recently picked out four of one of whom be captain of company to enter city find suitable post for whole band crossed jordan together made detour to avoid jericho where tenth legion have be quartered during winter then took way up steep road through hill until passing through bethany came out on crest of hill looking down upon valley of jehoshaphat with temple rising immediately opposite to palace of agrippa crowded house of city in background illustration john band in sight of jerusalem men laid down sack stood for long time looking at jerusalem many be moved to tear a looked on stately beauty of holy city thought how low have fallen with civil tumult within terrible enemy approaching from without even now there be fairer scene in world than view of jerusalem from spot where be standing called then a now mount of olive must have be superb indeed in day when temple stood intact palace of agrippa herod rose on brow of mount zion after long pause resumed way crossed upper end of valley of jehoshaphat established for night in grove of tree near grotto of jeremiah four chosen men at once entering city by old gate on north side of city country here indeed hill around jerusalem be covered with house of wealthy surrounded by garden orchard belonged not only to jew of city to who dwelt in foreign country who be accustomed year to come to jerusalem for passover to spend time there before returned to distant home even now undismayed by danger of time knowledge that roman must shortly besiege city pilgrim be arriving from city of asia minor greece egypt for time of passover be close at hand at foot of wall on slope around large number of pilgrim be encamped rich in gorgeous tent poor in shelter constructed of bough carpet overflow of people be occurrence be witnessed year on same occasion proportion be time of greater magnitude than usual partly owing to difficulty of procuring lodging in town owing to crowd of fugitive there partly because many thought safer to camp outside to enter city only to pay devotion take part in ceremonial than to put wholly into power of ruffian of simon john in following morning men returned reported that have found spot in inner lower town between corner gate gate of ephraim in second wall where be large house inhabited now by two three person here great number of must take up quarter while others must find lodging near reason why so many house be empty there be that be somewhat exposed to irruption of simon men from upper town a frequently came down robbed who entered city at damascus gate from led great north road crowd of fugitive be making way by road to city flying before advance of roman who be said few hour march in rear many be men coming to take part in defense of city great proportion be old men woman child flying for refuge john shook head a watched stream of fugitive for well knew horror must befall besieged town better thousand time said to jonas that poor people must have remained in village have nothing must tempt cupidity of roman soldier evil might have befallen whereas now will perish by famine disease be slain by roman besides consuming food must have sustained fighting men be master of jerusalem must when heard roman be approaching have cleared out from city who must not aid in defense must have seemed harsh action must have be merciful one must greatly strengthen power of resistance chapter jerusalem mingling with crowd john follower made way through damascus gate into jerusalem followed damascus street to gate of ephraim air of sombre misery pervaded whole population in heart greater portion of population have for many month be longing for approach of roman even death must be preferable to misery suffered there be few people in street for remained in house with closed door save when necessity drove out to make purchase turning sharp round by wall member of band made way along by until be met by one other of who have gone on in advance be conducted to house have be hired for inhabitant of house near looked out of window in alarm when saw so many armed men arriving gained courage on observing quiet orderly demeanor door be presently unbolted men came out to inquire who be newcomer when be told that be from galilee peraea have come down only to fight for holy city that must harm one have nothing in common with of faction confidence be restored offer be at once made to take in ten fifteen twenty men according to size of house for people soon saw that new arrival must prove protection from attack insult of small number of simon men who have hitherto pervaded lower town breaking into house robbing murdering wheresoever chose grain be stored in house have be hired here john took up quarter with men of own company of asher one of bravest most determined captain rest be accommodated in house in same street a like most of street of jerusalem be very narrow john felt that must be defended against attack by greatly superior force be hour after band have be settled in quarter that shriek be heard at end of street john ran out in time to see woman struck down while body of twenty half drunken soldier with drawn sword be trying to force in door of house john sounded bugle there be rush of armed men into street john put at head of two company with advanced against soldier sternly ordered to desist soldier astonished by sudden appearance of so large body of armed men drew back in astonishment who be one who seemed to be leader asked matter not who be john said quietly be enough a see have force here sufficiently strong to make obeyed street henceforth be mine beware of attempting plunder violence here for whoever doe so surely dy muttering threat below breath soldier sullenly withdrew hour later one of inhabitant ran in to inform john that large body of men be coming down from upper city john immediately called men to arm at head took up position at end of street ere long crowd of soldier be seen approaching at head strode one whom john at once guessed to be simon when arrived within ten pace simon stopped surprised at compact order resolute appearance of band filled street who be asked john imperiously name be john be generally called john of gamala although be not birthplace simon uttered exclamation of astonishment for tale of john attack upon roman camp at gamala of subsequent action against roman be well known in jerusalem be lad simon said contemptuously john of gamala must be warrior be john of gamala john repeated quietly men be part of band have come down to defend jerusalem since there be more to be done in open country wish to interfere with none to take part with faction simply to defend city war with roman not with jew assault one woe be to who assault here be six hundred of man ready to die though have twenty men to one yet will withstand if meddle with by tonight roman will be outside wall be time jew must fall upon other like wild beast simon hesitated idea of opposition excited a usual to fury upon other hand saw that determined body be not to be overcome save with great loss wanted men for struggle with zealot be not in correspondence with john of gischala asked doubtfully be in correspondence with none john said a have told come only to fight for jerusalem will take part on one side other in dissension have taken up street between gate corner gate street will hold simon still hesitated saw that round nucleus of determined men whole of citizen of lower town might gather that might be forced to confine to upper town however must be of great importance now inner lower town be poor quarter of jerusalem here dwelt artisan mechanic in narrow tortuous lane while wealthier class resided either in upper town where stood palace of great in new town between second third wall new town have indeed until lately be suburb outside wall agrippa have begun third wall be to inclose have be allowed to build according to design must have made jerusalem absolutely impregnable save by famine authority at rome knowing how turbulent be population of jerusalem foreseeing at time might have to lay siege to city have forbidden construction new wall have be hastily erected by jew after have risen defeated cestius four year before wall inclosed vast number of villa with garden open space now thickly tenanted by temporary habitation of fugitive pilgrim lower town then contained little to tempt cupidity of simon house have indeed be ransacked over over again simon reflected that even must men be prevented from descending into must matter little while a be separated from upper town by tyropoeon valley first wall rising there must be formidable danger to still galled to be resisted have not be that roman be close at hand must at once have given men order to attack stranger stood for minute stroking beard then said will give answer now will think over what say till tomorrow then will talk again doubt not what decision will be john said be brave man simon although have done much harm to jew yet know that will defend jerusalem to end against roman need feel jealousy of aspire to leadership power be here only to fight six hundred such men a mine be not to be despised in day of trial must roman march away baffled before wall too will leave who remain can resume mad struggle if will think that in presence of enemy strife within city must cease that must be a one man in face of roman simon looked with surprise admiration at young man who so boldly addressed savage cruel a be simon be man of greatest bravery have none of duplicity treachery characterized john of gischala be straightforward in way honest a only picture have come down to a described by pen of josephus who at time of writing history have become thoroughly roman who elevated titus troop at expense of own countryman great allowance must be made for dark color in be painted fact that be regarded with affection devotion by troop who be willing to go to certain death at order show that at least there must have be many good quality in history record instance of more desperate sustained bravery than exhibited in defense of jerusalem frankness of john speech instead of angering pleased much enough said need further time to reflect man who have thought of treachery must not speak so boldly fearlessly a do let be friend have often wondered what sort of man be john of gamala of whom have heard so much who have so long kept field against roman although wonder greatly at seeing so young man yet rejoice that so valiant fighter must be here to aid in struggle here be hand in token of amity john took hand held out to shout of satisfaction rose from armed men on side follower of john being rejoiced that must not be called upon to engage in civil strife of simon well satisfied that be not to be called upon to attack body of men who looked such formidable antagonist just at moment man rode in at gate saying that roman be two mile distant must speedily make appearance over hill of scopus simon ordered party of men to proceed at once to damascus gate to close a soon a roman be visible then turned again to john come up with said to palace of herod from summit can see enemy approaching giving order to men to lay aside arm calling jonas to accompany john without hesitation turned to accompany simon latter have hardly expected to accept invitation readiness with did so at once pleased gratified be proof of fearlessness testimony to john belief in faith honor john of gischala treacherous must not have placed in power whatever guarantee gave for safety while must not have confided to john of gischala though latter have sworn to safety with hand on altar john be struck with rugged grandeur of simon appearance be far above stature of ordinary men of immense strength there be nevertheless ease lightness in carriage showed that be le active than strong face be leonine in expression long hair fell back from forehead eyebrow be heavy eye be gray clear with fierce savage expression when brow met in frown lip be firmly set at other time frank open straightforward in look mouth be set determined without being hard pleasant smile at time lit up feature be man capable of strong affection generous impulse be cruel at time be age of cruelty titus who be held up a magnanimous general be guilty of far more hideous cruelty than committed by simon have latter be master of jerusalem from first have not granary be destroyed in civil war legion of titus must never have achieved conquest of city ascending steep slope of valley passed through gate in first wall turning to right entered palace of herod be at once royal dwelling fortress of tremendous strength much a john thought be otherwise occupied must not help being struck by magnificence splendor of noble building said nothing a simon strode along through forum passed out beyond palace entered strong lofty tower of phasaelus ascended to summit involuntary exclamation burst from john a gained platform from point on stood commanded view of whole city of country round far below at foot lay crowded street of inner town between outer wall ground be thickly occupied by house of better class standing half embowered in tree close beside rose stately tower of hippicus mariamne behind be palace of herod standing on ground once occupied by castle of david on east palace of agrippa partly obscured view of temple portion of building must be seen standing on platform on summit of mount moriah to left connected with by two line of cloister be castle of antonia while still further along be fort known a acra behind palace of herod superb garden be scattered palace mansion of wealthy jew stranger with garden occupied whole of upper part of mount zion on lower slope of mount moriah lying between valley of jehoshaphat that of tyropoeon be densely populated suburb known a new town westward beyond tower of hippicus lay valley of hinnom with dragon pool glistening in sun while at distance of four five mile to southward must be seen village of bethlehem whole country outside wall be garden with countless villa mansion grove of tree for minute john looked round in admiration of scene while simon stood with eye fixed upon road crossing mount scopus suddenly uttered exclamation john joined looked in direction in be gazing white line of road be darkened by moving mass sparkling a sun shone on arm armor come at last simon said a spoke cry of wailing lamentation be heard from wall far below four year have elapsed since danger first threatened jerusalem have deepened impression in mind of jew that enemy must not be permitted to approach holy city be true that faith have be sorely shaken by many strange prodigy strange light have shone about altar temple be said that voice have be heard from holy of holy saying let depart hence beautiful gate of temple required strength of twenty men to close have opened of own accord war chariot army have be seen contending in cloud for month great comet in shape like flaming sword have hung over city still men have hoped cry from watcher that roman army be in sight struck dismay among inhabitant there be still many without wall of rushed wildly into gate entered city while wiser fled away to hill made way to home titus a reached brow of mount scopus reined in horse looked for time in silence at great magnificent city extended before there can be little doubt that must fain have spared have be possible even roman must not gaze on massive beauty of temple unmoved be most famous religious edifice in world from part pilgrim flocked to king made offering to be believed by jew to be special seat of deity roman partly from policy partly from superstition paid respect reverence to god of nation subdued annual offering have be sent by rome to temple titus may well have wished to spare city ruin misery of siege to preserve temple intact to hand over to king agrippa uninjured palace capital in wide dominion of rome there be not city approached jerusalem in beauty grandeur titus must have felt that honor must accrue to from conquest must be dearly purchased by linking of name to time a destroyer of so magnificent city similar emotion be felt by group of officer who rode with titus who reined up horse a did so with military point of view be doubtless most prominent a saw from lofty vantage ground how deep valley of hinnom girt city in on side how stately strong be wall tower may well have felt how mighty be task have before scene be calm peaceful sound of warlike trumpet came from wall sign of enemy appeared without titus rode on past deserted villa beautiful ground bordered road until neared damascus gate be accompanied by six hundred horse for legion have encamped in valley of thorn near village of gaboth saul four mile from jerusalem wall appeared deserted titus having experience of desperate courage of jew paused at little distance from gate turning to right entered lane ran parallel to wall made way towards tower of psephinus rubble tower at north eastern angle of outer wall suddenly gate near tower of woman be thrown open crowd of armed men dashed out rushing forward at top of speed threw across road titus be following most of rushed in behind cutting off from main body of cavalry leaving isolated with few follower main body of roman cavalry furiously assailed ignorant that titus be cut off from turned fled titus hesitated moment in front of be unknown country knew not lane be following led hedge rose on side even did burst through crowd in front of might be overwhelmed by missile a rode on therefore calling upon men to follow turned round dashed into crowd barred retreat wore helmet breastplate for a have only advanced to reconnoiter with thought of fighting have be left behind though javelin flew around in shower arrow whizzed close to not one touched a struck right left among who barred passage while warhorse excited by shout tumult trampled under foot in vain jew astonished at bravery still more so at immunity from harm amid shower of missile strove to seize little band cut way onward in front drawing back with almost superstitious fear from attack two only of follower be slain one fell pierced with numerous javelin be pulled from horse killed with rest emerged unharmed from among assailant reached camp in safety soldier of simon for be men who guarded part of wall returned with mingled feeling be triumphant that have caused son of caesar to fly before be humiliated that so great prize must have escaped when seemed in hand have superstitious feeling that have be divinely protected from assault from lookout simon john have seen roman cavalry turn off from damascus road into lane have then lost sight of then heard sudden din of battle shout of combatant saw roman cavalry riding off in full speed clamor have continued in short time little party of horseman be seen to issue from lane follow companion simon laughed grimly have taught roman early that wasp have sting that if think be going to take nest without trouble will be mistaken now john what do advise be say at jotapata gamala have since shown how well understand roman tactic be soldier with arm to strike so far have not have experience in roman tactic at siege tell what must do first be commander of city there be doubt what be first thing to be done john said be duty of within city to lay aside feud unite in defense be for a strongest to make first advance to send at once to john eleazar to propose so long a roman be before city there will be truce between to arrange part of wall will be held by soldier of must also arrange to unite for common action in defense in attacking without wall for be only by disturbing at work by hindering a bring forward engine of war that can hope to hold city strong a wall may be will crumble to ruin when battering ram once begin work against simon be silent for minute then said advice be good will send at once to john eleazar ask to meet on bridge across tyropoeon separate force sun be already setting distance be short simon advanced to bridge hailing zealot on other side said that desired interview with john in reference to defense of city that pledged solemn oath that harm must come to sent similar message to eleazar john shortly appeared for from summit of antonia too have watched advancing roman felt necessity for common action for defense of town eleazar refused to come must have trusted simon to reach meeting place must have have to pas through outer court of temple held by john knew that confidence must be reposed in oath that latter might take sent word however that be willing to abstain from hostility to make common cause with others for defense of city john of gischala advanced alone on to bridge wide stately edifice carried on lofty arch across tyropoeon valley from point near palace of agrippa to platform of temple come with simon said to companion john of gischala paused in advance a saw that simon be not alone let one of men come with if like simon said with grim laugh at hesitation two six if like john of gischala knew that eye of soldier on side of bridge be upon having faith in oath of simon again advanced john looked with curiosity at man of whom have heard so much who having be scourge to upper galilee with horde of robber have now brought such misery upon jerusalem without approaching rival in size strength john of gischala be powerfully built man did not shrink from danger have upon occasion shown great bravery relied upon craft more than force to gain end possessed great power of oratory must rouse men passion calm at will must cajole threaten persuade deceive with equal facility be always ready to break oath if be inconvenient to keep although fond of power be still more greedy of gain in one respect simon agreed hated roman with intense bitter hatred be ready to die in defense of jerusalem think be time john simon said to cease from strife for present to make common cause against enemy if continue dissension roman in consequence take city name will be accursed in generation a men who gave jerusalem into hand of roman be ready to agree to truce john of gischala said be who have be attacking not who have be attacking need not talk of now be to be understood thing that if roman retire will occupy position hold now change may have taken place can then come to understanding fight matter out yes be what must propose simon replied change may take place when roman retire occupy exactly position hold now will swear to by temple will john said two men took solemn oath to carry out term agreed upon throughout siege to put aside enmity towards other to act together in thing for defense of city then arranged a to portion of wall must occupy corresponding very nearly to line at present held simon held whole of third wall commencing from tower at north corner of high town ran northward to psephinus rubble tower then eastward to valley of jehoshaphat again south to temple platform second wall inclosing inner low town inner acra a be sometimes called be divided between two simon also held first wall from hippicus right round at foot of zion across lower end of tyropoeon valley round outer low town a far a platform of temple john held temple platform middle low town part of city immediately adjacent on south slope of mount moriah ophel a portion of hill be called part of inner low town line therefore simon have to defend be vastly greater than held by john troop in fact whole line bordering valley of hinnom jehoshaphat be practically unassailable wall being built along edge of precipice where must not be attacked with battering ram by escalade be really north face of city only be exposed to serious assault outer wall on side against assault must first be made be entirely occupied by simon troop be not anticipated that successful resistance must be made here for wall hastily raised by jew after turning out roman be incapable of offering long resistance to force a be now to assail be then at second wall that first great stand must be made john simon troop divided between so that division be fair enough when be considered that simon force be more than double that of john when matter have be arranged john of gischala said to simon who be young man who accompanies be one who have done much more for cause than john of gischala indeed hitherto may be doubted whether have not be two worst enemy of jerusalem be john of gamala of whom have heard so often during last three year john of gamala john repeated in tone of incredulity be mocking simon mock one simon said sternly tell be john of gamala when think that men of war have a yet struck single blow against roman since aided in defeat of legion of cestius for fled from gischala like coward at night while have be fighting for own land down here may well feel ashamed of in presence of youth who have for three year harassed roman burning camp driving out small garrison hindering pillager from straying over country cutting off convoy forcing to keep ever on watch tell john feel ashamed beside have brought here six hundred men of band picked determined fellow for defense of city tell will be mean assistance must say so also have seen how drew up today in solid order ready to withstand whole of force be not of party of yours come simply to fight against roman a understand when roman retire will leave also be certainly intention john said quietly before go hope that will be able to act a mediator between to persuade to come to arrangement may free jerusalem from renewal of evil between have inflicted upon if beat back roman will have gained honor that men must desire name will go down to posterity a savior of jerusalem temple if desire treasure there be not jew will be ready to contribute to utmost of power if desire power palestine be wide enough for to divide between only beware lest by striving longer against other name go down a who have be tyrant of land name to be accursed a long a hebrew tongue remains two men be silent bold a be felt abashed before outspoken rebuke of stripling have heard spoken of a one under special protection of jehovah knew that have have marvelous escape that have fought single handed with titus air of authority with spoke entire disregard of power fearlessness in presence of men before whom jerusalem trembled confirmed story have heard created impression almost to awe if three be alive when roman depart from before city simon said in deep voice will be a say bind beforehand to agree to whatever will decide be just right therefore john of gischala henceforth will regard not a truce a beginning of peace between rivalry will be who will best defend holy city against foe so be john of gischala replied must eleazar be here be enemy in midst just a whenever be fighting with fell upon from behind so will be that while be struggling with roman may be attacking from inner temple have none of outer wall to defend will therefore be free to choose moment when can fall upon unawares make peace with at price john said only put end to strife let there be more bloodshed in temple how can hope for god assistance in defending city when altar be being daily desecrated with blood will see what can do john said somehow other strife must be brought to end will be done without bloodshed if possible there be thing john simon said comrade here have be telling that from what saw at jotapata gamala be convinced that by passive resistance only can not defeat roman that must sally out attack in camp at work therefore let agree that will meet here from time to time arrange that issuing together through gate in portion of wall may unite in falling upon roman counsel be good john of gischala said will keep up courage of men to fight in open whenever opportunity present men will act with yours have given titus lesson today next time will divide honor chapter siege be begun fifth legion have be stationed at emmaus halfway between jerusalem jaffa marching greater part of night joined twelfth fifteenth at halting place at gaboth saul next morning three advanced together twelfth fifteenth marched halfway down hill of scopus encamped together on knoll while fifth legion encamped three furlong to rear so in case of attack by jew weary soldier must not have to bear brunt of conflict a legion be marking out camp tenth legion have marched up from jericho appeared on mount of olive titus sent word for to encamp there thus jerusalem be overlooked throughout length breadth by roman camp on hill to north east side john have at earnest request of simon taken up residence with in palace of herod from top of tower of phasaelus watched roman legion at work seems to said to simon now be time for to make assault roman raise veritable fortification round camp when once be completed can scarcely hope to storm whereas if fall suddenly upon now can fight on even term legion on mount of olive be widely separated from rest might overcome before others must come to assistance agree with simon said let strike blow at once simon at once sent off to john to propose that latter must issue out from golden gate in middle of temple platform while must lead out troop by gate to north of platform in accordance with suggestion of john requested john of gischala to place watchman on conspicuous position on wall with order to wave mantle a signal to party to charge a from position must be better able than to see what roman be doing party must see while might be invisible to other john of gischala sent back at once to say that approved of plan must join in simon called troop together leaving outer wall strongly manned lest twelfth fifteenth legion might take advantage of absence of so large portion of garrison to make sudden attack upon marched towards northeastern gate being joined on way by john with band waited until messenger came from john of gischala saying that be ready then gate be thrown open troop poured out john have given strict order to men to keep together in company under commander not to try to maintain regular order a one band for must be next to impossible fighting on such hilly broken ground besides must be sure to get mixed up with mass of simon troop at same moment that simon force poured through northeastern gate that of john of gischala issued from temple platform in rivalry with other dashed down steep declivity into bottom of valley of jehoshaphat then climbed sharp slope of mount of olive then with loud shout fell in wild disorder a reached spot upon tenth legion roman anticipating attack many of unarmed a worked at intrenchment be unable to resist fierce onslaught accustomed to regular warfare rush of armed men from side upon surprised disconcerted moment added to number of assailant a fresh combatant continued to pour out from city fighting stubbornly sullenly roman be driven out of half formed intrenchment up slope over crest of mount of olive jew fought regardless of life single men dashed into midst of roman fell there fighting fiercely john compact company hurled upon line broke simon fought desperately at head of men cutting down who stood in way roman be wavering must soon have broken into open flight when rescue arrived general in command have immediately jew have be seen issuing out sent off horseman to titus with news putting at head of bodyguard started instantly to assistance falling suddenly upon flank of jew bore down by impetuosity weight of charge in vain simon john of gischala tried to rally men john band gathering round at sound of bugle opposed firm steady resistance roman legion rallied ashamed of having be driven back before very eye of titus attacked jew with fury latter be driven down hill into valley here john band refused to retire further simon john of gischala rallied troop obstinate contest ensued roman being unable to push jew farther back now that latter be in turn fighting with ground in favor for time battle raged then titus seeing that must not drive jew back into city ordered portion of tenth legion to reascend mount of olive complete work of fortifying camp so at end of day legion must fall back to place of safety watchman on wall saw movement thought that roman be retreating waved mantle wildly at signal jew again burst down upon foe fresh force poured down from gate to assistance in vain roman line tried to hold bottom of valley jew burst through drove in disorder up hill titus alone with few follower making stand on lower slope jew rushing on surrounded party fell upon from side while main body swarmed up hill roman panic stricken dispersed in direction victory seemed in hand of jew when of roman discovered that titus be not with be cut off surrounded at bottom of hill shouted to others news rapidly spread through fugitive overwhelmed with shame at having deserted general knowing severe punishment according to roman military law must befall for cowardice roman paused in flight discipline came to aid quickly fell in in company with shout of fury advanced upon scattered jew who although vastly superior in number have order formation must enable to resist downward impetus of solid mass of heavy armed roman again be driven down hill roman pressing upon found to delight that titus band have successfully resisted attack of foe jew be driven distance up side of slope there combat be renewed until seeing that must make further impression upon enemy jew retired sullenly through gate into city be however well satisfied with day work number have fallen have inflicted heavy loss upon roman have forced one of legion to retreat in fair fight have captured titus have proved to roman formidable nature of task have undertaken next day th of april be day of passover jerusalem prepared a usual to celebrate day of great sacrifice gate of temple be a usual thrown open multitude thronged in to worship john of gischala have sworn to eleazar a have to simon to lay aside hostility a usual did not allow oath to prevent from carrying out design number of men concealed arm under garment entered temple with worshiper at signal sword be drawn cry of battle be raised eleazar follower at once fled in dismay to vault under temple multitude in court above panic stricken at threatened conflict strove to escape many be trampled under foot killed be wantonly slain by john follower to whom murder have become pastime when order be restored john of gischala went to entrance of vault shouted to eleazar that desired to keep oath must do harm that for general safety of city must be no longer permitted to hold inner temple must with men take share in defense of wall if eleazar must agree to do promised that harm must be done to follower eleazar being at mercy of foe accepted term with follower ascended into temple for once john of gischala kept word eleazar be permitted to retain command of own two thousand men force henceforth formed part of zealot army of john thus from time forward there be two faction in city josephus always bitter enemy of john of gischala speaks in term of utmost reprobation of conduct on occasion occasion manner in deed be effected can not for moment be defended at same time must be admitted that occasion be urgent one that existence of enemy in midst crippled john of gischala power to defend portion of city that suppression of eleazar faction conversion of troop from enemy into ally be act of high policy be indeed necessity if jerusalem be to be successfully defended desecration of temple however upon so sacred occasion a feast of passover filled pious jew with horror caused john to be regarded with even greater detestation than before for opinion of unarmed multitude however cared little have crushed faction of eleazar have added two thousand men to strength be now ready without fear of trouble within to face roman enemy without desperate sortie of jew have convinced titus that if jerusalem be to be taken must be by mean of regular siege operation conducted with greatest care caution having made circuit of city perceived that be impregnable save on north northwestern side be part defended by third wall therefore reluctantly gave order that villa mansion garden grove standing between wall foot of mount scopus must be destroyed placing strong body of troop opposite gate to prevent sortie of defender set whole of three legion encamped on side to carry out work of destruction feeling of grief dismay filled city at sight of devastation be being wrought there be very many among multitude who must gladly have avoided further evil by submitting to roman idea did not enter head of military leader simon determined upon sortie number of citizen be ordered to take place upon wall to cry out to roman that desired peace to implore to enter town take possession in meantime number of simon men issued out from woman gate in confusion a if expelled by peace party appeared to be in state of extreme terror sometimes advancing towards roman a if to submit to at other time retreating towards wall a if afraid of putting into hand of roman a neared wall be assailed by shower of missile from above titus suspected that trick be being played ordered troop to stand fast battalion facing gate seeing stand open be unable to resist impulse to rush in take possession therefore advanced through crowd of jew outside until close to gate then simon men drew out concealed weapon fell upon in rear while fresh body of armed men rushed out from gate attacked in front while from two flanking tower storm of javelin arrow stone be poured upon roman fought desperately number of be slain rest took to flight pursued by jew did not halt until reached tomb of helen half mile from wall while jew with shout of triumph re entered city john have taken part in sortie have lost more than fifty men in fight on mount of olive determined to hold rest in reserve until be needed in moment of extreme peril manner in band have held together have steadfastly resisted roman attack have greatly excited admiration of simon see now said on evening of sortie when talking matter over with john secret of success have gained over roman men fight a steadily with a much discipline a do while be far quicker in movement unite activity of men with steadiness of roman wish now that have spent last year in training disciplining men to act with equal steadiness order be too late to try to do so now will do best will die fighting be to attempt now to introduce regularity among must lose fierce rush with assault roman without acquiring sufficient discipline to enable to keep order a yours do in confusion of battle mine be picked men john said have eight thousand under order during last two year of fighting bade leave when advanced to jerusalem save who be ready prepared to die therefore can rely upon man a upon unless see exceptional opportunity think will lead out beyond wall again time will come a siege go on when will need body of men to hold breach arrest advance of roman column men who will die rather than give way foot when time come band will fill gap think be right simon agreed men be too good to be wasted in desultory fighting will be kept a last resource know that when time come can be relied upon clearing of ground occupied four day titus then determined to advance camp nearer to city fixed upon spot be highest on plateau quarter of mile to northwest of rubble tower before moving into position be strongly fortified so much impressed be titus by sally jew have made that formed up whole army along north northwest side of city heavy armed troop three be first line behind came rank of archer behind cavalry three deep brave a be jew did not venture to sally out to endeavor to break through living wall stood day immovable while baggage animal aided by great crowd of artisan camp follower moved war engine reserve baggage of army from mount scopus down to new camp here twelfth fifteenth legion under titus took up position fifth legion under command of cerealis formed camp on knoll quarter of mile from jaffa gate divided from by valley of hinnom be here of great depth lay about third of mile south of camp of titus tenth legion remained on mount of olive camp have now be very strongly fortified be in position to repel attack might be made against now that disposition be complete titus determined to save city if possible from horror of siege therefore sent nicanor josephus with flag of truce towards wall to offer term sooner have come within bow shot than arrow be discharged from wall struck nicanor upon shoulder ambassador at once retired titus indignant alike at insult to messenger violation of flag of truce immediately began to make preparation for siege must population of city have be consulted must have declared by immense majority of voice for surrender simon john of gischala whose men held wall be absolute master of city inhabitant be to pay now a have paid in past for cowardice in allowing to be tyrannized over by body of men whom outnumbered by ten to one titus after careful examination of wall determined to attack at spot between jaffa gate psephinus in former time assault of enemy have be directed against north be here consequently that wall be strongest at foot too wide deep fosse have be cut in solid rock rendering impossible for assailant to advance to attack until be filled up on northwest wall have not be made equally strong have fosse be continued from psephinus to jaffa gate have doubt be considered that projecting angle of wall at psephinus fortification of palace of herod covered portion of wall be moreover to extent protected by valley of hinnom between top of slope of valley foot of wall be level space of ground sufficiently wide for establishment of machine for breaching wall here therefore titus determined to make attack on nd of april troop began work legion be to erect bank mount battering ram construct tower vast quantity of timber be required desolation already effected between north wall scopus be now widely extended whole of tree for great distance round jerusalem being cut down brought to spot tower be constructed about ninety foot in height with wide face be put together beyond range of missile of defender be to be advanced upon wheel up bank until neared wall a three bank approached wall hurdle covered with hide be erected to protect worker on side javelin men archer be posted together with war engine for casting missile simon be not idle possessed war engine taken when antonia be surrendered by roman captured from legion of cestius men have experience in working of machine must only manipulate slowly aim be bad be able therefore to interfere little with work of roman archer slinger however did greater damage killed many while at time gate must be thrown open simon must dash out at head of men do much damage before roman must drive back within wall tenth legion did more injury to defender than did others being provided with more powerful war machine ballista threw stone weighing hundred weight distance of quarter of mile jewish watchman on wall kept vigilant watch upon machine time stone be coming shouted warning defender threw on face until stone passed over even at night whiteness of newly cut rock rendered mass visible a flew through air titus then ordered stone to be painted black before be discharged thus added to effect a approach must be no longer seen night day roman toiled at work night day jew with missile sortie hindered approach until bank have approached so close to wall that battering ram must be within striking distance then tower be brought up ram began to strike mighty blow upon wall while from top of lofty tower from story below archer war machine poured storm of missile down upon defender of wall a be evident now that danger lay solely in quarter that whole strength of besieged be needed here simon sent to john of gischala to urge that line of demarcation agreed upon by between respective troop must no longer be observed john must not trust in power of simon gave leave to soldier to go down aid in defense who have be chafing at forced inactivity while simon men be bearing brunt of fighting went down to take share in struggle regardless of storm of missile jew maintained place upon wall shooting blazing arrow hurling combustible down upon roman work executing such frequent desperate sortie that titus be obliged to keep greater part of force constantly under arm to gather round tower large body of archer horseman to repel attack at length corner tower fell before one of battering ram wall behind stood firm breach be effected nevertheless jew appeared dispirited at proof of power of battering ram fell back into city roman legionary under belief that fighting be over for evening be drawn back into camp suddenly from small gate hitherto unnoticed by roman situated at foot of tower of hippicus jew poured out with flaming brand in hand dashed at roman bank sweeping defender of work before swarming up bank surrounding tower to endeavored to set fire be however plated with iron outside beam inside be of so massive description that jew be unable to set light to while of jew be striving to do rest fell with such fury upon roman troop who hurried up to protection of work that be driven back body of alexandrian troop only posted near tower maintained against attack until titus with cavalry charged down upon jew who although match for roman infantry be never throughout war able to resist charge of body of heavy horseman titus be said to have killed twelve jew with own hand fighting desperately to end assailant be driven back into city one prisoner only be taken titus with barbarity afterwards distinguished proceeding during siege ordered to be crucified close to wall among killed on jewish side be john commander of idumeans who formed part of simon force be shot by arab while be parleying with roman soldier be man of great courage excellent judgment loss be serious one for besieged at night be still silent party be exhausted with long desperate struggle even machine ceased to hurl missile suddenly terrific crash be heard very ground seemed to shake party sprang to arm jew fearing that wall have fallen roman not knowing what have happened apprehensive of of sortie have begun to hold in high respect something like panic seized until titus riding about among reassured by presence word knew indeed that repetition of defeat have suffered at jewish hand must not be forgiven battalion have be defeated at sortie at woman gate have be sternly rebuked by titus who have ordered military law to be carried into effect certain number of soldier to be executed have only pardoned upon intercession of whole army on behalf therefore legionary now fell into rank at order of titus drew up in order of battle while party be sent forward to ascertain what have happened be found that serious misfortune have befallen jew in attack have be unable to set fire to tower have worked so vigorously in attempt to destroy bank that have weakened that portion of upon one of tower stood have given way beneath tremendous weight resting upon great tower have fallen with crash to ground in morning combat recommenced although jew exposed life on wall unflinchingly be unable to withstand terrible shower of missile poured upon from remaining tower to interrupt steady swing of huge ram day night beat against wall one of especially did material damage jew christened nico conqueror at length wearied out by effort disheartened by failure of attempt to interfere with work of destruction knowing that inner line be vastly stronger than without jew abandoned defense of tottering wall retired behind next line of defense roman soon discovered that be unopposed scaled wall a soon a found that whole space between second wall be abandoned set to work threw down large portion of third wall took up post inside titus established at spot known a camp of assyrian at foot of tower of psephinus a soon a arrangement be completed gave order for assault to be recommenced date of capture of outer wall be on th of may fifteen day after commencement of siege capture of bezetha new town enabled roman to make attack directly on palace of herod on one side mount moriah upon other without first assaulting second wall defended inner lower town two three day fighting convinced titus that position must not be successfully attacked until lower town be in power three great tower phasaelus hippicus mariamne desperately defended by simon soldier formed impregnable obstacle on one side while antonia steep ascent up to temple platform be defended with equal stubbornness success by soldier of john of gischala titus therefore prepared for assault of second wall point selected for attack be middle tower on northern face close to be wool mart clothes mart brazier shop there be natural obstacle to approach battering ram be soon placed in position while strong body of archer prevented defender showing above parapet wall be of far le strength than roman have before encountered soon began to totter before blow of battering ram jew indeed be indifferent a to fall for knew that possession of inner town be of slight importance to that fall must not greatly facilitate attack upon what be natural line of defense namely height of zion moriah for short time roman advance be delayed by proceeding of castor jewish officer commanding tower have assaulted with ten men alone have remained there when rest of defender have retired got up sham battle among men roman suspending operation under belief that party of defender be anxious to surrender castor stood on parapet offered titus to surrender titus promised life when archer standing near sent arrow pierced castor nose sternly rebuked then asked josephus who be standing beside to go forward assure castor companion that life must be spared josephus however knew way of countryman too well declined to endanger life upon castor offering to throw down bag of gold man ran forward to receive when castor hurled great stone down at titus seeing that be being fooled ordered battering ram to recommence work just before tower fell castor set fire to leaped with companion a roman supposed into flame really into vault whence made escape into city a soon a tower fell titus entered breach with bodyguard thousand heavy armed troop inhabitant almost entirely of poorer class surrendered willingly titus gave order that none save found with arm upon must be killed roman dispersed through narrow winding street when suddenly simon men poured down from upper city john at head of band issued from quarter while fell upon roman in street others entered house rained missile upon from above while party issuing from gate by phasaelus attacked roman between second third wall drove into camp for time titus in lower town suffered terribly at last titus posted archer to command lane leading towards breach managed with considerable loss to withdraw troop through jew at once manned wall formed in close order behind breach titus led heavy armed troop against john simon defended with greatest valor for three day night beat back continued attack of roman soldier at end of time be utterly exhausted while roman incessantly brought up fresh troop even simon who have fought desperately at head of men have performed prodigy of valor must no longer continue struggle slowly in good order defender of breach fell back to upper city lower town remained in possession of roman in order to avoid recurrence of disaster have befallen titus ordered considerable portion of second wall to be leveled so that troop must if necessary pour in out without difficulty simon have thought of repeating sortie large number of best men have already fallen determined to reserve force for defense of almost impregnable position of upper city two hundred of john band have fallen round breach have received several wound fighting strength of band be now one half of what be at commencement of siege have before roman first entered inner town have remainder of store of grain removed to building in upper town simon have assigned to band have a yet be little trenched upon a simon have ordered that ration similar to issued to own men from few granary have escaped destruction must be given to john band what do think now of prospect simon asked a john stood together on tower of phasaelus on day after roman have taken possession of lower town think a did at first john said that nothing miracle can save temple difficulty that roman have overcome simon said be a nothing to still before be quite true john agreed have good supply of food believe that might hold out for month grain be already nearly exhausted can not support even fighting men much longer while inhabitant be dying from hunger well strong might resist attack that roman can make when can no longer lift sword must overcome still a long a can fight be ready to do so in hope that god may yet have mercy upon deliver temple chapter subterranean passage for few day after capture of lower city jew have respite titus knew that famine be sapping strength of defender day weakened power of resistance saw that assault upon strong position must be attended with immense difficulty loss be desirous of saving city from destruction ordered therefore grand review of troop to take place for four day great army at command splendid cavalry solid mass of roman infantry light armed troop cavalry of ally defiled before jew from height of city watched with feeling of dull despair tremendous power assembled against felt hopelessness of further resistance intense desire for peace reigned throughout multitude john of gischala simon have thought of yielding believed that mercy titus might be ready to grant to inhabitant of town for follower there be hope whatever of pardon be firmly resolved to resist until last titus finding that offer of submission came from city sent josephus to parley with defender must not have made worse choice of ambassador divided a jew be among be united in common hatred for man whom regarded a traitor to country harangue of josephus to effect that resistance be unavailing that must submit to mercy of titus be drowned by execration from wall in fact in case must word have reached large number of inhabitant for have cautiously placed out of bow shot of wall word must scarcely have reached for whom have be intended even if silence have be observed mission therefore be altogether unavailing illustration misery in jerusalem during siege by titus john felt own resolution terribly shaken by sight beheld in city inhabitant moved about like specter fell died in street felt now that resistance have be mistake that must have be far better to have thrown open gate when titus appeared before in case great proportion at least of within must have be spared temple city must have escaped destruction even regretted that have marched down to take part in defense have known how entirely exhausted be granary must not have done so have thought that at least there must have be sufficient provision for siege of month that patience of roman might have be worn out felt now that sacrifice have be useless one although must now have raised voice in favor of surrender be powerless even own men must not have listened to voice originally most fervent ardent spirit of band be now inspired by feeling of desperate enthusiasm equal to animated simon john of gischala authority must have be at once overthrown have ventured to raise voice in favor of surrender already have once be made to feel that there be point a to influence failed to have effect whatever have morning after retired to upper city spoken to men on subject of store of grain have urged on horror be taking place before eye that woman child be expiring in thousand that inhabitant be suffering extreme agony of starvation have concluded by proposing that store must be distributed among starving woman word have be received in silence then one of captain of company have risen what say john of suffering people be undergoing be felt by for one can not agree to proposal that must give up store of food owing to number of have fallen there be still well nigh fifty pound man left will keep in health strength for two month be to give out must not suffice for single meal for quarter of people assembled here must delay death few hour thus must profit nothing while will enable to maintain strength maybe at critical moment to hurl back roman from very gate of temple must be wickedness not charity to part with store must defeat object for came here for be ready to die without real benefit to on whom bestowed food general chorus of approval showed that speaker represented opinion of comrade after pause went on there be reason why must keep what ourselves have brought in here know how soldier of simon persecute people how torture to discover hidden store of food how break in rob a devour in secret provision have concealed know not whether hunger must drive to act likewise know length to famished men can be driven therefore must that must be spared necessity for such cruelty to keep life together be ready to die let be a strong men facing enemy slaying a fall again murmur of approval be heard john felt that must be worse than useless to urge point admitted to that there be reason in argument that while distribution of food must give most temporary relief only to multitude must impair efficiency of band result showed that implicit a be obedience given to in military matter influence have limit beyond certain point authority ceased henceforth remained in house except when went to post on wall immediately adjoining therefore escaped being harrowed by sight of suffering that must not relieve day however set apart half of own portion of grain gave to first starving woman met when went out regulation issue of ration have now ceased granary be exhausted henceforth simon troop lived entirely upon food extorted from inhabitant john of gischala follower fared better enormous a have be destruction of grain store in temple be so prodigious that be enabled to live in comparative abundance so maintained strength fighting power suffering of people increased daily great number made escape from city either sallying out from unguarded postern at night letting down from lower part of wall by rope titus allowed to pas through john of gischala simon with purposeless cruelty placed guard on wall gate to prevent starving people leaving city although true policy must have be to facilitate in way escape of save fighting men thus to husband what provision still remained for use of defender of city in daytime when gate be open people went out collected vegetable herb from garden between wall roman post on return be pitilessly robbed by rough soldier who confiscated to own use be brought in effort to escape formed fresh pretext to simon john of gischala to plunder wealthy inhabitant who under charge of intending to fly to roman be despoiled of have tortured executed titus soon changed policy instead of allowing deserter to make way through seized who went out from city to seek food scourged tortured crucified before wall sometimes a many a five hundred be crucified in single day checked desertion multitude deeming better to die of hunger than to be tortured to death by roman resigned to misery of starvation for seventeen day roman labored at embankment only one attack be made upon wall be carried out by son of king of commagene who have just joined army with chosen band armed attired in macedonian fashion a soon a arrived loudly expressed surprise at duration of siege titus hearing told that be at perfect liberty to assault city if liked men at once did fought with great valor with success whatever great number of being killed scarcely one escaping uninjured for fortnight john have bestowed half of ration upon poor woman whose child be sick who stood at door of house morning to wait passing one day begged to enter will need more food said thanks to god who sent to aid child be recovered can now walk intend to fly tonight from terrible place there be escape john said soldier allow none to pas if must pas through roman must slay can escape woman said be why have called in husband who be killed by simon robber three month ago be for many year employed in working in underground passage of city in repairing conduit carry water from spring a often carried down food to when be at work know winding turn of underground way a know ground beneath city be honeycombed by passage whence stone be in old time obtained for building there be many house have entrance by pit into place be one of husband took for convenience from here can find way down to great conduit be built by king hezekiah to bring water from upper spring of river gihon down into city of water supply pool known a dragon pool main body run down conduit in line of tyropoeon valley from temple must in old time go down draw water thence must pool cistern fail entrance have long be blocked up for when temple be destroyed people carried away captive ruin covered entrance none knew of husband when at work once found passage ran for distance by side of massive masonry of old time one of great stone be loose prised out to see what might lie behind when did so heard sound of running water passing through hole found in great conduit afterwards followed up found that terminated at upper end of valley of hinnom in round chamber at bottom of spring bubbled up there be entrance to chamber from without through passage outer exit of be well nigh filled up with earth many bush grew there so that none passing by must have idea of existence when trouble here became great took showed conduit led to exit saying that time might come when might need to fly from jerusalem exit lie far beyond camp that roman have planted on side of valley of hinnom by going out at night child can make way unseen to hill since have saved life tell of secret be known think to none for after showing place husband closed up entrance to passage be before well nigh filled up with stone may be that time may come when too will need to save by flight now if will come with will show way see have mixed here pot of charcoal water with can mark turning passage so that will afterwards be able to find way for without such aid must never be able to follow path through many winding after only once going through john thanked woman warmly for offer at once prepared to descend into pit be situated in cellar beneath house be boarded over so that plunderer entering to search for provision must not discover upon entering cellar woman lit two lamp be full of oil said have often be sorely tempted to drink have kept untouched knowing that life might day depend upon rough step be cut in side of pit after descending thirty foot john found in long passage woman led way a went on john be surprised at number extent of passage crossed other in direction sometimes opening into great chamber from large quantity of stone have be taken while passed many shaft like by have descended to surface above woman led way with unfaltering step showed how thorough be acquaintance with ground pausing when turned down fresh passage to make smear at corner of wall with black liquid presently passage began to descend rapidly be now under palace of king agrippa said be descending by side of tyropoeon valley presently turning down small side passage found way arrested by pile of stone rubbish clambered up removed of upper stone crawled along underneath roof rubbish heap soon slanted down again continued way a before turn be in wider passage than have latterly traversed be wall of conduit woman said touching massive masonry on right hand opening be little further on presently arrived at great stone lying across passage corresponding in size to gap in wall on right made way through found in conduit of king hezekiah stream of water ankle deep be running through need not go further woman said once here can not miss way will take nigh hour walking through water before arrive at chamber of spring from there be one exit will come down again with tonight john said will carry child to entrance will both need strength when sally out so a to get well beyond roman who be scattered over country cutting wood for embankment moreover will be able to see a come down with whether mark be plainly visible that there be fear of mistake for once lost in passage one must never find one way again there must be choice between dying of hunger of being found by roman who will assuredly search passage for fugitive a did at jotapata truly thank with heart feel have given mean of saving life be if fall in fighting a made way back to house john examined mark at turning added to be not sufficiently conspicuous to catch eye at once when have gained cellar replaced board woman said why must not also leave city tonight say that there be hope of resistance that john of gischala simon be only bringing destruction upon in city by thus holding out against roman why must throw away life so uselessly have come here to defend temple john said so long a temple stand will resist enemy may be be useless one can say what be purpose of god whether doe not yet intend to save holy seat when temple have fallen will have more to fight for will then if can save life for sake of who love that evening on return from wall john proceeded to house of woman be in readiness for journey child who be seven eight year old be dressed mother have little bundle with valuable by a soon a descended into passage below john offered to carry child mother refused can walk well said for time must not carry upon shoulder for passage be in many place just high enough for to pas under without stooping at rate can walk for time be not long however before child weakened by illness began to drag behind john swung up on to back mark found be easily made out in hour arrived at entrance to conduit here be forced to walk slowly in place water owing to channel having sunk deepened to knee at other time stone have fallen from roof impeded passage be nearly two hour before reached arched chamber at termination of conduit there be stone pavement round edge of pool upon sat down to rest for hour for john woman be exhausted by labor have undergone be time for to be moving woman said rising must be nigh midnight must be mile on way before morning child have walked short distance yet will do best now when know that wicked roman will kill mother if catch wo

distance at time for too be weak weight be too much for now god bless friend said turning to john may keep safe through danger of siege lead to home parent again made way to end of passage together climbed over rubbish nearly blocked entrance crawled through hole found in outer air thick low bush covered ground around sound be to be heard john rose to foot looked round behind at distance of more than quarter of mile light of roman watch fire showed where legion be encamped beyond above must be seen here there light in city sound be to be heard save occasional call of roman sentinel on other side be dark for working party always returned to camp at night in readiness to repel sortie jew might make against camp working party be very dark night john said doubtfully do think can find way there be star woman replied confidently besides be born at bethlehem know country well will keep on west for while then turn off into deep valley leading down towards masada god be with taking child

ground be trying even to strong active man carefully replaced board across mouth of pit placed lamp in position so that must find in dark upon going out of house closed door carefully next morning that of th of may roman attack began fifth twelfth legion have raised embankment near struthion soapwort pool facing castle of antonia while tenth fifteenth raised theirs facing great tower of hippicus phasaelus mariamne have not carried out work unmolested for jew have now learned art of constructing managing war machine have made three hundred scorpion for throwing arrow forty ballista for hurling stone with have caused terrible annoyance great loss to roman now be prepared on evening of th last stroke have be given to embankment on following morning engine be mounted troop stood in readiness for attack suddenly smoke be seen stealing up round embankment facing antonia roman officer called back men not knowing what be going to occur then series of mighty crash be heard great embankment with engine battering ram tottered fell dense smoke shot up in column followed rapidly by tongue of fire soon vast pile of material collected put together with so much pain be blazing fiercely while jew laughed shouted in triumph upon wall moment john of gischala perceived where roman be going to construct embankment have begun to run mine from behind wall towards when gallery be extended under great excavation be hollowed out roof being supported by huge beam between be piled up pitch other combustible when roman be seen advancing to attack fire be applied a soon a support of roof be burned away ground with embankment upon fell in simon on side be equally ready to receive enemy trusted rather to valour than stratagem a soon a roman engine facing tower began to shake wall tepthaus megassar chagiras rushed out with torch in hand followed by crowd of simon soldier drove roman before set fire to great machine roman crowded up to assistance of working party a advanced be received with shower of missile from wall attacked fiercely by jew who poured out from city in continuous stream flame spread rapidly seeing hope of saving engine embankment roman retreated to camp triumphant jew pressed hard on rear rushed upon intrenchment assailed guard number of be killed rest fought resolutely while engine on work poured shower of missile among jew careless of death assailant pressed forward stormed intrenchment roman be on point of flight when titus who have be absent upon other side arrived with strong body of troop fell upon jew desperate contest ensued jew be finally driven back into city enterprise have however be crowned with complete success embankment have occupied roman seventeen day in building be destroyed with battering ram greater part of engine work of reconstruction must be far more difficult toilsome than at first for country have be denuded of timber for many mile off moreover soldier be becoming greatly disheartened by failure of attack upon city titus summoned council laid before three plan one for attempt to take city by storm second to repair work rebuild engine third to blockade city starve into surrender last be decided upon a first step whole army be set to work to build trench wall round city work be carried on with greatest zeal in three day wall nearly five mile in circumference be completed thus there be longer chance of escape to inhabitant more possibility of going out at night to search for food now misery of siege be redoubled thousand died daily mournful silence hung over city died in house in street crawled to cemetery expired there sat upon housetop with eye fixed upon temple until sank back dead one have strength to dig graf dead body be thrown from wall into ravine below high priest matthias who have admitted simon follower into city be suspected of being in communication with roman three son be led out on to wall executed in sight of besieger while fifteen of member of sanhedrin be executed at same time murder caused indignation even on part of of simon men one juda with ten others agreed to deliver one of tower to enemy roman rendered cautious by treachery have before be practised hesitated to approach before be convinced that offer be made in good faith simon discovered what be going on eleven conspirator be executed upon wall body thrown over despair drove many again to attempt desertion of on reaching roman line be spared many more be killed for sake of money supposed to be concealed upon up to st of july be calculated that well nigh six hundred thousand have perished in addition to vast number buried in cemetery great heap of dead before wall great number of house have become tomb inhabitant shutting up dying quietly together while trusting chiefly to famine roman have laboured steadily on at military engine although obliged to fetch timber for ten mile at beginning of july battering ram began to play against antonia jew sallied out time with le fury than usual be repulsed without much difficulty by roman day long battering ram thundered against wall while men protected by hurdle penthouse laboured to dislodge stone at foot of wall in spite of storm of missile hurled down from above by nightfall have got out four large stone happened that stone stood just over part under john of gischala have driven mine when destroyed roman embankment thus doubly weakened wall fell with crash during night john however have built wall in rear when roman rushed to assault of breach in morning found new line of defence confronting titus addressed troop called for volunteer sabinus syrian volunteered for attack eleven men followed in spite of storm of missile reached top of wall jew believing that many be behind turned to fly foot slipped fell before must regain foot jew turned round upon slew three of companion fell beside on top of wall rest be carried back wounded to camp two day later in middle of night twenty roman soldier with standard bearer trumpeter crept silently up to breach surprised slew watch trumpeter blew charge jew believing that whole roman army be upon fled in sudden panic titus at once advanced with men stormed new wall entered castle of antonia then advanced along cloister connected with temple john of gischala have by time arrived at spot opposed desperate resistance to assault until simon crossing from upper city by bridge came to assistance john finding that temple be attacked also led band across for ten hour struggle raged vast number fell on side till dead formed bank between combatant titus finding that even courage discipline of troop did not avail against desperate resistance of jew at last called off from assault well satisfied with having captured antonia during fight roman have several time nearly penetrated into temple indeed centurion named julian man of great strength courage skill at arm have charged jew with such fury that have made way alone a far a inner court when mailed shoe slipped on marble pavement fell jew rushing back slew after desperate resistance to end titus commanded that fortress of antonia must be levelled to ground then sent josephus with message to john of gischala offering free egress for men if must come out to fight outside in order that temple might be saved further defilement john replied by curse upon josephus whom denounced a traitor concluded that feared not that city must be taken for be city of god then titus sent for number of person of distinction who have from time to time made escape from city attempted in vain to persuade people if not to surrender at least to spare temple from defilement ruin even roman soldier be adverse to attack upon place so long regarded a pre eminently holy titus harangued jew have put up barrier said to prevent stranger from polluting temple roman have always respected have allowed to put to death who violated precinct yet defile yourselves with blood carnage call on god call on whole army call upon jew who be with call on yourselves to witness force to crime come forth fight in other place roman will violate sacred edifice john of gischala zealot must hear of surrender doubted whether titus must keep promise feared to surrender stronghold be now last hope above still believed that god must yet interfere to save temple titus finding that garrison be obstinate raised voice called out john whom met near hebron if be there bear witness have striven to keep oath will strive to end blame not if not through fault by obstinacy of men destruction come upon temple john who be standing within hearing called out be here titus bear witness yet pray strive to end to keep oath swore to what be oath john simon who be standing close by asked what compact have with roman general met in battle alone john said quietly chanced that fell might have slain came to that be better to try to save temple than to slay one of enemy therefore swore to save temple if lay in power have offered to spare lay with john of gischala to save temple from destruction by accepting term have not done so if temple be destroyed be by obstinacy of defender not by cruelty of roman must be madness to accept offer simon said angrily titus know well that in plain must be match for troop did ever hear before of garrison giving up position so strong that must not be taken from going out to fight beyond wall besides who can tell that roman will keep promise once be at mercy might level temple in case sin must be upon head besides there be occasion to retire beyond wall why must not all fighting men retire into upper city leave temple to god if be will that roman must destroy will do so if be will that must respect will do so can save destroy at will if retreat to upper town break down bridge after must never take how long must hold out simon said with hard laugh be there day food left in city if there be men be le sharp than give credit for will fight here to end for temple sooner roman attack better for if delay many day there be not single man will have strength enough to lift sword chapter capture of temple although abhorring general conduct of simon john of gischala believing that condition must be made with roman must save temple john still retained hope cherished by jew that god must yet save jerusalem a in old time be conscious that people have forfeited all right to expect aid that by wickedness forgetfulness of more especially by frightful scene have desecrated city temple during last four year must have angered god beyond hope of forgiveness still punishment have be inflicted be already so terrible that like others hoped that god anger might yet relent a have done in old time that remnant might yet be spared above hope lay in belief that temple be actual abode of lord that though might suffer whole people to perish for sin must yet protect at last own sanctuary surely john thought a stood on roof of temple glorious building can never be meant to be destroyed temple occupied square six hundred foot way lofty rock on stood have be cased with solid masonry so that rose perpendicularly from plain on top of massive foundation be built strong lofty wall round whole area within wall be spacious double cloister fifty two one half foot broad supported by one hundred sixty two column on south side cloister be one hundred five foot wide

hundred thirty two foot high forty three foot wide through be seen beautiful gate temple be built of white marble roof be covered with sharp golden spike now that be evident that on side of temple alone must enemy make attack division between simon john of gischala men be no longer kept up gathered for defence of temple jew kept up vigilant watch for roman must assemble in great force in antonia unseen by must advance under cover by cloister flanked platform connecting antonia with temple on side interval between antonia temple be three hundred foot cloister be considered to form part of temple jew be therefore reluctant to destroy although greatly facilitated attack of roman finding that offer be rejected titus spent seven day in destruction of large portion of antonia then prepared for night attack a whole army must not make assault thirty men be picked from hundred tribune be appointed over thousand cerealis being chosen to command whole titus mounted watchtower in antonia in order that might see reward act of bravery assault began between two three o'clock in morning jew be on watch a soon a massive column moved forward cry of guard gave alarm jew sleeping in around temple seized arm rushed down to defence for time roman have advantage weight of close formation enabled to press forward against most obstinate resistance even in darkness there be fear of mistaking friend for foe while jew fighting in small party often mistook other for enemy a many fell by sword of friend a by of enemy loss be greater since troop of john of gischala simon have common password coming suddenly upon other often fought desperately before discovered mistake a daylight began to break mistake became le frequent presence example of leader animated jew to greatest exertion while knowledge that titus be watching inspired roman with even more than usual courage obstinacy for nine hour conflict raged then roman unable to make slightest impression upon resistance of jew fell back again into antonia finding that in hand to hand conflict soldier must not overcome jew titus ordered erection of small embankment two on platform between cloister other two outside cloister wall work proceeded slowly owing to difficulty of procuring wood jew a usual hindered work a much a possible with shower of missile attempted to create diversion by sortie attack upon camp of tenth legion on mount of olive however be repulsed by roman without great difficulty a cloister leading to antonia afforded great assistance to roman in attack jew set fire to end of cloister touching temple wall length of from twenty to thirty foot of cloister be destroyed roman destroyed further portion so a to afford more room for men at work upon embankment action of jew be to certain extent necessity depressed spirit of inhabitant for there be prophecy when square wall temple fall hitherto antonia connecting cloister have be considered a forming part of temple have given irregular form destruction of cloister left temple standing massive square embankment presently rose above height of wall be evident that must soon be taken jew retired from roof of cloister facing embankment a if despairing of further resistance have previously stored great quantity of combustible in space between cedar roof of cloister upper platform roman on embankment seeing that jew have retired without waiting for order ran down planting ladder scaled wall jew set up cry a if of despair roman poured up on to wall until great mass of men be collected on roof of cloister then on sudden flame shot up in direction beneath foot found enveloped in sea of fire many be burned smothered by smoke stabbed with sword leaped down into outer court be there killed by jew many jumped down outside wall be picked up dead with broken limb others ran along upon top of wall until be shot down by jewish missile one man seems to have escaped soldier named artorius standing on wall shouted to roman below whoever catch will be heir soldier ran forward to accept term artorius jumped down upon killing by fall escaping unhurt fire extended along whole of western cloister northern cloister be next day burned by roman thus on west north side inner temple be now exposed to invader time famine have be continuing work fighting men be so weakened that have scarcely strength to drag limb along to hold weapon while horrible tale be told of suffering of such of inhabitant who still survived one woman maddened by despair cooking eating own infant occasionally baggage animal roman cavalry horse strayed near wall when crowd of famishing wretch must pour out kill devour titus however cut off even occasional supply by ordering soldier whose horse have thus fallen into hand of jew to be put to death for carelessness john band have be greatly diminished in number in two day have be fighting opposite antonia store have brought to city be now exhausted although for long time only smallest amount have be issued daily to eke out handful of grain still served out to of fighting men few only have in suffering refused to obey order of john officer have joined band of simon john of gischala in revolting cruelty practised to extort food from inhabitant have not be allowed to rejoin band be now reduced to little over fifty stern gaunt famine worn figure still unshaken in determination to fight to end roman now pushed on bank from western wall across smouldering ruin of cloister inner court battering ram began to play against inner temple after six day effort bringing up heaviest battering ram roman gave up in despair for huge stone formed masonry of wall defied even ponderous machine roman brought to play against embankment from northern side be also carried across outer court to foot of most easterly of four northern gate of inner temple still anxious to save temple cloister if possible titus must not resort to use of fire ordered men to force gate with crowbar lever after great effort few of stone of threshold be removed gate supported by massive wall prop behind defied effort titus now ordered soldier to carry wall by storm ladder be brought up soldier eager for revenge upon foe who have so long baffled humiliated sprang to assault with shout of exultation jew offered resistance until roman reached top of wall a leaped down on to roof of cloister threw upon number be slain a stepped off ladder on to wall many of ladder be hurled backward crushing soldier crowded upon on pavement beneath then titus ordered standard of legion to be carried up thinking that soldier must rally round emblem of military honour jew however permitted standard number of legionary to ascend on to roof of cloister then again fell upon with such fury that roman be overpowered standard be taken defender killed not one of roman who have mounted wall retired from must no longer resist appeal of infuriated soldier who maddened by loss have suffered disgrace of loss of standard must not understand why loss be entailed upon when easy way of destroying gate entering temple be in power most reluctantly titus gave permission clamoured for allowed troop to set fire to gate dry woodwork caught like tinder flame mounted instantly silver plate covered woodwork melted ran down in stream fire at once communicated with cloister inside wall appalled at sight of inner court in flame jew stood despairing while shout of triumph of roman rose high in air during rest of day through night conflagration continued extended round cloister thus temple be surrounded by ring of fire next day th of august titus called council of general to deliberate on fate of temple there be present besides titus tiberias alexander second in command commander of fifth tenth fifteenth legion fronto commander of alexandrian troop marcus antonius julianus procurator of judea be for levelling temple to ground others advised that if abandoned by jew might be preserved if defended a citadel ought to be destroyed titus listened to opinion of others then declared own be that whatever use jew made of ought to be preserved alexander cerealis fronto went over to opinion of titus therefore by majority of one be agreed that temple must be spared however fiercely jew might resist order be given to prevent fire spreading to temple to clear ground for assault against th of august broke be on day that temple of solomon have be burned by nebuchadnezzar courage of jew be not depressed by omen brief pause have enabled to recover from despair have felt in seeing inner cloister in flame at eight o'clock in morning sallying from eastern gate rushed down upon roman latter formed in close order covered by shield received onslaught calmly so desperately did jew fight in such number did pour out from temple that roman have begun to give way when titus arrived with great reinforcement even then be not until one o'clock that jew be driven back again into wall of inner temple titus having seen troop victorious retired to tent soldier continued work of clearing platform extinguishing smouldering fire of cloister suddenly jewish band burst out again deadly struggle commenced then one of roman soldier seizing burning brand from cloister hurled into window of one of side chamber inclosed temple on north in furious struggle be going on none noticed action be not until flame be seen rushing out of window that jew perceived what have happened with cry of anguish discontinued conflict rushed back to try extinguish flame woodwork dried by intense heat of august sun be ripe for burning in spite of most desperate effort fire spread rapidly news that temple be on fire reached titus starting up accompanied by bodyguard of spearmen commanded by liberatus hastened to spot officer followed a news spread whole of roman legionary rushed with one accord to spot titus pushed forward into first court of inner temple court of woman then into inner court by shout gesture implored own soldier jew alike to assist in subduing flame clamour din drowned voice legionary pouring in after added to confusion so great be crowd that many of soldier be crushed to death while many fell among ruin of still smouldering cloister be either smothered burned who reached sanctuary paid attention to remonstrance command even threat of titus shouted to in front of to complete work of destruction titus pressed forward with guard to vestibule then entered first holy then holy of holy after one glance at beauty magnificence of marvellous shrine rushed back again implored soldier to exert to save ordered liberatus to strike down who disobeyed soldier be now altogether beyond control be mad with triumph fury hate one of bodyguard a titus left sanctuary seized brand applied to woodwork flame leaped up soon whole temple be wrapped in fire soldier spread through building snatching at golden ornament vessel slaying met unarmed men priest in robe woman child many of jew threw into flame of priest found way on to broad wall of inner temple where remained until compelled by famine to come down when be executed six thousand of populace took refuge on roof of royal cloister along south side of outer temple roman set fire to soul upon perished a soon a felt that effort to extinguish fire be vain that temple be indeed lost john of gischala simon john called men together issuing out fell with fury of desperation upon dense rank of roman soldier in inner court in spite of resistance cut way through to outer court gained bridge leading from southwest corner across valley of tyropceon to upper city be therefore for time in safety john bewildered exhausted heartbroken from terrible event of past few day staggered back to house threw on couch lay there for long time crushed by severity of blow until now have hoped that titus must in end spare temple recognized now that be obstinacy of jew have brought about destruction be god will that must perish said to titus must no more save than must do after hour roused descended to room now occupied by remnant of band jonas ten others alone be gathered there have thrown down on ground sat in attitude of utter dejection several be bleeding from wound received in desperate fight of morning others be badly burned in desperate effort have made to extinguish flame exhausted by want of food worn out by exertion filled with despair at failure of last hope member of little band scarce looked up when leader entered friend said listen to if for last time at least have nothing to reproach with have fought for temple to last if failed to save be because be will of god that must perish at rate duty be done god have not given life preserved through so many fight that must throw away be duty now to save life if can now that temple have fallen be called upon to do more fighting let band of john of gischala simon fight to last be a wild beast inclosed in snare of hunter merit thousand death for be who have brought jerusalem to pas who have robbed murdered population who have destroyed granary must have enabled city to exist for year who refused term by temple might have be saved who have caused destruction in spite of effort of titus to preserve be author of ruin woe have lived a wild beast so let die there be reason why must die with for guilt be not upon head have done duty in fighting for temple have robbed injured none therefore say let save life must surrender to roman one of band asked indignantly do whom have followed counsel to become traitor be not treachery to surrender when one can no longer resist john said quietly be not thinking of surrendering be thinking of passing out of city into country around first let eat see look surprised although store brought be long since exhausted there be still last reserve bought with money have with from one of simon men upon day when came hither from lower town have gained doubtless in wanton robbery for at time fighting men have plenty of food a be bought thinking that time might come when one meal might mean life to many of have never touched remains where hid in chamber will fetch now john ascended to chamber brought down bag containing about fifteen pound of flour let make bread of said will give good meal now there will be enough left to provide food for during first day journey exhausted men seemed inspired with new life at sight of food thought of asking how be to pas through roman line occurred to idea of satisfying hunger overpowered other feeling door be closed to keep out intruder dough be made fire kindled with piece of wood dry a tinder so that smoke must attract eye of who be constantly on lookout for sign that family be engaged in cooking flat dough cake be placed over glowing ember whole having be divided into twenty four portion of men must hardly wait until portion be baked john urged upon be to eat in half cooked state consequence might be very serious after prolonged fast still none of must resist breaking off little piece to stay craving let eat slowly john said when food be ready more slowly eat further will go when be eaten will take sleep for four hour to regain strength there be fear of being called upon to aid in defence roman must be a exhausted a be will need thought preparation before attack last stronghold be far stronger than have yet taken if have food must hold mount zion against for month a soon a meal be over lay down to sleep none have asked question a to how escape be to be effected unexpected meal john forethought have prepared for have revived confidence in be ready to follow wherever might take be night when john called to awake glare of vast pile of burning temple lit up object brightness almost equalled that of day be time john said a men rose to foot grasped arm trust that will have occasion to use weapon will carry so that if must fall into hand of roman may fall fighting not die by torment that inflict upon who fall into hand if must obtain hearing so a to be brought before titus might give life will not trust to in first place must cut down like hunted animal did come upon in second must not now owe life to clemency of roman fierce assent be given by follower now john went on let take piece of bread put in bosom leave buckler javelin behind take sword jonas bring brand from fire now let be off none of with except jonas have least idea where be going have instructed lad in secret of pit one day have taken down passage to aqueduct found safety before jonas together trust may do so again must anything happen to will now have mean of escape if die will die with master jonas said indeed in fight have always kept close to john following movement ready to dash forward when leader be attacked by more than one enemy springing upon like wildcat burying knife in throat be to watchful protection ready aid that john owed that have passed through so many combat comparatively unharmed not so jonas said in answer to lad declaration that must die with must be satisfaction to that must share fate great one to know that must get away safely if fall charge to pas out by underground way to carry to father mother mary news have fallen fighting to last in defence of temple tell thought of to end sent to to be with to be to father mother son until will find for mary husband who may fill place be stay of old age father will treat a adopted son for sake will bestow upon portion of land have be a brother to jonas pray promise to carry out wish jonas have reluctantly given pledge from hour until john have declared that must fight no more jonas have be moody silent now however a walked behind friend face be full of satisfaction there be chance now that must have to take home news of leader death befell must share together soon reached door of house in pit be situated be entered door closed behind lamp be then lit john led way to cellar bade men remove board will go first with one of lamp said do jonas take other come last in line keep close together so that light may be sufficient for to see strengthened by meal by confidence in john promise to lead through roman band felt like new men followed john with usual light active gait a led way not word be spoken till reached hole leading into aqueduct be conduit of king hezekiah john said when emerge at other end will be beyond roman line exclamation of satisfaction burst from men have be wondering a walked where leader be taking knew that ground beneath jerusalem be honeycombed by cave passage leader must not intend to hide there be evident for have one meal with that of passage must debouch beyond roman line have not occurred to have thought that passage be following must probably lead out at foot of wall into valley of hinnom of jehoshaphat john intended to creep with up to foot of roman wall to trust to activity speed to climb make way through guard placed there to cut off fugitive none have even hoped that must be able to pas wall of circumvallation without struggle hour walking brought to chamber over spring now john said will rest for hour before sally out let man eat food have brought with rest must keep till tomorrow for will have to travel many mile before can reach spot that roman have not laid desolate where may procure food trust went on that will be altogether unnoticed sentry may be on alert on wall for will think likely that many may be trying to escape from city save on duty will be asleep after toil feasting in honour of success fact too of great glare of light over jerusalem will render darkness more intense when look in other direction if must be noticed be best that must separate scatter in darkness flying for life making way home a best may if be not seen will keep together there be fear of meeting with roman band when be once fairly away party getting wood will have be warned by smoke of what have taken place will have hurried back to gain share of spoil at end of half hour john rose to foot led way along passage to entrance when came to spot where be nearly blocked up blew out light crawled forward over rubbish until reached open air others followed until be beside then rose to foot temple be not visible whole sky seemed on fire above jerusalem outline of three great tower of palace of herod of building of upper city stood black against glare there be sign of life movement near a with quick noiseless step little party stole away none of knew more than general direction have to follow glare of great fire served a guide a to direction even at distance made object on ground plainly visible so that be enabled to pick way among stump of fallen plantation orchard through garden by ruined villa house until reached edge of plateau plunged down into valley descending to dead sea after walking for two hour john called halt can walk slowly now said avoid risk of breaking leg among rock be safe here have best lie down until morning then resume way there be fear whatever of roman sending out party for day have upper city to take yet work of plunder division of spoil to carry out can sleep without anxiety be strange to to lie down to sleep among stillness of mountain after din turmoil of siege when at moment might be called upon to leap up to repel attack few of went off to sleep for time dull feeling of despair utter carelessness of life desire for death end of trouble have so long oppressed have passed away now that be free in open air thought of home have never thought to see again of loved one who must greet on return a men who have almost come back from dead fell upon must go back with head erect clear conscience have fought so long a temple stood have over over again faced roman hand to hand without giving way foot have taken share in evil deed in city have wronged plundered one did not return a conqueror be will of god fault of theirs at daybreak be on foot again now struck off more to left following mountain path among hill until at last came down to plain within mile of upper end of dead sea john here called companion round here friend said think be best that separated laying aside sword singly in pair finding way back to home know not in what town there may be roman garrison where may meet party of soldier traversing country alone will attract attention one man may conceal behind tree in smallest bush sight of party together must assuredly draw upon therefore be best to separate of will find shorter to cross ford of jordan three mile away while others have best follow side of river agreed that must be safer plan after short talk took leave of leader comrade strode away until jonas alone remained with john will cross river john follow side jonas asked think have best keep on side jonas on other country be hilly village few here at least can gather fruit corn a go from deserted garden field two day walking will take to tarichea can cross there take boat up lake after waiting until last of comrade have disappeared from sight john companion continued way keeping about halfway between jericho jordan presently bore to left until on great road running north from jericho followed until nightfall rejoicing in grape fig picked by roadside where few month since little village have nestled thickly just before darkness fell came upon village although deserted have not be burned probably owing to body of roman soldier having taken up post there for time entered one of house lay down be soon fast asleep chapter slave john be roused from sleep by being roughly shaken sprang to foot found number of men of whom be holding torch in room two of have appearance of merchant others be armed by dress seemed to be arab what be doing here one of men asked be peaceful traveller john said injuring one came in here to sleep night look like peaceful traveller man replied have two wound yet unhealed on head companion have one of arm bandaged be robber of cutthroat who escaped from jerusalem may think iucky have fallen into hand instead of of roman who must have finished off without question bind said turning to men resistance be useless hand of john jonas be tied behind back be taken outside house several fire be burning in road lying down be three four hundred men woman while several men with spear sword stood a guard over john saw at once that have fallen into hand of slave dealer one of many who have come from various part to purchase jew whom roman sold a slave already multitude sold be so vast that have reduced price of slave throughout italy egypt east to one third of former value there be however comparatively few able bodied men among in almost case roman have put to sword slave dealer finding john jonas have congratulated on acquisition knowing well that complaint that captive might make must be listened to that story must not be believed even if must get to tell to anyone of authority john jonas be ordered to lie down with rest be told that if made attempt to escape must be scourged to death villain jonas muttered a lay down be not enough to drive one mad to think that after having escaped roman must fall into hand of rogue must not grumble at fate hitherto jonas have be marvellously preserved first of two be alone saved from jotapata then with ten others alone out of six hundred escaped alive from jerusalem have reason for thankfulness rather than repining have be delivered out of hand of death remember have ring of titus with that when time come will avail from day siege have begun john have carried signet ring of titus wearing on toe concealed by band of sandal knew that be to fall into hand of roman must get opportunity of speaking even if not killed at once must be robbed of valuable might posse that assertion that ring be signet titus have given must even if listened to be received with incredulity have therefore resolved to keep concealed to produce only when favourable opportunity seemed to offer at rate jonas let practise patience be thankful that be still alive in morning cavalcade got into motion john found that majority of fellow captive be people who have be taken captive when titus for second time obtained possession of lower city have be sent up to tiberias there sold purchaser be now taking down to egypt men be mostly past middle age must have be of little value a slave have not be that be craftsman worker in stone metal must therefore fetch fair price if sold to master of craft rest be woman child men be attached to other by cord john jonas being placed at distance apart one of armed guard placed near a there be far more risk of active determined young men trying to make escape than of others doing so especially after manner in have be kidnapped clothes be taken from save loincloth john trembled lest must be ordered also to take off sandal for present captor must have idea of value of ring must seize for setting fortunately however be not case guard wore sandal have therefore motive in taking of captive especially a be old worn party soon turned off from main road struck across hill to west john bitterly regretted that have not halted for night few mile further back than did in case must have avoided slave dealer caravan heat be intense john pitied woman child compelled to keep up with rest soon proposed to woman who be burdened with child about two year old to place on shoulder a guard saw in proof that new captive have idea of endeavouring to escape offered objection to arrangement indeed seemed so good to that a other mother became fatigued placed child on shoulder of male prisoner loosing hand of latter in order that might prevent little one from losing balance caravan halted for night at sichem next day crossed mount gerizim to bethsalisa then went on to jaffa here slave dealer hired ship embarked slave be crowded closely together otherwise be not unkindly treated being supplied with abundance of food water for be desirable that must arrive in best possible condition at alexandria whither be bound fortunately weather be fine in six day reached destination alexandria be at time largest city next to rome upon shore of mediterranean have contained very large jewish population prior to great massacre five year before even now there be considerable number remaining merchant have counted upon indeed have not be for number of jew scattered among various city of east price of slave must have fallen even lower than did jewish resident so far a must afford came forward to buy country men woman in order to free from slavery when therefore new arrival be exposed in market many assuring message reached from compatriot telling to keep up courage for friend must look after feeling against jew be still too strong for who remained in alexandria to appear openly in matter therefore employed intermediary principally greek cretan to buy up captive woman with child be first purchased a value of be not great then of older men who be unfit for much work be taken then there be pause for already many cargo of captive have reached alexandria resource of benevolent countryman be becoming exhausted one have yet bid for john jonas a slave dealer have placed high price upon a being strong active fitted for hard work great fear be that must be separated john have over over again assured companion must a hoped succeed in getting sent to titus so be freed must before proceeding home come to egypt purchase friend freedom event feared however did not happen one day roman evidently of high rank came into market after looking carelessly round fixed eye upon john companion at once approached master few minute be spent in bargaining then dealer unfastened fetter bound roman briefly bade follow proceeded through crowded street until be in country outside town here villa with beautiful garden lined road roman turned in at entrance to one of largest of mansion under colonnade surrounded house lady be reclining upon couch two slave girl be fanning illustration ' roman said have brought two more slave lesbia roman said complained yesterday that have not enough slave to keep garden in proper order so have bought two more from slave market be jew that obstinate race have be giving titus so much trouble young a be seem

after news of return to rome triumph of titus arrived john asked philo to tell tibellus that prayed that must hear a wished to speak to on subject connected with titus wondering what jewish slave must have to say about son of emperor upon hearing from philo of request at once ordered john to be brought to let bring companion also with john said to philo be adopted brother can bear evidence to truth of statement when reached colonnade philo told to stop there minute later came out philo tell that have something to say to concerning titus have lord john said advanced held out ring roman took examined be signet ring of titus said in surprise how came by be grave matter slave if can not account satisfactorily a to how came possessed of signet have better have thrown into sea swallowed poison than have spoken of possession of signet be given to by titus john said roman made gesture of anger be ill jesting with name of caesar said sternly be caesar ring doubtless be stolen from may have taken from robber by force fraud a gift know not mock with tale a caesar gave one of signet to jew be a said john replied calmly titus bestowed that ring upon said that if desired to come to at time showed to roman must open door bring to presence speak a if be mad tibellus said yet tale be not credible be weary of life jew do long to die by torture philo have spoken well to of young companion have laboured well cheerfully tell be skilled at work do find lot so hard that must die to escape so tell impossible story for death horrible death will assuredly be portion if persist in tale showing ring say ' demand that send companion to titus ' must be bound to do so then torture death will be portion for mocking name of caesar lord john said calmly repeat that mock not name of caesar that what have told be true be not weary of life discontented with station have be kindly treated by philo work no harder than must work at father farm in galilee naturally long to return home have abstained from showing ring before because titus have not a yet conquered jerusalem now that hear have be received in triumph in rome must have time to give audience therefore pray may be sent to how be possible that titus must have given ring tibellus asked impressed by calmness of john manner yet still unable to believe statement appeared to altogether incredible will tell lord will tell alone for although titus made secret of at time might not care for story to be generally told tibellus waved hand to philo who at once withdrew have found hard to believe what have told lord john went on will find harder still to believe what now tell if be command be bound to do so be command tibellus said shortly must fain know whole of monstrous tale must first tell lord though a yet twenty one year old have for four year fought with countryman against roman see said pointing to scar on head arm body have be wounded often a may see for of scar be yet unhealed others be so old that can scarce see trace be proof of so much at least of story companion here be by protection of god enabled to escape from jotapata when else save josephus perished there be regarded by countryman a well nigh miracle a proof have divine favour in consequence number of young men when took up arm elected a leader for three year did what must to oppose progress of roman arm be a if fly must try to stop camel still did what must of roman officer who served under titus must tell that of who opposed in field there be more active partisan than leader who be generally known a john of gamala john of gamala tibellus exclaimed in frequent letter from friend with army have read that name heard how incessant be watchfulness required to resist attack how often small garrison party be cut off by be too who burned vespasian camp before gamala tell young man that be that jewish hero for hero be though be against rome fought tell so lord adopted brother here who be with through campaign will confirm what say say not boastingly for leadership be due to special bravery on part simply because young men of band thought that god have specially chosen to lead now about titus tibellus said briefly more more convinced that slave be audaciously inventing story once near hebron john said be passing through valley alone when titus who be riding from carmelia in obedience to summons from vespasian who be at hebron came upon attacked fought titus hand to hand tibellus asked with short laugh titus hand to hand john repeated quietly have wounded twice when sprang within guard closed with foot slipped fell for moment must have slain if must did not then fainted from loss of blood titus be shortly joined by of men have carried down to camp where be kindly nursed for week visiting several time at end of time dismissed giving signet ring telling that if ever again fell into hand of roman wished to see have to show ring to roman that must send to to will go tibellus said sternly better must have be that have never be born than must send to with tale a so saying turned away while john companion returned to work roman officer be absolutely incredulous a to story have heard indignant in extreme at what considered audacity of falsehood still must not be struck by calmness with john told story must see what motive must have in inventing falsity must of course be made apparent instant arrived in rome whereas have said a be doubtless truth that have obtained ring from one who have stolen from titus might have obtained freedom reward for restoration after thinking matter over for time ordered horse rode into city one of legion from palestine have returned there while two have accompanied titus to rome fourth have remained in judea tibellus rode at once to headquarters of commander of legion have just returned with of officer from parade of troop have taken off armour slave be pouring wine into goblet for ah said be drink friend tell ail for in truth look angered hot have be angered by one of slave said then there be trouble in roman said with smile throw to fish buy be cheap enough for have flooded world with slave a know to cost be scarce saleable have brought two three thousand with can get bid for yes matter ca be settled so tibellus said first want to ask question two heard of course of john of gamala in war in judea there be chorus of assent did indeed to cost general said save two leader in jerusalem be most dangerous be by far most troublesome of foe many score of sleepless night have that fellow caused from time well nigh burnt camp before gamala be thorn in side one never knew where be when to expect one day heard of attacking garrison at other end of country next night must fall upon camp never marched through ravine without expecting to see men appearing on hill sending rock thundering down among worst of be do what must must never get to close quarter with men must march three mile to one a for arab if sent in pursuit must soon come flying back to leaving goodly portion of number dead behind be most formidable enemy have outside jerusalem have jew fought a did instead of shutting up in walled town might have be year before subdued that pestilent country did ever see john of gamala do know what be like personally be giant like simon who be executed at triumph other day none of ever saw be to know be though doubtless may have seen in fight country people questioned such wounded men a fell into hand for never once captured one of band unharmed asserted that be little more than lad be strong skilful in arm in year youth believed that be sort of prophet one who have mission from god why be asking will tell presently said first answer question be not legion be at carmelia with titus when vespasian lay at hebron there be general assent did ever hear of wounded jew being brought in tended there by order of titus did general said here be plancus who be in command of part of horse of legion formed bodyguard of titus who brought into camp will tell about titus have received message from vespasian that wished to see officer signified by general said rode off at once telling to follow armed mounted a soon a must titus be well mounted have considerable start came up to in valley be standing by side of dead horse be slightly wounded dirtied armour showed that have have sharp fight close by lay jew who seemed to be dead titus ordered to be carried back to camp cared for by own leech be know about can tell more general said for titus told that have have desperate fight with jew that have wounded severely be on point of finishing when jew sprang at suddenly sudden shock threw to ground strange a might seem although knowing who be jew spared life be strange story anyone besides titus must have kept to run sword through body of jew to make sure of silence titus have notion of own be a generous a be brave by what said gathered that jew abstained from striking believing a be truly case that titus be more merciful than vespasian that must spare jerusalem temple if must now why question one more on part first what became of jew what be like be two question general replied however will answer titus let go free when be recovered from wound be young man of twenty year old do know name know name be john for so told titus a other jew one come across be john doe not tell much can tell other name tibellus said be john of gamala exclamation of astonishment broke from officer so be john of gamala general said none of ever dreamt of yet might well have be for now think of young fellow saw lying wounded in tent next to of titus answered exactly to description have heard of fact that overcame titus in show that have unusual strength bravery how do know about simply because john of gamala be at present working a slave in garden say so general exclaimed have often wondered what became of learned from deserter that have entered into jerusalem be fighting there against agreed that men have brought with took part in atrocity of soldier of simon john of gischala that kept together lived quietly harmed man be heard who did chief part in three day fighting at breach of lower town never heard what became of supposed that must have fallen in fighting round temple so be slave how did know be what be going to do war be over now there have be bloodshed enough after be gallant enemy who fought fairly well told who be tibellus said believed that be lying to have heard often of john of gamala deemed that be brave skilful warrior seemed impossible that young man must be a to what be going to do with have nothing to do what have demanded namely to be sent to titus produced signet ring of caesar said that be given to by general that told that if presented to roman at time must lead to presence believed that have stolen ring have got from somebody have stolen then told of story very much a have told save that said that when be well nigh conquered by titus sprang upon caesar foot slipped fell hinting that success be result of accident rather than own effort spoke by mean boastingly of a if be most natural thing in world there showed discretion wisdom general said truly be marvellous story if have not appealed to caesar must have said 'give freedom ' can buy new slave for few sesterces young fellow be too good to be slave now that judea be finally crushed must never become dangerous a have demanded to be sent to caesar must of course send there besides with idea titus have may be really glad to see youth again will like to see also honour brave adversary must like to see who so long set at defiance will bring down tomorrow at hour tibellus said then taking leave of officer mounted rode back on reaching home at once sent for john doubted story when told to said deemed impossible have be down to officer of legion arrived last week from judea chance to be very one be at carmelia when vespasian lay at hebron find story be fully confirmed although indeed did not know that wounded man titus sent in be john of gamala a admit that answered exactly to description have heard of leader doubt not that be however be assured that request be granted that will be sent to rome by next ship go thither chapter at rome tibellus at once ordered john to be released from further work badge of slavery to be removed that must be supplied with handsome garment removed into house assigned apartment with freedman bearer of signet of titus now that be ascertained that signet have be really given to by caesar be important person be to be received with consideration if not honour when change have be made john be again brought before tibellus be there anything else that can do for comfort a one who have be honoured by titus future emperor have to express wish will be glad to carry out must ask then john said that friend companion may be set free allowed to accompany to rome be adopted brother have fought slept by side for last four year bounty to give pleasure so long a be labouring a slave tibellus at once sent for philo ordered collar to be filed from neck of jonas for to be treated in same manner a john next day invited john to accompany to barrack a must take excuse be obliged to do so tibellus presented to general officer who received very cordially be much struck with quiet demeanour nobility of bearing john have for four year be accustomed to command belief entertained by follower in special mission have have effect upon manner although simple unassuming in mind always ready on return to farm to become again simple worker upon father farm have yet insensibly acquired bearing of one born to position authority be much above ordinary height although figure be slight showed sign must well be appreciated by roman of great activity unusual strength face be handsome forehead lofty eye large soft in extreme firmness of mouth square chin jaw be there alone sign of determination steadfastness have made so formidable foe to roman so be john of gamala general said have doubtless nearly crossed sword more than once have caused many sleepless night seemed to that band be ubiquitous be glad to meet a be roman cherishes malice against honourable foe such always found trust have malice for past none john said regard a instrument of god for punishment of people brought misfortune upon ourselves by rebellion must have seemed madness have not doubtless be will of god that must so provoke perish ask now be to return to father farm to resume life there if must do without going to rome must gladly do so that can hardly be tibellus said rule be that when one appeal to caesar to caesar must go case be at once taken out of hand besides must have to report fact to rome titus may wish to see might be ill pleased at hearing that have returned to galilee without going to see besides may be time before animosity between two people dy out there might obtain from imperial order must prove protection to family against who might desire to molest if for reason alone must be well worth while for to proceed to rome three day later tibellus told john that ship must sail next morning that centurion in charge of invalided soldier must go in have arranged for to go in charge have instructed to accompany to palace of titus facilitate having interview with have given letter to present to titus with greeting saying why have sent to here be purse of money
