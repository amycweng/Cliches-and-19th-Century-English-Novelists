heavy on sand sometimes generally strike channel there be fear of anything else never start if gale be blowing smack be safe in anything gale be too deep to capsize at sea there be more drinking smack dropped down river stood off on near entrance will be delighted with bright sea dotted with ship fishing craft sun be shining there be just enough wind to send smack along briskly through water without raising wave sufficiently high to give perceptible motion at eight o'clock captain went on shore in boat with man to look after absent sailor leaving only one hand two boy on board at boat be again seen coming out one two three four boy said have got now will be off boat be soon alongside two drunken men be helped on board at once went below to sleep sober then boat be hoisted on board second hand taking helm kitty started fairly on way now captain said let get little tidy took hour work before deck be washed rope coiled down everything ship shape by time be done low coast of norfolk have sunk below horizon smack be far out at sea there be more motion now wind be still light skipper be pleased with earnestness alacrity new apprentice showed now jack said to other boy take will below with show how to make tea process of tea making on board smack be not difficult one to master sole operation consisting in putting few more spoonful of tea into kettle boiling over fire when begin to get low filling up with fresh water simple a thing be william gale did not learn on occasion have be feeling somewhat shaky even while on deck heat of cabin smell of grease jack have just put in frying pan preparatory to cooking fish brought off from shore completed effect of rising sea until next morning be not in condition to care even have tea remained unmade to end of time did not go below lay under shelter of tarpaulin on deck in morning skipper roused up now lad just take off coat shirt here be bucket of water put head in give good sluice then come down have cup of tea bit of biscuit will find all right again will followed instruction found wonderfully better now lad lend hand in tidying up on deck there be nothing like work for keeping off seasickness jack will cook for today boy set to work with will felt so refreshed that by one o'clock be able to go below take share of dinner at present while on way to fishing ground meal be taken at same time a on shore once at work there be only two meal day of first be taken when fishing be over fish cleaned picked weighed packed hour varying between nine eleven second meal be taken before trawl be lowered at six seven o'clock in evening after five day sailing smack arrived off fishing ground two day be spent in finding fleet a fishing ground extend over distance of hundred of mile when came up with william gale be astonished at vast number of boat dotted sea in yarmouth fleet there be between four five hundred vessel be not that most perfect order discipline reign number of accident must occur from so many boat fishing close to other at night must be terrible fleet be commanded by one of most experienced skipper who be termed admiral authority be absolute lead fleet to ground selects for fishing by signal by day rocket by night issue order when net be to be lowered down drawn up course be to be steered tack on be to stand fishing be entirely done at night trawl be let down about dusk fleet attached to moving anchor forge slowly ahead to leeward until daybreak then trawl be got in fleet sail in body to spot where admiral decides that fishing will be continued in evening at o'clock at night trawl be hauled in net emptied hand be called up for operation when be concluded trawl be again lowered fish cleaned packed by light of torch formed of rope dipped in tar watch who have hitherto be on deck turn in others remain on deck until morning when net be again hauled in there be not indeed much for watch to do a smack need steering attention of men on deck be directed chiefly to see that other smack drift down upon must there appear danger of flare be lit to warn other smacksmen trawl rope be slacked out hauled in a case may require generally volley of strong language pas between respective crew trawl beam be heavy pole foot long at end be fitted strong iron hoop of about three foot in diameter keep pole from touching ground keep open mouth of net one side of be attached to pole while other drag along bottom net resembles in shape long deep purse have various pocket other contrivance by when fish have once entered mouth be prevented from returning trawl rope be from to yard in length according to depth of water be hauled in by mean of winch great weight tax united strength of crew to get level with bulwark when be up net be hauled on board small end be opened fish tumble on to deck be then separated packed in trunk a wooden case in be sent to market be called sol fetch by far highest price fortunate be crew who get good haul of fish for men work upon share account being kept of sale made during fishing trip owner deducts cost of provision store have be put on board take one more share for vessel man have one share skipper mate receiving rather larger proportion than others thus men have lively interest in haul great be satisfaction when net come up well filled there be seen to be good proportion of sol among content coarse fish a be called include brill haddock hake ling whiting many others turbot be also caught in haul there must probably be vast number of object must delight heart of naturalist dog fish too be sometimes taken a be conger eel horse mackerel stone oyster too come up in net latter be betes noires of fishing sometimes when fleet get over bed of oyster score of net will be lost in single night for when bag becomes full of oyster weight be so great that utmost power of fisherman exertion on winch be insufficient to lift from bottom there be nothing to be done to cut rope abandon trawl net upon occasion language applied to admiral be scarcely of kind for polite ear food of crew when once upon fishing ground consists almost wholly of fish with exception of sol man may select fish fancy from glistening mass upon deck amount consumed at meal at first astonished william gale accustomed a be to meager workhouse ration soon however found able to keep up with rest operation of frying seemed sometimes interminable so many time have pan to be filled emptied hard biscuit be eaten with fish whole washed down with copious draught of tea without milk two three time week men must a change have meal of salt meat on sunday duff pudding of flour currant be made few day after joining fleet weather changed sky became gloomy threatening wind blew hard heavy sea got up will found that keeping watch at night be pleasant enough on fine star light night be very different thing now be joke looking ahead with wind blowing fiercely shower of spray dashing into eye yet vigilant watch must be kept for if rocket ordered hauling of trawl be not noticed other smack moving rapidly when released from drag of net might at moment come into collision with smack still more important be to notice upon side trawl be to be lowered after being emptied upon tack vessel be to proceed for mistake in respect must be certain to bring smack across in case trawl rope must become entangled involving in heavy sea certain loss of one other many of smack carry dog be found that become even better watcher than master for can be relied on to call attention of watch by sharp barking to letting up of rocket however distant rocket may seem to be easy thing to see in large fleet stern most smack may be three four mile away from leader in dark thick night be exceedingly difficult to make out even rocket at distance wind increased to gale trawl be up now fleet lay to may be explained that operation be performed by bringing ship nearly into eye of wind then hauling foresail across belaying sheet aft sail mizzen be then hauled tight tiller lashed amidships a fore sail pay vessel off from wind after sail brings up again be thus kept nearly head to sea crew go below wait till storm abates chapter run down william gale be astonished at fury of tempest wildness of sea although at workhouse have often heard wind roaring round wall there be nothing to show force be being exerted there be few tree in neighborhood william have hardly ever be without wall except in fine summer weather be therefore almost bewildered by force fury of gale by noise a shrieked through rigging howled across water occasional flapping of sail rattling of heavy block added to din seemed to that kitty like fishing smack be very deep in water must be completely engulfed by great wave swept down upon several time indeed be obliged to leap down into cabin to avoid being swept away by great mass of green water pouring over bow swept aft carrying away before yarmouth smack be admirable sea boat pounded belabored a be kitty always shook off water smothered rose again for next wave in twenty four hour gale abated scattered fleet be assembled flying flag be found that three be missing having foundered be driven away from consort with return of fine weather fishing began again william thoroughly enjoyed life skipper be kind forbearing ill treated boy permitted of crew to do so everything went on regularly comfortably there be few book on board of evening after trawl be lowered before watch below turned into bunk william who be best reader on board must be asked to read aloud for hour sometimes there be song a kitty be fortunate taking of fish good men be cheerful good tempered once three four day collecting steamer came in sight then there be general race in fleet to put trunk of fish on board did best to be in good time for when catch have be heavy steamer be sometimes unable to take whole of in case portion left behind must be wholly spoilt before arrival of steamer whole of fleet therefore ran down towards steamer a soon a be seen heavy boat be tossed overboard trunk lowered into two hand jumped in to row to steamer round swarm of boat must soon be collected striving to get alongside to deliver fish in calm weather scene be simply amusing when sea be high be exciting even dangerous indeed in course of year more life be lost in process of taking fish from smack to steamer than in vessel foundered by gale sometimes fleet will be joined by dutch trading smack who exchange fresh bread meat tobacco spirit for fish traffic be cause alike of loss to owner by fish thus parted with of injury to men by use of spirit fortunately skipper of kitty although not averse to use of spirit on shore be strict man at sea saw that one took more than single glass of grog of evening over over again will congratulated that have good fortune to make first voyage under skipper for shuddered at story jack told of cruelty barbarity with apprentice be treated on board of smack although however there be doubt many brutal skipper hail from fleet from town bear good reputation in comparison with of grimsby where number of apprentice returned a drowned year be appalling one night when wind be high fleet trawling lower down north sea than usual will who be on deck be startled at seeing great ship bearing down upon smack gave shout of terror warning be joined in by crew on deck one ran for hatchet to cut trawl thus give steerage way to smack be too late in moment great ship bore down upon with crash kitty sunk beneath wave bowsprit of vessel projected across deck just at point where william gale be standing in moment caught at bob stay quickly hauled on to bowsprit climbing along be soon on board two three sailor be leaning over bow peering into darkness have not seen smack until too late to avoid collision have proved fatal to kitty have scarcely be felt by ship will be at one taken to captain who spoke english boy implored to turn back captain shook head must be useless said sea be heavy in long boot pointed to sea boot up to thigh fisherman wear man must swim for two minute must there be chance if must of finding on so dark night be very sorry lad can not be helped must take hour to bring ship about go back to spot where smack sunk might not get within mile of know that a well a do will have be long enough at sea to recognize truth of what captain said a be led forward burst into tear at thought of loss of kind friend captain rest of mate sailor who accompanied patted on back spoke cheeringly to in foreign language be soon between deck with crew several of must speak english will found that be on board dutch merchantman bound with troop for java wind got up in morning be blowing heavy gale from east vessel with reefed topsail be running for strait between dover calais at twelve knot hour after breakfast captain sent for william be sorry for sake that state of weather will prevent communicating with ship may meet promise that if gale break before be fairly out from channel will heave to put on board homeward bound ship chance did not occur for four five day gale continued with great severity before ceased ship be well down coast of spain on way south when captain saw that there be small chance of being able to transship involuntary passenger said to look lad fear that will have to make voyage with for will not touch at port until arrive at destination if like will ship a hand on board a from day of collision hand more le will make difference to owner money will be useful to when leave ship of course can return in if think fit be likely enough that when reach java may be sent up to china for homeward cargo in case will procure passage in first ship sailing for home will gladly accepted offer be however by mean penniless for upon morning after coming on board dutch officer passenger hearing what have happened in night made collection among presented boy with purse containing fifteen pound be long voyage not unpleasant one for william duty be not very heavy have far le to do than have be case on board smack month on board kitty have done much towards making sailor of for there be better seaman in world than yarmouth smacksmen going aloft be at first trial soon learned duty being strong active lad be quickly able to do efficient work speedily gained good opinion of dutch sailor by good temper anxiety to please ran little distance to south of cape before shaping easterly course to avoid bad weather so frequently met with there beyond encountering two three gale of exceptional severity nothing occurred to break monotony of voyage until coast of java be in sight upon arrival in port found vessel there about to sail for europe captain expectation be fulfilled a found order awaiting to proceed to china when have landed troop discharged cargo will determined to continue voyage in to place among ship boy on board be one between whom will gale great friendship have be struck up be year two will senior scarcely so tall upon other hand be nearly twice girth talked little broad face be ever alight with good tempered grin spoke few word of english will have when first picked up be given specially into charge will superior activity energy astonished dutch lad whose movement be slow heavy while will on part be surprised at strength han must exert when chose one day when will have be plaguing ventured within reach lad have seized held out at arm length shaking a dog must rat till shouted for mercy two be soon able to get on in queer mixture of dutch english when word failed must eke out word by gesture vessel have sailed few day from java when there be sign of change of weather hitherto have be lovely now slight mist seemed to hang over sea while overhead be clear bright there be not breath of wind sail hung listlessly against mast will who be leaning against bulwark chatting to han observed captain after looking round at horizon go into cabin reappeared in minute spoke to officer who immediately shouted order for hand to shorten sail what be for will said wonderingly there be not breath of wind egzpect captain haz looked at glass han said find fall egzpect going to have ztorm very bad ztorms in dese zea will ran aloft with sailor in ten minute inch of canvas with exception of small stay sail be stripped from ship still there be not breath of wind sea be a smooth a glass save for slight ground swell although mist did not seem to thicken strange darkness hung over sky a if high up thick fog have gathered darker darker grew until there be little more than pale twilight men stood in two three watching sea sky talking together in low tone like han will said there be something awful about have big ztorm han replied zyclone call scarcely have han spoken when sky above seemed to open with crash roar of thunder louder than ten thousand piece of artillery pealed around while at same moment blinding flash of lightning struck mainmast shivering into splinter prostrating to deck five seaman who be standing round foot a if signal have be given by peal of thunder tremendous blast of wind smote vessel stripped though be of sail heaved over almost to gunwale for moment crew be paralyzed by suddenness of catastrophe stunned by terrible thunder blinded by lightning none seemed capable of moving will have instinctively covered eye with hand seemed to for moment that sight be gone then voice of captain be heard shouting helm hard up out ax cut away wreck at once who be least stupefied by shock sprang in dazed stupid way to obey order will drew out knife feeling rather than seeing what be doing tried to assist in cutting away shroud of fallen mast have gone few foot above deck presently seemed a worked to recover from stupor power of sight came back to then saw that vessel taken on broadside by gale be lying far over with several foot of lee deck under water so furious be wind that must not show head over weather bulwark sea be still smooth a if water be flattened by force of wind stay sail have be blown into ribbon in order to get ship head off wind head of jib be hauled up few foot happened to be new strong one although bellied lashed a if must tear into fragment still stood again captain gave order sail be hauled up to full height still further vessel heaved over will expected moment that must capsize then gradually head paid off slowly righted flew before gale be near squeak will said what be zqueak han shouted mean close shave will replied han blue eye opened wider than usual zhave repeated what be talking about zhaving will said laughing mean narrow escape of being capsized han nodded there be time for talk for order be given for getting preventer stay on foremast jib having done work have be hauled down instant ship payed off small storm sail set in place men now have time to attend to who have be struck by lightning three of be found to be dead other two who be stunned senseless still lived be lifted carried below serious a disaster have be will felt that stroke of lightning have saved ship pressure of wind upon two mast hull have nearly sufficed to capsize have main mast stood felt that must have gone over sea got up in very few minute being now only in light ballast vessel rose easily over four men be at helm for wave soon became so high that ship yawed dangerously on course gale seemed to increase rather than diminish in fury sea instead of following in regular wave became perfect chaos of tossing water such a will have never before seen understood however when hour after outburst of gale heard one of men who have just be relieved at wheel say that in time ship have already run twice round compass be therefore in very center of cyclone strangely tossed sea be accounted for motion of ship be extraordinary sometimes be thrown on one side sometimes on other mountain of water seemed to rise suddenly beside tumbled in great green mass over bulwark so wild sudden be movement even oldest sailor be unable to keep foot clung on to shroud belaying pin will han have lashed by slack of rope to bulwark close to other there clung on sometimes half drowned by wave poured in above sometimes torn from foot by rush of green water a ship plunged head foremost into wave shipped one over poop presently there be crash sounded even above fury of gale fore top mast have gone at cap ax be again called into requisition for blow from floating spar must have instantly stove in side while engaged upon captain called two of men with ax aft be set to work to chop through shroud of mizzen in minute later mast snapped asunder on level of deck went over side with crash carrying away several foot of bulwark act be necessitated by loss of fore top mast a pressure of wind upon mizzen must have brought head up laid broadside to gale motion of vessel be now considerably easier there be longer difficulty in keeping dead before wind be now describing much larger circle in course showing that be farther removed from center of cyclone after five six hour extreme violence of wind somewhat abated seemed to settle down into heavy gale for two day vessel ran before have made good deal of water from opening of seam by straining pump be kept going be found able to prevent water from gaining upon felt that must weather tempest provided that be not dashed upon of island in portion of ocean abounds crew have have regular meal since gale began for caboose have be broken up washed overboard soon after commencement of storm have be obliged to be content with biscuit there be little to be done on deck watch over passed time in bunk in afternoon of third day of tempest cry be raised of breaker ahead will with comrade of watch below sprang from berth hurried on deck far ahead a vessel lifted on wave must be seen gleam of white water in anticipation of such danger small spar have be erected upon stump of mizzen steadied with strong stay sail be now hoisted upon effort be made to bring vessel head to wind watching for favorable moment between passage of heavy sea helm be put down slowly head came up into wind under such sail captain have hope of being able to reach out in teeth of gale hoped to be able to claw off shore until clear of land lay to leeward of that hope soon vanished one of mate be sent to top of foremast descended with news that a far a must be seen line of breaker stretched away on beam quarter a minute went by anxious crew must see too clearly that ship be drifting down upon land that must inevitably be wrecked upon outline of shore must now be seen forest of tossing tree behind high land must be made out through driving cloud order be now given to prepare to anchor knew that chance be slight indeed water be for most part deep close alongside island of eastern archipelago even be holding ground good hemp iron must hardly hold vessel head to gale tremendous sea when within quarter of mile of breaker man with lead proclaimed depth of ten fathom be better than have expected jib be lowered head brought dead to wind captain shouted cut in instant stopper be severed two heavy anchor dropt into sea one have heavy chain cable other hemp be allowed to run out to bit vessel brought up with le shock than must be expected wave two passed under still cable held gleam of hope began to reign when mountainous sea be seen approaching higher higher rose just a reached ship curled over crashed down upon deck cable snapped like pack thread cry of despair arose from crew captain be calm collected shouted order for jib to be again hoisted helm put up so a to run head first on to shore a neared line of breaker must see head of jagged rock rising among while beyond belt of smooth water quarter of mile wide extended to land ship head be directed towards point where rock appeared above surface everyone held breath clinging to bulwark awaited shock vessel lifted on great wave just a came to line of broken water a settled down struck with tremendous crash so great be shock that broke in two amidships a if have be made of paper portion aft going instantly to piece at once sea around be covered with fragment of wreck bale box cask great sea followed filling now open ship forcing up deck sweeping everything before william gale han have gone a far forward a possible come out to end of bowsprit will said to han two lad crawled out together sat on end of spar sea beneath be white a milk with foam poured over reef will thought that be beyond rock sea struck wreck added to disaster until larger one than usual struck broke into fragment lad clung to spar a fell sank deep in water retained hold until came to surface will looked round be safely beyond edge of reef sea be still rough broken be quiet compared to beyond reef saw that fore mast be floating near to several be clinging in quarter of hour spar floated to land boy felt bottom with foot soon scrambled ashore few minute later fore mast also drifted up several men clinging to fragment of wreck be also cast ashore in eleven men including first mate be saved chapter castaway after waiting on shore until hope that more of shipmate survived be at end party by mate order detached sail from yard have drifted ashore carried well into wood where be sheltered to extent from force of gale stout pole be then cut lashed between two tree sail be thrown over pegged down at side fire be lit with difficulty then quantity of fern branch of tree be cut made soft elastic bed whole party slept heavily until morning then went back to shore be littered thickly with fragment of wreck cask box other article here too be nearly score of corps of shipmate first duty be to dig long willow trench in sand beyond high water mark in body of drowned comrade be laid storm be now breaking glimpse of blue sky be visible overhead wind have greatly abated sea upon reef be however a high a ever setting to work hauled large number of box bale beyond reach of wave one of cask contained biscuit knocking in head helped to content sat down to talk over position be not sure mate said that poor comrade there nodded towards grave have not best of inhabitant of most of island be bloodthirsty pirate who if find will cut throat at once keep a slave only hope be that may not be discovered until have time to build boat in to sail away to singapore back to java have be wrecked further south thing must have be more hopeful for papuan be friendly inoffensive people island here be inhabited by malay most bloodthirsty pirate in world however must hope that may not be found before have finished boat chest be among have be washed up there be few tool in always have fancy for carpentry be hard if in fortnight can not make sort of craft will carry indeed if content with strong framework covered with canvas may be ready in four five day men set cheerfully to work under direction in chest be hatchet saw chisel with young tree of flexible wood be cut down split keel be laid foot in length cross piece foot long be pegged to by trenail nail formed of tough hard wood cross piece be then bent upwards fastened to strip be to form gunwale strengthening piece be placed along at distance of inch apart firmly lashed when whole be finished after three day labor framework of boat foot long foot deep foot in beam stood upon beach barrel of oil have be thrown ashore with mate intended thoroughly to soak canvas with frame be to be covered boat must calculated carry whole of men with ample store of food water for voyage upon morning of fourth day a on way to work emerged from wood upon open beach mate gave low cry pointed along shore there between reef island be large malay prahu party instantly fell back among tree malay be apparently cruising along reef to see if late storm have thrown up wreckage might be useful to loud shout proclaimed satisfaction a saw shore strewn with remains of dutch ship prahu be rowed to shore fifty sixty malay sprang from bow on to sand scarcely have done so when shout from one of called attention of others to framework of boat there be minute loud excited chatter among then dashed forward to wood deep footstep in sand showing plainly enough direction from builder of boat have come gone latter a malay boat neared shore have retired further into wood from screen of leaf be able to see what be going on a saw malay rush in excited yelling throng towards wood little party took to heel scatter mate said together be sure to overtake singly may escape let keep together han will said a dashed along through wild jungle torn by thorn often thrown down by projecting root low creeper kept on pace at time quickening a shout scream told that of comrade have fallen into hand of malay presently came upon little stream flowed into sea close to where have be cast ashore let follow up will said can track through forest water will set off scent for quarter of mile followed course of stream stopping breathlessly many time a heard voice in wood not far off presently will pointed to tree rising from clump of bush close to bank let get through bush said be careful han not to break twig a go can climb tree there be plant with stem like cord winding round top be so thick bushy that think can see there very carefully parted bush overhung stream entered thicket then made way with great difficulty to foot of tree be very large one with trunk fully foot in diameter rising forty foot without branch then number of great arm grew out at right angle be covered thickly with parasitic vegetation round trunk like snake embracing victim great climber have wound main stem be a thick a man arm there be dozen of smaller cord like climber thus lad have difficulty in climbing to point where branch grew out above be mass of foliage completely covered by climber whose drooping spray cluster gave tree appearance of solid mass of verdure boy continued to climb until be nearly at top of tree there will said wiping away perspiration streamed from face if track through bush to very foot of tree defy to find for hour wood be alive with noise malay be evidently beating foot of be determined that none of victim must escape several time party of men came up stream searching bank on side happily even sharp eye did not detect spot where boy have entered bush gradually noise ceased at night great glare by seashore told lad enemy have gathered again there be continuing by fire light work of breaking open examining treasure sea have cast up for what do zay will zhall get down go furder into wood zhall wait here think anyhow have better wait till tomorrow night will answered may search again tomorrow might come upon track if find may suppose that have caught that have escaped right into interior if find trace of will likely enough set sail before night there be difficulty in finding place in must sleep for cord like climber from bough to bough formed natural cradle in lay a securely a if in hammock on board ship in morning be woke at daybreak by cry of many bird throng forest of eastern archipelago one approached during day doubted not that malay be hard at work on shore night there be reflection of fire on beach in morning descended from perch made way carefully a noiselessly a possible through wood to point upon shore mile distant from point where landed going to edge of tree be enabled to take view along shore be deserted malay prahu be gone confident that none of enemy must have remained behind walked boldly along shore to spot where malay have landed box barrel have be broken open content carried away plank beam have be split asunder to obtain copper bolt fastening framework of boat have be destroyed portion of canvas rope carried away lad sat down on shore what will do next han han shook head perhaps of others may have got away may join here today tomorrow if be alive must be certain to come back here when thought malay have left han grunted assent anyhow first thing to do will went on be to gather up piece of biscuit have wasted lot in breaking open barrel be famishing han rose with alacrity soon be at work collecting piece of biscuit let gather up piece carefully there be good lot altogether may want badly before have done in hour have collected about pound of biscuit having gone to stream taken drink made for spot where tent have stood a expected found canvas be gone set to work with knife cutting number of bough erected shelter sufficient to shield from night air day hoped in vain that of comrade must return listened eagerly to sound in forest call footstep met ear have mean of lighting fire first having be lit by mate who being smoker have have small tin box of match in pocket have fitted closely kept out water what have better do if one come back will said a sat in little hut build anoder boat han answered how be to do han might make framework have canvas to cover with besides even if have have idea of direction of singapore doubt if must find way back to java han have further suggestion to offer suppose must live in forest for time will said read book called robinson crusoe sailor there lived on desert island for year then have gun sort of thing there be plenty of bird even if must make bow arrow suppose must be month before must shoot straight enough to hit several day passed lad found plenty of fruit season be advancing will said one day to han what on earth be to do when fruit biscuit be finished wandering in wood found body of whole of companion be malay having carried off coveted trophy did not attempt to bury body for in such climate decomposition set in rapidly swarm of insect complete work in grass near hut found one treasure mate ax have evidently fallen from belt in flight have be overlooked by malay tell what han will said one day fruit be getting scarcer scarcer there be not more than five six pound of biscuit left vote that make through forest into interior of island there must be village scattered about if enter one boldly may not kill know whether have respect for law of hospitality a savage have even if did kill be better than being starved to death here be chance anyhow what do say han zay noding han answered have obinion at if dink zat be ze best plan let do so saying han collected biscuit tied up in handkerchief be ready to start at once there be hurry han will said laughing still if be to make start may a well go at once turning back upon sea struck into wood have never before gone farther than mile from shore after hour walking found that character of forest be changing ground rose rapidly thick tangled undergrowth disappeared be able to walk briskly forward under shade of large tree hill became steeper steeper a advanced will knew that be ascending hill that have seen from ship when be coming towards shore three hour after leaving coast be upon top ground be rocky here in place bare of tree inland saw hill rising behind hill knew that island must be large one illustration will han in search of shelter look han there be smoke curling up at foot of hill over there see be very faint be certainly smoke there must be house there most likely village come on will get there before sun set think can be more than mile half away han a usual assented in about hour arrived at malay village aspect be curious hut being built in tree at point where lower branch started platform be made tree above be cut down on platform hut be erected access being obtained to by ladder several of inhabitant be walking about upon seeing lad uttered cry of warning instantly flying to ladder be constructed of light bamboo climbed to hut raised ladder after then at door men appeared with bent bow pointed arrow threatening invader will have cut green bough waved a token of peace while han threw up hand to

supplied with food be constantly surrounded by little group of woman child to whom white skin appeared source of constant wonder movement be entirely unchecked be evidently considered in light of guest rather than prisoner next night village retired to rest early boy sat talking together for long time then lay down to sleep presently will thought that heard noise looking up saw in moonlight number of savage stealthily approaching carried with ladder intended have doubt to surprise sleeping villager be already close at hand will shook han who have already gone off to sleep pointed out to advancing foe be already in village separating fixed ladder against of hut so far boy who lay in shadow of hut have not be noticed malay who belonged to hostile village began to climb ladder when lad grasping heavy stick always carried springing to foot with loud shout ran to ladder before malay must recover from astonishment at approach of white faced men rushing upon dozen of ladder be upset men who have mounted coming heavily to ground of a rose at once took to heel others drawing kris rushed at assailant lad be no longer alone at first shout door of hut have opened inhabitant rushed out with arm remaining ladder be instantly overthrown shower of arrow poured upon assailant will han knocked down foremost of assailant whole body foiled in attempted surprise discomfited at appearance of strange white faced men exposed to arrow of defender at once darted away several of number having already fallen under shaft from above with exulting warrior of village poured down ladder from hut took up pursuit soon one remained in village save white lad woman child towards morning warrior returned several of bringing with gory head showing that pursuit have not be in vain village be now scene of great rejoicing huge fire be lighted feast held in honor of victory chief solemnly placed white men one on side of made speech in by bowing placing hand on head judged be thanking for having preserved village from massacre indeed be clear from respectful manner of towards that be regarded in light of genius who have come specially to protect village from assault of enemy after feast be over chief after consultation with rest pointed to tree close to in own hut be situated whole village set to work ladder be fixed against men ascending hacked away with kris stone hatchet at trunk han seeing object made sign to chief to lend ax ascending to tree set to work with doing in five minute more work than whole of native employed must have accomplished in hour after working for time handed ax to one of native who continued work tree be not large one trunk at point being about inch in diameter hour work sufficed to cut through upper part of tree fell with crash in meantime woman have brought in from forest quantity of bamboo with men set to work speedily formed platform upon hut be erected roof side being covered with palm leaf laid closely together forming roof impervious to rain two large bundle of fern for bed be then taken up chief ascending solemnly invited boy to come up take possession woman be told off to prepare food for attend to want by lad found in comfortable abode of own pulling up ladder after manner of native sat down to chat over altered prospect be now clearly regarded a adopted into village community need have further fear a to personal security mean of living for time be safe will said a want to turn malay live life with other amusement than keeping own head on hunting for of enemy of village must think of making escape somehow though at present own see how chapter attack on village day two later malay ran at full speed into village said few word caused perfect hubbub of excitement men shouted woman screamed running up ladder to tree abode began gathering together various article of value in eye chief came up to boy by sign intimated that large number of hostile native belonging to several village be advancing to attack that must fly into interior be very unwelcome news for lad once removed from sea tribe might not improbably take up abode there a must fear to return to neighborhood of enemy must be fatal to chance of lad being taken off by passing ship after few word together determined to oppose movement will in loud voice with threatening gesture intimated that disapproved of plan that companion must assist in defending village malay paused in preparation faith in white visitor be very great after few minute talk among intimated to boy that must obey order will at once signed to few men to stand a guard round village to warn of approaching enemy then set whole of rest of population to work cutting sharp pointed pole bough thorny bush with circle be made around tree upon village be built fortunately hostile malay have halted in forest two three mile away intending to make attack by night a news of coming have arrived at noon villager have before ceased work late in evening erected formidable hedge round village of woman have be set to work manufacturing number of torch similar to used by for lighting dwelling much larger be formed of stringy bark of tree dipped in resinous juice obtained from will have one of fastened to of tree nearest to hedge be fixed to trunk on outside so flame must throw light on whole circle beyond hedge while within must be shadow darkness be very late before preparation be completed will then placed few men a outpost hundred yard in forest in direction from enemy be likely to approach be ordered to give alarm moment heard noise be then to run in enter circle by small gap have be left in abbatis for purpose many of men then took post with bow arrow in tree near hedge others remained on ground ready to rush to point assailed for several hour sound save call of night bird occasional distant howl of beast of prey be heard in forest be not until within hour of morning hour generally selected by malay for attack a men sleep at time heaviest that loud yell at one of outpost told that enemy be close at hand two three minute later scout ran in gap through have entered be at once filled up with bush have be piled close at hand for purpose aware that approach be discovered enemy abandoned further concealment advanced with wild yell intending to strike terror into defender of village a advanced torch be lighted a assailant came within circle of light shower of arrow from malay on ground in tree above be poured into yell scream told that volley have be successful one discharging arrow in turn malay with demoniac yell rushed against village advance however be arrested suddenly when arrived at abbatis from behind shelter so deadly rain of arrow be poured in soon shrank back bounded away beyond circle of light while taunting shout rose from defender for time contented by distant shouting then with wild yell charged forward again several dropped from fire of arrow from in tree behind abbatis discharging arrow in return assailant kept on until again reached impediment here strove furiously to break through hacking with kris endeavoring to pull up stake with hand defender in shade behind sent arrow so fast thick that assailant again shrank back darted away to shelter throughout night there be renewal of attack in morning not foe be visible two three scout went out to reconnoiter sooner did enter forest than one of be shot down rest sent flying back believe scoundrel be going to try to starve out will said let speak to chief ask how much provision have got after much pantomime will succeeded in conveying meaning to chief latter at once ordered inhabitant to produce stock of food be unexpectedly large will thought that there be sufficient for fortnight consumption now made sign of drinking reply to be disheartening in extreme few gourd full of water be brought forward two three of close woven basket in water be often carried in country there be in fact scarce enough to last defender for day stream from village drew supply of water be about couple of hundred yard away consequently villager fetched up water a needed one thought of keeping store will looked in dismay at smallness of supply if really intend to starve out han be done for doubt reckon on water falling short must know that be not likely that there must be supply here native be not slow to recognize weak point of defense one two of men taking water basket be about to go to stream will made sign to chief that must not do only hope be that enemy must draw off if saw that water be already short must be encouraged to continue to beleaguer place will be unable to explain reason to chief latter seeing how great be advantage that have already gained by following counsel of white visitor in matter of hedge acquiesced at once in wish will then ascended to one of hut carefully reconnoitered whole ground there be saw at end farthest from stream slight dip in land extending into forest beckoning chief to join made sign at night warrior must issue silently from village at point make noiselessly through wood must then take wide circuit till came upon stream must then working up fall upon enemy in rear chief be dubious will made imperative gesture chief in humble manner agreed to do a be ordered day passed slowly before supply of water be entirely finished once twice scout have gone out to see if enemy be still round village returned time with news that be there last time just before nightfall will directed two three of to take water bucket to go in direction of stream signing to however to return moment saw sign of enemy be soon back a will have expected sight of water bucket showed enemy that garrison of village be badly supplied in respect taunting shout arose from wood asking why did not go down to drink will felt certain that malay must now draw greater part of number down to side of stream that there must therefore be more chance of garrison making way out at other end of village three hour after be dark chief mustered men be about five forty in will signed that must take with water basket large gourd so that in case failed in defeating enemy breaking up blockade might at least be able to bring supply of water into village will then with much difficulty explained to chief that old men boy woman remaining in village be moment heard sound of attack upon enemy rear to shout yell loudest to shoot arrow in direction of enemy few stick have already be pulled up at point of hedge through will intended to make sally band now passed noiselessly out chief led way white boy following behind lying upon stomach crawled noiselessly along down little depression in ten minute be well in wood without having met with enemy although have several time heard voice among tree near now rose to foot making wide detour came down after quarter of hour walk upon stream here gourd basket be filled then keeping along by waterside continued march presently saw number of fire round many malay be sitting crept noiselessly up until within few yard then with yell burst upon enemy number be cut down at once rest appalled by attack on rear supposing that inhabitant of other village must have arrived to assistance of be besieging at once fled in direction remaining in village have seconded attack by wild shout so loud continuous that besieger have reason to suppose that number have be weakened for few minute pursuit be kept up then chief recalled follower with shout water basket many of have be thrown down in attack be refilled party made way up to village where be received with shout of triumph panic of malay have be in slight degree caused by appearance of two boy who have purposely stripped to waist have shouted at top of voice a waving kris have borrowed fell upon foe idea that white devil be leagued with enemy against have excited superstitious fear of malay to utmost when in morning scout again sallied from village found that enemy have entirely gone fact that have not even returned to carry off effect have be abandoned in first panic showing that have continued flight without stopping to distant village chief like able politician took advantage of impression white visitor have created same day sent off messenger to village have combined in attack against saying that white men guest be very angry that unless peace be made solemn promise given that there must be renewal of late attempt be going to lay dreadful spell upon village woman child must be seized by disease right arm of warrior wither up terrible threat carried consternation into malay village woman burst into prolonged wailing bravest of men trembled messenger said that white men have consented to abstain from using magical power until following day that only chance to propitiate be for deputation from village to come in early next morning with promise of peace offering for offended white men be not for time afterwards that lad learned enough of language to understand what have be done guessed from exultation of chief sign made that late enemy must shortly come in in attitude of humiliation that have in way succeeded in establishing scare among on following morning deputation consisting of six warrior woman bearing tray with fruit bird other offering arrived at village men be unarmed at approach chief made sign to boy to take seat at foot of principal tree then accompanied by leading warrior led deputation with much ceremony before woman placed tray at foot men addressed in long speech with many sign of submission boy played part well a soon a saw what be required of signified with air of much dignity that accepted offering then went through ceremony of shaking hand solemnly with of warrior then made speech in with much gesticulation signified to visitor that terrible fate must befall must again venture to meddle with village much awed impressed malay withdrew boy made selection from basket of fruit for own eating then signified to chief that must divide rest among inhabitant of village when be done boy ascended to tree passed day there quietly villager indulging in feasting singing rejoicing over victory worst of be will said to han that more reverence more useful find more anxious will be to keep always with however there be one comfort be safe a long a choose to remain here be more than must have hoped for when first landed from wreck be curious that malay who have hesitation in attacking english ship murdering crew have yet sort of superstitious dread of suppose be something same way a be in england in day of persecution of old woman a witch believed that if left to must cast deadly spell yet have hesitation in putting to death suppose that be something of same feeling here chapter fight with prahus very frequently in day followed william gale friend han talked over possibility of effecting escape difficulty appeared almost invincible various village so far a boy must understand be scattered at distance apart have little dealing with other indeed be frequently engaged in feud particular people with whom lived have nothing whatever to do with sea used at least so boy understood by sign to fish at one time have be robbed of boat maltreated by of cruising tribe who lived in village on coast on creek river possibility of escape seemed small indeed to escape must get on board ship to do must first go out to sea must only be done in boat of own in one of piratical prahus latter course must not be thought of for coast pirate be bloodthirsty in extreme even must change residence to one of seaside village gain friendship of inhabitant must be nearer to end for a go out to attack not to trade with european ship there must be chance of escaping in way upon other hand might build boat of own considered improbable that malay must allow to depart for evidently regarded presence a prodigy revered a having miraculously arrived at moment when great danger threatened village even must be allowed to build boat depart knew not whither to go knew nothing of navigation be ignorant of geography of archipelago chance of striking upon one two spot where alone must land with safety be so small that must be madness to undertake voyage for six month lived quietly in malay village people instructed in use of blowgun in be wonderfully skilful being able to bring down bird sitting on lofty bough of tree with almost unerring accuracy also taught to shoot with bow arrow found that native used root of various kind of plant for food time did not pas unpleasantly have known that must last few month only must have enjoyed much at last after much deliberation determined that must a first step towards escape construct little boat under pretense of wanting to fish accordingly one day when out with chief two three of men in direction of sea pointed there signified that wished to go there for have picked up good many malay word chief shook head insisted in so authoritative manner that gave way followed when reached shore made sign that wanted to construct boat again chief shook head vehemently enforced meaning by pointing along shore going through action first of rowing then of fighting intimating that must certainly be killed if ventured out by fierce coast tribe boy nodded to show that understood what wished to say pointing to water few yard from shore went through action of fishing then burdening with imaginary fish pointed to village showed that must supply with food malay talked for time among have so vast respect for white men that did not like to thwart wish thought too of supply of fish of have be long deprived owing to feud with of coast village also operated strongly in favor of yielding assent at last chief made sign that agreed pointing to village intimated that assistance must be given in building boat next day accordingly ten twelve men came down to shore with tree be felled end be pointed whole formed roughly into shape of canoe fire be lighted on top by dint of flame ax hollow be dug out operation lasted three day men having brought provision with so a to avoid making journey two half hour long to from village day boat when finished be rough construction must have excited mockery of of coast villager a be expert boat builder still be amply sufficient for purpose for be intended namely for fishing inside line of reef be heavy paddled slowly lad have strong suspicion that malay have purposely made more clumsy unseaworthy than need be in order that must have temptation to attempt distant journey in there be difficulty about line malay being skilled in making string rope from fiber of tree hook be more difficult upon searching very carefully along shore lad found fragment of one of ship boat in be several copper nail hammered bent must serve purpose well line be ready on day canoe be finished a soon a be launched chief one of other malay boy took seat in native paddled out nearly to edge of reef four line baited with piece of raw bird flesh be thrown overboard few minute passed rather anxiously for lad who be most desirous that fishing must be successful so a to afford excuse for frequently pursuing then there be bite han who held line found that taxed strength to haul in fish tugged strained upon when be got into boat proved to be fourteen pound in weight by time two of other bait have be taken in le than hour have caught upwards of thirty fish most of of considerable size native be delighted paddling to shore burden be distributed among whole party with exception of chief two white before starting young tree be cut down chopped into length of few foot on roller canoe be hauled high up beach then party set out for village where arrival with so large supply of food occasioned great rejoicing after boy went down regularly day to fish at first three four of native always accompanied under pretense of carrying back fish really a thought to keep watch over to lessen host suspicion sometimes one other stayed in village a time went on suspicion of malay abated number of guard be lessened finally a men disliked so long tramp of boy be told off to accompany white men assist in bringing back fish be in habit of starting soon after daybreak of not returning till late in evening accounting for long absence by pointing to sun fishing be always performed immediately reached coast when have caught a many a boy must carry be placed in large covered basket be sunk in water close to shore to keep fish in good condition until started then must paddle about within reef during extreme heat of day lie in boat shaded by bunch of palm leaf malay boy who be set on shore after fishing be left alone amused by bathing passed time asleep under tree after first day two have struck boy that be dangerous to leave canoe high on sand a must be observed even at distance by passing prahu consequently deep trench have be dug from sea far enough up to allow canoe when floating in to lie below level of beach before leaving be day roughly covered with seaweed might therefore escape observation by craft passing at short distance from shore in expedition along reef boy discovered passage through be of about double width of ship of amply sufficient depth to allow vessel of size to cross at other point for distance of mile two way be extent of excursion reef came very near to surface jagged point for most part showing above several month passed still sail promised hope of deliverance have shown over surface of sea scarce day passed without seeing malay prahus passing up down coast always kept distance out caused uneasiness to fisherman have during time completed hollowing out of boat until side be extremely thin be so light that must be paddled at high rate of speed be now expert with paddle felt that if in light wind vessel must be seen off coast must be enabled to row out reach might be knew month even year before such ship must be seen still a there be many vessel trading among island at moment occurrence might arise one afternoon have be dozing under leafy shade when will who first awoke sat up uttered cry almost abreast of quarter of mile outside reef be large brig wind be light with stitch of canvas set be making slow progress through water han leaped up echoed cry seizing paddle rowed with strength away to opening through reef passed through headed for ship now saw what have not at first observed at distance of three mile astern be five large prahus with sail set bank of oar rising falling rapidly brig be chased by pirate boy rested on paddle for moment be more than match for be afraid will said what do say han will go on not han made reply be never quick at coming to decision have better go will went on can see whether mean to fight not boy be naked to waist for thorn of forest have long since torn in piece shirt have on when landed from wreck skin be bronzed to deep copper color still differed in hue from native of island men on board brig regarded with surprise a approached throw rope will shouted a neared there be cry of surprise from crew at being addressed in english rope be thrown boy soon sprang on board saw at once that ship be english one hallo where do spring from asked captain be shipwrecked here ten month ago will said have be living with native at other time must have be glad to see captain said just at present if will take advice will get into canoe row on shore again a see pointed to prahus be chased although mean to fight to last for there be mercy to be expected from bloodthirsty scoundrel fear chance be small will looked round saw that six cannon brig carried for vessel trading in eastern archipelago be always armed have already be loosened ready for action that group of men be at work mounting long gun have just be raised from hold knowing number of men that prahus carried will felt that chance of successful resistance be slight there be about eighteen men on deck number larger than brig must carry in other sea necessary in so dangerous trading ground a prahus however must carry from eighty to one hundred men attacking at once from opposite side must be likely to bear down opposition suddenly idea occurred to look sir there be passage through reef there with plenty of water width enough for ship can take through there be other passage for distance if take inside lay across channel prahus can only attack on one side can place gun strength there captain at once saw advantage of scheme capital exclaimed take helm at once lad ease off sheet men be now nearly opposite entrance light wind be blowing towards shore captain ordered hand to reduce sail only keeping on enough to give vessel steerage way two boat be lowered anchor cable passed into a brig passed through opening rest of sail be lowered boat rowed to reef one on side anchor be firmly fixed into rock one being taken from head other from stern crew set to work at capstan speedily have vessel safely moored broadside on across entrance to reef malay boat be now about mile astern have ceased rowing when saw vessel headed for land supposing that captain be about to run on shore when to astonishment saw pas reef with safety again set to at work gun be now all brought over to side facing entrance be loaded to muzzle with bullet number of shot belonging to long gun be placed by bulwark in readiness to hurl down into prahus must get alongside sailor though determined to fight till last have when boy came on board be making preparation with silence of despair be now in high spirit for felt that must beat off attempt of enemy to attack when malay be abreast of ship ceased rowing drew close together evidently held consultation brig at once opened fire with long gun first shot hulled one of prahus close to water edge be right tom captain said stick to same craft if can sink there be one le several more shot be fired with such effect that malay be observed jumping overboard in great number swimming towards other boat own being in sinking condition other four prahus at once turned head towards shore rowed with full speed towards ship knew that entrance of whose existence have be previously unaware be exceedingly narrow one a neared shore must see by line of breaking surf that must at most be wide enough for one to pas at time accordingly one drew ahead discharging cannon carried in bow rowed at full speed for entrance following so close behind bow almost touched stern train gun to bear on center of channel captain said three bow gun take first boat other three second do tom work away at two behind prahus came along at great rate sweep churning up water into foam leading boat dashed through channel sweep grating on rock on side bow be two yard distant from side of ship when captain gave word three cannon poured content into sweeping crowded deck tearing out bottom great a be speed sank below water just a bow touched side of ship ten second later command be again given broadside a destructive be poured into second boat damage done be somewhat le bow reached side of ship dozen malay sprang on board a boat sank under foot sailor be ready with musket pistol cutlas fell upon either cut down drove overboard sea around be covered with swimmer ship be too high out of water for to attempt to board malay at once struck out for shore sailor keeping up musketry fire upon until out of range other two boat have not followed mate have plumped shot from long gun full into bow of first seeing destruction have fallen upon leader turned head made for sea mate continuing fire until be out of range one shot carrying away greater part of oar on one side of boat previously struck when at distance of upwards of mile ceased rowing for time lay close together men of injured boat be observed to be stopping yawning hole in bow few inch above water level other started off at full speed up coast be now evening there be scarcely breath of wind men crowded round lad thanked warmly for having be mean of saving from destruction be afraid be not out of danger yet will said a captain shook by hand doubt that boat have gone off with news before morning will have dozen fresh enemy coming down inside reef to attack if have breath of wind might do captain said fear will have none before morning then generally blow fresh for two three hour know how far be to village be headquarters of pirate a far a must make out from malay with whom have be living be about six hour walking boat will row twice a fast a man must walk through forest in case may be attacked at two three o'clock in morning wo get breeze till after sunrise be there other channel through reef captain asked know will replied have never explored very far way a must think from action of malay that did not know of might not know of other did exist then captain said will warp brig out through channel again anchor stem stern across outside will find a hard to attack there a did before then when breeze come will slip cable run for be fast sailer can think get away from pirate even with sail oar besides by shifting long gun two of others to stern can give so hot that even if be fastest may sicken know sir will said must be likely to hang about until breeze drop then to attack on side at once if must keep from coming through channel in pursuit must be safe ah how on earth be to do that captain asked william gale be silent for minute two have plenty of powder on board ship sir plenty use for barter seems to will went on if before sailing must sink couple of barrel of powder in channel with fuse to explode few minute after have left malay must be so astonished at explosion that must not venture to pas through idea be capital one captain said warmly how about fuse must burn under water what do think tom must be managed must think so sir mate answered suppose take one of empty gallon beer cask fill up with powder will hold ten twelve of little barrel then might bung up make hole in head over hole might fix wine bottle with bottom knocked out so fastened with tow oakum that water wo get in then might shove down through mouth of bottle through hole below into powder long strip of paper dipped in saltpetre to make touch paper of know a regular fuse must do a might go out for want of air there must be plenty to keep touch paper alight must sling three four pounder shot under bottom of cask to make sink upright just before slip cable might lower down with boat lighting fuse last thing sticking in cork if put too much saltpetre might burn for minute before reached powder be worth trying at rate captain said fear must not burn long enough think that instead of bottle might jam piece of iron tube six eight foot long into head of cask cut bung to fit in way must get good length of fuse plan be carried out large cask be filled with powder iron tube three inch in diameter six foot long fitted into made water tight long strip of paper after being dipped in water in gunpowder have be dissolved be then dried rolled tight lowered down tube until touched powder bung be cut to fit top of tube piece of wash leather being placed over to ensure being perfectly water tight top of fuse be then cut level with pipe several bit of iron be lashed to lower end of cask to make sink upright cask be steadily lowered into boat lying alongside ship in readiness for use sailor entered into preparation with glee of schoolboy machine be not ready until long after ship have be towed out again through channel moored broadside to just outside chapter torpedo be about two o'clock in morning when watch awoke crew with news that must hear distant sound of oar coming along shore took place in silence after time rowing ceased be quiet again hour passed then there be slight sound close alongside in channel must dimly make out small boat be rapidly rowed away into darkness again several musket shot being fired after have sent on ahead to find if be lying in same berth captain said expect will be puzzled when hear that be outside that entrance be guarded must not be surprised if did not attack before morning have lesson yesterday that think will try to force channel in teeth again will play waiting game sure that will secure sooner later so turned out hour passed slowly on sound be heard then in dim morning light pirate fleet of eight prahus be seen lying at distance of mile within reef a day broke breeze sprang up sail be hoisted captain prepared to slip cable similar preparation must through glass be observed on board malay fleet will do very well captain said fellow will be along in about eight ten minute after have started fuse according to experiment made a to rate of burning will last about seven now quick lad into boat tom take charge of sinking in minute boat be rowed to channel cask lowered over side be held there for minute while mate struck light applied to touch paper then pressed bung firmly into top of tube lashing of cask be cut boat rowed back to ship anchor be already on board brig be getting way on a boat rowed alongside men jumped on board boat be suffered to tow behind while hand set whole of sail vessel be soon running briskly before land breeze pirate fleet be instantly in motion eye in ship be directed towards will be there in le than ten minute from moment lowered cask mate said looking at watch not much captain said be rowing fast now tree keep off wind sail help be minute two behind in starting be just eight minute from time when cask have be lowered that first of malay boat rowed out through channel hope nothing have gone wrong mate growled be not afraid of though may be wrong minute two a to length of fuse boat followed first third be in mid channel when suddenly seemed to rise bodily in air then to fall into piece mighty column of water hundred foot high rose into air mingled with fragment of wood human body deep low report be heard brig shook a if have come into collision with floating body although be nearly mile away yell of astonishment fright of malay reached ship prahus still inside reef be seen to turn round row away along coast at top of speed while have passed channel after rowing wildly for distance lay on oar crew apparently stupefied at what have taken place craft have be injured day before still lay seaward on watch now turned head rowed towards shore to join consort sea belle left coast malay attempted pursuit so long a must be seen remained inactive near scene of sudden to

rumor came that twelve gun be stuck in ravine at foot of khotal pas with small force of cavalry at command general must hing so returned to khuram determined to hurry up troop faster than have intended so a to capture gun reported a be afterwards proved falsely to have be left behind by afghan sick superfluous baggage be left behind at khuram on th troop moved at daybreak two brigade marching in parallel column cold be now severe at night although be hot in daytime have be intended to halt at halid kitta four mile from khotal intelligence arriving that ameer troop have abandoned

follow up closely body of retreating afghan troop that might come across light brigade be to march up regular road to peiwar thus supporting attack of left brigade left brigade followed out order except that regiment in support did not go round southern side of spur kept to north enemy be seen on south side of spur so when track leading across to turrai be reached troop moved down towards village regiment in support advancing at foot of open on north side mountain path that advanced troop be now filing down did not lead directly to village fell into valley ahead of at point where widens out into what be known a punch bowl valley at foot of peiwar khotal a soon a head of column reached spot came in sight of afghan who showed in great number on crest of mountain far above head a troop have order to attack so formidable position fell back towards turrai be about quarter of mile to rear at sight of movement afghan swarmed down spur of hill commenced attack on regiment be moving towards village th punjaubees climbed hill sharp skirmish ensued two mounted gun coming into action while be going on main body of troop arrived at turrai advanced troop be recalled th ghoorkas be advanced to cover movement a be now seen that story of abandonment of gun be false order be given to pile arm in village to encamp there step be imprudent one a afghan speedily showed while men be sitting lying upon ground waiting for baggage to arrive afghan brought up mountain gun from main ridge about three quarter of mile distant to point of spur overlooking village of turrai opened fire at yard range astonishment of troop when first shell fell among be great one jumped to foot seized rifle gun of royal horse artillery be brought at once into action be four o'clock in afternoon when afghan opened fire have waited for few hour brought up gun two made night attack immediately after opening fire be morally certain that imprudence of camping in position must have be punished by disaster might have vied with of isandula huddled together in small village surrounded by scrub impeded a troop must have be by baggage animal native follower rushing in terror in direction men must have be taken at immense disadvantage fortunate be that enemy opened fire before darkness set in troop be at once ordered to fall back mile half to pitch on fresh ground there be much confusion in retreat a road in rear be crowded with baggage animal spot chosen for camp be rough one for ground be covered with scrub scattered growth of hill oak thorny bush be broken by remains of ancient terrace a jungle broken ground extended for three half mile there be nothing for to take up best position possible under circumstance troop bivouacked on ridge of ravine with steep bank formed line of defense in front of camp while view in other direction be obscured by tree regiment passed wretched night on rough ground most of be unable to find baggage be wandering in scrub in dark greater part of troop lay down on bare ground went supperless to sleep after fatiguing march of twenty one mile in morning men cattle be greatly exhausted by long march almost sleepless night general robert determined to wait for day two to reconnoiter formidable position of enemy before undertaking attack camp be shifted to more secure site brushwood tree be cleared away tent pitched troop be again comfortable reconnaissance be made by colonel perkins commanding royal engineer with two company of pioneer ascertained that deep ravine lay between ridge on be encamped khotal that be impossible to direct attack on side major collett also with two company of rd proceeded to reconnoiter route known a spingawi cow pas instead of going straight up hill in front wound round foot to right of valley ascending mountain at point three four mile to east of peiwar khotal reconnaissance reached summit of ridge about five mile distant from camp overlooking spingawi khotal be ascertained that road up pas seemed easy practicable for arm that top of pas appeared to be on same ridge a peiwar khotal that force working from towards peiwar must pas over series of dominating position did not appear to major collett that enemy held peiwar khotal in force although there be gun on commanding knoll on south there seemed to be one at top of pas road from village of peiwar to top of spingawi pas seemed perfectly easy for troop of arm next two day be spent in clearing camp so far a possible improving military position be still surrounded by thick oak jungle must have afforded cover for enemy making sudden attack further reconnaissance be made of spingawi pas a examination confirmed major collett report be determined to attack by order be issued on st of december for march night regiment be to form main attack by spingawi plateau route be th punjaub infantry th ghoorkas commanded by colonel gordon in advance be to be followed by mountain battery wing of nd highlander company of ranger nd

khotal be intended party of pioneer with engineer officer covering party of th regiment be to construct battery near village of turrai frequent reconnoitering party have also be sent out in direction so well be secret of general intention to attack by spingawi khotal kept that everyone in camp who have not be let into secret be confident that peiwar khotal must be stormed on morrow enemy although in camp be ignorant of fact be reinforced on st by four regiment of infantry with mountain battery on side be meditating attack upon british camp regiment have freshly arrived be however fatigued by long march assault on camp be postponed until next day chance of coming off be therefore lost for ever to william gale great satisfaction company of ranger to have be posted be one selected by colonel to accompany column marching up pas did not indeed know that be route by be to advance be pleased at not being left behind with regiment in charge of camp well young 'un corporal said to that evening be going to be under fire at last nice climb will have of put one out of breath to look at steep road running up hill when come to fighting one way up with cannon afghan on top will find hard work expect william answered that sha' go up at extraordinary pace if skirmish up a expect will from rock to rock will have plenty of time to get wind at halt be not to take knapsack so will fight light have not much extra weight to carry what with heat what with long march must think must have lost stone in weight since landed in calcutta think have lost weight at corporal said seems to that have grown widened out in two month only yesterday when be sizing company have to move two men higher for young stand fatigue well be right will said except have got frightful blister on foot be not going to say anything about because must have be kept in hospital left behind at khuram have hardly known how to march last few day think must possibly have managed if have not adopted native dodge of wearing putty have greased well on inside wear instead of stocking putty may be said be slip of woolen cloth about two half yard long three inch wide with tape sewn into one end be wound round round leg from ankle to below knee secured by end being tied with tape nearly one officer men wore through campaign for long march there must be doubt that bandage wound round foot instead of stocking be very preferable a obviate liability to foot sore even with well made boot pedestrian may at time suffer from sore foot liability be immensely increased when a in case of british soldier boot be coarse roughly sewn frequently ill fitted chapter peiwar khotal at ten o'clock at night on st of december troop detailed for attack mustered in camp assembly took place without sound of bugle even necessary word of command be given in low tone through still night air afghan on hill little more than two mile away must have heard stir be very dark night although star shone clear where can be going william gale asked soldier next to be going right away from pas instead of towards so be soldier replied be blest if know what be up to be so precious dark can scarcely see file before hope ai going to fight in dark anyhow what must be good of being marksman when can not see end of own rifle let alone man be firing at oh ca be going to attack in dark will said expect have got long march before be going to work round somehow take in rear well hope whoever be acting a guide can see better in darkness than can else be safe to lose way may find anywhere in morning confound exclamation be elicited by speaker stumbling over boulder nearly going on to head silence in rank there officer said close by regiment be followed by ammunition mule hospital doolies latter being covered stretcher palkies carried by native besides be dandy chair slung upon mule greatly added to difficulty of night march for even in daytime presence of baggage animal in column upon narrow road greatly hinders troop at night delay occasioned by be naturally very much greater for first three half mile column marched away from enemy upon khotal surprise of soldier increased at step took at end of time arrived at village of peiwar here turned to left after crossing several ravine stony water course arrived on cultivated terrace kept along till reached very stiff nullah twenty foot deep night be bitterly cold bank of nullah be extremely slippery boulder in water course below coated with ice difficulty of getting loaded animal across in darkness be therefore very great passage of various water course caused great delay be difficult to keep column together in dark at passage rear be immensely delayed while leading troop be passing again have to be halted while behind struggled over difficulty men suffered much from cold a pace be so slow that must not warm mounted officer specially suffered in hand foot at midnight ravine leading up to spingawi pas be reached so dark be that nd punjaubees separated by few yard from regiment in front of marched straight on instead of turning up nd pioneer four artillery gun carried on elephant being behind naturally went astray also brigadier general thelwall who commanded column be at head of brigade be for time unaware of absence of two of regiment after halting finding that did not come up sent back mounted officer who after two mile ride came up with missing troop guided back to point where have left route from foot of ravine to top of pas be six mile in distance dark a be in open be still more so in ravine shadowed by steep hill on side a ascent continued road became worse boulder being larger hole dried up pool deeper darkness prevailing white color of stone prevented difference of level being observed many of men have heavy fall a steep side of pool be often from two to four foot deep after marching for mile half up ravine report of rifle be heard in rank of th punjaubees who be leading column followed instantly by discharge colonel gordon commanding regiment halted general tried in vain to discover who have fired one must must identify seemed clearly to prove that rifle have be fired a signal to enemy for have not be loaded before column started punjaubee regiment contained many hill tribesman men closely connected by tie of blood religion with enemy whom be marching to attack non commissioned officer several of men who be just about spot where gun have be fired be placed under arrest sent back be afterwards found that two of rifle have be discharged men who fired non commissioned officer be tried by court martial for treachery be hung after men have be sent back th ghoorkas company of ranger two company of nd passed rd punjaubees took place at head of column in course of march good many other men of rd left column in dark made way back to camp turned out afterwards that afghan sentry at top of pas heard report woke up commander of post who hearing further cause of alarm took action in matter have traitor waited until column be within mile of top of pas afghan must assuredly have taken alarm firing at distance of four half mile failed in desired effect advance be resumed up bed of stream for mile half about three in morning main water course be quitted road now entering ravine to left up three mile further on be summit of pas column continued weary way up ravine slowly stumbling along in dark one incident occurred in part of road showing necessity in night marching for regiment to keep close to other in one place fir covered island lay in middle of ravine torrent bed lying on side of when two company of nd highlander who have be following close to of ranger came to spot be surprised to find that troop in front have suddenly vanished explanation must be given a to cause of disappearance so company be halted until mystery be solved leading regiment have taken passage to right of island while nd have gone to left separation of road being unnoticed in dark have road diverged instead of reuniting much inconvenience might have be caused by delay in collecting separated portion of force at last foot of khotal be reached where track left ravine turned up spur two guide native of country who have led head of column to point refused to go further a column be now at point where fighting might begin be allowed to depart be about six o'clock when ghoorkas began to climb spur morning have broken be still dark path be almost invisible in shadow of tree ghoorkas rifle loaded now made way quietly up hill presently challenge of sentry be heard followed by two shot be relief to men after ten hour of weary stumbling along in cold darkness to know that be at length face to face with foe cold fatigue be at once forgotten with eye strained through darkness rifle ready for use man pressed forward fifty yard up hill behind sentry who have fired be first stockade of enemy formed by several large tree have be felled so a to completely block up road presenting obstacle of about eight foot high to attacking force afghan picket lining stockade poured volley into ghoorkas who led by major fitzhugh captain cook made rush at place for few minute there be fierce fight at tree a fresh assailant momentarily poured up obstruction be scaled afghan retired on second stockade eighty yard back here stand be made spur being little wider ghoorkas be able to work round taking defense in flank soon drove afghan back beyond point ground be clear of tree road ran in short zigzag up steep hill to breastwork lined edge of top zigzag mountain gun at point swept approach to position while hill at back be now covered with afghan who opened heavy fire upon troop a in dim morning light issued from tree by time that ghoorkas ranger have cleared second stockade wing of nd highlander ascending by right flank have made way up to front whole now advanced together a quickly a possible pushed up hill under heavy fire of enemy latter fought well number of be killed before retiring at defense erected at top of zigzag so obstinately did afghan in front hold ground that comrade behind be enabled to remove mountain gun to right of enemy position be knoll nd at once took possession of two mountain gun be brought up to assistance afghan be seen in great number in broken ground ahead ghoorkas little body of ranger pushed on against presently enemy gathered made rush down upon desperate hand to hand fight took place for few minute men be scattered among tree fought for william gale have just reloaded rifle when saw captain herbert who commanded company fall to ground three afghan spring forward to finish with bound will reached side of officer two of afghan have already discharged piece third leveled fired so close be that flash almost burnt soldier face felt sharp pain a if hot iron have passed across cheek in instant shot assailant dead then with bayonet stood at bay a other two afghan rushed upon illustration captain herbert saved have drawn tulwars slashed fiercely at kept off with bayonet until ghoorka running up cut down one of with kookerie heavy sword like knife ghoorkas carry always employ in preference to bayonet in fighting at close quarter remaining afghan at once took to flight th punjaubees have now come into action afghan disheartened at loss of position fell back withdrew into wood cover plateau at half past seven o'clock whole force except elephant gun have reached plateau general robert be able to flash news of successful capture of enemy first position to brigadier general cobbe who be in command of force be to operate direct against peiwar khotal rest be given troop after long march at half past nine again fell in for attack upon pine covered slope in direction of peiwar khotal how strong be enemy who might be lurking there knew not be certain that must fight obstinately in so dense forest much of advantage gained by drill discipline be lost change be made in order of advance troop who have before led advance have done fighting be now placed in rear rd pioneer led way followed by nd th punjaubees column crossed plateau without opposition began ascent towards enemy position in wood considerable caution be needed a one have knowledge of country be ignorant of position number of enemy who might for aught knew be massing in great number for attack upon front one of flank line of skirmisher entered pine wood near rocky hillside rolling fire of musketry soon told that be engaged from end to end of line be slow work for fallen tree rock bush everywhere hampered advance still skirmishing line reinforced from behind pushed forward steadily presently cleared afghan off hillside when troop reached top found valley in front of from wood on opposite side so heavy musketry fire be kept up that be evident afghan intended to make desperate stand here valley rather ravine be narrow one fifty yard wide at foot scarce three time a much from brow to brow enemy hidden among tree must not be made out except by continual fire did not content however with mere defense of side of hill from time to time large number charged down tried to force way up held by british time however when attempted punjaubees drove back with slaughter be clear that afghan be in great number for line extended for mile half along hillside major anderson of rd pioneer after repulsing one of attack led four company to assault of afghan position drove enemy back for little distance major anderson fell party retired colonel curry who commanded regiment again led men forward for time hand to hand fight took place for two hour rifle contest continued without cessation storm of bullet be tremendous very great execution be done on side party lying behind shelter of tree so far advantage have be gained by british general robert felt that with force under command must be rash to attempt to carry so strong position held by greatly superior force in meantime attack upon peiwar khotal from valley have commenced before daylight brigadier general cobbe with th punjaub infantry th regiment left camp object being to cooperate with flank attack th regiment moved directly towards pas while th punjaubees climbed one of principal spur between peiwar spingawi khotals ascent be extremely difficult took troop six hour to reach summit during last portion of ascent came under fire of enemy when near summit major macqueen of th punjaubees saw through opening in pine wood afghan camp with baggage animal be placed for shelter in glade behind peiwar khotal two mountain gun be at once brought up fire opened upon afghan camp in few minute tent caught fire animal stampeded in direction enemy in front seized with panic began rapidly to retreat afghan troop facing general robert column when found comrade on right retreating began to draw off fire sensibly diminished movement be accelerated by four elephant gun have at length come up opening fire into pine wood forest a fire slackened reconnaissance of hill be made by general robert staff result showed that mountain be so covered with pine brushwood that formed almost impenetrable barrier to advance of troop for growth be so thick that be impossible to say in direction movement must be made experience gained in last six hour of hard fighting have shown how difficult be to keep command over troop scattered along front of mile long in forest where nothing must be seen beyond radius of few yard general therefore determined to desist from attempt to force way direct to top of peiwar khotal to march to left so by menacing afghan line of retreat to hasten movement towards rear have evidently begun men be therefore brought back to plateau to east of ravine here be halted for time content of haversack furnished with meal at two o'clock again drew up on spingawi plateau nd punjaub infantry being left on hill to oppose afghan must again advance in direction rest of column entered defile leading into hurriab valley far in rear of peiwar khotal a soon a enemy who be still opposing nd punjaub infantry saw head of column enter defile be seized with panic lest retreat must be cut off began to retreat with greatest haste a have to make way across two mountain ridge before must pas spot towards troop be moving advance of column however be necessarily slow a wood side valley have to be carefully examined lest flank attack must be made upon in two hour head of column emerged from forest on to open slope above highest cultivated point in hurriab valley be now four o'clock short december day be drawing to close enemy be in sight for line of retreat be hidden in bed of stream couple of mile further on one knew where be to be found troop be much exhausted with want of rest with heavy work for have now be marching fighting for eighteen hour be glad to receive order to bivouac although have tent food cold a might be expected on winter day at elevation of over foot above sea began to be very severe number of nearest tree be felled by

circumstance must have fallen back in good order force be amply sufficient to have swept aside little column barred retreat must have occupied fresh position farther to rear renewed conflict not so afghan capture of ali musjid brought with entire demoralization of afghan army few hour before have be fully confident in power to repulse attack might be made upon british continued advance passed

northern frontier contrasting energy enterprise of great northern power with inactivity may have supposed to prevail among men who governed became more more anxious asked english definitely to state whether must rely upon for assistance must be attacked by russian received reply from duke of argyle british minister for india of doubtful nature couched in term seem to have aroused resentment from moment there can be doubt that ameer course be decided upon be between hammer anvil a must obtain guarantee of assistance from england determined to throw into arm of russia letter be exchanged between general kaufmann russian viceroy in turkestan latter gave warmest promise of support if must ally with russia although have for year declined to accept british resident at cabul to allow

ministry at once sent to sheer ali to demand that must receive british resident be late in year ameer acting doubt on advice of russian friend sought to gain time by evasive answer british government who saw through ruse ordered envoy to advance with strong escort obliged ameer to come to final decision die be cast by escort being stopped by force on arrival at ali musjid there be doubt that ameer friend calculated that be already too late in season for english to gather sufficient force on frontier to force pass held by afghan army before snow promptness of action of english government valor of troop unusually late setting in of winter combined to overthrow ameer plan have campaign be delayed till spring there can be little doubt that british in advance must have found opposed if not by russian army at least by army led officered by russian with russian engineer artilleryman promptness of advance capture of pass dispersion of afghan army within week of opening of campaign altogether altered position sheer ali found king without army plain of cabul be thronged with panic stricken fugitive from khyber peiwar sheer ali started at night from capital with russian friend made for north

only by isolated attack upon individual soldier by fanatical ghazis when peace be concluded one of condition distinctly insisted upon by british general agreed to by ameer be that candahar must remain in possession alleged advantage thus gained territory thus acquired be afterwards abandoned by british government succeeding that have so vigorously carried out war occupation of candahar by british have be insisted on at first on ground that if russia must make advance against india british nation must have ample cause to rue cession of candahar for be declared that with city strongly fortified surrounded by outlying work british troop there must arrest progress of invading army however large until england have have full time to put forth strength to assemble army amply sufficient to secure safety of most valuable of possession empire of india be said that ally russia might have prepared for herself by intrigue among prince of india must not think of moving so long a knew that fortress of candahar remained a british bulwark against invading force be represented that so long a place held out england must be able to devote whole force towards repelling foreign invader instead of being obliged simultaneously to oppose to put down formidable rising in india be however not universal opinion that best policy of england be to occupy territory by armed force subsequent event with change

be forced to fall back be right lad major cavagnari said cheerfully to men can hold place for time ameer will bring cabul regiment down in time sweep away rascal afghan now thousand strong assisted by budmashes turbulent portion of population of cabul surrounded house on side kept up heavy incessant fire be coolly steadily returned by guide after hour fighting there be sudden roar above rattle of musketry followed by simultaneously came crash of shell one burst in house other tore through gate still there be sign of cabul regiment eight ten gun be brought to play on little garrison gate be broken down nearly force of house be already killed wounded by musketry shell fire still continued defense over over again afghan swarmed up close to gate only to fall back again before steady fire of snider rifle of guide major cavagnari went from room to room encouraging men while other officer will gale taking rifle have fallen from hand of men no longer able to use set example of cool steady firing to men for four hour unequal contest continued then cry arose from men that house be on fire be too true shell have exploded in lower part of house have ignited woodwork fire have already obtained so firm hold that be impossible to extinguish few of men continued fire from window to last while rest carried wounded comrade out into courtyard a flame shot out from lower window yell of afghan rose higher higher fearful storm of lead iron swept down upon little band who be now plainly visible in light of flame even now enemy did not dare although numbering hundred to one to come too close upon though flocked up close to gate now lad major cavagnari exclaimed let rush out die fighting hand to hand better than to be shot down defenseless here thus saying led way charged out upon crowded foe there be lieutenant hamilton eight men to follow rest have fallen doctor kelly have be shot in house while dressing wound of one of soldier mr jenkyns have fallen outside will gale have twice be wounded be still on foot grasping musket rushed forward with comrade figure sprang out just a reached gate with sudden rush carried along for pace then stumbled over fragment of wall fell just at corner of gate have swung inward when burst open by enemy shell confused bewildered struggled to regain foot keep quiet master yossouf voice said in ear be only chance of safety so saying dragged will into narrow space between gate wall then a rose to foot wrapped round loose afghan cloak pressed black sheepskin cap far down over face in minute there be sound of fierce struggle without shot of revolver of two english officer rang out in quick succession mingled with loud report of afghan musket savage yell rose high triumphant last of gallant band who have for hour defended embassy have fallen then there be rush through gate a afghan swarmed into courtyard till space around burning house be well nigh full unperceived will gale yossouf stepped from behind gate joined throng at once made way into stable where several of budmashes be already engaged in work of plunder yossouf caught up three four horse rug made into loose bundle signed to will to do same young soldier did so lifted on shoulder so a to partly hide face then followed into courtyard again already there be stream of men with saddle rug musket other plunder making way out while others be still thronging in joining former will guide be soon outside enclosure at other time disguise must have be noticed at once in crowd leg be hidden be too intent upon plunder too excited at success to notice once outside

leaped upon a now went on with guide have fear whatever of being detected still carried bundle of rug on shoulder a walked round towards lower gate of bala hissar met number of villager townspeople thronging in have waited to hear issue of attack before leaving home now that arrival of plunderer from residency cessation of fire told of successful termination of assault flocked up to join in rejoicing over annihilation of kaffir chapter advance upon cabul throughout long hour of night of nd of september while roll of musketry roar of cannon have gone on without moment pause just outside wall of palace yakoob khan have made movement to protect guest fulfil own solemn promise silent sullen have sat in council chamber disgrace of broken promise be not one weighs heavily upon afghan mind be not probable that thought of tarnished honor troubled in slightest degree knew that massacre be being perpetrated at door must be avenged that english troop have so easily beaten army father have spent so many year in preparing must be set in movement against cabul moment news reached india can not have dreaded consequence apparently feared even more to incur hostility of heratee regiment by interfering to save victim again again during night wisest councilors besought to call upon loyal cabullee regiment to act against heratees in vain be doubtful whether yakoob be previously informed of intended massacre there be strong reason to believe that be so proof however be not clear definite conduct cost throne condemned to remain to end of life dishonored pensioner semi prisoner in india many eager question be asked of will companion a made way down to gate of bala hissar yossouf took upon to answer passed through gate without slightest suspicion way now think will be safest to go into city might lie hid for few day in deserted hut sooner later presence there must excite comment will be best think to go into city in quarter of parsee merchant there be assuredly who must give shelter domajee who be contractor for supply of mission must must think be best to go to there be little danger for none will suspect presence there servant be hindoo be best place yossouf have be down several time to domajee be certainly devoted to english can try first dawn of morning be breaking when will faithful friend arrived at door of parsee trader in hindoo quarter of cabul door be fastened barred for be impossible to say whether attack upon mission have be heard going on night might not be followed by fanatic outbreak against hindoo parsee trader in hindoo quarter therefore there be little sleep that night yossouf knocked gently at door who be there voice at once inquired from within come on urgent business with domajee yossouf replied open quickly there be two of here there be slight pause then door be opened closed immediately two visitor have entered light be burning in large anteroom a entered several hindoo who have be lying wrapped up in cloth on floor rose to foot to inspect newcomer moment later trader came down stair from apartment above what be asked did not pause for answer light from lamp carried fell upon will be face now white a sheet from loss of blood with one word follow parsee turned on heel led way upstairs have mission be captured asked a entered empty room yes will replied believe that be only survivor fatigue of climbing stair completed work caused by prolonged excitement loss of blood a spoke tottered must have fallen have not yossouf seized with assistance of parsee laid on couch in few word yossouf informed trader of what have happened satisfied that suspicion must arise of presence of one of british in house a residency have be burnt down body of who have fallen within consumed one must suspect that one of five englishman there have effected escape must be supposed will body like of doctor kelly have be consumed in flame parsee be sure that cabul must soon be reoccupied by british putting aside loyalty to felt that concealment of english survivor of massacre must be greatly to advantage must secure for custom of english upon arrival at town first descended stair warned hindoo follower on account to breathe word of entry of stranger there then again returned to room where yossouf be sprinkling water on will face be endeavoring to recover to consciousness there be blood on couch trader said be wounded be suffering from loss see sleeve of coat be soaked with blood see mark on cloth yossouf replied have put on uniform since fight go downstairs trader said wife daughter will see to a soon a yossouf left room domajee wife daughter entered with many exclamation of surprise alarm be at once silenced by trader who bid cut off wounded man uniform stanch wound will have be hit in two place one ball have passed through left arm fortunately without injuring bone other have struck in side have run round rib gone out behind inflicting ugly looking not serious wound course being marked by blue line on flesh behind two hole of entry exit wound be washed bound up cordial be poured between lip ere long opened eye looked round in bewilderment be safe among friend parsee said drink little more of cordial then go off quietly to sleep need have fear of being discovered friend will be here ere long four of hindoo servant now at order of trader came upstairs lifting couch carried will to cool airy chamber in upper story of house here soft bed of rug mattress be prepared will be soon in quiet sleep with yossouf watching by side be twenty four hour after massacre that well mounted native from cabul brought news over shatur gardan pas into khurum valley thence be telegraphed to simla in few hour india rang with not instant be lost in making preparation for avenging murder of british mission on same day order be sent to brigadier general massy at time commanding field force in khurum valley to move rd punjaub pioneer th ghoorkas mountain battery to crest of shatur gardan pas to entrench there day two later nd highlander th punjaub infantry ascended peiwar khotal to ali kheyl to secure road between khotal pas nd then moved forward joined rd pioneer th ghoorkas on shatur gardan on th general baker arrived there took command time be needed before advance must commence a be usual with british great transport train have with such pain be collected organized for war have be dispersed immediately peace be signed whole work have now to be recommenced vast number of animal have be used up during campaign there be greatest difficulty in obtaining minimum number be required before troop must move at last general robert managed to collect in punjaub mule camel bullock tribe in khurum valley too who have be kindly treated be well satisfied with change of master furnished many animal for transport of store a far a shatur gardan news have thrown gilgis other tribe among mountain beyond peiwar khotal into state of ferment several determined attack be made by upon convoy on way up to head of pas however be always successfully repulsed by baggage guard with considerable loss to assailant on th september three week from date of massacre general robert joined troop at ali kheyl moved forward to shatur gardan during time two three letter have be received from ameer who wrote to general robert deprecating advance of british troop saying that be trying to restore order to put down mutinous heratee troop to punish for conduct a however detail have be received of massacre showed that ameer have behaved in most suspicious if not in most treacherous manner at time of massacre that if possessed authority over troop have not attempted to exercise attention be paid to letter advanced party of invading force moved down from shatur gardan pas consisted of th th bengal cavalry two gun of royal horse artillery two company of nd highlander th punjaub native infantry road be found to be extremely steep difficult much labor be necessary before must be made practicable for gun wheeled carriage enemy be encountered little force encamped at night in logan valley over cavalry skirmished far ahead found foe awaiting on following day made march forward brigade of general baker macpherson from pas into valley advance force halted at zerghun shah soon after have done so of cavalry rode in with surprising news that ameer be close at hand hour later yakoob khan attended by of principal noble rode into camp be received with honor due to rank personally general robert greeted with great coldness ameer stated that came into camp because must not control soldiery of cabul that therefore have left place come in to show friendship for english may have be motif for coming be never fully explained circumstance afterwards occurred strongly confirmed suspicion that meditated treachery be treated honorably guard of honor be assigned to be in fact guard over from time be virtually prisoner general robert declined altogether to discus with event of massacre of cabul saying that be matter must not now be entered into must be fully investigated on arrival at afghan capital following day brigade of general baker macpherson joined advance at zerghun shah amount of transport available be only sufficient for baggage of army be necessary therefore to move forward in two division one advancing day march then halting while animal went back to bring up baggage of second division on following day proclamation be now issued by general sent forward among people of valley saying that object of expedition be only to punish concerned in massacre at cabul that loyal subject of ameer must be well treated on rd of october macpherson brigade with cavalry reached suffed sang here halted while baggage animal went back to bring up general baker brigade attitude of people of valley have now become very threatening great number of hill tribesman have come down on day attack be made upon rear guard be beaten off with loss that native be bitterly hostile be undoubted be for most part waiting to see result of approaching fight heratee cabul regiment be confident that must defeat approaching column have great advantage in number have be drilled in european fashion be armed with enfields have enormous park of artillery at disposal be able to choose own fighting ground have selected spot gave immense advantage be therefore confident of victory have british troop be beaten inhabitant of logan valley be prepared to rise to man ghilzais other hill tribe must have swept down upon line of retreat few if of british force must have returned to tell tale next day baker division have post of honor made short march to chaurasia beyond village enemy have taken up position three mile beyond village valley end mass of hill shutting in with only narrow defile leading through to plain of cabul beyond upon side of defile enemy have placed gun in position lined whole circle of hill commanding approach to mountaineer from birth believed that although british infantry might posse superiority in plain must be match for on steep hillside doubt thought that attempt must be made to storm so strong position that british column must march straight up valley into defile where must be helplessly slaughtered by gun matchlock men on height judging from own tactic have reason for belief that position be impregnable one in hill fight afghan never come to close quarter posted behind rock huge boulder opposing side keep up distant musketry duel lasting sometimes for day until one side other becomes disheartened with loss have exhausted ammunition then fall back other claim victory idea that english soldier must under heavy fire from concealed force steadily climb up broken mountainside come to close quarter probably never entered into calculation at daybreak on th working party be sent forward to improve road towards defile have scarcely started when cavalry patrol in advance rode in announced that enemy be in great strength on hill have gun in position to command road general robert have now choice of two course must either attack whole afghan force with one division at hand must wait until joined by macpherson brigade next morning feat of carrying position in face of immensely superior force with only half of little command be very serious one upon other hand hour added to number of hillmen who swarmed upon flank of army just beyond musket range delay of twenty four hour must bring whole fighting force of tribesman into valley while attacking enemy position in front must be liable to assault upon rear by confident in valor of soldier chose first alternative at eleven o'clock little force marched out from camp to attack afghan army by time enemy position have be reconnoitered be found to be too strong for direct attack be therefore resolved to ascend hill on flank so to drive defender back beyond defile in case must have be best mode of assault against semi savage enemy flank attack be peculiarly effective having prepared for assault in one direction be disconcerted disheartened by finding attacked in different manner fear of flank being turned line of retreat thereby menaced will generally suffice to cause rapid retreat general baker took command of left attack force consisted of four gun of number mountain battery two gatling gun th company of sapper miner wing of nd highlander six company of th ghoorkas men of th punjaub infantry of rd pioneer be main column of attack right column under command of major white of nd highlander consisted of wing of regiment men of rd pioneer three gun of royal artillery two squadron of cavalry attack be intended only a feint to distract attention of afghan from main attack strong reserve be left in chaurasia to guard baggage to overawe tribesman a general baker column reached foot of hill rd who led advance thrown out in skirmishing line began to climb ascent enemy be armed with sniders enfields fire be rapid continuous fortunately be by mean accurate loss be small afghan in hill fighting be accustomed to fire very slowly deliberately taking steady aim with gun resting on rock so fighting be excellent shot be probable however that steady advance of men towards flurried disconcerted that thought more of firing quickly than of taking correct aim nd pressing up hill be assisted by fire of mountain gun gatling by of punjaubees in rear gradually upper slope of hill be gained british troop pressing forward drove afghan back along crest several time made obstinate stand holding ground until nd be close to however must not be denied massacre of mission at cabul have infuriated soldier man be animated with stern determination to avenge murdered countryman for hour half fight continued then afghan abandoned ridge fled in confusion rallied upon low hill yard from rear mountain gun gatling opened upon whole line advancing to attack enemy fell back major white column have be doing excellent service on right although attack have be intended only a feint be pushed forward so vigorously that met with success equal to have attended main column on left enemy be driven off hill on right of defile twenty gun be captured direct road cleared of enemy unfortunately cavalry be in rear road through pas be difficult before must get through into plain on other side mass of afghan have fallen back into strong village scattered over must not be attacked by cavalry alone enemy have from to men upon ridge including thirteen regiment of regular troop left dead upon field besides carried off large number of killed wounded during night upon side only be killed wounded have general robert have whole force with must after capturing hill have at once pushed forward have attacked enemy on plain afghan disheartened panic stricken must have be completely crushed with so small force in hand possibility of serious attack by tribe on rear general robert did not think prudent to advance farther regiment have taken principal part in massacre of cabul marched away unmolested enormously superior a still be in number have thought of further resistance capture of position deemed impregnable by force so inferior in number to own have utterly disheartened heratee regiment day before have be so proudly confident of ability to exterminate kaffir be now utterly demoralized panic stricken in night whole of afghan troop scattered fled cavalry under general massy swept along plain of cabul skirting town kept on a far a ameer great entrenched camp at sherpur three mile further along valley here gun be captured in morning macpherson arrived general robert now advanced with whole force of infantry found that have no longer foe before afghan army have disappeared there be longer occasion for haste column halted until baggage have be brought up through difficult defile total defeat of afghan army have overawed tribesman at once retired to hill again villager however be bitterly hostile seized opportunity of firing at small body of troop on cavalry patrol continued for time general robert at last be obliged to punish with severity in such case found with arm in hand be at once shot on th of october sir frederick robert staff with cavalry escort rode into bala hissar next morning british troop marched into fort gate of cabul stood open column be marched through town formal possession taken of during first five week elapsed after massacre of mission william gale remained almost prostrate in house of friendly parsee trader have barely recovered strength after prolonged illness when attack be made event of night great loss of blood have suffered have reduced strength to of infant under care of parsee family however slowly steadily regained strength for first month little news reached from without then report came that british have assembled in considerable force on crest of shatur gardan be going to move on cabul from direction then day by day tidings came in of advance of force be reported generally that ameer have gone out to meet with intention of leaving when decisive moment arrived taking command of tribesman who must fall upon annihilate on th town be unusually quiet will heard that afghan army have moved out to occupy hill commanding approach through defile that with aid of tribesman british army be to be exterminated there chapter fighting round cabul day long on th of october william gale sat at open window in upper story of parsee house facing west listened to distant roar of battle while cabul be in state of wild excitement in sure anticipation of victory will felt equally confident a to result of battle knew that well led british force must be trusted to carry position held by afghan felt sure that even must fail to carry by direct attack english general must sooner later succeed in turning by flank movement about two o'clock in afternoon william noticed change in character of sound in town in hindoo quarter have be quiet for inhabitant greatly feared that in burst of fanaticism following victory achieved over british afghan might sack hindoo quarter murder inhabitant yossouf however have be morning out in town have from time to time brought in report of rumor current there at first be said that british be being utterly routed that be being exterminated by afghan fire that hill tribe be sweeping down upon rear that not man must escape presently report became more contradictory firing be still heard be no longer one continuous roll said that british be annihilated others repulsed in attack have fallen back to camp soon after two o'clock yossouf rushed up to william room with news that afghan have be driven from height that british be in possession of of defile through have throughout morning be swayed by conflicting emotion wish at one moment hoped that countryman might conquer then fear that after victory hindoo quarter might be sacked english friend discovered killed overpowered feeling of patriotism must be remembered that afghanistan have for century be rather geographical expression than country population be composed of great number of tribe without common feeling interest often engaged in desperate war conflict with other two leading tribe ghilzais duranees have long struggled for ascendency in cultivated portion of country for long period ghilzais have have supremacy duranees be now lord of country mountain tribe for most part held entirely independent although in time gave nominal allegiance to ameer of cabul yet a have be shown in khurum valley hated native master with animosity far exceeding that felt towards british throughout war tribesman be ready when saw opportunity to attack english convoy small column be true be animated by love of plunder rather than of country over considerable area of afghanistan notably at candahar people in general must have infinitely preferred mild just rule of english to military tyranny of cabul thus yossouf have grown up without understanding meaning of feeling call patriotism have be true be taught to hate unbeliever feeling have disappeared on acquaintance with will gale now ranked safety happiness of friend far before national consideration how weak be feeling of patriotism among afghan be shown by fact that most of british frontier troop consist of afghan hillmen who be always ready when called upon to fight desperately against countryman co religionist example of treachery such a exhibited by two pathan who fired gun to warn countryman of british advance up spingawi pas be almost unknown be then with feeling of joy that yossouf related to english friend news of defeat of afghan army throughout hindoo quarter there be deep suppressed gladness at news of british victory increased when a night went on be known that afghan army be totally dispersed that troop remaining in cabul have fled that city be virtually open for entrance of english when on th with band playing color displayed british troop marched through cabul will must fain have gone out joined countryman parsee pointed out to that must draw attention of afghan to fact that have be concealed by that in case at time british must evacuate cabul return to india must be marked man for vengeance of afghan will therefore wrapped up in long cloak accompanied by yossouf parsee left house after dark proceeding to gate walked out to bala hissar explaining who be will be soon passed through sentry have be set at be conducted to quarter of general latter be greatly surprised when be told that english soldier who have be present at attack upon mission wished to speak to at once ordered will to be brought before great be surprise when learned from young soldier that have fought under at taking of peiwar khotal having be made prisoner near ali kheyl have be brought to cabul have joined party of sir lewis cavagnari on arrival at city still more that having be in residency when attack upon be commenced by heratee soldiery have managed to escape from massacre of night after having first heard complete outline of will story general called in several of staff who have just finished dinner then requested will to give full detailed description of adventure after have concluded yossouf parsee be called in general warmly expressed gratification at kindness that have shown to wounded english soldier at risk of life ordered that handsome present must be made to yossouf told parsee to call again in morning when quartermaster general must be told to arrange with for supply of such article a country afforded for use of troop regiment said to will be at present at jellalabad whether will come up here yet know in meantime will be promoted to rank of sergeant be least can do after what have gone through will take place with staff orderly sergeant then sent for one of sergeant gave will into charge telling must speak further with when have arranged pressing business occupation of cabul entailed upon yossouf remained with will being at urgent request placed upon roll a native follower of whom considerable number accompany regiment in india duty be nominal for when will story be well known yossouf became most popular character among sergeant of staff money have received in first place from ameer now from general robert must secure future in afghanistan animal be cheap owner of small herd of ox sheep even goat be regarded by neighbor a wealthy man therefore yossouf must on departure of british be able to settle down in position of comparative affluence two day later general robert being one evening disengaged sent for william gale have be much struck with bearing manner of young soldier now requested to give full history of antecedent have have curious eventful history said when young sergeant have finished appear to have conducted with great discretion readiness courage from what tell of conversation with colonel shepherd have doubt that formed same impression do from manner appearance that be of respectable if not of good family trust that will day discover clue to parent seems to have authority of place where be left properly bestirred ought to have be able to find out who be however be not to point now be sufficient for that from manner address must not be out of place in position will of course report fact of having fought by major cavagnari side in attack upon here will strongly recommend that commission be granted be sure that from conduct hitherto will never do discredit to position in may find say nothing to fellow sergeant of what have told be possible although not probable that recommendation may not be acted upon at rate month must elapse before answer can be received william gale returned to quarter in state of extreme delight communication general robert have made to be altogether beyond hope have indeed from very day that enlisted often hoped that time other might win for commission take place in rank to have from childhood believed that be by birth entitled word manner of colonel have encouraged hope have never dreamed that promotion might be attained so soon be year since have enlisted five be very earliest at have even dreamed that commission might possibly be gained next day have be sent from orderly room with note to colonel of th be regiment now in quarter in bala hissar rest of force being encamped in plain below a be walking across open be suddenly hurled to ground with tremendous violence at same moment roar a loud a of thunder sounded in ear bewildered half stunned rose to foot while shower of stone beam other debris fell around illustration one of gunpowder magazine have exploded one of gunpowder magazine have exploded have be known that very large quantity of powder be stored in various building at bala hissar at moment of explosion body of engineer under captain shafto be examining building in be stored making preparation for removal of powder singularly enough soldier of th be killed of ghoorkas who be on guard at arsenal at time twelve be killed seven wounded shafto be unfortunately killed th be at once called out set to work to extinguish flame have be kindled by explosion great damage being done southern wall of arsenal have be blown down several building set on fire explosion followed explosion work of extinguishing flame be extremely dangerous one in afternoon magazine blew up fortunately troop be in neighborhood at time four afghan be killed several soldier hurt at distance of three four hundred yard from spot although be never proved be strongly believed that explosion be caused by afghan a large quantity of powder still remained in bala hissar be determined that for present place must be evacuated general therefore with staff regiment in garrison left place joined camp in plain little force at cabul be now isolated troop be slowly coming up khyber pas to jellalabad where division be to be formed destined in spring to join force at cabul must be necessary to carry on further operation between cabul shatur gardan native be in restless excited state two attack by men have be made on garrison holding crest of latter position three hundred in number bravely sallied out attacked enemy in open killed large number of still great number of tribesman be gathered round general gough with th punjaubee cavalry th punjaubee infantry four gun be therefore sent from cabul to bring down from shatur gardan garrison store accumulated there pas must shortly be closed by snow be then to be deserted several execution now took place at cabul of men who be proved to have shared in attack on embassy of leading men of place who have instigated troop to attack be among executed many of villager be also hung for shooting at detached body of troop proclamation have be issued by general on first arrival warning people that attempt against authority must be severely punished forbidding carrying of weapon within street of cabul within distance of five mile of city gate offering reward for arm belonging to afghan troop must be given up for surrender of person whether soldier civilian concerned in attack on embassy position of british force at cabul be that of body holding only ground occupied in midst of bitterly hostile country ameer be powerless indeed goodwill be more than doubtful have from arrival in camp be regarded a prisoner although treated with courtesy after battle of chaurasia feeling own impotence being viewed with hostility by party resigned position a ameer asked to be sent to india be done abdication of ameer really took place on day troop entered cabul be not publicly known until end of month a nothing must be done on subject until desire be communicated to indian authority view concerning ascertained from moment of arrival at cabul general robert have set to work to prepare for winter must for four five month be entirely cut off must have to rely upon alone have before terrible catastrophe have on same ground befallen general elphinstone army knew that be possible indeed probable that with memory of success before afghan must unite in great effort to annihilate little force shut up in heart of country fortunately have in ameer barrack at position be confident must hold against attack must be made upon extensive barrack have be erected by sheer ali for use of cavalry have never be used consisted of large square three side of be surrounded by lofty wall isolated rocky steep hill rising at back closing fourth side building be amply large enough to contain whole of general robert force there be abundant room for store baggage animal wagon only fault be indeed that extent of wall to be defended be too long for force at disposal round two side outer wall be complete on third have not be taken to full height have be continued so a to join hill behind great effort be made to bring in sufficient provision forage for winter expedition be made up logan maidan other valley for purpose winter be fast setting in snow have begun to fall upon hill ice formed on pool night native of valley near be ready enough to sell grain straw fuel few supply came in from distance a armed band stopped supply on way however sufficient amount of food fuel be obtained stored in sherpur grain too be procured for winter only article of supply be insufficient be chopped straw of very large quantity be required attitude of native grew daily more hostile priest be preaching revolt to death recalling to people how father have annihilated british force thirty year before urged alike by fanaticism desire for plunder native over whole country be seething with excitement general robert saw that crisis be approaching afghan must assemble at least men among must be included troop of ameer disbanded army armed with weapon equal to own burning to revenge defeat have be inflicted upon to oppose english general have le than men though prepared for trouble storm when came burst suddenly upon english enemy be known to be collecting in great number in maidan valley two column be sent out to attack one be commanded by macpherson other by baker although be to strike simultaneously at enemy route of march lay up different valley with lofty mountain range between so must in way cooperate with other after have started general massy be directed to move out with small force of cavalry battery of horse artillery cooperate with general macpherson hour after cavalry have started general robert rode out be accompanied by usual escort by two mounted orderly sergeant one of be william gale have only proceeded short distance when heard distance ahead of gun of royal horse artillery with massy at work general at once rode forward at gallop general macpherson have found mahomed jan one of principal leader of afghan with men near chardeh fight ensued gun shelled enemy water course prevented cavalry with macpherson acting mahomed jan moving across hill placed between macpherson cabul shortly afterwards general massy who have with three troop of th lancer forty four men of th bengal lancer with four gun under major smith wyndham came in sight of portion of mahomed jan force be clear that have in way interposed between

at trot before have left village deep roar be heard knew that afghan fort be destroyed two hour later arrived safely in camp where four rescued officer be warmly congratulated on narrow escape by friend on th of july conspiracy among wali troop came to head openly mutinied marched out with cannon arm from camp be situated at short distance from of british colonel ripon be first to gallop in with news unfortunately british commander be not man endowed with promptness of decision step be taken until mutineer have proceeded considerable distance then cavalry artillery be despatched in pursuit have order be given at once there can be doubt that wali force must have be completely cut up who escaped must have arrived mere horde of fugitive for most part without arm at ayoub camp late a be pursuit be not ineffectual six british gun opened fire upon wali artillery be in rear of retreating column with such effect that gunner be seized with panic cutting trace fled for life good many be cut down by british cavalry six gun deserted by be brought into camp colonel burrow little force now stood alone for have with infantry cavalry six of own gun besides taken from mutineer force altogether disproportioned to that with ayoub be advancing swelled a be by accession of wali army message be sent to general primrose at candahar asking for reinforcement officer although have considerable force at disposal declined to despatch reinforcement news now arrived that ayoub instead of marching direct upon girishk have crossed helmund higher up be moving across country by line parallel with road from candahar to girishk by movement must have option of placing between colonel burrow force candahar of marching direct upon latter city of keeping to north coming down upon road between candahar shahpur then marching direct for cabul under circumstance general burrow determined to fall back at once to spot where might oppose ayoub advancing force accordingly brigade marched from helmund to village called khusk nakhud there encamped general nuttal with cavalry made reconnaissance in direction of enemy people of country held altogether aloof accurate information be obtained a to strength of ayoub army be believed by general burrow to be very much smaller than really be early in morning of th be known that ayoub be marching upon maiwand village farther to north at half past six troop moved out to intercept be at time believed that be only enemy cavalry with whom must have to deal upon arriving near maiwand however news be brought in by spy that whole of enemy be at hand force be at once halted in position singularly ill adapted for fighting ground deep ravine ran to right to left of ground occupied by british by enemy must advance under shelter until within short distance on side be range of hill completely commanding position be difficult to imagine more unsuitable position than general burrow prepared to hold with mere handful of troop against enormously superior force be total strength of ayoub army be never exactly known a be swollen by enormous number of ghazis tribesman from village be in fact far more formidable opponent than regular afghan troop a tremendous rush indifference to loss inflicted upon be trying in extreme for even best trained troop to withstand morning be thick little must be seen of ayoub army cavalry indeed be found to be moving about in large mass fell back at advance lieutenant maclean with two horse artillery gun small cavalry escort galloped out on extreme left opened fire on afghan cavalry infantry at once appeared in force swarming down towards gun be withdrawn to position nearer to line british infantry be formed in following order th be on right bombay grenadier in center jacob rifle on left two gun be placed in position to support th on right remaining four british gun six bore gun captured from wali mutineer be placed between grenadier jacob rifle rd scinde horse rd bombay light cavalry be formed in rear of line a enemy advanced gun opened heavy fire upon be fully hour before artillery replied then thirty gun be unmasked opened fire upon british line under cover of heavy fire swarm of enemy irregular advanced towards position when within yard of th british opened with martini rifle shower of lead at such unexpected distance checked advance of enemy for time artillery duel continued enemy gun be then moved on to hill on side of british position terrible crossfire be opened from flank at about two o'clock smooth bore gun began to get short of ammunition only sixty round have be captured with there being reserve of ammunition fitting ceased fire position now became most serious from ravine on side ghazis swarmed up in vast number artillery thundered from height upon troop of battery be brought up to within very short distance great number of enemy keeping along ravine sheltered from fire came up in rear seized village there company of jacob rifle on left after resisting for time furious attack of ghazis began to waver enemy cavalry swept down in heavy mass while cavalry for reason have never be explained remained inactive general have stated that ordered to charge that must not do so cavalry affirm that never received order anyhow at critical moment rd scinde horse rd bombay cavalry remained inactive confusion amid jacob rifle rapidly grew in spite of effort of officer to rally ghazis swept down upon rifle broke in confusion rushed among bombay grenadier who hitherto fighting steadily also fell into confusion a rifle ghazis burst into rank be hot work will gale said to captain when enemy gun on height on side began to play on line of th with flank fire be indeed officer answered fire of enemy from edge of ravine be very trying wish to heaven general must move farther back have made hideous mistake in fighting on such ground a must be difficult to withdraw now will said must shake confidence of men think that ought to advance drive enemy before till take up really defensible position doubt if afghan must wait for in history british charge against indian enemy have always be successful matter how great odds be bad lookout captain said a shell burst close by killing wounding five six men be quite evident that if stay where be must in time be annihilated fellow will stand doubt be english soldier well officered how can one expect two indian regiment with only three four white officer to remain steady under fire a with desperate charge of ghazis upon very steadily th held ground in spite of flanking fire of artillery musketry time enemy gathered at edge of ravine for rush heavy fire of company on flank be wheeled back at right angle to line so a to face drove back to shelter again regiment have suffered very heavily still officer felt that must endure till of victory there be now idea for to conquer men must act here be only called upon to suffer presently wild tumult be heard to left then men of scattered native regiment burst in tumultuous mass into rank of th steady men steady shouted officer be of avail be in hopeless confusion artillery fired until ghazis be within few yard of then hastily limbered up fell back ghazis be too close at hand two of gun be lost even now have cavalry charged upon afghan time must have be given to broken infantry to form again into solid mass to draw off from field in good order cavalry remained inactive regiment have record of good service in field conduct on occasion be little short of disgraceful among infantry order be lost mixed up in confused mass hemmed in on side by enemy fell back man fighting for upon village behind here in walled enclosure th grenadier rallied fought nobly house be used a fortress only carried after desperate struggle here colonel galbraith nine other officer of th be killed greater portion of regiment shared fate body of troop entirely cut off from rest in retreat stood ground in open fought desperately to end surrounding ere died with ring of slaughtered enemy so desperate be defense in case that outnumbering fifty to one enemy never dared to come to close quarter with gallant band kept up rain of fire on till last man have fallen so long stoutly be village defended that great majority of broken fugitive have time to pas out behind general burrow who have done best to stem rout drew off shattered remains fell back with in fair order will gale company be in right flank of regiment therefore farthest from point where line be broken by rush of native troop seeing what be taking place captain formed men into company square fell back to village in fair order company then threw into house with walled garden to right of village steady fire in slight degree helped to keep back afghan cover retreat did until general burrow rode up ordered to fall in company have done good service sir said to captain fletcher be for now to cover retreat slowly in good order company fell back joining troop who still retained formation retired slowly facing about pouring volley after volley into afghan a came out through village for two mile enemy pressed closely upon loss have already be immense desired to join in plundering of british camp therefore pursuit slackened three mile from village rear guard be ordered to main body at quick march chapter candahar thank god be over captain fletcher said a lifted cap wiped perspiration from forehead regiment be almost annihilated fear worst be yet to come will said be fifty mile from candahar when came out have to carry water with for there be none to be found on way have fearful march before what on earth have become of cavalry have done nothing to cover retreat have ridden on ahead captain said bitterly without having drawn sword in day fight will ride into candahar tomorrow morning without losing man save few who be knocked over by artillery presently officer rode up ah gale exclaimed thank god be safe rode back to see colonel ripon shook hand warmly with young officer be glad to see that be safe sir will answered have be terrible day have indeed colonel said mournfully terrible there have be nothing like since retreat from cabul in how many of poor fellow will reach candahar god only know water bottle wore emptied hour ago men be already exhausted with long day work parched with thirst have fifty mile tramp before have wounded men here with several sir of badly hurt put one of worst on horse colonel ripon said dismounting push on briskly lad there be cart ahead will turn out store put wounded in have better let men throw away knapsack useless encumbrance said to captain fletcher will have to march perhaps fight night must husband strength steadily rear guard followed broken column consisted of men of th grenadier mingled together well did carry out arduous duty portion be thrown out on flat while rest kept to road be strewn with arm accouterment of kind men heart be wrung to core by sight of number of wounded who have dropped by roadside who implored a passed not to leave to be murdered by enemy many of be lifted placed in cart everything else being turned out to make way for many have to be left behind for must be impossible to carry on march slowly long night passed along line ahead scattered fire of musketry must be heard a villager shot down fugitive who in hope of finding water straggled from road sometimes sharp volley rang out a troop stood at bay drove back native when pressed upon several time rear guard be hotly engaged a afghan furious at seeing prey slipping from finger mustered fell upon time be repulsed column held on way will be in command of mixed band of forty men moved to right of road colonel ripon kept by side few word be spoken through long night men be half mad with thirst have there be water near nothing must have restrained from rushing to knew that none must be obtained until reached candahar many in utter despair at distance before threw down on ground to die others kept on stumbling staggering a marched stupid half blind rallying only when order came to turn repulse enemy two three time in night rear guard halted for few minute men threw down on sand where picked scattered herbage within reach chewed to quench burning thirst daylight be welcome relief knew indeed that with rising of sun torment must grow still greater change from long dreary darkness cheered must now see from nature of country that be within fifteen mile of candahar marched on for two more hour then officer in command of little body saw that must do more therefore led to village on rising ground short distance from road halted there exhausted men threw down in shade of house have long day yet to pas thirst seemed unendurable still halt be welcome for there be not man felt that strength be at end that must have be impossibility to reach city captain fletcher picked out few of least exhausted men placed in outskirt of village to call rest to arm in case afghan number of whom be hovering round must venture upon attack for first hour after reaching village not man moved from spot where have thrown down officer have searched house found jar of water carried round doled out few mouthful to man small though amount be relief afforded be immense a soon a first exhaustion have subsided men scattered through garden plucking vine leaf chewing fortunately discovering few gourd be cut up into small fragment divided day wore on at one o'clock there be shout of joy for body of cavalry be seen approaching at rapid trot from town soon rode up proved to be regiment have be despatched from town for relief of straggler at daybreak cavalry riding in many mile ahead of infantry brought news to city of defeat something very like panic at first ensued be time before anything be done to succor exhausted fugitive who be pressing forward to city at last force be sent out with wagon bullock with water skin thus hundred of life must otherwise have be sacrificed be saved cavalry have come out with full water bottle relief be soon afforded to worn out rear guard who at once fell into rank resumed march towards candahar cavalry who have brought few light cart with pursuing journey for distance further to succor collect who have fallen on road sun be just setting a rear guard of general burrow brigade reached candahar after having marched since previous morning sixty mile without food with only few mouthful of water having fought for nearly twenty four hour of time preparation be made in city for expected attack defense be strengthened lower portion of populace who must be likely to declare against be turned out of town provision be collected from country round fortunately ample time be afforded for preparation ayoub army have be to great extent demoralized by tremendous loss have sustained in defeat of handful of british troop day elapsed before moved forward from maiwand then by easy march approached candahar took up position in plain to north of city just a rear guard of general burrow force be starting from halting place for last march into city will gale be delighted at seeing yossouf approaching have not seen since regiment marched out from khusk nakhud young afghan have remained with other follower in village behind maiwand during battle when while resistance of british be still continuing afghan have worked round by ravine entered village yossouf have be obliged to join in retreat be at once commenced by baggage train full of anxiety for fate of master have hurried forward at best speed to candahar reaching city only hour two after arrival of cavalry in spite of distance have already performed did not delay for instant set out again with provision bottle of wine one of water hidden away in dress have resolved to push forward at hazard until have joined master whether on retreat a prisoner in ayoub army have discovered body on field of battle given burial passing through throng of fugitive questioning of men of th met made way forward have learned that will be company have withdrawn in body from battlefield to village further than none of fugitive must tell delight be exuberant when saw will marching along with company little supply have brought be at once served out among men who most needed will who have be in state of great uneasiness concerning safety of faithful follower be greatly cheered by finding alive unhurt news of defeat of maiwand produced immense sensation in india measure be at once taken for relief of candahar strong division be ordered to march from cabul through ghuzni while general phayre who commanded force at quettah be also ordered to advance to assistance of garrison general phayre however although comparatively close to candahar be unable to advance for time same miserable economy have dispersed transport train after signature of treaty of gundamuk have so delayed advance of general robert towards cabul after massacre of mission again paralyzed action of british troop whole of transport train collected at so much cost difficulty having be dismissed to home a soon a negotiation with abdul rahman held out prospect of peace many week elapsed before sufficient number of baggage animal must be collected to enable general phayre to advance with relieving column in candahar thing passed quietly enemy from time to time fired shot shell into city from distant position believing that relief must reach garrison before supply of food be exhausted that must therefore yield to hunger ayoub army contented by watching city from distance by keeping cordon of troop round wall to prevent country people from bringing in provision detached body indeed often crept up near wall kept up musketry fire at troop showing there attempt be made to batter down wall to make anything like resolute assault ayoub army have indeed greatly lost heart if british soldier attacked under circumstance of greatest disadvantage have killed of assailant what might not be slaughter greatly superior force must inflict when sheltered behind stone wall from one village situate mile from eastern gate of city so constant harassing fire be maintained by enemy that general primrose resolved to make sortie to capture affair be however badly planned resulted in failure afghan sheltered in strongly built house kept up so severe fire upon assailant that be obliged to fall back with considerable loss after further sortie be attempted city remained in quiet until relieving column be close at hand force selected to march from cabul to relief of candahar under command of

endeavoring to break into loot house thus left vacant by proprietor in order to protect a much a possible many of officer be directed to move from quarter in barrack take up residence in order be gladly obeyed a exchange from hot confined quarter to roomy dwelling of merchant be very pleasant one will gale be one of who so moved with yossouf two native follower have be quartered in house of wealthy silk merchant one night be aroused from sleep by yossouf sahib latter whispered hear people moving below think there be thief in house will rose noiselessly slipped on trouser shoe taking up

that sentry be posted at ten o'clock at night at entrance to various street in house left deserted by native trader be situated order be given that native must be out of house after hour unless provided with pas signed by commandant of city several messenger be from time to time sent out to endeavor to get through enemy line to carry to general phayre news of what be going on in city few of succeeded in getting through none returned so that until signal light be seen flashing from distant hill in direction of khelat ghilzai garrison be unaware of step be being taken for rescue even have unforeseen obstacle prevented advent of of relieving column be probable that garrison of candahar must finally have freed colonel primrose have at disposal force more than double that have fought at maiwand have british advanced into plain offered battle to ayoub on fair fighting ground must without difficulty have defeated army whose long delay hesitation showed how immensely morale have be affected by previous battle thus be that sale after sustaining long siege in jellalabad finally sallied out completely defeated besieging army before arrival of force marching to relief candahar force be not commanded by sale have be given chance to retrieve maiwand there can be little doubt of what issue must have be over over again subject be discussed at mess of various regiment immense indignation be felt at force being kept cooped up in candahar when history of india recorded score of example of victory won by british troop against greater odds than now opposed to must be said however that native portion of army in candahar be of very inferior fighting quality to operated in eastern afghanistan regiment be for most part ghoorkas sikh punjaubees than whom braver men exist ghoorkas be small active men mountaineer by birth to whom war be passion sikh punjaubees upon contrary be tall stately men proud of historical fighting power of race have fought with extreme bravery against english once conquered became true faithful subject of english crown be fidelity bravery saved england in dark day of mutiny bombay troop upon other hand be drawn from race have long ceased to be warlike possessed none of dash fire of hardier troop organization be still be defective system of officering be radically bad contrast between two be strongly shown in conduct of sikh ghoorka regiment with general stewart when attacked by sudden rush of ghazis at ahmed khil that of bombay grenadier jacob foot under precisely similar circumstance at maiwand there be doubt however that main reason why general primrose did not sally out give battle on plain of candahar be that in case of defeat populace of city must assuredly have closed gate against army that nothing must have remained disastrous retreat across kojak pas retreat of very few must ever have survived to tell enforced idleness in candahar made time pas slowly heavily be with greatest joy that garrison hailed entry of column of general robert upon arrival general lost time in reconnoitering position of enemy be well chosen for defense army be encamped behind range of hill known a baba wali hill road ran direct over

fugitive must have be hard work sir will gale said to colonel ripon a rode forward in rear of fighting brigade to have taken position with candahar force alone must not have be done colonel ripon replied one must have dreamed of attempting afghan say that force robert brought down from cabul be so large that stood on defensive must have ventured to attack have sallied out offered battle on level plain round city then have doubt must have beaten however be well that end well robert have come up in time have completely defeated enemy still must have be more satisfactory have retrieved maiwand by thrashing single handed well suppose be end of afghan war have beaten ayoub hope so effectually that abdul rahman will have difficulty in dealing with in future if really mean profession of
