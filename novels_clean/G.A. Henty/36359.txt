finished be not fatigue so much a be loss of heart that one felt wind seemed to go right through one to take one pluck out wonder lady be alive can quite understand ' lord halliburn said have idea what must be like until got into then though porter have brought up warm wrap for be terrible must quite have given up hope have not guide persisted that if have got off glacier might have taken shelter somewhere under lee of rock that if so might find unharmed ' 'it be too late when got off glacier to think of lady be already almost insensible rest of so chilled to bone shelter must have be of use unless must make fire that of course be out of question so only chance be to make straight down mountain be nothing to work on ice 'hawtrey fortescue seem badly knocked up ' lord ulleswater

wonderfully shaky about knee now be over 'no wonder ' lord ulleswater said 'it be bad enough coming down hill by carrying lady must have be hard work indeed ' did not feel that much weight well up on shoulder be nothing kept so close behind guide walked in footstep went on blindly without thinking much about path one way other thing worried most be that hawtrey fortescue might give out must not think what must do then stumbled very often kept expecting to hear fall by pace guide went at felt sure that must carry woman down thought that warmth of body must keep life in if hawtrey fortescue fell did not see what must do must not leave there to die yet to stop must have be death to of well here be mule be not sorry for ' be not until be on something like level ground that must quicken pace of animal be not long before overtook porter with litter then a must hing there rode on ahead to see that everything be in readiness for reception with exception of captain armstrong none of

to get up on following day be on sofa in sitting room 'well have made nice business of young lady mr singleton said when paid first visit 'this be what come of mountaineering must have done much better to have stopped down here in valley instead of pretty nearly frightening to death besides risking own life injuring health be glad to hear that sister be little better morning miss fortescue doctor think that worst have passed though will still have troublesome time of ' ' be sorry frightened mr singleton ' dorothy said 'well mr fortescue have bad time of dorothy of course must not quite realise danger for down here sun be shining brightly morning think mr fortescue did quite realise until arrived knew guide here must not have be so alarmed unless there have be real danger must have come up with party knew that so far from being of slightest use must only have be trouble to be fortunate halliburn two friend happened to be in hotel almost everyone else be out took management of expedition in hand hurried thing up wonderfully never liked man so much before a did then be tremendous relief when rode in with armstrong brought news that must be here in hour that although be exhausted worn out with terrible time have have hoped that must be none worse for think realised what have gone through most when father came in quarter of hour after have be carried up to room have to be lifted off mule helped upstairs where hot bath have be got ready for if two strong hearty men be so utterly exhausted one must easily understand what time must have gone through ' 'yes be carried mr singleton ada fortescue said remember much about be so cold miserable know once almost laughed at thought be being carried like package on guide back what mother must think of if saw ' 'what did feel dorothy quite know what felt said reluctantly with somewhat heightened colour ' know felt ashamed of used to think be a strong in way a men be in theirs seemed to disgraceful must have to be carried then must not help thinking where road be very steep must hear guide in front telling captain armstrong where must step that might slip must be killed together otherwise felt safe for must tell that be walking firmly be not feeling weight too much think lost consciousness at body felt quite warm hand foot be a if be dead must not have be at surprised to find have lost altogether ' in afternoon captain armstrong be admitted to see invalid at once laughed down dorothy attempt to thank for having saved life ' only did for miss hawtrey exactly what guide did for miss fortescue sister there be nothing very terrible in carrying weight when get comfortably fixed why porter in andes think nothing of carrying people right over mountain be only matter of getting weight properly balanced saw how guide did knotted shawl over cap just above peak carry weight here know a do in most mountain country with strap across forehead coming over ice really did feel heavy though have two others to help with cold seemed to have taken one strength out of one weight be on one side coming down be nothing in comparison believe must have carried right down to hotel here with occasional rest be a warm a toast when got into wood must not think say anything more about if do will straightway pack up kit take place in next diligence wherever may be going to now be able to walk into room pretty easily 'we be very stiff felt curiously weak just a if have have long illness doctor say will soon pas off that in week will be walking about again ' ' rather think will change plan armstrong ' mr hawtrey said 'by time get back will be far on in october wetting damp cold up in lincolnshire doctor advises that must be better to cross alp spend few week in northern italy so a to set dorothy completely up to work cold out of system have not settled upon yet think be probably what will do be of use running risk of getting rheumatism at rate will be here for week ten day by time hope clara fortescue will have fairly turned corner so lingered on in week two girl be able to get about again to enjoy sunshine in valley hotel be nearly empty now season being over clara fortescue be fairly through fever though still very weak be however only question of time captain armstrong still remained dorothy must no longer disguise from why be staying up to day of expedition up to mer de glace have refused to admit idea into mind have before told distinctly that must never care for in way wanted have believed have accepted decision a final be great friend have enjoyed stay at martigny just a have done have observed difference in manner to two friend in fact if anything have thought be rather pleased than otherwise that be oftener by side of ada fortescue than by own there have be however something in manner during terrible time have opened eye something perhaps in tone of voice when cheered on in clasp of arm a aided father to carry have told truth when still lingered on at chamounix knew what be coming what did not know be what answer must be liked very much have saved life be sure must do best to make happy yet did not feel that loved a thought woman must love man who be to be husband have made one mistake have regretted bitterly have become engaged without feeling that love have vowed to herself never again must say 'yes unless whole heart went with word have have girlish hero for year have thought that one be like have come back little earlier have still remained ideal must never have become engaged to lord halliburn have fancied that be unchanged until moment when have failed in perfect trust have thought have placed in now have gone away for month to america dream be over altogether have felt journey a personal grievance of course after offence have given made difference to did not wish to see be unpleasant for of nevertheless be somewhat sore at acquiescing so readily in decision that old relation be entirely thing of past in fact be unreasonable be vexed with for being so be annoying to now that must think of at have gone altogether out of life must in few month be back in india again thought of breach cause brought back again strongly to event of two month previous to leaving england have be almost forgotten of late acknowledged a thought over that position be practically same a have be be still exposed to charge of theft although have be arranged that there must be compromise yet in mind of two tradesman who have be victimised of assistant be thief although who knew best be convinced of innocence whisper of affair might yet get abroad be fact known must be generally condemned besides at moment system might be recommenced might again be branded a thief tale of compromise effected in first case must add weight to charge be for reason that have broken off engagement with lord halliburn have then declared to herself never must place in similar position until be absolutely entirely cleared from suspicion freed from chance of repetition of nothing have occurred to shake determination have right to enter upon engagement until stood above suspicion man might trust blindly might scoff at idea of doing dishonourable action must not suffice to shield from consequence of charge what life must theirs be be generally believed to be thief society must close door against consciousness of innocence might support life must be none le painful humiliating dorothy arrived at conclusion not without certain amount of unacknowledged sense of relief obviated necessity for giving direct answer to question be to be asked felt that must not again say 'no ' yet shrank from saying 'yes so when next day captain armstrong happening to find alone told that love be unchanged since have spoken to in spring except that loved more asked if must not give different answer to with have sent away said ' be sorry so sorry captain armstrong be great pain to to say before if have dreamt when joined at martigny that still thought of in way must have told frankly at once that be better for that must not stay there thought have come to regard a friend be not until day on ice felt be not so be great pain to to say before liked very much then a told not enough for like even more now must be impossible must help when have be so much together did so much for day like so much that if be free ' must have broken in checked by motion of hand ' be not otherwise than free in way ' said ' have broken off with lord halliburn for good yet be not free have be so know what answer must have be think must have brought to say feel sure must hardly have said yes think must have said quite know have made one mistake must not make like very much think that be love that woman must give to husband give little more time to think before answer ' ' must have be well content dorothy must have waited a long a liked understand how be that be not free ' 'you have right to know be because be disgraced because a long a disgrace hang over can never marry ' 'you mean ridiculous story be in paper dorothy do think must care for moment for such thing a that have brought slightest taint of disgrace upon in mind of know ' be beginning of ' said 'but there be worse be that made break off engagement doubt now whether in case must have held to have begun to feel have made mistake before came even have not done so must have be same be accused of theft ' theft dorothy ' repeated in incredulous scorn suspected of theft ' on evidence so strong ' went on quietly 'that even father for moment suspected dear friend mr singleton believed have be mixed up in disgraceful transaction others who thought knew well must have trusted a know must have done believed guilty not of theft of previous accusation there be shopmen in london ready to swear in court of law obtained diamond other good from to morrow fresh charge may be made ere long may stand in dock a thief captain armstrong looked at a if doubted sanity 'but one in sens must think thing dorothy ' 'but have told that even who knew best did for moment think so mr charles levine lawyer be clear headed man yet even after hearing fact be convinced of guilt will tell more be fair must do so gave history of postcard then of robbery at jeweller of mr singleton lending money of other robbery on same day of captain hampton seeing in conversation on afternoon with man believed to be author of postcard see ' said 'that here be evidence of three four tradespeople of whom know well by sight who recognised dress a well a face here be evidence of mr singleton who have known from child that of captain hampton who be at time seeing day to have to oppose own denial to declare never be at of four place afternoon ' must believe word if thousand swore to contrary said passionately 'you may now when have heard thing said 'but must not at time when shopkeeper assistant told father that story must see that face turned white for moment believed that must have taken thing in order to obtain money to bribe man whom have solemnly declared have letter of mine when story told that very dress be recognised asked if must have done unconsciously in state of somnambulism something of sort be absolutely dazed bewildered with trust in be sure must have be shaken when heard that story just a own father be again when old kindest friend mr singleton declared that have come to sobbing cry begging to save from disgrace that have given cheque for thousand pound must be blamed for believing that girl knew loved have be engaged in scandalous affair a to captain hampton believed absolutely in regard to letter doubted afterwards try to put in place if have known about affair of letter have seen in out of way part of london engaged in conversation with man be searching for a author of postcard what must have thought asked question little wistfully ca say ' said honestly suppose just for moment must have thought have really got into serious sort of scrape see how must have helped be sure must never have thought have done anything really wrong ' 'but in case must have be liar suppose must have thought of at time dorothy when came to think over must have said be impossible must have doubted own sens robbery never must have believed in if hundred shopkeeper have sworn to what doe really mean there must be explanation of ' only explanation can arrive at ' replied 'be that there be other woman so like that can pas for when dressed up in clothes like own course of course what fool be not to think of ' 'yes captain armstrong accept just a father mr singleton accept because must accept anything rather than believe guilty must anyone else believe if went into court mass of evidence be brought against must bare denial weigh against must suggestion of counsel that theft have be committed by other woman so like that even who knew best have be deceived unsupported a must be by even shadow of evidence be accepted for instant know well enough that jury must return verdict against without moment hesitation that world save dozen people must believe guilty present police over england be endeavouring to find proof of existence of double notice have be sent to country in europe have be going on ever since left england so far without slightest success after having be so successful be hardly likely that thing will not be attempted again in case must come before public will be terrible to bear disgrace alone must be ten time more so did involve in disgrace pain by saying more captain armstrong laid hand on arm a be about to speak 'nothing must induce to change determination if at time dreadful mystery be cleared up must come to again will give honest answer say will be yes must be a heart will decide then at present hope be that will not wait for matter may never be cleared up believe that never will be must far rather know that be married to woman who must make a happy a deserve than that be wasting life on that even must be cleared might not be able to give answer want ' ' will wait for time at rate dorothy ' said quietly 'but will not say more now be very good to have spoken so frankly to ought not to have allowed to talk so much can see that have be almost too great strain for think that have better leave to morrow morning ' ' think will be best said 'but promise captain armstrong in case will always be good friend may think little of act of saving life will never forget promised before must find change in manner kept word well ' promise again dorothy ' said raising hand to lip be never to regard in closer light will always think of a dearest friend ' 'and will rejoice in happiness a sister might do captain armstrong in minute be gone dorothy sitting down indulged in long cry did not attempt to analyse feeling be not sure whether be glad sorry whether have virtually refused not be certainly relieved that have not be obliged to make up mind to give answer from there must have be drawing back hour later father came in 'the carriage will be at door in ten minute dear be looking pale child be not feeling so well ' ' have rather headache think instead of going for drive will lie down until dinner time came down looking again knew that captain armstrong intention of leaving next morning must excite certain amount of surprise that possibly might be suspected that be not unconnected with departure certainly ada fortescue must have suspicion for during last two three day have thrown out little hint showed that be not blind a to intention be relieved to find a sat down that party be in ignorance of approaching departure be not until meal be nearly finished that captain armstrong said suddenly have be putting off tearing away from day to day leave be up be afraid can not possibly delay longer go awfully against grain there be help for have be to office afternoon booked place for geneva to morrow morning ' there be general chorus of regret ' must grumble ' said laughingly have have very pleasant time indeed though have not gone in a have intended for mountaineering think one mild attempt way have good deal quenched ardour ought to have gone ten day ago did not like to do so until miss fortescue be up fairly on way to recover strength be glad to have have pleasure of seeing to day have however knocked from under last excuse for remaining here longer will get severe wigging a be for exceeding leave of course have written making various excuse wo do longer will have to travel right through without stay hope mr fortescue that will meet in london in few week time find daughter quite again suppose mr hawtrey will have to look forward to beginning of season before see miss hawtrey ' ' think likely will not be in town until may ' mr hawtrey replied 'we will probably work down so a to be at rome at easter will have month two of quiet at home before come up to town still must depend on circumstance if can get few day leave later on must be very pleased if must run down to place for week shooting there have not be gun fired there season take couple of men down with if like will write to housekeeper gamekeeper saying that be to be looked after just same a if be at home will have to do will be to send note saying that be coming couple of day beforehand name be brodrick make note of in pocket book ' will enjoy very much if can get away have doubt whether will be able to if can will certainly avail of offer ' be dorothy ada fortescue whispered a went together that night ' knew that by face afternoon tried to talk laugh a usual must see thing have gone badly with need not tell if like ' went on a dorothy gave answer 'it be not difficult riddle to guess for ' ' will tell must be quite to ada there be certain reason why must give answer at understand ' went on in answer to ada look of surprise suppose ever will there be circumstance that render impossible for to give answer a far a can see there be not likely to be alteration in circumstance so please say anything more about see must not act differently think most likely that question will never be asked again perhaps day other may tell about have got to be real friend now when do hear will acknowledge have done right good night now be so glad to think that clara be to be down to breakfast again in morning ' be not only conversation on subject mr singleton contrary to usual custom sat up until mr hawtrey bad retired have be bit of surprise hawtrey there be doubt that have proposed that have not accepted a have quite made up mind must do 'do think so idea have not occurred to seemed just same a usual 'you be a blind a bat hawtrey did stay at home with headache afternoon be going away suddenly to morrow doe not require smallest degree of penetration to discover what mean be relief to great relief be afraid be only postponement have refused to accept on same ground that broke off engagement to other man now think over see be about only thing must have done must not have be right to have become engaged a long a thing be hanging over be very well for to feel that be going to compromise matter comfortably there be still may break out afresh again at moment have shaken off bit since came away must be on mind expect frankly told armstrong why must give answer at present still be afraid will come to same thing in long run mr hawtrey wisely held tongue must have be in way content with captain armstrong a son in law a have wish to irritate friend abstained from going farther into subject chapter xviii mr singleton have gone out for stroll after breakfast with dorothy ada fortescue mr fortescue be with clara who have come down to breakfast for first time be now lying down for bit a preparation for going for short drive later on mr hawtrey be smoking cigar in front of hotel with mr fortescue intending to follow girl mr singleton after post came in after hour waiting bag for hotel be brought in 'they be principally yours fortescue ' mr hawtrey said a clerk sorted over 'the inquiry after clara health must have materially benefited postal revenue a be not coming will put four for ada in pocket there be nothing for of others only one for know what content be without opening ' putting five letter into pocket strolled down village knew exactly where must find others a almost always took seat in nook sheltered completely from wind exposed to full ray of sun suppose have better look at letter said to ' must rather danvers did not write so often dorothy look up inquiringly whenever post come in must rather say no letter to day than to have to say there be letter from danvers dorothy sends news whatever come to same thing doubt letter might mean that have got little clue meant following up at rate doe not look so disappointed a when tell that there be letter with nothing in ' 'hulloa exclaimed a opened 'this be much more lengthy epistle ' first line two be sufficient to cause to burst into something like shout of joy ran ' be delighted to be able to give good news that existence whereabouts of man counterfeit of miss hawtrey have be ascertained without doubt hampton be right when considered must probably have made off to united state directly have secured plunder received letter from morning unfortunately have be away shooting for week have be lying unopened since day left then followed copy of captain hampton letter together with copy of various affidavit prove practically require have be round with to charles levine be very much gratified say that considers testimony must be ample to enable to defend action on part of gilliat think best plan will be to place captain hampton letter deposition before gilliat say that be prepared to defend action to bring over people a witness of course must be more satisfactory to have adventuress accomplice in dock to produce written confession such be evidently be opinion also see have started for new orleans say will follow if have to cross continent however have not copied a have put that on separate piece of paper marked private confidential from something said to day before started imagine have for reason other objection to miss hawtrey knowing that be working on behalf see in early part of letter thought must be sent to doubtless shown to treat discovery have made a purely accidental matter although told that intended to make sole business to hunt down if took six month to do so however when wrote be certainly on point of starting for new orleans own consider undertaking to be somewhat perilous one fellow must be thorough paced ruffian will find difficulty in getting together number of reckless men who must if found be in danger of arrest hesitate at nothing of course if go farther west errand will be still more difficult hampton be so thoroughly good fellow must feel grieved indeed did anything befall ' mr hawtrey thrust letter enclosure into pocket hurried on hesitated for moment a remembered that ada fortescue be with daughter said to be good girl great friend of dorothy can trust to hold tongue besides need not go much into past have be running father ' dear be little excited over letter have just received be family matter ada know dorothy will not wish to go away for be sure can trust with little secret news father ' dorothy asked springing to foot 'news about ' 'yes dear first must tell friend that tradesman have be robbed by person so strongly resembling that deceived even that knew well matter be so serious that have have number of detective searching for woman a only by being found must prove that order for good be not given by having told that much can go on with news 'they have be found dorothy thank god have be found ' girl threw arm round father neck burst into passion of tear hitherto have have nothing consciousness of innocence to support until suggestion have be made by captain hampton that one have impersonated have be in state of complete bewilderment even hypothesis seemed to to be improbable in extreme still a father mr singleton have accepted too have clung to with le real hope than have entertained that might prove to be true a week have passed by without shadow of proof that person existed being forthcoming have more than once told that must have to pas life with dark cloud over few close friend might believe in when story be whispered about a sooner later must be sure to be everyone else must hold aloof from have be feeling that morning in lower spirit than usual captain armstrong have left early be deeply sorry for more sorry for than for herself have slept little night have come to conclusion be weight ever removed be ever to ask again life must be happy one with even though did not feel for more than very real liking sudden announcement of fact have begun to doubt for time completely upset father at last said will leave here for few minute with friend dorothy will stroll away with singleton by time return will be able to listen calmly to story when have gone short distance away from girl placed copy of letter deposition in mr singleton hand ' latter exclaimed a soon a glanced over first line two ' be glad indeed let sit down on rock over there news be too pleasant to be lost by not being able to read distinctly ' 'well hawtrey congratulate ' said when have finished 'those letter be sufficient to prove to unprejudiced person dorothy have be perfectly innocent throughout whole business be pity bird have flown before hampton arrived there even putting everything else aside must have given something to see that woman who humbugged so completely what will young lady say now when hears that be hampton who have thus cleared by way writes a if be mere accident having discovered ' ' fancy writes in style because have doubt that will see letter there be letter danvers sent with enclosure hampton seems to be just a obstinate about matter a dorothy be mr singleton read letter with many grunt of disapprobation 'why must be satisfied with what have done ' exclaimed when have finished letter have got enough evidence to satisfy reasonable people now must need go chasing over america a likely a not get shot for pain why did write over ask whether be not sufficient 'because if have done so singleton might never have be able to pick up clue again evidence have got may not be absolutely conclusive undoubtedly will be very valuable affidavit prove conclusively that there be on certain day woman staying in new york hotel who be so like dorothy that daughter portrait be believed by several people who have seen woman to be hers must also be proved that man with have just come from hamburg see doe not in way connect woman with robbery there be weak point of business evidence be enough a say to convince reasonable people a shopmen be ready to swear to dorothy fact that have found woman exactly like whom can not produce be scarcely satisfactory proof from legal point of view that be innocent however can talk that over presently have better join others dorothy will be wanting to hear news be careful what say may think that ned hampton view be foolish be bound to respect ' mr singleton made reply mentally resolved that if be necessary must speak about whether ' be not going to see young fool throw away chance like ' said to 'he doe not know what have be going on here dorothy have be within ace of accepting one else foolery of show that really care for if have not done so must simply have laughed at nonsense ' met girl coming towards have be unconscionable time father be burning with impatience to know how have come about 'those paper will tell dorothy one be extract from letter written to mr danvers by ned others be copy of affidavit sworn in new york dorothy changed colour have be thinking of former friend night have very reluctantly come to conclusion that have be unduly hard upon have asked captain armstrong what must have thought have seen a ned hampton have supposed that have done in spite of love for absolute confidence in word captain armstrong have admitted that must at first have come to exactly same conclusion namely that have got into scrape have not felt hurt angry when admitted why then must have be in case of old playfellow question be altogether unwelcome one have dismissed a speedily a possible name coming upon now so suddenly unexpectedly have almost startled in anger against for involuntary flush took paper prepared to read much more deliberately than must otherwise have done however eye ran over line more rapidly a read on when finished exclaimed wonderful piece of good fortune seems quite providential that captain hampton must have taken fancy to go out to america must have inquired when went through new york if man woman have lately arrived seems to have managed wonderfully well be lucky got clever detective a person speaks of really father feel very grateful to ' beo think ought to ' mr hawtrey said somewhat sharply 'considering that have done what detective in london have failed to do even aided by police over continent have gone long way towards lifting cloud if have not be for must have darkened whole life ' quite feel that father have be thinking that over while have be away have told ada that word can express what relief be to of course be very very grateful to captain hampton be very good of indeed to think of to take such trouble about what will have to do next 'that must depend upon what lawyer say dorothy almost wish that have be going back to london so a to talk over with personally ' 'why must go father be feeling quite well again now be wanting very much to be home again must infinitely rather do than go to italy fortescues be talking of starting in couple of day why must not go back together ' ' will think over dear now think have better be getting back to hotel sun have gone in cloud be half way down mountain think that be going to have snowstorm so ada have better hurry have have experience of suddenness with storm come on here ' ' suppose be why must give answer yesterday ' ada fortescue said a two girl walked briskly back toward chamounix followed more leisurely by mr hawtrey friend 'yes partly ada ' 'what pity news did not come day sooner know ada really have not made up mind see all along have be feeling must never get engaged again so have answer ready have not thought over a must have done otherwise there be snowflake do let hurry so a to be in before begin in earnest ada did not see snowflake saw that companion wanted to change subject nothing more be said till reached hotel just a snow be really beginning to fall dorothy remained for time in room be dissatisfied with for not feeling more elated at discovery have be made be everything to told greatest event of life yet after first burst of joy have not made a happy a must have done be tiresome that must have be made by captain hampton have requested not to interfere farther in affair have done so with success certainly must much rather that woman have be discovered by one else be not all if news have come day earlier supposed that must have accepted captain armstrong there must have be end of have promised that must let know if be ever cleared up now in honour ought to write to anyhow there be occasion for to day have only left that morning must look ridiculous be to get letter day arrived in town if be going back must wait until be in england must be difficult letter to write most difficult sat down for time thinking ended by being a unjustly angry with captain armstrong a have be with ned hampton believe be getting quite idiotic ' said getting up impatiently will begin to think storm on glacier have affected brain when ought to be happiest girl possible here be discontented with everything ' result of conversation between mr hawtrey friend be that at luncheon former announced that letter that have received that morning told presence be required in london a dorothy be so much better must give up idea of visit to italy must go home with at once 'let go together clara said ' be sure that be strong enough to travel do so long to be home ' a be agreed that couple of day must make difference to order be at once given for carriage to be ready next morning at early hour started on way down to geneva chapter xix mr hawtrey made few hour stay in london dorothy urging father to leave at once for home must have preferred stopping for day two to confer with mr charles levine to get matter with jeweller settled before went north dorothy pressed point so much that gave way 'what be use father ' urged 'of

'except dorothy that be in london at time there be proof that be that people swear be while most that can prove be that there be in existence one who be wonderfully like be immense satisfaction to to have got a far a have have at rate strong defence story will at least satisfy who know still singleton agrees with that jury must hardly be satisfied that verdict must probably be against ' expect jeweller to give up claim think must be reasonable to expect man have be robbed of valuable good two assistant be absolutely convinced that be who took there be report about that be being pressed for money defence that woman so like that portrait be taken for hers crossed from hamburg to new york week after robbery can not be taken a conclusive that be woman not who be at jeweller shop greatest

steel there can eat more breakfast ' pushed plate from rising hastily left room dorothy went about house with pale face day father rode off directly after breakfast to carry news to singleton who be greatly distressed thereat tell dorothy that be at new orleans asked presently 'no did not mention place thought be a well to wait until got letter of course knew from affidavit that man woman have gone down there ' ' must have told mr singleton said 'ned begged to say nothing about though did not give specific promise have held tongue thus far though have be strongly inclined to tell dozen time there be reason why must not know be new orleans if like to put two two together can wonder whether attack on have anything to do with affair ' 'that be what be thinking a rode over singleton see how must have done so see have only just arrived there there be saying boy distinctly say be nigger may only have be attempt at robbery suppose letter be written in evening if boat have come in early must have set about making inquiry at once a be evidently leaving until next day take must have written after dinner then gone out for stroll perhaps got stabbed by vagabond other for sake of watch 'how did dorothy take ' behe seemed very sorry in fact did not notice much be regularly upset got out of room a soon a must for if have talked about must have broken down poor lad to think of having gone through dozen desperate fight in india then to be stabbed by negro thief at new orleans 'evidently boy thought there be hope mr singleton said beo must trust that next letter will bring better news can not bring to believe that be going to lose ned hampton in way ' day passed quietly dorothy have put off writing to captain armstrong telling that there be hurry for although if met fortescues might learn have returned to england must not know that change have occurred in reference to matter of have spoken to have asked father on evening on letter came to let read although have said nothing on subject have not failed to notice that be at new orleans have be wounded knew enough of america to be aware that must not have gone there on way to district where might be going to shoot game wondered whether have really gone down there in order to find out something more about woman be very good of if have done so have put aside own plan for purpose have lately be thinking of with good deal of contrition have really taken great deal of pain to try find man that after have be so angry with must have pursued inquiry in new york have given sharp pang have opened eye still more widely to injustice with have treated have only spent day over still have showed that affair still occupied mind if have really given up plan in order to follow people down to new orleans be real sacrifice one felt have not deserved did not admit to herself that have anything whatever to do with delay in writing to captain armstrong more than have admitted that have be prevented from writing at once from chamounix by thought of ned did acknowledge to herself that if ned hampton be to die of wound never must have received have not gone down to new orleans on business must be matter of deep regret to life shrank from speaking of subject be never alluded to unless father mr singleton spoke of always did when latter came over then seldom joined in conversation be nearly month later when mr hawtrey one morning found among letter one from danvers three four letter have passed between mr levine have seen jeweller who although admitting that evidence of existence of person who strongly resembled miss hawtrey be remarkable pointed out absence of proof that person have even be in london at time diamond be taken away declaring that own impression remained unchanged at same time be perfectly ready to let matter remain open for year more if necessary must indeed much rather do so than accept offer for part payment even for entire payment from mr hawtrey seemed highly probable that proof must by time be obtained that might clear matter up entirely if have be subject of extraordinarily clever fraud be willing to submit to entire loss must indeed hail with satisfaction evidence must convince that assistant have be deceived must thus entirely clear away unjust suspicion that must not otherwise feel of young lady who be daughter of old valued customer of firm man speaks fairly enough must confess danvers have written 'he be evidently absolutely convinced that assistant can not have made mistake a to lady who visited be of course much struck at deposition from new york remarked that people be liable to be deceived by photograph that be one thing to see likeness perhaps accidental between photograph living person altogether to mistake living person know well for be evidently greatly disturbed troubled over affair said over over again must infinitely rather lose money that miss hawtrey must be cleared upon other hand can not give way without evidence will absolutely convince that sens have be deceived in so extraordinary manner mr hawtrey then expected news of importance from danvers a to affair be possible letter might contain later intelligence from new orleans be nearly month since have heard in case like news be very far from being good news opened therefore with great reluctance more so that letter be lying at top of others saw by anxiety with dorothy be watching that have at once recognised handwriting a eye fell upon content uttered exclamation of thankfulness 'it be from ned ' mr hawtrey said 'thank god for ' dorothy repeated exclamation of thankfulness in low tone hand moved unsteadily among tea thing in front of then suddenly burst into tear father went round to 'there there child ' said putting hand on shoulder ' distress know that

now that hear of recovery will glance through letter tell what say danvers have written few line with letter dear mr hawtrey enclose hampton letter speaks for think that conjecture a to author of attempt on life be likely to be correct much a must be glad to hear that daughter be finally satisfactorily cleared from charge can not regret that hampton must have undertaken so dangerous business a upon have embarked think better to send letter especially a be not likely to hear again from for long time ned hampton letter commenced with expression of regret that friend must have be unduly
