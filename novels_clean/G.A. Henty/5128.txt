young carthaginian story of time of hannibal by g henty preface dear lad when be boy at school if remember rightly sympathy be generally with carthaginian a against roman why be so except one generally sympathizes with unfortunate quite know certainly have hazy idea a to merit of struggle knew little of event for latin greek author serve a ordinary textbook in school treat of punic war that be struggle for empire at first latterly one for existence on part of carthage that hannibal be great skilful general that defeated roman at trebia lake trasimenus cannae took rome that roman behaved with bad faith great cruelty at capture of carthage represents think pretty nearly sum total of knowledge be sure must have liked to know great deal more about struggle for empire of world a think that most of must also like to do so have chosen subject for story fortunately there be lack of authentic material from to glean incident of struggle polybius visited pass of alp forty year after event conversed with tribesman who have witnessed passage of hannibal there can be doubt that description be far more accurate than of livy who wrote somewhat later have personal knowledge of affair number of book have be written a to identity of pass traversed by hannibal whole of have be discussed summarized by mr w j law a appears to that argument be quite conclusive have adopted line lay down a followed by hannibal in regard to general history of expedition of manner custom religion politics of carthage have followed m hennebert in most exhaustive important work on subject think that when have read to end will perceive that although sympathy may remain with hannibal carthaginian be nevertheless for good of world that rome be conqueror in great struggle for empire at time war began carthage be already corrupt to core although might have enslaved many nation must never have civilized rome gave free institution to people conquered subdued never enslaved rather strove to plant civilization among to raise to own level carthage on contrary be from first cruel mistress to people conquered consequently while people of italy rallied round rome in day of distress tribe subject to carthage rose in insurrection against a soon a presence of roman army gave hope of escape from bondage have carthage conquered rome in struggle must never have extended power over known world a rome afterwards did must have fallen to piece again from weakness of institution corruption of people thus then although may feel sympathy for failure fate of noble chivalrous hannibal can not regret that rome came out conqueror in strife be left free to carry out great work of civilization yours sincerely g henty chapter camp in desert be afternoon sun ray still pour down with great power

men laughed feel hotter than ever be fifteenth time that have be to door of tent during last half hour restlessness be enough to give one fever believe that be just a eager a be adherbal boy replied laughing be first lion hunt a well a mine be sure be longing to see whether assault of king of beast be more trying to nerve than of iberian tribesman be looking forward to malchus certainly young man replied a know lion will not quit covert until after a effort on part will hasten approach of hour be well content to lie quiet to keep a cool a may be cousin be right general said impatience be fault malchus must make allowance for impatience on present occasion for lion be foe not to be despised be truly a formidable antagonist when brought to bay a iberian on bank of ebro far more so than revolted tribesman have be hunting for past three week giscon say nothing adherbal remarked have soul above even hunting of lion warrant that during five hour have be reclining here thought have never once turned towards hunt be going to have tonight be true enough giscon said speaking for first time own that thought have be of carthage of trouble threaten owing to corruption misgovernment be sapping strength be best not to think too much on subject giscon general said still better not to speak of know lament a do misgovernment of carthage mourn for disaster have be brought upon by subject be dangerous one council have spy everywhere to be denounced a one hostile to established state of thing be to be lost know danger young man said passionately know that hitherto who have ventured to raise voice against authority of tyrant have died by torture that murmuring have be stamped out in blood yet be danger ten time a great speaker have risen now from couch be walking up down tent must not keep silent what have tyrant brought to extravagance corruption have wasted public fund have paralyzed arm sicily sardinia have be lost ally in africa have be goaded by exaction again again into rebellion carthage have more than once lately be obliged to fight hard for very existence lower class in city be utterly disaffected earnings be wrung from by tax gatherer justice be denied by judge who be mere creature of committee of five suffetes be mere puppet in hand vessel lie unmanned in harbour because fund must pay sailor be appropriated by tyrant to own purpose how can carthaginian who love country remain silent say be true giscon general said gravely though must be pressed to death be whispered in carthage said so at present can hing have great hamilcar barca lived believe that must have set to work to clear out augean stable task greater than accomplished by great hero demigod hercules le hand can accomplish know how attempt at revolt have failed how terrible vengeance fell on matho mercenary how down trodden tribe have again again when victory seemed in hand be crushed into dust giscon must suffer terrible ill speak of until hero arises hero whose victory will bind not only army to will cause common people of carthage ally tributary to look upon a leader deliverer have hope great hope that hero may be found in nephew hannibal who seems to posse genius wisdom talent of father must dream cherished of be now speaking to that of leading carthaginian army across ebro over apennines through plain of lower gaul over alp into italy there to give battle to cohort of rome on own ground must dream be verified say must success attend rome be humbled to dust then hannibal must be in position to become dictator of carthage to overthrow corrupt council to destroy tyranny misnamed republic to establish monarchy of must be first sovereign under carthage again queen of world must be worthy of herself people now let speak of more very wall have ear doubt not even among attendant there be men who be spy in pay of council see lament a much a man ruin of country until see fair hope of deliverance be content to do best can against enemy to fight battle a simple soldier there be silence in tent malchus have thrown down on couch for time forgot even approaching lion hunt in conversation to have listened government of carthage be indeed detestable be chief cause of misfortune have befallen in past of disaster be in future to be hers scheme of government be not in bad in earlier simpler time have acted well originally have consisted of three estate answered to king lord common at head of affair be two suffetes chosen for life below be senate very numerous body comprising aristocracy of carthage below be democracy great mass of people whose vote be necessary

department being entirely in hand of member of inner council of thirty judge be hundred in number be appointed by council be ever ready to carry out behest consequently justice in carthage be mockery interest intrigue be paramount in law court a in department of state prominent citizen successful general man who seemed likely by ability wealth to become popular personage with mass fell under ban of council sooner later be certain to be disgraced resource of state be devoted not to need of country to aggrandizement enriching of member of committee heavy a be impost be laid upon tributary people of africa for purpose of state enormous burden be added by tax gatherer to satisfy cupidity of patron in council under such circumstance be not to be wondered at carthage decaying corrupt ill governed have suffered terrible revers at hand of young energetic rival rome who be day when attained apex of power to suffer from abuse le flagrant general than have sapped strength of carthage with impetuosity of youth malchus naturally inclined rather to aspiration of kinsman giscon than to more sober counsel of father have burned with shame anger a heard tale of disaster have befallen country because have made money god have suffered army navy to be regarded a secondary object have permitted command of sea to be wrested from by wiser more far seeing rival a evening closed in stir in neighbouring camp aroused malchus from thought anticipation of lion hunt in be about to take part again became foremost camp be situated twenty day march from carthage at foot of hill in lion other beast of prey be known to abound there be doubt that must be found that evening expedition have be despatched under command of hamilcar to chastise small tribe have attacked plundered of carthaginian caravan on way to ethiopia then rich prosperous country be many flourishing colony have be sent out by carthage object of expedition have be partly successful lightly clad tribesman have taken refuge far among hill although by dint of long fatiguing march several party have be surprised slain main body have evaded effort of carthaginian general expedition have arrived at present camping place on previous evening during night deep roaring of lion have be heard continuously among hill so bold numerous be that have come down in such proximity to camp that troop have be obliged to rise light great fire to scare from making attack upon horse general have therefore consented upon entreaty of nephew adherbal son to organize hunt upon following night a soon a sun set troop who have already received order fell into rank full moon rose a soon a sun dipped below horizon light be ample for object have in view numidian horse be to take station on plain infantry in two column mile apart be to enter mountain having marched distance leaving detachment behind be to move along crest of hill until met then forming great semicircle be to light torch have prepared during day to advance towards plain shouting dashing arm so a to drive wild animal inclosed in arc down into plain general with two young officer son party of fifty spearmen be to be divided between two grove in camp be pitched be centre of space facing line inclosed by beater behind grove numidian horse be stationed to give chase to such animal a might try to make escape across open plain general inspected two body of infantry before started repeated instruction to officer who commanded enjoined to march a noiselessly a possible until semicircle be completed beat began in earnest troop be to be divided into group of eight in order to be able to repel attack of beast might try to break through line when two column have marched away right left towards hill attendant of elephant baggage animal be ordered to remove into centre of grove footman who remained be divided into two party of equal strength general with malchus remained in grove in tent be fixed with one of party while adherbal giscon with others took up station in larger grove do think lion be sure to make for grove malchus asked father a with bundle of javelin lying by side bow in hand quiver of arrow hung from belt in readiness took place at edge of tree there can be certainty of malchus seems likely that lion when driven out of refuge among hill will make for grove will seem to offer shelter from pursuer fire here will have informed of presence last night a be still dark now may suppose that grove be deserted in case horse be in readiness among tree close at hand if lion take to plain must mount join numidian in chase must rather meet here on foot father yes there be more excitement because there be more danger in malchus can tell attack of wounded lion be joke even for party of twenty five well armed men force fury be prodigious will throw fearlessly upon clump of spear in order to reach enemy one blow from paw be certain death be careful therefore malchus stir not from side remember that there be vast difference between rashness bravery chapter ii night attack time seemed to malchus to pas slowly indeed a sat waiting commencement of hunt deep roar sounding like distant thunder be heard from time to time among hill once twice malchus fancied that must hear other sound such a must be made by heavy stone dislodged from site leaping down mountain side be not sure that be not fancy that sound might not be caused by roaring of lion far away among hill father have said that three hour must probably elapse before circuit must be completed distance be not great troop must have to make way with greatest care along rocky hill through brushwood forest advance must be more slow that have to take such pain to move noiselessly be indeed more than three hour after column have left camp when sound of distant horn be heard far up hillside almost instantaneously light burst out in great semicircle along hillside faint confused sound a of shouting of large body of men be heard on still night air be very well done general said in tone of satisfaction have hardly expected to be so well managed for operation on such broken difficult ground be not easy to carry out even with moon to help see father malchus said there be many patch of darkness in line lion might surely escape through must not be possible malchus to place party at equal distance over such broken ground be lion likely to discover gap in line will be far too much terrified by uproar sudden blaze of light to approach troop hark how be roaring truly be majestic terrible sound wonder that wild native of mountain regard animal with something of respect pay to god now do keep sharp eye along foot of hill there be saying how soon beast may break cover slowly semicircle of light be seen to contract a soldier who formed moved forward towards foot of hill although malchus kept eye strained upon fringe of tree at foot must see sign of movement roaring still continued at interval be evident that beast inclosed in arc have descended to lower slope of hill may be upon sooner than expect malchus colour well nigh match with of sand may not see until be close upon presently numidian soldier standing behind malchus touched on shoulder said in whisper there be pointing at same time across plain malchus must for time see nothing then made out indistinct form there be six of general said be making for grove get bow ready malchus must now clearly see lion approaching be advancing slowly turning occasionally to look back a if reluctant to quit shelter of hill malchus must hardly resist start of uneasiness a one of suddenly gave vent to deep threatening roar so menacing terrible that very leaf of tree seemed to quiver in light of moon under vibration lion seemed of huge dimension especially leader of troop who stalked with steady majestic step at head when within fifty yard of grove lion suddenly paused leader apparently scented danger again deep terrible roar rose in air answered by angry snarling noise on part of female aim at leader general whispered have brand in readiness immediately behind party fire be burning have be suffered to die down until be mere pile of glowing ember in end of dozen stake of dried wood be laid glow of fire be carefully hidden by circle of stick on thick cloth have be hung fire have be prepared in readiness in case lion must appear in number too formidable to be coped with leading lion be within twenty five pace of spot where party be standing when hamilcar gave word volley of arrow shot forth from hiding place lion gave roar of rage pain then crouching for moment with few tremendous bound reached edge of wood must see enemy now with fierce spring threw upon a soon a have discharged arrow soldier have caught up weapon formed in close body lion be received upon point of dozen spear there be crashing of wood snarling growl a one of soldier be struck dead with blow of mighty paw of lion who ere must recover received dozen javelin thrust deep into flank fell dead rest of troop have followed a sprang forward of soldier who have be told off for purpose seized lighted brand threw over head of leader among follower a glowing brand after describing fiery circle in air fell scattered at foot lion paused turning abruptly off dashed away with long bound across front of grove now malchus to horse hamilcar exclaimed general son leaping upon steed dashed out from grove in pursuit of troop of lion passing between two clump of tree be making for plain beyond when from behind other grove dark band of horseman rode out let pas hamilcar shouted head back cavalry reined up until troop of lion have passed hamilcar rode up to officer in command bring twenty of men said let rest remain here there will doubtless be more of yet then with twenty horseman rode on in pursuit of lion chase be exciting one for time lion with long bound kept ahead of horseman latter splendidly mounted on well bred steed soon began to gain when be within hundred yard of one of lion suddenly faced round numidian well accustomed to sport needed order from chief scattered at once broke off on flank so a to encircle lion who have taken post on hummock of sand lay couched on haunch with tail lashing side angrily like great cat about to make spring horseman circled round dashing up to within five twenty yard discharging arrow then wheeling away time lion be struck uttered sharp angry growl made spring in direction of horseman then fell back to post one of soldier thinking that lion be now nearly crippled ventured to ride somewhat closer discharged arrow before must wheel horse lion with two tremendous spring be upon single blow of paw brought horse to ground then lion seized soldier by shoulder shook a cat must mouse throwing on sand lay with paw across at moment malchus galloped past at full speed bow drawn to arrow head fixed arrow struck lion just behind shoulder fierce beast be in act of rising sank down quietly again majestic head drooped between forepaw on to body of numidian there lay a if overtaken with sudden sleep two more arrow be fired into there be movement brave beast be dead malchus said here be arrow with slew be well done malchus hide be yours let set off after others stand lion have made have be sufficiently long to enable rest of troop to escape leaving two three of comrade to remove body of soldier horseman scattered in various direction although rode far over plain must see sign of troop have pursued after time gave up pursuit rode back towards camp when reached found that troop of lion eight in number have approached other grove where two have be killed by party commanded by adherbal giscon rest of cavalry be still in pursuit of others presently returned bringing in four more skin so eight lion in have fallen in night work well malchus what do think of lion hunting adherbal asked a gathered again in general tent be terrible beast malchus said have not thought that beast must make so tremendous roar of course have heard in captivity in carthage did not seem nearly so terrible a sounded here in stillness of desert own made blood run cold adherbal said charge be tremendous broke through hedge of spear a if have be reed three of men be killed yes malchus agreed seemed almost like dream for minute when great beast be among felt very glad when rolled over on to side be dangerous way of hunting hamilcar said chase on horseback in plain have danger a saw when numidian be killed with proper care skill be grand sport work on foot be too dangerous have cost republic loss of five soldier have have net with must have adopted usual plan of stretching one across tree ten pace in front of break lion spring becomes entangled in mesh can be destroyed with little danger skill address avail against charge of wounded lion be wounded giscon be mere nothing giscon said nay hamilcar replied be ugly scratch giscon have laid open arm from shoulder to elbow a if be by cut of knife served right for being too rash giscon said thought be nearly dead approached with sword to give finishing thrust when struck viciously at sprang back one of claw caught shoulder few inch nearer must have stripped flesh from arm perhaps broken limb shoulder bone while be speaking slave be washing wound then carefully bandaged up few minute later whole party lay down to sleep malchus found difficult to close eye pulse be still throbbing with excitement mind be busy with brief stirring scene of conflict two three hour passed felt drowsiness creeping over when heard sudden challenge followed instantly by loud piercing yell from hundred of throat sprang in instant to foot a did other occupant of tent to arm hamilcar cried enemy be upon malchus caught up shield sword threw helmet on head rushed out of tent with father tremendous din have succeeded silence have just before reigned in desert yell of barbarian rose high in air answered by shout loud word of command from soldier in other grove elephant in excitement be trumpeting loudly horse stamped ground draught cattle terrified by din strove to break away large number of dark figure occupied space two hundred yard wide between grove general guard twenty in number have already sprung to foot stood to arm slave attendant panic stricken at sudden attack be giving vent to scream cry be running about in confusion hamilcar sternly ordered silence let man said take weapon of kind stand steady be cut off from main body will have to fight for life do said to soldier lay aside spear shoot quickly among fire fast great object be to conceal from smallness of number moving round little grove hamilcar posted slave at short distance apart to give warning must enemy be attempting attack upon other side then returned to side facing other grove where soldier be keeping up steady fire at enemy latter be at present concentrating attention upon attack upon main body scout on hill during previous day have doubt ascertained that carthaginian force be encamped here occupant of smaller grove must fall easy victim after have dealt with main body fight be raging furiously here native have crept up close before be discovered by sentry with fierce rush have fallen upon troop before have time to seize arm gather in order fight raged hand to hand bow twanged arrow flew light javelin be hurled at close quarter with deadly effect shrill cry of numidian mingled with deeper shout of iberian yell of native hamilcar stood for minute irresolute be neglecting said to adherbal until have finished with main body must go to assistance at present men be fighting without order regularity unless leader be with be lost presence will encourage reanimate bring up elephant quickly three elephant be at once brought forward driver mounted on neck four soldier with bow arrow took place on back of general with rest of fighting men followed closely behind at order of driver well trained animal broke into trot party advanced from shadow of grove native scattered between wood fired volley of arrow then broke a elephant charged down upon trained to warfare elephant dashed among catching up in trunk dashing lifeless to ground knocking down trampling upon others scattering terror wherever went while archer on back kept up deadly fire a soon a way be open hamilcar led little party on foot at full speed towards wood a entered ordered trumpeter to blow horn well known signal revived hope courage of sorely pressed troop who surprised discouraged have be losing ground great number falling before arrow javelin of swarming active foe native surprised at trumpet sound in rear paused moment before must turn round to face unexpected adversary hamilcar with little band burst way through joined soldier who gathered now in close body in centre of grove received leader with shout of welcome hamilcar measure be promptly taken saw that if stationary band must melt away under shower of missile be being poured upon gave command troop rapidly formed into three group men of corp gathering together adherbal who be in command of numidian placed at head giscon led iberian hamilcar headed heavily armed troop malchus taking place at side hamilcar have already given order to young officer response be to be made to fire of arrow javelin with spear sword battleaxe troop be to fall upon native charge shouted in voice be heard above yell

in council opinion be nearly equally divided one party urged that did take step to prepare populace for rising rumour must be sure to meet ear of opponent must be on guard whereas if scattered quickly after section have slain two of tyrant operation might be repeated until influential men of hanno faction have be removed in reply to argument other party urged that delay be always dangerous that huge reward must be offered after first attempt that of men of section might turn traitor that hanno party must be on guard in future that judge must effect wholesale arrest execution be populace

trifling offence by tribunal have be ruined by extortion of tax gatherer be stated to be ready to give life for vengeance agent of ours see malchus be not for most part animated by feeling of pure patriotism be own wrong not injury of carthage must avenge must take a find one can not expect deep feeling of patriotism on part of mass who must be owned have very great reason to feel lively interest in glory of republic so that eat drink sufficiently can earn living matter not very greatly to whether carthage be great glorious humbled defeated will not always be so when have succeeded in ridding carthage of tyrant must next do can so to raise condition of common people that may feel that too have common interest in fate of country must not of course propose giving to vote to bestow

must god of phoenicia carthage alone demand blood of greece rome be not so bloodthirsty yet mar give a many victory to roman arm a moloch doe to ours blaspheme not god malchus giscon said gloomily may be sure that wreath of conquering general will never be placed around brow if honour not if honouring mean approval of shedding blood of infant captive will renounce hope of obtaining victory by aid must have spoken so before malchus have known that be scorner of god must not have asked to join in enterprise good fortune can be expected to attend effort unless have help of god matter be easily mended giscon malchus said calmly so far have taken step towards carrying out plan have listened to what said therefore harm can yet have be done strike name off list forget have be with have oath will say nought of anything have heard can well make excuse to comrade tell for example that though fear not for thought that being son of hamilcar have right to involve name family in such enterprise unless by order yes be better so giscon said after pause dare not continue enterprise with one who condemns god among must be to court failure did not dream of who must have thought that lad of age must have be spurner of god be neither condemner spurner malchus said indignantly say only that believe worship wrongfully that do injustice say be impossible that god who rule world can have pleasure

not at heart sorry that be freed from association into without knowing measure by intended to carry out aim have rashly entered be ready for armed insurrection against tyrant of carthage revolted from thought of plan for midnight massacre be not by such mean that must have achieved regeneration of country felt too that reason have given giscon be valid one have right at age to involve family in such conspiracy did fail be found to be among conspirator hanno associate must be sure to seize fact a pretext for assailing hamilcar must say that malchus must never have joined in such plot have not known that have approval of father that be in fact representative of family in design for overthrowing constitution of republic fortunately for malchus few day later order be given for instant embarkation of portion of reinforcement destined for hannibal hamilcar be to proceed in command of busied with preparation for start malchus thought little more of conspiracy be brewing thirty large merchant ship be hired to convey troop who numbered six thousand be principally libyan footman main body with numidian horse be to follow shortly at last day for embarkation arrived troop defiled through temple of moloch where sacrifice be offered up for success of enterprise malchus under pretense that something be not ready at last moment lingered at home only joined comrade hundred young

be engaged for be whispered that hannibal have in preparation mighty enterprise troubled not at thought that many of might never look on carthage again in heart perhaps of like malchus be thinking sadly of parting have just gone through with loved sign of such thought be apparent in face conversation presently blast of trumpet sounded babel of voice be hushed a if by magic soldier fell into military order stood motionless then hamilcar walked along quay inspecting carefully group asking question of captain of ship a to store of provision water receiving from officer charged with duty list of war machine store be stored away in hull having assured that everything be in order gave signal to trumpeter who again blew long piercing blast work of embarkation at once commenced infantry be soon on board operation of shipping horse of cavalry took longer half of be stored away in hold of general ship rest in vessel when troop be on board soldier who have kept back crowd be withdrawn carthaginian thronged down on to quay small space be still kept clear on wharf by whose side admiral ship be lying here be gathered throng of aristocracy of city to see last of son relative of guard having seen horse safely stowed below young men crowded to side of ship to exchange adieu with friend parting be brief one for wind be fair general anxious to be well out of bay before therefore

slept at night on skin thick rug fortunately weather be fair be early in march night be not cold fleet hugged coast anchoring at night until northern shore stood out clear well defined a spain stretched down towards africa then crossed cruised along until arrived at carthagena short a be time have elapsed since foundation of city aspect be already imposing extensive lay at head of gulf facing south about mile in depth nearly double that width across mouth of bay be island with narrow passage on side protecting from southern wind forming with magnificent harbour on bold hill at head of harbour stood town hill rose from wide lagoon communicated on one side with sea be on other separated from only by strip of land four hundred yard wide through wide channel have be dug thus hill be of considerable extent rugged precipitous be isolated must only be attacked by sea town be built in sort of amphitheatre facing sea be surrounded by strong fortification two mile half in circumference so that even must assailant cross lagoon in summer be nearly dry must have before almost impregnable defence to carry here in building whose magnitude surprised newcomer acquainted a be with building of carthage be stored treasure baggage ammunition of war provision of army have be aim of great hamilcar of hasdrubal after to render army of spain a far a possible independent of mother country well knew how often treasury of carthage be empty owing to extravagance dishonesty of ruler how impossible must be to obtain thence supply required for army therefore established immense workshop where arm munition of war machine for siege everything required for use of army be fabricated vast a be expense of establishment revenue of iberia be amply sufficient not only to defray cost of occupation to transmit large sum to carthage revenue be derived partly from tribute paid by conquered tribe partly from spoil taken in captured city most of from mine of gold silver be at time immensely rich be worked by labour of slave taken in war of whole tribe subdued idea of richness of mine may be formed by fact that one mine hannibal have inherited from father brought in to revenue of nearly thousand pound day be one of various source of wealth be reason hamilcar hasdrubal hannibal be able to maintain in spite of intrigue of enemy in capital army be own rather than of country be to that soldier looked for pay a well a for promotion reward for valour be able therefore to carry out plan genius suggested untrammelled by order from carthage occupied indeed position very similar to of wallenstein when with army raised paid from private mean defended cause of empire against gustavus adolphus prince of protestant league be true that carthaginian general have always by side two commissioner of senate republic of carthage like first republic of france be ever jealous of general appointed commissioner to accompany on campaign to advise control movement to report on conduct many of defeat of carthaginian be due in small degree to general being hampered by interference of commissioner be present a matter of course with army of hannibal power be so great that influence over proceeding be nominal war be about to break out with rome be called second punic war must rather be named war of hannibal with rome conceived carried out from own resource without interference almost without assistance from carthage throughout war ship lay idle in harbour even in greatest need carthage never armed galley for assistance pay of army came solely from coffer material for war from arsenal constructed by father brother in law be war waged by single man against mighty power a such there be with exception of case of wallenstein nothing to resemble in history of world passing through narrow passage into harbour fleet sailed up to end of bay be soon alongside spacious quay have be erected large quantity of shipping already lay there for trade of carthagena with mother city with port of spain africa east already rivaled that of carthage group of officer be gathered on quay a hamilcar ship be leading fleet neared hamilcar exclaimed there be hannibal a ship moored alongside

have entered cavalry be well can not begin too early to accustom to war then turning went among young men of guard to of whom be personally known greeting with cordiality kindness greatly gratified malchus gazed at with admiration fortunately accurate description of hannibal have come down to be one who even at first sight won heart by lofty noble expression by kindness sincerity face expressed carthaginian a race be short hannibal be very tall great width of shoulder testified to immense strength beauty of carthaginian race be proverbial even among be remarkable head be well placed on

of galatian manufacture material be bronze shape circular in centre be conical sharply pointed bos face of shield be ornamented with subject taken from history of carthage in relief offensive arm be

suffer hardship to dare danger for sake be personal influence that alone welded army composed of men of various nationality tribe into one whole enabled to perform greatest military exploit in world history for year to sustain terrible struggle against whole power of rome chapter vi campaign in spain among young officer who have followed hannibal on board be who have left carthage only few month before be known to malchus from learned with delight that troop must take field at once be going on campaign against vacaei one of said army marched out two day since hannibal have be waiting here for arrival for fast sailing ship started few hour after brought news that be on way will set off to join rest without delay be going to be hard campaign where be country of vacaei malchus asked long way off other replied march will be long tiresome country lie somewhat to northwest of great plateau in centre of iberia will have to ascend mountain on side to cross plateau to follow river flow to great ocean vacaei in fact dwelt in land bordered by upper duero country comprising portion of old castille leon basque province journey must indeed be long difficult one hannibal be undertaking expedition not only to punish turbulent vacaei who have attacked of tribe have submitted to carthage to accustom troop to fatigue hardship to prepare for great expedition have in view time be indeed lost for a soon a troop be landed be formed up at once started on march be more than bargained for trebon young guardsman whose place in rank be next to malchus said to thought must have have at least month here before set out say city be a gay a carthage a have many friend here have looked forward to month of jollity before starting night when lay down on hard plank of deck have consoled with thought that soft bed awaited here now have to take at once to bare ground with nothing skin strapped on pommel of saddle to sleep on bernous to cover be colder already great deal than be at carthage if be so here what will be on top of jagged mountain see before why a live that highest one over there be of dazzling white must be snow have heard of rain turned solid by cold say cause pain to naked limb something like hot iron fancy having to sleep in such stuff malchus laughed at complaint of comrade confess be glad be off at once said for be sick of doing nothing idling away time at carthage suppose must be just same here how busy be street of town except for sight of mountain see through break of house one might believe one self still at home aspect of carthagena indeed closely resembled that of mother city inhabitant be of same race blood carthagena have in first place be formed by great colony of libyan inhabitant of province inhabiting seaport coast near carthage be mixture of phoenician native blood be ever impatient of supremacy of carthage rebellion be frequent often dangerous after suppression of insurrection carthage sensible of danger arising from turbulence of neighbour deported great number of to form colony vast number be sent up into soudan be then one of most important possession of republic most extensive however of forced emigration be great colony sent to found carthagena have thus in very few year under fostering genius of great hamilcar become great prosperous city carthage have thus suddenly sprung into existence after many internal trouble democracy of tyre have gained upper hand in city finding position intolerable whole of aristocracy decided to emigrate sailing with great fleet under queen dido elisa for be called by name founded carthage triumph of democracy in tyre a might be expected proved ruin of city very rapidly fell from lofty position have held place in world proud position a queen of sea be very speedily taken by carthage original libyan colony of carthagena have be very largely increased by subsequent emigration populace presented appearance very similar to of mother city save that instead of swarthy desert tribesman with passive face air of proud indifference mingling with population of town there be in carthagena large admixture of native iberian who belonging to tribe first subdued by carthage have be forced to settle here to supply manual labour needed for rising city who have voluntarily abandoned wandering life adopted more settled habitude more assured comfort of existence in great town skirting lower part of city hamilcar force marched along isthmus crossed bridge over canal cut through be soon in country beyond ground rose gradually after marching for six mile brigade be halted at spot to hannibal have when fleet be first discerned approaching along coast despatched bullock other provision for use march be short one after week confinement on board ship men be little fitted for long journey bullock other ration be served out to various company work of preparing repast began malchus be amused although rather disgusted at first experience in real campaign when with hamilcar on expedition against atarantes have formed part of father suite have lived in luxury be now simple soldier be called upon to assist to cut up bullock have fallen to share of carthaginian cavalry of party went out to cut bring in wood for fire cooking others moistened flour made dough for flat cake must be baked in hot ember eaten with meat loud shout of laughter rose a young soldier worked at unaccustomed task superintended by officer who having made several campaign be able to instruct a to duty from culinary point of view meal must not be pronounced success be indeed contrast to food to young noble be accustomed march however keen bracing air have given good appetite novelty strangeness of experience gave zest to food in spite of roughness of meal declared that have never dined better many fire be now lit round a evening closed in men gathered in group closely wrapped in bernouses be worn alike by officer men of whole of nationality serving in carthaginian army serving a cloak by day blanket at night presently trampling of horse be heard hannibal personal staff rode into encampment have not started until several hour after when having given last order made final arrangement for management of affair during absence have ridden on to join army dismounting went at once on foot among troop chatting gaily with inquiring how fared after visiting other detachment came to bivouac of carthaginian horse for hour sat talking by fire ah said a rose to go others will sleep well enough tonight sybarite accustomed to soft couch luxury will fare badly remember first

lie down will sleep a comfortably a if on soft couch many of young soldier followed be advice others among whom be malchus determined to accustom at once to hard ground malchus be not long in getting to sleep last thought being that precaution advised by hannibal to ensure repose be altogether unnecessary changed opinion when two three hour later woke up with acute pain in hip shoulder after trying vainly by changing position again to go off to sleep rose rolled up skin set to work to make excavation recommended by general then spreading out skin again lay down be astonished to find how immense be relief afforded by simple expedient at daybreak party be in motion march be long one for hannibal wished to come up with main army a soon a possible le than thirty mile be encompassed

in cold weather when descend commit terrible damage among flock thought did not know sound malchus said night be noisy enough sometimes at southern edge of desert pack of jackal with sharp yelping cry abounded then there be deeper note of hyena barking cry of troop of monkey thundering roar of lion be unpleasant enough at first used to keep one awake none of be so lugubrious a mournful howl hear now suppose sometimes when there be nothing else to do get up hunting party yes officer replied be chief amusement of garrison in winter among wild part of country of course near carthagena creature have be eradicated among mountain abound carcass of dead horse be sure to attract plenty of be sport not without danger there be many instance where party of five six have gone out taking with carcass to attract wolf have never returned search have resulted in discovery of weapon injured perhaps broken of stain of blood sign of desperate struggle of not so much a bone have remained behind thought lion hunting be exciting sport lion although may move hunt in company fight in pack a fierce brute seem to do hope day to try must like to send back two of head to hang on wall by side of of lion killed up in desert next winter may do so officer said season be nearly over now may be sure that hannibal will give enough to do without thinking of hunting wolf vacaei be fierce enough perhaps two of head must do instead of of wolf think mother sister must approve of malchus laughed so must wait for winter night did not pas so quietly a have preceded distant howling of wolf a hunted in forest kept horse in tremor of terror excitement rider be obliged over over again to rise go among by speaking to patting to allay fear so long a master be near well trained horse be quiet tractable must at

circumstance of case malchus explained that have be to meeting once being taken there by giscon being in entire ignorance of object of plot that have refused when discovered to proceed in matter hannibal hamilcar blamed severely for allowing at age to be mixed up in way in public affair so represented matter to two carthaginian commissioner with army that have written home to say that having inquired into affair found that beyond boyish imprudence in accompanying giscon to place where conspirator met malchus be not to blame in matter narrow escape that have have be lesson be not lost upon malchus hamilcar lectured sternly pointed out to that affair of nation be not to be settled by effort of handful of enthusiast grievance however great must only be righted when people at large be determined that change must be made there must be order stability in affair malchus if party of desperate men of one party be ever striving for change for revolution must be met by counter revolution

six peasant acquainted with country accustomed to chase took several cart laden with tent wine provision four day journey from carthagena took party into heart of mountain here in sheltered valley through ran stream formed camp have good sport sometimes with dog tracked bear to lair sometimes soldier made wide sweep in hill having inclosed considerable tract of forest moved forward shouting clashing arm until drove animal inclosed down through valley in malchus companion have taken post very various be game then fell before arrow javelin sometimes herd of deer must dart past then two bear with family must come along growling fiercely a went looking back angrily at disturber of peace sometimes pack of wolf with red tongue hanging out fierce snarling bark must hurry along wild boar must trot leisurely past until reached spot where hunter be posted wolf deer fell harmlessly before javelin of carthaginian bear wild boar frequently showed formidable opponent there be several desperate fight before yielded to spear sword of hunter sometimes portion of animal have killed be hung up at night from bough of tree at distance from camp to attract bear one two of party taking post in neighbouring tree must watch night for coming of beast snow be now lying thick on top of mountain wolf be plentiful among forest one day malchus two of companion have followed wounded deer far up among hill be mile away from camp when darkness began to set in think have better give up malchus said will find difficult a be to find way back have idea that be so late companion at once agreed turned face towards camp in half hour be perfectly dark under shadow of tree moon be shining position afforded mean of judging a to direction where camp lay even with such assistance be easy matter making way country be rough broken ravine have to be crossed hill ascended after pushing on for two hour halcon eldest of party said be by mean sure that be going right after have have long day work now believe will find camp tonight think have better light fire here wrap ourselves in cloak fire will scare wild beast away will be easily able to find camp in morning proposal be at once accepted stick be collected with flint steel aid of dried fungus carried in pouch fire be soon lit choice portion of deer have killed early in day be soon broiling on stick over must keep watch by turn halcon said will not do to let fire burn low for likely enough may be visited by bear before morning after eating meal chatting for time halcon companion lay down to rest malchus volunteering to keep first watch for time sat quietly occasionally throwing log on fire from store have collected in readiness presently attitude changed listened intently rose to foot several time have heard howl of wolf wandering in wood now made out long deep continuous howling listened for minute two then aroused companion there be large pack of wolf approaching said by direction of sound judge be hunting on trace of footstep be line by came down from yonder brow seems to that be ascending opposite slope yes by sound there must be very large pack of halcon agreed pile up fire set yourselves to gather more wood a quickly a possible beast in large pack be formidable foe three men set to work vigourously cutting down brushwood lopping off small bough of tree with sword divide fire in four halcon said pile fuel in centre will hardly dare to pas between fire pack be now descending slope keeping up chorus of howl short yelp sent shiver of uneasiness through malchus a wolf approached spot howling suddenly ceased see halcon said keep sharp lookout for throw away shot will need arrow before daylight standing perfectly quiet friend must hear pattering sound made by wolf foot upon fallen leaf moon have sunk now be unable to make out figure seems to malchus said in whisper can see speck of fire gleaming on bush be reflection of fire in eye halcon replied see be round there must be score of for time wolf approached closer then encouraged by silence of little group standing in centre of fire two three gray form showed in circle of light three bow twanged two of wolf fell third with howl of pain fled in darkness there be sound of snarling growling cry of pain fierce struggle then long continued snarling what be doing malchus asked with shudder believe be eating wounded comrade halcon replied have heard such be custom of savage brute see carcass of other two have disappeared already short a have be time have elapsed since have fallen other wolf have stolen out have dragged away body of two have be killed incident showed how extreme be hunger of wolf how noiseless be motion redoubled vigilance of party malchus threw handful of brushwood on to of fire must be careful of fuel halcon said must have thought of before lay down to sleep if have collected fuel enough for fire must have be safe doubt much if supply will last now till morning a hour went on attitude of wolf became more more threatening in strong body advanced close up to fire time that did so armful of fuel be thrown on a flame leaped up brightly time fell back losing several of number from arrow of little party pile of fuel be now sinking fast except when wolf advanced be necessary to let fire burn down must want four hour yet of daylight halcon said a threw on last piece of wood look round a fire blaze up see if can make out tree may be climbed must that have taken to at first instead of trusting to fire unfortunately have chosen somewhat open space of ground for encampment for brushwood grew thick among tree there be tree over there malchus said pointing to with bough six foot from ground one spring on to be safe very well halcon assented will attempt at once before fire burn low put sword into sheath sling bow arrow behind take burning brand will be better weapon in such case than sword spear now be ready now waving burning brand over head three carthaginian dashed across intervening space towards tree seemed a if wolf be conscious that prey be attempting to escape for with fierce howl sprang from bush rushed to meet undeterred by blazing brand sprang upon malchus scarce knew what passed in short fierce struggle one wolf sprang upon shield nearly brought to ground sharp bos pierced body flung from at same moment that dashed brand full in face of third sprang upon shoulder felt hot breath in face dropping brand drove dagger deep into side then hurled heavy shield among mass of wolf before took bound into midst grasping bough swung into tree sat there with leg drawn up a score of wolf leaped up towards with open mouth gave cry of horror two friend be down confused mass of struggling body alone showed where have fallen for instant hesitated debating whether must leap down strive to rescue glance below showed that must be pulled down long before must reach spot where have fallen shifting along arm until reached trunk rose to foot sent arrow vengefully into midst of struggling mass of wolf until have three four shaft left reserved a last resource there be nothing to do now sat down on branch burst into tear over fate of comrade when looked up again be quiet fierce pack have devoured not only comrade own fallen companion now sat in circle with red tongue hanging out eye fixed upon a fire gradually died out form disappeared must hear quick breathing knew that be still on watch malchus climbed tree until reached fork where must sit at ease there waited for morning when hoped that foe must disappear a gray light dawned saw still on watch a dawn brightened into day did show sign of moving when saw have intention of leaving place malchus began to consider seriously what have best do might still be for aught knew mile away from camp friend there must have mean of knowing position in be placed must doubt send out soldier in search of party in broken wilderness of forest mountain be merest chance whether must find spot where be prisoner still appeared to that be only possibility of rescue tree grew thickly together must easily have climbed from in be stationed to next might so have made way for distance a wolf be watching must see a well by night a by day there be advantage in shifting position day passed slowly wolf have for most part withdrawn from beneath tree few kept station there steadily malchus knew that rest be only lying beneath bush round for must hear frequent snarling sometimes gray head be thrust out pair of eager eye looked hungrily towards from time to time malchus listened breathlessly in hope of hearing distant shout of comrade be still in forest felt sure that wolf must hear anyone approaching before must once twice indeed fancied that by pricked ear attitude of attention must hear sound inaudible to alarm if such be soon passed away might have be that be listening only to distant footstep of stag passing through forest night came again with long dreary hour malchus strapped by belt to tree to prevent from falling managed to obtain few hour of uneasy sleep waking up time with start in cold perspiration of fear believing that be falling into hungry jaw below in morning fierce desire to kill of foe seized descended to lowest branch wolf seeing prey so close at hand thronged thickly under strove to leap up at lying down on bough twisting leg firmly under to give purchase malchus thrust sword nearly to hilt between jaw snapped fiercely a wolf sprang to within few inch of bough several be killed in way rest rendered cautious withdrew to short distance suddenly idea struck malchus took off belt formed into running noose then waited until wolf must summon up courage to attack again be not long furious with hunger prey have already devoured be only sufficient to whet wolf again approached began to spring towards bough malchus dropped noose over one of neck with effort hauled to bough despatched with dagger then moved along bough hung on branch ten foot from ground slashing open with dagger chest stomach having done returned to place six wolf be one after other so hauled up despatched a malchus expected smell of blood rendered pack more savage than ever assembled round foot of tree continued to spring at trunk making vain endeavour to get at supply of food hung tantalizingly at so short distance beyond reach so day passed a before without sign of rescue when became dark malchus again descended to lowest trunk fired three remaining arrow among wolf below loud howl followed discharge followed by desperate struggle below then tumbled from position six dead wolf to ground below then a noiselessly a possible made way along bough into adjoining tree so into till have attained distance from spot where wolf be fighting growling over remains of companion far too absorbed in work for thought of then dropped noiselessly to ground fled at top of speed must be be sure time before wolf have completed feast even must discover that be missing from tree must probably be time before must hit upon scent especially a having just feasted on blood sense of smell must for time be dulled prevision be accurate several time stopped listened in dread lest must hear distant howl must tell that pack be again on scent be quiet save for usual cry noise in forest in two hour saw distant glow of light be soon in encampment of friend why malchus comrade exclaimed a entered tent where have be two day why be splashed with blood where be halcon chalcus dead malchus said devoured by wolf cry of horror broke from three young guardsman be too true malchus went on give food wine have eaten drunk for last two day have gone through terrible time even now seem to see round countless cruel eye hungry open mouth with red tongue seeing that malchus be utterly worn exhausted companion hastened to place food drink before before asking further question malchus drank cup of wine took mouthful of bread be too faint exhausted at present to eat more have supported well terrible strain for last forty eight hour a have run through forest have not noticed how have told upon now that be safe among friend felt a weak a child for time lay upon lion skin on have thrown upon entering tent unable to reply to comrade question then a cordial began to take effect roused forced to eat more after that told friend what have happened have indeed have escape malchus how be did not take to tree at once did not think of malchus said suppose did others halcon be leader did a told thought fire must keep off who must have thought beast must have ventured to attack have always heard be terrible one of others said must have thought that three armed men must have be match for number of must have be a much a thirty must have done to withstand malchus replied did not seem to care for life sought only to slay there be hundred hundred of must rather march alone to assault of walled city than face terrible beast in morning whole party started for scene of encounter malchus have difficulty in discovering at last after searching long time came upon ground beneath tree be everywhere trampled torn by wolf in struggle be spotted with patch of dry blood helmet shield arm of halcon chalcus lay there not remnant of bone remained few fragment of skin closely gnawed skull alone testified to wolf have fallen in encounter arm be gathered up party returned to camp next day started for carthagena for after experience none cared for further hunting be week before malchus completely recovered from effect of strain have undergone night be disturbed restless must constantly start from couch thinking that heard howl of wolf sudden noise made start turn pale seeing how shaken young kinsman be what have passed through hannibal sent several time in ship be going across to africa for store did not venture to send to carthage for although influence with commissioner have be sufficient to annul order of council for sending of malchus a prisoner there be probable that be to return must be seized put to death not for supposed crime have committed to gratify hatred of hanno against adherent sea voyage soon restored malchus to accustomed health trained disciplined a body have be by constant exercise nerve be not easily shaken soon recovered tone when early in march rejoined regiment be able to enter with zest energy into preparation hannibal be making for siege of saguntum difficult a operation must be preparation be being made appeared enormous week ship brought over reinforcement of troop iberian contingent be largely increased one day malchus entered apartment where father hannibal be talking earnestly together with large map spread out before must have retired at once hannibal called in come in malchus must have secret from although be young know that be devoted to carthage that be brave determined see in what be at age nine year ago may be that day will be destined to continue work be beginning too have commenced early training have be severe a father son cousin promotion will naturally be rapid will therefore tell plan be clear that rome carthage can not exist one other must be destroyed be useless to strike at extremity blow must be dealt at heart unfortunately fleet be no longer superior to of rome victory at sea however important only temporarily cripple enemy be by land blow must be struck be sea ours must say land troop in southern italy continue to pour over reinforcement until fighting men of north africa be at gate of rome without absolute command of sea can not be done therefore intend to make spain base to march through southern gaul over alp into italy there to fight roman on own ground already have agent at work among gaul northern tribe of italy who will trust join in war against common enemy enterprise be great one be not impossible if succeeds rome will be destroyed carthage will reign without rival mistress of world plan be hasdrubal have fallen to to carry out be grand plan indeed malchus exclaimed enthusiastically glorious plan difficulty seem tremendous difficulty be made to be overcome by brave men hannibal said alp be greatest barrier agent tell that difficulty be not insuperable even for elephant before start have spain to subdue saguntum be under protection of rome must be crushed country north of ebro conquered pacified done passage of reinforcement to army in italy will be easy gaul will favour mountain tribe will be crushed bought over so that route for advance of reinforcement for retreat if too hardly pressed will be always open be for alone plan must not yet be known already enemy in carthage be gaining in strength many of adherent have be put to death estate of others confiscated capture of saguntum will restore supremacy enthusiasm will incite among populace will carry before spoil will be taken there will be sufficient to silence murmur in carthage now leave malchus have much to talk over to arrange have given plenty to think about for present chapter viii plot frustrated after leaving hannibal malchus did not rejoin comrade mounted hill behind town sat down there looking over sea thinking over vast plan hannibal word have laid before to father have once alluded in presence malchus have be brought up by hamilcar to regard rome a deadly enemy of carthage have not till now seen truth hannibal have grasped that be struggle not for empire only between two republic one of life death carthage rome must not coexist that one other of must be absolutely destroyed indeed be creed of barcine party be apart from minor question of internal reform great point on differed from hanno trading portion of community who be chief supporter be in favour of carthage abandoning colony conquest devoting solely to commerce acquisition of wealth believing that rome who must then have open to europe asia to conquer must not grudge to carthage northern seaboard of africa forgot that nation be rich defenceless will speedily fall victim to greed of powerful warlike neighbour that conqueror never need excuse for attack upon defenceless neighbour hitherto malchus have thought only of war with rome made up of sea fight of descent upon sicily sardinia very idea of invading italy striking at rome have never even entered mind for word of father have be forgotten in event followed so quickly upon prospect word opened seemed immense first northern spain be to be conquered gaul to be crossed terrible mountain of have heard from traveller be next to be surmounted finally fight for life death to be fought out on plain of italy struggle must indeed be tremendous one malchus felt heart beat fast at thought that be to be actor in surely history of world told of greater enterprise than even first step be to be taken mere preliminary to grand expedition be most formidable one saguntum stood a outpost of rome while carthage have be advancing from south rome have be pressing forward from east along shore of mediterranean have planted firmly at marseille port gave foothold in gaul formed base whence must act in spain in order to check rising power of carthaginian there have entered into firm alliance with saguntines whose country occupied what be now district of valencia by term of last treaty between two republic be forbidden to make war upon tribe in alliance with rival saguntum being thus under jurisdiction of rome attack upon must be almost equivalent to declaration of war position of city be one of great strength stood on almost isolated rock at foot of spur of mountain formed amphitheatre behind around extended rich fertile country sea be le than mile from wall roman must thus quickly send succour to ally rock on town stood be well nigh inaccessible falling sheer down from foot of wall be assailable only on western side where rock sloped gradually down to plain here wall be extremely strong lofty be strengthened by great tower dominated whole slope must be difficult to form approach for rock be bare of soil afforded cover of kind hitherto carthaginian general have scrupulously respected territory of saguntines now that rest of spain be subdued be necessary to reduce advanced post of rome open door through rome now mistress of sea must at moment pour legion into heart of spain saguntines be not ignorant of danger threatened have again again sent urgently to rome to demand that legion must be stationed there for protection rome hesitated at despatching legion of troop to so distant spot where in case of naval reverse must be isolated cut off hannibal have not far to look for excuse for attack upon saguntum on previous year while have be engaged in campaign against carpatans saguntines taking advantage of critical position have made war upon town of torbola ally of carthage torbola have implored assistance of hannibal be now preparing to march against saguntum with whole force without waiting for arrival of spring preparation have be silently made saguntines although uneasy have idea of imminent danger carthaginian army collected in around carthagena be in entire ignorance that be about to be called upon to take field what say malchus hannibal asked that evening be time now that gave command a near relative be fitting that must be in authority have now served campaign be eligible for command may give have shown prompt in danger worthy to command men must rather must place under company of giant gaul of steady iberian of well disciplined libyan active tribesman of desert choose will will be yours malchus thought for time in day of battle said at last must rather lead gaul in such march a have told be meditating must rather have company of numidian footman to act a scout feel way for army there must not perhaps be so much glory to be obtained there must be constant work excitement will be far better than marching in long column of army think choice be good one hannibal replied corp will be needed to feel way a advance to examine road indicate that by column have best move to guard against ambush surprise tomorrow will inspect numidian footman will put through exercise will have foot race trial of skill with bow will bid officer pick out two hundred of most active vigourous among will have under command can choose among comrade of guard one whom must like to have a lieutenant will take trebon malchus said fought side by side through last campaign be prompt active always cheerful under fatigue a brave a lion must not wish better comrade so be hannibal replied henceforth be captain of advanced company of army remember malchus that responsibility be great one henceforward there must be no more boyish trick company will be eye of army upon vigilance safety when once start upon expedition will in slight degree depend remember too that have by conduct to justify in choosing young kinsman for so important post next day numidian be put through exercise by two hundred picked men be chosen from rank be placed by hannibal under command of malchus trebon be greatly pleased when found appointed a lieutenant of company although of noble family connection be much le influential than of majority of comrade have deemed exceptionally fortunate in having be permitted to enter chosen corp of carthaginian cavalry have not expected to be made officer for year to come since promotion in carthaginian army be almost wholly matter of family influence be indeed obliged to malchus said a joined friend after hannibal have announced appointment to general told that have appointed at request never even hoped that such good fortune must befall of course knew that must speedily obtain command people have influence whatever general say that company be to act a scout for army so there will be plenty of opportunity to distinguish unfortunately see much chance of fighting at present iberian tribesman have lesson last autumn that be not likely for long time to give further trouble make uneasy on score trebon malchus said can tell let go further that ere long there will be fighting enough to satisfy even most pugnacious one evening malchus have left club early full a be of thought of tremendous struggle be soon to begin between great antagonist wearied of light talk of gay comrade game of chance to room in club be allotted afforded pleasure have interest in wagering be going on a to merit of horse be to run in race on following day on leaving club directed footstep towards top of hill on carthagena stood there sitting alone on one of highest point looked over sea sparkling in moonlight many vessel in harbour lagoon stretching inland on side of city tried to imagine course that army be to follow terrible journey through snow covered pass of tremendous range of mountain of have heard descent into plain of italy first sight of rome pictured to battle must have to be fought by way above deadly conflict must take place before rome must be carried by assault great rival of carthage be humbled to dust then pictured return of triumphant expedition shouting multitude who must acclaim hannibal sole arbitrator of destiny of carthage in heart rejoiced over change must take place overthrow of faction of hanno reform of abuse commencement of era of justice freedom prosperity for for more than three hour sat thus then awoke to fact that night be cold hour late drawing bernous tightly round descended into city be now for most part wrapped in sleep be passing through native quarter when door opened several men came out scarcely knowing why did so malchus drew back into doorway until have moved on ahead of then followed at little distance at other time must have thought nothing of such incident nerve be highly strung at moment pause be dictated more by indisposition to encounter anything might disturb current of thought than by other motive in moonlight must see that two of five men ahead of be member of carthaginian horse guard for light glittered on helmet other three be by attire native two of latter soon separated from others on reaching better part of town two carthaginian turned down side street in still night malchus heard parting word to neighbour at same place tomorrow night remaining native kept straight along road malchus be following still onward went malchus to surprise saw go up to one of side entrance to hannibal palace must have knocked very quietly someone must have be waiting to admit for without sound door be opened man entered malchus went round to principal entrance after little badinage from officer on guard a to lateness of hour at returned made way to apartment be puzzled by what have seen be strange that two of carthaginian guard men necessarily belonging to noble family must have be at native gathering of sort in upper town strange too that man probably attendant slave belonging to palace must also have be present more thought of more be puzzled to account for before went to sleep came to resolution that must if possible on following night discover object of such gathering next evening therefore returned from syssite early exchanged helmet for skullcap wrapping in cloak made way to house from have seen men come forth stood at corner of street thick hanging hung across opening for window prevented even ray of light from finding way out listening attentively malchus must hear low hum of voice within a there be still people about moved away for hour on return street be deserted malchus put hand through window opening into side street felt that hanging be composed of rush tightly plaited together with point of dagger very cautiously cut slit in applying eye to be able to obtain glimpse of apartment within on low stool by fire two carthaginian be sitting while four native be seated on rush covered floor malchus recognized carthaginian at once for be member of troop in have served neither of be men popular among fellow for belonged to family closely related to hanno have always however professed greatest admiration for hannibal have declared that for part altogether repudiated doings of party to family belonged conversation be carried on in low tone precaution absolutely necessary in day when glass window be unknown unless discourse be upon general subject malchus listened attentively although thought caught word hanno hannibal repeated several time be unable to hear more at end of half hour conference be apparently at end for rose to foot one of carthaginian put bag be evidently heavy into hand of one of native party then went out malchus stepped to corner caught word tomorrow night then without fail party then separated carthaginian passing straight on native waiting until have gone little distance ahead before followed malchus remained for little time in side street before sallied out took way after after saw two of native leave other quickened step passed man who proceeded alone towards palace short distance before arrived there a did so glanced at face recognized a one of attendant who waited at hannibal table malchus did not turn head however kept straight on way entered palace a usual malchus captain of guard laughed a went in assuredly will have to tell hamilcar of doings last night entered hour after one have retired to rest tonight be back in better time assuredly have not be to syssite in hunting cap savour of mystery pretend to that have be looking after company of numidian at time of night because did swear by astarte must not believe think must invent better story than if be put to malchus said with laugh a be not obliged to invent one at will leave to do so for in truth have be about private business what that business be be profound secret secret of state doubt officer rejoined well will say nothing time let occur again will think that iberian maiden have captured that susceptible heart of yours after malchus have reached chamber sat down for time in deep thought be clear to that something be wrong secret meeting of two carthaginian with native one of whom be employed in hannibal household must mean good money have passed too judging from size apparent weight of bag inconsiderable amount what must mean be few month before hasdrubal have fallen beneath dagger of native servant must be plot against life of hannibal two carthaginian be connected with hanno might well be agent employed to rid of great rival yet have heard nothing must justify bringing so grave accusation against men money have seen exchanged might be for price of horse of slave might only make ridiculous be to speak to hannibal father a to what have occurred decided therefore that action might take must be on own account if word have overheard meant anything if plot be really on hand be to be carried out on following night malchus determined to take step to meet next day took trebon into counsel told of mysterious meeting have accidentally discovered there be free access to hannibal palace officer be constantly coming in out soldier arriving leaving with message order malchus have therefore have difficulty in passing into apartment one by one ten picked men of company have order to remain there perfectly quiet trebon also took post with malchus telling to make excuse other to prevent attendant slave from entering apartment while be absent there be concert evening palace be crowded with guest from time to time malchus stole away to room where numidian be seated on ground silent immovable a so many bronze statue at other time kept near hannibal watching closely movement of native who passed near ready to spring forward instantly if saw sign of evil intention however did not much apprehend that even if suspicion be correct plot be on foot against hannibal attempt must be made to assassinate in midst of crowded assembly where there must be possibility of escape for perpetrator of such deed at last guest began to depart hour later be quiet in palace laying aside sandal malchus stole noiselessly over marble pavement until approached entrance have twice seen opened so late slave be lying close to unobserved malchus stole away again to chamber bade numidian follow noiselessly troop of barefooted arab moved shadowlike through lofty hall corridor two of placed at entrance to chamber where hannibal slept with order to allow one to pas until returned then with others proceeded to entrance few light only be burning in passage be not until be close at hand that slave perceived approaching figure leaped to foot before must cry out malchus stepped forward said silence if value life know be malchus son of hamilcar now tell truth tomorrow torture will wring from who placed here why carpadon one of chief attendant ordered to remain here to admit on return knew not there be harm in slave said be first time have kept watch for purpose lord six seven time have gone out late do know cause of absence lord must not become slave to question one of chief attendant of lord hannibal a to why go come man manner be so natural surprise at interest one of rank of malchus showed in doings of attendant so genuine that malchus be convinced knew nothing of enterprise in man who have placed there might be engaged very well said will believe what tell now do resume place at door open a usual at signal say word make sign may lead to know of presence here mind eye will be upon life will pay for treachery malchus with four of men now took post on one side of door standing well back in shadow so presence must not be noticed by anyone entering trebon with remaining four men took up similar position on other side of doorway two hour passed at length low tap followed by two others be heard at door slave at once opened carpadon entered with sudden movement threw one arm round slave neck with other stabbed to heart then opened door wide said in low tone enter be safe in moment dark mass of men poured in at door matter be more serious than malchus have expected have looked for entry perhaps of three four men have intended to close in behind cut off here be score at least how many more might be outside knew not therefore gave signal by shouting carthage at once with follower fell upon one flank of native for such dress showed to be while trebon attacked on other there be shout of surprise alarm at unexpected onslaught several be cut down at once others drawing sword began to defend trying at same time to retreat to door through however many others be still pressing in for few minute severe fight went on number desperation of carpadon follower began to tell in spite of effort of malchus numidian must have be forced to fall back allow others to pas out have not help be at hand shouting clashing of weapon have awakened palace officer of guard with ten of men of bearing torch came running at full speed from post at chief entrance a guard came up stood gazing uncertain what to do among whom conflict be raging malchus for moment drew out from fray seize disarm native said numidian be here by order instant soldier understood situation fell to native whose retreat be cut off by numidian be speedily disarmed nearer to door have instant saw torch approaching taken to flight moment later hannibal hamilcar many other officer resident at palace came running up what mean fray malchus mean attempt upon life hannibal have be fortunate enough to discover defeat who be men hamilcar asked so far a know be native malchus replied chief of party be that man who lie bleeding there be one of attendant one of soldier held torch close to man face be carpadon hannibal said believed honest faithful be tool of others hannibal have be well paid for night work hannibal gave order for prisoner to be strictly guarded then with hamilcar malchus returned to private study lamp be lighted by attendant who then withdrew now malchus tell story hannibal said seems strange to that must have said nought to father of what have learned left to take such measure a might seem fit to instead of taking matter into own hand have have certainty to go upon must assuredly have done so a will see when tell have learned have nothing suspicion of vaguest for aught knew might be altogether in wrong malchus then gave full detail of manner in suspicion have be first excited in on previous night have taken step to ascertain whether there be foundation for see concluded there be sort of certainty nothing to prove that money be not paid for purchase of horse slave be only one fact that one of party be servant here rendered what discovered serious have not be for fate of hasdrubal must never have given matter second thought knowing that be assassinated by trusted servant seeing two men whose family knew belonged to hanno faction engaged in secret talk with one of attendant suspicion struck that similar deed might again be attempted only word have to go upon be 'tomorrow night then without fail ' be not enough for to bring accusation against two men of noble family have told tale without confirmation have now received must probably have treated lightly resolved therefore to wait see taking such precaution that harm must come of secrecy concealed in room ten of numidian with lieutenant trebon ample force might betide if a suspected man intended with two three others to steal into chamber slay while slept must at once have stopped attempt must come with larger force must a be proved resist until guard arrived on spot if on other hand night passed off quietly suspicion proved to be altogether erroneous must escape ridicule must certainly have be forthcoming have alarmed without cause have acted very wisely well son hamilcar said carthage owes life of beloved hannibal indeed reasoned with great wisdom forethought have informed of what have discovered must have taken precaution must doubtless have effected object must probably have become known to plotter attempt must have be postponed attempted other time perhaps with success what say hannibal have not reason to be proud of young son of mine have indeed hamilcar deeply be indebted to be not life care for although now be precious to for sake of beloved imilce have fallen now plan have thought of together must have be frustrated fairest chance carthage ever have of fighting out quarrel with rival must have be destroyed truly have be marvellous escape seems to that god must have inspired malchus to act a did on such slight ground a seeing two carthaginian of guard in company with three four native at late hour of evening what do think will be best to do with traitor who have plotted against life hannibal will try execute here send to carthage to be dealt with hannibal did not answer for minute think hamilcar best plan will be to keep silent altogether a to danger have run army must be furious must at same time be dispirited be known in carthage that two of noble have be executed for attempt on life must only cause fresh outbreak of animosity even deadlier feud than before between hanno friend ours therefore say let men taken tonight be executed in morning without question asked let word be said by by that be bribed by carthaginian in palace now know that party of native have broken in will guess that life be object there be need that must know more a to two men will call before tomorrow with none present will let know that be aware that be author of attempt will bid resign place in guard return at once to carthage grief that must go unpunished hamilcar said doubtless plan be wisest then hannibal said rising will to bed again malchus acquaint trebon of determination silence be to be kept tell that will bear in mind not forget share in night work a for malchus henceforth be more than cousin have saved life will never forget will tell imilce in morning of danger have passed for be sure to come to ear will know better than do how to thank accordingly in morning hannibal order be carried out twelve native taken prisoner be beheaded without of usual torture must have be inflicted upon similar occasion le than fourteen others have be killed in fight two carthaginian noble be sent for by hannibal came prepared to die for knew already by rumour that attempt have failed doubted not when summons reached that carpadon have denounced a accomplice went to certain doom with courage of class pale perhaps otherwise unmoved hannibal be alone with hamilcar when entered that assassination be not altogether unknown crime in carthage said quietly be well aware did not before think that noble in carthaginian horse must stoop to know that be who provided gold for payment of men who made attempt upon life that personally paid attendant carpadon to hire assassin to lead to chamber be to denounce soldier must tear in piece very name of family must be held accursed by honest men in carthage for time ask whether have given cause for offence for know have not done so acted simply for benefit of hanno whether be instructed by deign to ask will not harm tale of infamy be known to four person none others will ever know be proud of honour of noble of carthage must not that scum of people must bandy name of family on lip a guilty of so foul act of treason will of course at once resign position in carthaginian horse make what pretext will illness private affair tomorrow sail for carthage there strive by effort for good of country to efface remembrance of blow must have struck so saying with wave of hand dismissed went without word too astonished at clemency too humiliated by own disgrace even to utter word of thanks when be fairly beyond palace looked at other a men awakened from dream what man one of exclaimed wonder soldier adore have given life more have saved name from disgrace henceforth pontus at least can never again take part against be almost too much to bear other said feel must rather that have ordered to instant execution ay for own sake pontus not for of others for will retire to country seems to that never again will be able to mix with others may know nothing of will be ever on mind how must shrink back in horror be what have done whispered to truly be not for family must prefer death with worst torture to life a will be now excitement in army be intense when became known that body of iberian have attempted to break into hannibal palace with design of murdering many of soldier seizing arm hurried towards city have not officer ridden with news to hannibal must assuredly have fallen upon native inhabitant general massacre must have taken place hannibal at once mounted rode out to meet soldier be received with enthusiastic acclamation at length raised arm to restore silence then addressed troop telling how deeply valued evidence of affection that prayed to return to camp lay by arm must not said confound innocent with guilty who be concerned in attempt have paid penalty with life be not because handful of spaniard have plotted against that be to swear hatred against whole race be to punish innocent for guilty must arouse fury of iberian throughout whole peninsula work must have to be done over again know that above thing desire friendship goodwill of native nothing must grieve more than just a be attaining effort must be marred by quarrel between yourselves people here pray therefore a personal favour to to abstain from tumult go quietly back to camp attack upon palace be made only by thirty forty of scum of inhabitant attempt be defeated by wisdom courage of young cousin malchus whom must henceforth regard a saviour of life soldier at once acceded to request of general after outburst of cheering returned quietly to camp result of affair be to render malchus one of most popular personage in army lad be quite abashed by enthusiastic reception soldier gave when passed among removed too feeling of jealousy might have existed among former comrade of carthaginian horse for although be considered a matter of course in carthage that general must appoint near relative to post of high command human nature be then same a now men not possessed of high patronage must not help grumbling little at promotion of more fortunate than henceforth however voice be ever raised against promotion of malchus have at once be appointed to command of importance none must have deemed favour undeserved by youth who have saved life of hannibal chapter ix siege of saguntum few day later carthaginian army be astonished by issue of order that whole be to be in readiness to march upon following day greatest excitement arose when news got abroad none knew against whom hostility be to be directed one have heard aught of arrival of messenger announcing fresh insurrection among recently conquered tribe sort of surmise be indulged in a to foe against whom great force largest have ever be collected by carthage be about to get in motion army now gathered around carthagena amounted indeed to hundred fifty thousand men much surprise have for time existed at continual arrival of reinforcement from home at large number of troop have during winter be raised disciplined from among friendly tribe simultaneously with issue of order long line of wagon laden with military store began to pour out from arsenal day long procession of cart moved across bridge over canal in isthmus to mainland tent be struck at daylight baggage loaded up into wagon told off to accompany various body of soldier troop formed up in military order when hannibal rode on to ground surrounded by principal officer shout of welcome rose from army proceeded to make close inspection of whole force officer then placed at head of respective command trumpet gave signal army set out on march a to whose direction distance few present have idea from few indeed be ever destined to return there be longer occasion for secrecy a to object of expedition general repeated to immediate staff informed other officer news speedily spread through army that be marching against importance of news be felt by saguntum be near ally of rome attack upon city must mean carthage be entering upon struggle with great rival saguntum lay about mile north of carthagena army have to cross range of mountain now known a sierra morena run across peninsula from cape st vincent on west to cape st martin on east march of so large army impeded a be by huge train of wagon with store machine necessary for siege be toilsome arduous in extreme worked with greatest enthusiasm diligence road be made with immense labour through forest across ravine over mountain stream hannibal be always present encouraging men by praise sharing hardship at last mountain be passed army poured down into fertile plain of valencia town however be not then in existence passing over site where be now situated continued march north until saguntum standing on rocky eminence came into view during march malchus company have led way guided by native who pointed out easiest path a there be enemy to be guarded against have taken full share in labour of army saguntines be already aware of approach of expedition sooner have crossed crest of mountain than native runner have carried news of approach inhabitant have spent intervening time in laying in great store of provision in making preparation for defence garrison be small in comparison with force marching against be ample for defence of wall for position rendered city well nigh impregnable against machine in use at time be formidable in extreme even against modern artillery for year afterwards saguntum with garrison of men resisted for long time effort of french army under general suchet a soon a force arrived near town hannibal rode forward in accordance with custom of time summoned garrison to surrender upon refusal solemnly declared war by hurling javelin against wall troop at once advanced to assault poured flight of arrow mass of stone from machine javelin missile of description into city defender replying with equal vigour from wall at end of first day fighting hannibal perceived that hope of carrying place by assault be vain for wall be too high to be scaled too thick to be shaken by irregular attack that long siege must be undertaken be great disappointment to a must cause long delay that must be scarce possible to commence march meditated summer a to advancing with saguntum in rear be not to be thought of for roman must be able to land army there to cut off from communication with carthagena carthage there be then nothing to be done to undertake siege in regular order army formed encampment in circle round town strong force be left to prevent garrison from making sortie whole of troop be then marched away in detachment to hill to fell bring down timber must be required for tower wall bareness of rock rendering impossible to construct approach a usual with earth in first place wall strengthened by numerous small tower be erected round whole circumference of rock then approach be begun on western side where attack be alone possible be done by line of wooden tower connected one with by wall of same material movable tower be constructed to be pushed forward against great tower formed chief defence of wall on side line of attack be carried onward by portable screen covered with thick hide in meantime saguntines be not idle shower of missile of description be hurled upon working party great rock from machine on wall crashed through wooden erection frequent desperate sortie be made in carthaginian be almost always worsted nature of ground overlooked a be by lofty tower wall swept by missile of defender rendered impossible for considerable force to remain close at hand to render assistance to worker sudden attack of saguntines several time drove far down hillside enabled besieged with axe fire to destroy much of work have be so labouriously carried out in one of sortie hannibal who be continually at front overlooking work be seriously wounded by javelin in thigh until be cured siege languished be converted into blockade for be presence influence alone encouraged men to continue work under such extreme difficulty involving death of large proportion of engaged upon hannibal recovery work be pressed forward with new vigour screen tower be pushed on almost to foot of wall battering ram be now brought up shielded by massive screen protected who worked from dart stone thrown down by enemy by lofty tower from whose top carthaginian archer engaged saguntines on wall began work construction of wall be in day rude primitive have little of solidity of such structure in succeeding age stone be very roughly shaped mortar be used displacement of one stone consequently involved that of several others being case be not long before heavy battering ram of carthaginian produced effect on wall large breach be speedily made three tower wall connected fell with mighty crash besieger believing that place be won advanced to assault saguntines met in breach for hour desperate battle raged there saguntines hurled down upon assailant trunk of tree bristling with spearhead spike of iron blazing dart falariques great block of wood with projecting spike covered thickly with mass of pitch sulphur set on fire touched other specie of falariques be in form of spindle shaft wrapped round with flax dipped in pitch hannibal fought at head of troop with desperate bravery have narrow escape of being crushed by enormous rock fell at foot in spite of effort of troop be unable to carry breach at nightfall fell back to camp having suffered very heavy loss singularly enough french column be repulsed in effort to carry breach at almost same spot spaniard hurling among stone hand grenade of glass bottle shell defending breach with long pike against effort of suchet troop day passed before attack be renewed a troop be worn out by labour strong guard in meantime held advanced work against sortie of saguntines on side worked night day by time carthaginian again advanced wall be rebuilt breach closed hannibal have also be busy seeing that be impossible for troop to win entrance by breach a long a saguntines occupied point commanding caused vast tower to be built sufficiently lofty to overlook point of defence arming of stage with catapult ballista also built near wall great terrace of wood higher than wall from from tower poured such torrent of missile into town that defender must no longer remain upon wall five hundred arab miner now advanced setting to work with implement soon loosened lower stone of wall again fell with mighty crash breach be opened carthaginian at once swarmed in took possession of wall while besieger have be constructing castle terrace saguntines have built interior wall hannibal saw confronted with fresh line of defence a preparation be being made for attack of new defence messenger arrived saying that carpatans orotans furious at heavy levy of men have be demanded from for army have revolted leaving maharbal to conduct siege in absence hannibal hurried away with portion of force returned in two month having put down revolt severely punished tribesman while siege have be continuing roman have be making vain effort to induce carthaginian to desist sooner have operation commenced than agent from roman senate waited on hannibal begged to abandon siege hannibal treated remonstrance with disdain at same time writing to carthage to say that be absolutely necessary that people of saguntum who be insolent hostile relying on protection of rome must be punished envoy then went to carthage where made animated protest against what regarded a unprovoked attack upon ally rome in fact be anxious at moment to postpone struggle with carthage for same reason that hannibal be anxious to press on have just finished long struggle with gaulish tribe of northern italy be anxious to recover strength before engaged in war be for very reason that hannibal desired to force on struggle friend at carthage persuaded senate to refuse to listen to envoy of rome embassy be sent to hannibal general must not give interview following instruction have received ambassador then sailed to carthage to make formal demand for reparation for person of hannibal to be delivered over to for punishment barcine party be for moment in ascendancy long negotiation took place led to nothing time condition of saguntines be becoming more desperate five new ambassador be therefore sent from rome to ask in name of republic whether hannibal be authorized by carthaginian to lay siege to saguntum to demand that must be delivered to rome in case of refusal to declare war carthaginian senate met in temple of moloch there received roman ambassador q fabius chief man of embassy briefly laid demand of rome before senate cestar one of barcine leader replied refusing demand fabius then rose give choice peace war choose carthaginian cried then choose war fabius said so be assembly shouted thus war be formally declared between two republic saguntum have now fallen second wall have be breached by time hannibal have returned from expedition assault be ordered a before saguntines fought desperately after long struggle carthaginian succeeded in winning footing upon wall saguntines seeing that further resistance be vain that besieger have already won breach that there be chance of assistance from rome having moreover consumed last provision sought for term halcon saguntine general noble spaniard named alorcus on part of hannibal met in breach alorcus named condition hannibal have imposed that saguntines must restore to torbolates territory have taken from that inhabitant giving up good treasure must then be permitted to leave town to found new city at spot hannibal must name saguntines who be crowding round heard term many of principal senator at once left place hurrying into house carried gold silver have there also of in public treasury into forum piling up vast heap of wood set alight threw into flame act caused tremendous commotion in city general tumult broke out hannibal seeing that term be refused poured troop across breach after short desperate fight captured city in accordance with cruel custom of time however be rarely carried into effect by hannibal male prisoner be put to sword a on occasion considered necessary to strike terror into inhabitant of spain to inflict lesson must not be forgotten during absence in country siege have lasted eight month booty taken be enormous soldier in army have rich share of plunder vast sum be sent to carthage besides treasure chest of army be filled up spanish troop have leave given to return to home for winter dispersed highly satisfied with booty with be laden be most politic step on part of young general a tribesman seeing wealth with countryman returned no longer felt hardship to fight in carthaginian rank levy called out in spring went willingly even eagerly hannibal returned with african troop to spend winter at carthagena be there joined by emissary have sent to examine southern gaul pass of alp to determine most practicable route for march of army to form alliance with tribe of southern gaul northern italy report be favourable for have found greatest discontent existing among tribe north of apennines who have recently be conquered by roman chief smarting under heavy yoke of rome listened eagerly to offer of hannibal agent who distributed large sum of money among promised in return for assistance not only freedom from conqueror full share in spoil of rome chief replied that must render assistance to carthaginian a soon a passed alp that must then join with force report a to pass of alp be le satisfactory who have examined found that difficulty offered to passage of army be enormous that tribe who inhabited lower pass having suffered in way yet at hand of rome must probably resist army endeavouring to cross by far easiest route must be to follow seashore be barred against carthaginian by fact that massilians people of marseille be close ally of rome have admitted roman colonist among carried on extensive trade with capital town be strong port must be open to roman fleet tribe in neighourhood be closely allied with hannibal saw at once that must not advance by route by sea without first reducing marseille must be even more difficult operation than siege of saguntum a rome must be able to send number of men by sea to aid of besieged great struggle must be fought out in southern gaul instead of a wished in italy thus decided to march by route must take far north of marseille even although must necessitate passage through terrible pass of alp during winter hannibal laboured without intermission in preparing for expedition be ever among soldier personally saw to everything must conduce to comfort well being took lively interest in minute detail affected saw that clothing be abundant of good quality inspected ration saw that be well cooked be personal attention to want of soldier a much a genius a general personal valour brilliant quality endeared to troop saw how anxious be for welfare felt that regarded man in army a friend comrade in return be ready to respond to appeal to make sacrifice to endure to suffer to fight to death for beloved leader troop be mercenary be fought for pay in cause in way concerned personal affection for general supplied in place of patriotism inspires modern soldier transformed semi barbarous tribesman into troop fit to cope with trained legionary of rome hannibal be far in advance of of general of time in matter of organization commissariat be a perfect a of modern army be duty to collect grain from country through army marched to form magazine to collect drive with troop herd of cattle to take over provision booty brought in by foraging party to see to daily distribution of ration among various division along line of communication depot be formed where provision clothing arm be stored in readiness for use from whole army must in case of necessity be supplied with fresh clothing shoe band of surgeon accompanied army at head of whom be synhalus one of most celebrated physician of time so perfect be arrangement that be said that throughout long campaign in italy not single day passed that troop elephant animal of description accompanying army received daily ration of food chapter x beset during winter hannibal made preparation to ensure tranquillity of spain while be absent in order to lessen number of possible enemy there raised body of twelve hundred horse fourteen thousand infantry from among most turbulent tribe sent across to africa to serve a garrison in carthage other point while equal number of african troop be brought over to garrison spain of hasdrubal hannibal brother be to have government during absence hanno able general be to command force be to be left in southern gaul to keep open communication between pyrenees alp while youngest brother mago youth of about same age a malchus be to accompany to italy hannibal wife child have be born in preceding spring be sent by ship to carthage in early spring march commenced army following coast line until reached mouth of ebro mountainous broken country lying between river pyrenees now known a catalonia be inhabited by fierce tribe unconquered a yet by roman carthaginian conquest presented enormous difficulty there be coherence between people valley mountain be stronghold to be defended desperately until last inhabitant accustomed to mountain be hardy active vigourous ready to oppose desperate resistance so long a resistance be possible then to flee across hill at speed defied fleetest of pursuer man be soldier at first alarm inhabitant of village abandoned house buried grain having driven away cattle into almost inaccessible recess among hill returned to oppose invader conquest of such people be one of most difficult of undertaking a french general of napoleon afterwards discovered to cost cruelty of mountaineer be equal to courage lapse of two thousand year changed little for in long struggle against french massacred detachment whom must surprise among hill murdered wounded who fell into hand poisoned well grain army hannibal have brought to foot of country through have to pas amounted to men of be cavalry infantry force passed ebro in three body of equal strength native opposed desperate resistance three column pressed forward on parallel line town be besieged captured after two month of desperate fighting catalonia be subdued conquest cost hannibal twenty one thousand men fifth of whole army hanno be for time left here with ten thousand infantry thousand cavalry be to suppress fresh rising to hold large town to form magazine for army to keep open pass of pyrenees fixed headquarters at operation be facilitated by fact that along line of sea coast be number of phoenician colony who be natural ally of carthaginian aided in way in power before advancing through pass of pyrenees hannibal still further reduced strength of force by weeding out who have in conflict among mountain shown wanting in personal strength in military quality giving leave to return home advanced at head of fifty thousand picked infantry nine thousand cavalry company under malchus have rendered good service during campaign of catalonia have accompanied column marching by seashore with be elephant treasure heavy baggage of army have throughout be in advance of column feeling way protecting from ambush dispersing small body of tribesman who might have placed on height whence with arrow sling must harass column on march company have lost comparatively few men in campaign for have taken part in various siege duty however be severe in extreme men be ever on watch scouting country round while army be engaged in siege operation sometimes ascending mountain whence must command view over interior pursuing band of tribesman to refuge among hill severely a malchus have trained in exercise found at first difficult to support fatigue of life day muscle hardened by end of campaign be able to keep on foot a long a hardest of men one day have followed party of tribesman far up among mountain enemy have scattered arab in hot pursuit have also broken up into small party malchus kept eye upon man who appeared to be chief of enemy party pressing hotly upon brought to bay on face of steep rugged gorge only one of numidian be at hand man named nessus who be greatly attached to young leader always kept close to in expedition savage bulky heavy man finding must no longer keep ahead of fleet footed pursuer took post at narrow point in path where one must oppose there with heavy sword drawn awaited attack malchus advanced to meet sword in hand when arrow from nessus whizzed past struck chief in throat body fell heavily down rock be not fair malchus said angrily must fain have fought hand to hand arab bowed head lord said combat must not have be even man have upper ground must have fought at grievous disadvantage why must risk life in fight with sword when arrow have answered purpose what must have said if have gone back without what satisfaction must have be to to avenge fall what must have said to when told that looked on idly while engaged in such struggle valour be valour know that lord be bravest among life of cousin of general be too valuable to be risked for nought when be embarked upon great enterprise look nessus what be there malchus exclaimed attention attracted by dark object be crossing narrow path distance ahead ascending steep side of gorge be bear let follow flesh will form welcome change for company tonight bear who have be prowling in bottom of ravine have be disturbed by fall of body of savage near started hastily to return to abode lay up on face of cliff malchus companion hurried forward to spot where have crossed path way be plain enough there be scratch on rock bush growing in crevice be beaten down path have evidently be frequently used by animal look out lord nessus exclaimed a malchus hurried along bear of pyrenees be savage brute see that doe not take unawares rock be exceedingly steep malchus with bow in hand arrow fitted ready to draw climbed on keeping eye on clump of bush lest bear must be lurking there at last paused have reached spot now short distance from top cliff here fell almost perpendicularly down along face be narrow ledge scarcely foot wide along be evident bear have passed must think must be near den now nessus trust ledge widens out before get there must be awkward place for conflict for stroke of paw must send one over edge will be close behind lord said nessus whose blood be now up with chase must fail to stop drop on one knee may shoot over for fifty yard ledge continued unbroken malchus moved along cautiously with arrow in string shield shifted round shoulder in readiness for instant action suddenly upon turning sharp corner of cliff saw widened ten foot ahead into sort of platform lying in angle of cliff beyond again jutted out on platform be bear with angry growl at once advanced towards malchus discharged arrow struck bear full on chest penetrated deeply with stroke of paw animal broke shaft asunder rushed forward malchus threw forward point of spear with shield on arm awaited onset struck bear fairly on chest a before snapped shaft with paw rising to foot advanced kneel lord nessus exclaimed malchus dropped on one knee bracing a firmly a must against rock with shield above head sword in hand awaited attack of enraged animal heard twang of bow behind then felt mighty blow beat down shield descended with terrible force upon helmet throwing forward on to face then there be heavy blow on back be well for that have on backpiece a well a breastplate flesh must have be torn from shoulder to loin a blow fell there be angry roar for moment felt crushed by weight fell upon be suddenly removed heard crash far below a bear pierced to heart by arab spear fell over precipice nessus hastened to raise lord be not hurt hope in way nessus thanks to head swim arm be well nigh broken with blow who must have thought beast like must have struck so hard see have dented in helmet have bent shield now before go back search for body let see what den be like do take spear lord own be broken bow have gone over precipice may be that there be bear here where one be other be seldom far off advanced on to platform saw in corner of angle cave entering distance into hill a approached entrance deep growl be heard within have best leave alone lord nessus said a recoiled step at entrance be doubtless female be larger fiercer than male agree with nessus malchus said be on other ground must say let attack have have enough of fighting bear on edge of precipice there be a much meat a can carry ready for below besides hour be late men will be getting uneasy moreover be half armed can not get at without crawling through hole be scarce three foot high altogether have best leave alone while be speaking bear began to roar angrily deeper note being mingled with chorus of snarl whinings showed that there be young family with do go first nessus malchus said rear be post of honour here though fancy beast doe not mean to come out nessus without word took lead advanced across platform towards corner a be in act of turning sprang suddenly back while arrow flew past grazing corner of rock there be score of native on path exclaimed be in trap malchus looked round in dismay be evident that of native must have seen fall of leader watched pursue bear have now closed in behind to cut off retreat situation be most unpleasant one ledge extended further than platform below precipice fell away sheer down hundred foot above rose a high narrow path be occupied with numerous foe in den behind be angry bear for moment two men looked at other in consternation be fairly caught nessus malchus said there be one thing can no more attack than can attack only one can come round corner at time can shoot spear a do so be tolerably safe from attack can starve out can shoot over from other side of ravine nessus said arrow will carry from opposite brow easily enough then malchus said firmly must dispose of bear must have cave will be safe there from arrow while lying at entrance must shoot must venture past corner first though will blow horn of men may be within hearing malchus pulled forth horn carried be useless being completely flattened with blow that bear have struck that hope be gone nessus said now let get bear to come out a soon a possible finish with do stand at corner with arrow ready in case native must try to surprise be ready to aid when rush out malchus went to mouth of den struck spear against side threw in piece of stone although growling be deep continuous bear showed sign of intention of coming out arab be old hunter now asked malchus to take place with bow while drove bear out first took off bernous cut off several strip from bottom knotted together then twisted strip into rope growing out from crevice in rock three foot above top of cave be young tree round close to root nessus fastened one end of rope other formed into slip knot let noose fall in front of cave keeping open with two twig placed across then gathered brushwood placed at entrance put bunch of dried twig dead leaf among striking light with flint steel on dried fungus placed in middle of stick blew upon in minute flame leaped up now lord said be ready with sword spear beast will be out in minute can not stand smoke malchus ran to corner looked round native be at distance along ledge evidently with intention of attacking foe of whom felt sure taunting shout be raised arrow flew towards instantly withdrew head ran back to platform minute later there be fierce growl bear rushed out brushwood be scattered a checked suddenly in rush by noose animal rose on hind leg in instant spear of nessus be plunged deeply into on one side while malchus buried sword to hilt in body under fore shoulder of other stabbed to heart beast fell prostrate nessus repeated blow animal be dead five young bear rushed out after mother growling snapping a be only about quarter grown be easily despatched there be supply of food for long time malchus said cheerfully a there be drip of water coming down in angle will be able to quench thirst ah be just in time a spoke arrow struck rock close to dropped at foot others came in rapid succession looking at brow of opposite side of ravine saw number of native pull bear body across mouth of cave malchus said will prevent arrow strike rock in front from glancing in little bear will do for food at present be soon in cave opened beyond entrance extended distance into mountain be seven eight foot wide lofty enough to stand upright in nessus lay down behind bear with bow arrow so a to command angle of rock malchus seated further in cave sheltered by entrance from arrow from time to time glanced in at mouth only once did nessus have to shoot native on ledge informed by comrade on opposite side of gorge that foe have sought refuge in cave ventured to advance moment first turned corner fell over precipice transfixed by arrow from bow of nessus rest hastily retreated hand flint steel nessus piece of fungus may a well have look round cave light be soon procured malchus found that cave extended fifty foot back narrowing gradually to end have evidently be used for long time by wild animal floor be completely covered with dry bone of various size a soon a saw that be case malchus tore off strip of linen shirt rolling into ball set on fire on piled up small bone caught readily soon have bright almost smokeless fire now took place of nessus latter skinned cut up one of small bear soon have steak broiling over fire by time be getting dusk without when meat be cooked nessus satisfied hunger then sallied out from cave took post a sentry with spear close to angle of rock a by time native on opposite side being no longer able to see in gathering darkness have ceased to shoot malchus ate food at leisure then joined companion must get out of here somehow nessus company will search for tomorrow might search for week without finding here a army be advancing must not spare more than day so if be to get away must be by own exertion be ready to fight way along ledge lord if such be wish can not see to fire at a only one man can stand abreast number must be of avail to not on ledge nessus must hardly defend that doubt be grouped at further end must have to fight against overwhelming number be not to be thought of only way of escape can think of must be to let down precipice bernouses must not make rope long enough must not reach third of distance nessus replied shaking head have be worn time cloth be no longer strong must need broad strip to support be so nessus have material for making rope long enough nevertheless understand lord other garment must be of little use of use at nessus be not thinking of have skin of bear hide of old bear at least be thick tough narrow strip must bear weight of course nessus said how stupid of not to think of for in desert make rope of twisted slip of hide if will stand sentry here lord will set about at once malchus took spear nessus at once set to work to skin bear when be done cut long strip from hide having fastened together twisted into rope bernouses when on march be rolled up worn over one shoulder like scarf a german italian soldier carry blanket in modern time be also cut up twisted in three hour nessus have rope assured malchus be long enough to reach to bottom of precipice sufficiently strong to bear weight one end be fastened to trunk of young tree rope be then thrown over edge of platform one of young bear skin be fastened round round at point where crossed edge of rocky platform to prevent from being cut when weight be put upon then prepared for descent do go first malchus said a soon a feel that rope be loose will follow arab swung off edge in very short time malchus felt rope slacken followed at once first twenty foot descent be absolutely perpendicular after that rock inclined outward in steep pretty regular slope malchus be no longer hanging by rope throwing principal portion of weight still upon placing foot on inequality of rock made way down without difficulty presently stood by nessus at foot of slope have better make up ravine there will be number of at mouth can see glow of fire from here may not be able to find way up nessus said side seem to get steeper steeper may find caught in trap at end of gorge at rate will try way first wish moon be up be a black a wolf mouth here bottom of gorge be covered with boulder if stumble arm strike stone will be heard by native on opposite height now set forward feeling way with greatest care in dense darkness task of making way among boulder be difficult in extreme have proceeded short distance when loud yell rose from height above be repeated again again be answered by shout from opposite side from mouth of ravine by astarte malchus exclaimed have found out that have escaped already be so one of native have crept forward along path hoping to find sentry asleep to steal up noiselessly stab when got to angle of rock must see form before hear slightest sound creeping forward found platform deserted listened attentively at entrance to cave keen ear of savage must have detected have be slumbering there be still rose to foot with intention of creeping into cave when head struck against something put up hand felt rope saw how fugitive have escaped at once gave alarm to comrade in minute two score of men with blazing brand came running along path on seeing rope entered cave found that prey have really escaped malchus companion have not moved after alarm be given have better be going lord arab said a saw men with torch retracing step along brow will soon be after think not chance of finding among boulder in dark must be small must offer such good mark to arrow that must hardly enter upon think will wait till daybreak planting strong force at mouth of ravine along side of end wherever ascent must be made men on height there be calling to others along brow very well lord nessus said seating on rock then will sell life a dearly a possible hope have not come to nessus there be chance of safety for yet only place be not likely to look for be cave a have climbed down from above with rope there will be difficulty in ascending nessus gave exclamation expressed at once admiration of leader idea gratification at thought of escape began without delay to retrace step after trouble again found rope nessus mounted first bare foot enabled to grip inequality of surface of rock whenever came to ledge afforded standing room shook rope waited until malchus joined at last stood together at foot of perpendicular rock at top lightly armed arab found difficulty whatever in climbing rope be harder work for malchus encumbered with weight of armour numerous knot however helped when be within few foot of top nessus seized rope hauled up by sheer strength until malchus be level with top then gave hand assisted to gain foot entered cave made way to further end there threw down have not long be there when saw flash of light at mouth of cave heard voice malchus seized spear must have leaped to foot nessus pressed hand on shoulder be come for bear said be not likely will enter lying hidden in darkness fugitive watched native roll bear over tie leg together put stout pole through then four men lifted pole on shoulder started holding brand entered cave two fugitive held breath nessus sat with arrow in string ready to shoot brand however gave feeble light native picking up body of three of young bear lay close to entrance threw over shoulder crawled back out of cave again a heard departing footstep fugitive drew long breath of relief nessus rose made way cautiously out of cave returned in minute have taken rope with said be well for when have searched valley tomorrow be hanging there might occur to that have made way up now that be gone can never suspect that have returned here there be chance of being disturbed again tonight nessus can sleep a securely a if be in camp so saying malchus chose comfortable place be soon asleep nessus however did not lie down sat watching with unwearied eye entrance to cave a soon a day have fairly broken chorus of loud shout yell far down ravine told that search have begun for hour continued bush boulder in bottom be searched by native again again went up down gorge convinced that fugitive must be hidden somewhere for a nessus have anticipated cliff at upper end be so precipitous that escape there be impossible native have kept so close watch night along slope at lower end at mouth that felt sure that prey must not have escaped unseen yet at last be forced to come to conclusion that in inexplicable way must have be case for how else must have escaped thought that have reascended by rope before be removed that be hidden in cave at time body of bear cub be carried away never occurred to day wandered about in bottom of ravine searching possible place sometimes removing boulder with great labour where be piled together in such manner that one must be hidden beneath at nightfall feasted upon body of bear first killed have be found where have fallen in ravine body of one of young bear lay far up cave have escaped search portion of furnished meal to two prisoner who be however obliged to eat raw being afraid to light fire lest smoke however slight must be observed coming out at entrance next morning so far a must see place be deserted by native lying far back in cave must see that men on opposite side of ravine have retired a be quite possible that native feeling still convinced that fugitive must be hidden somewhere have set watch at spot commanding view of whole ravine did not venture to show at entrance after making meal of bear sallied out when again became dark made way along path when neared end saw party of enemy sitting round great fire at mouth of ravine below retired short distance sat down patiently until at last fire burned low native leaving two of party on watch lay down to sleep then malchus companion rose to foot made way along path when be nearly abreast of fire malchus happened to tread upon loose stone went bouncing down side of hill scout gave shout called companion to foot started up hillside towards spot where stone have fallen nessus discharged arrow struck full on chest of leader of party then followed malchus along hillside shout of rage broke from native a comrade fell without pausing pushed on malchus did not hurry silence now be of more importance than speed strode along then with rapid careful step nessus following closely behind shout of savage soon showed that be at fault malchus listened attentively a went whenever babel of tongue ceased for moment stopped perfectly still only ventured on when be renewed at last have placed long gap between pursuer came out on level shoulder of hill continued way until found at edge of forest be so dark under tree that must no longer advance malchus therefore determined to wait till dawn must enable to continue journey whether be in clump of tree in forest covered large portion of mountain side be unable to tell a not single star must be seen have indication of direction must take retiring then for little distance among tree lay down be soon asleep when first dawn of day appeared be on way again soon found that tree under have slept formed part of forest through occasional opening formed by tree have fallen from age tempest obtained view of surrounding country be enabled to form idea where lay camp have left two day before have not proceeded far when heard in distance behind shouting of men barking of dog knew that enemy be upon track ran now at top of speed convinced however that native who must have to follow track must not travel a fast a did suddenly malchus stopped listen said paused far down hillside heard distant sound of horn must be men malchus exclaimed be searching for still hannibal must have allowed to stay behind when army proceeded on way in half hour horn sounded close at hand be speedily among body of malchus own follower who received with shout of delight men be utterly worn out for have searched continuously day night from time have missed leader sometimes high up among hill sometimes among lower valley party met comprised fourth of band for have divided into four party better to range country be now ascending hill again at distance of two mile apart messenger be at once sent off to other body to inform that malchus have returned malchus quickly recounted to men story of what have befallen then bade lie down to rest while nessus kept watch native who have be in pursuit did not make appearance having doubtless horn told of approach of body of carthaginian in two hour whole of band be collected after few hour halt to enable men to recover from long fatigue sleeplessness malchus put at head marched away to join main body of army overtook two day later malchus be received with great delight by father hannibal who have given up for lost nessus have over over again recounted detail of adventure to comrade quickness of malchus at hitting upon stratagem of returning to cave so escaping from position where escape seemed well nigh impossible won for even higher place than before in admiration of follower chapter xi passage of rhone army be now moving through pass of pyrenees labour be great army have ever before crossed mountain barrier road have to be made stream bridged rock blasted away to allow passage of elephant baggage wagon opinion have differed a to explosive used by carthaginian miner be certain that possessed mean of blasting rock engineer of hannibal force possessed amount of knowledge science vastly in excess of attained by roman at time during campaign latter frequently endeavoured sometimes with success by promise of high reward to induce hannibal engineer to desert take service with people well acquainted with us of sulphur niter skilled in oriental science of chemistry capable of manufacturing greek fire compound must burn under water may well have be acquainted with mixture resembling gunpowder art of making explosive be certainly known to chinese in very remote age phoenician whose galley traversed most distant sea to east may have acquired knowledge from that people wild tribe of mountain harassed army during difficult march constant skirmish went on between hannibal light armed troop however at last difficulty be overcome army descended slope into plain of southern gaul already be agent have negotiated for unopposed passage through country gaul alarmed at appearance of army at news have reached of conquest of catalonia assembled in arm hannibal tact lavish distribution of present dissipated alarm of gaul chief visited hannibal camp at elne treaty be entered into for passage of army singular article of treaty one show esteem in gaul held woman be that complaint on part of native against carthaginian troop must be carried to hannibal general representing that complaint of carthaginian against native must be decided without appeal by council composed of gaulish woman condition caused much amusement to carthaginian who however have cause to regret acceptance for decision of singular tribunal be marked by greatest fairness impartiality greater part of tribe through whose country army marched towards rhone observed term of treaty with good faith proved troublesome be wholly unable to stand against carthaginian arm exact route traversed by army have be subject of long bitter controversy a event of very great importance occurred on way precise line followed in crossing gaul be matter of slight interest suffice that after marching from pyrenees at high rate of speed army reached rhone at point where roquemaure now stand short distance above avignon point have be chosen by hannibal because be one of few spot at rhone run in single stream course being for most part greatly broken up by island roquemaure lie sixty five mile from sea be necessary to cross rhone at distance from mouth for rome be now thoroughly alarmed scipio with fleet powerful army be near marseille waiting to engage hannibal on plain of gaul during last few day march inhabitant have be encountered arecomici who inhabited part of country have not be represented at meeting at news of approach of carthaginian have deserted country fled across rhone where joined by tribe dwelling upon further bank prepared to offer desperate opposition to passage of river appearance of mass of barbarian armed with bow arrow javelin on further side of wide rapid river have to be crossed be not encouraging be bad enough crossing pyrenees malchus said to trebon be nothing to undertaking be one thing to climb precipice however steep to assault of enemy to swim across at head of army under shower of missile a will meet with on other side hannibal however have prepared to overcome difficulty messenger have be sent up down river to people living on right bank offering to buy from at good price barge boat in possession promising freedom from exaction hard treatment offering good pay to who must render assistance to army in passage hannibal offer be accepted without hesitation that army must have chosen have taken boat by force impressed labour must offer to pay liberally for filled with admiration be moreover only too glad to aid formidable army of stranger to pas out of country dweller upon rhone at period carried on extensive commerce not only with tribe of upper river with marseille port of spain northern italy consequently large number of vessel barge of considerable tonnage be at once obtained to add to mean of transport whole army be set to work assisted by native soldier cut down tree hollowing out roughly formed canoe capable of carrying two three men so industriously did troop work in two day enough canoe be made to carry army across river there be still opposition of native to be overcome when canoe be finished hannibal ordered hanno one of best general to start with division at up bank of river hanno marched five mile when found spot where river be smooth favourable for passage troop set to at once to cut tree raft be formed of troop passed over spanish corp accustomed to passage of river simply stripped putting broad shield of hide beneath passed river by swimming once across hanno gave men twenty four hour rest then calculating that hannibal preparation must be complete marched down river until reached hill whose summit be visible from hannibal camp at daybreak upon lit signal fire moment smoke be seen in camp hannibal gave order for troop to embark light infantry took to little canoe cavalry embarked in larger vessel a be insufficient to carry horse great many of animal be made to enter river attached by rope to vessel heavier craft started highest up in order that might to extent break roughness of wave facilitate passage of canoe din be prodigious thousand of men tugged at oar roughly made canoe be dashed against other often upset while from opposite bank rose loudly defiant yell of native prepared to dispute to last landing of flotilla suddenly cry assumed different character mass of smoke be seen to rise from tent of enemy camp hanno division poured down upon rear arecomici taken wholly by surprise be seized with panic fled hastily in direction leaving bank clear for landing of whole of army be brought across at once encamped that night on river in morning hannibal sent off five hundred numidian horse to reconnoitre river below ascertain what scipio army be known to have landed at mouth be doing then assembled army introduced to chief of tribe beyond alp who have day two before arrived in camp with agent have sent to country harangued soldier interpreter translating speech assured of welcome must meet in rich fertile country beyond alp of alacrity with people there must join against roman hannibal then addressed soldier pointed out to that have already accomplished by far greatest part of journey have overcome obstacle that there now remained few day passage over mountain italy goal of endeavour must then lie before soldier replied with enthusiastic shout hannibal after offering up prayer to god on behalf of army dismissed soldier told to prepare to start on following day soon after assembly have broken up numidian horse returned in great confusion closely pressed by roman cavalry who have be sent by scipio to ascertain hannibal position course hostile cavalry have charged other with fury hundred forty of roman two hundred of numidian be slain hannibal saw that there be time to be lost next morning at daybreak whole of cavalry be posted to south to cover movement of army to check roman advance infantry be then set in motion up bank of river hannibal with small party remained behind to watch passage of elephant have not yet be brought across elephant have not be trained to take to water operation be extremely difficult one very strong massive raft be joined together until extended two hundred foot into river being kept in place by cable fastened to tree on bank above at end of floating pier be placed raft of immense size capable of carrying four elephant at time thick covering of earth be laid over whole on turf be placed elephant be then led forward so solid be construction that advanced upon without hesitation when four have taken place on great raft at end fastening secured to rest of structure be cut large number of boat barge filled with rower began to tow raft across river elephant be seized with terror at finding afloat seeing way of escape remained trembling in centre of raft until reached other side when be safely across raft towing boat returned operation be repeated until elephant be over of animal however be so terrified that flung from raft into river made way to shore keeping probosces above surface of water indian who directed be however swept away drowned a soon a elephant be across hannibal called in cavalry with elephant followed army roman did not arrive at spot until three day after carthaginian have left scipio be greatly astonished when found that hannibal have marched north a believed that alp be impassable for army have reckoned that hannibal must certainly march down river follow seashore finding that carthaginian have left marched army down to ship again re embarked sailed for genoa intending to oppose hannibal a issued from defile of alp in event of succeeding in making passage four day march up rhone brought hannibal to point where isere run into river crossed with army entered region called by polybius island although designation be incorrect one for while rhone flow along one side of triangle isere on other base be formed not by third river by portion of alpine chain malchus band have be among first to push off from shore when army began to cross rhone malchus be in roughly constructed canoe be paddled by nessus of men like most of other canoe craft soon became waterlogged for rapid angry current of river broken agitated by so large number of boat splashed over side of clumsy canoe be few inch above water buoyancy of wood be sufficient to float even when full paddled slowly heavily confusion be prodigious greater part of men unaccustomed to rowing have little control over boat collision be frequent number of boat be upset occupant drowned canoe carried malchus be making fair progress to vexation be longer in front line be urging paddler to exert to utmost when nessus gave sudden cry horse have broken loose from fastening behind one of barge be swimming down frightened confused at din be within few foot of when nessus perceived in moment struck canoe broadside with chest boat rolled over at once throwing occupant into water malchus grasped canoe a upset for must instantly have sunk from weight of armour nessus moment later appeared by side will go to other side lord said that will keep tree from turning over again dived under canoe came up on opposite side giving malchus hand across there be longer fear of log rolling over other rower did not reappear above surface malchus shouted in vain to of passing boat to pick up be so absorbed in effort to advance eagerness to engage enemy that none paid attention to malchus others in like plight besides seemed probable that if stuck to canoe must presently gain one bank other of river malchus too have started rather low down be therefore soon out of flotilla boat be nearly in midstream when accident happened first thing to do malchus said when saw that there be chance of being picked up be to rid of armour can hing with on if tree turn over will go down like stone first of nessus do unloose sword belt will do same if fasten together be long enough to go round canoe if take off helmet pas belt through chin chain will with sword hang safely be with difficulty accomplished now malchus continued let make way to stern of canoe will place hand on tree there do unfasten shoulder waist strap of breast backpieces can not do be also accomplished two piece of armour laid on tree be now free to look round rapid stream have already taken mile below point where army be crossing be now entering spot where river be broken up by island raced along pent up channel with greater velocity than before surface broken with short angry wave rendered difficult for to retain hold of tree for time strove by swimming to give canoe impetus towards one bank other effort be vain sometimes thought be about to succeed then eddy must take boat carry into middle of stream again be useless nessus malchus said at last be only wearing out effort be of avail whatever must be content to drift down river until good luck throw into eddy may carry near one bank other be long time indeed before stroke of fortune befell be many mile down river before current took near eastern bank at point where sharp curve of river threw force of current over in direction although be carried to within few yard of shore so numbed exhausted be by long immersion in cold water that be with greatest difficulty that must give canoe sufficient impulsion to carry to bank at last however foot touched bottom struggled to shore carrying with arm armour then letting canoe drift away again crawled up bank threw down utterly exhausted be time before of spoke then malchus said have best strip off clothes wring a well a can after will soon dry on have mean of drying here so must lie down among bush to shelter from bitter wind blow from mountain clothes be wrung until last drop be extracted from then put on again be still damp cold malchus companion have be accustomed to be drenched to skin thought nothing of be still too exhausted however to walk briskly therefore lay down among thick bush until must feel equal to setting out on long tramp to rejoin companion after lying for couple of hour malchus rose to foot issuing from bush looked round have resumed armour sword a stepped out sudden shout arose saw within hundred yard of body of native hundred strong approaching have already caught sight of nessus exclaimed without looking round lie still be seen will be taken in minute be hopeless for to try to escape will do more good by remaining hid trying to free from hand afterwards so saying without drawing sword malchus quietly advanced towards native who be rushing down towards with loud shout flight resistance must be a have at once seen hopeless be only by present submission must hope to save life native be portion of force have opposed hannibal landing have already killed several carthaginian who have like malchus struggled to bank after being upset in passage seeing that attempted to fly to defend rushed upon tumultuously stripped of arm armour dragged before leader latter briefly ordered to be brought along party continued hurried march fearing that carthaginian horse might at moment pursue for rest of afternoon marched without halt at stopped in wood fire be lit for knew not how close carthaginian might be behind malchus be bound hand foot thrown down in midst there be sleep night party remained on watch others sat together round spot where malchus lay discussed disastrous event of day great flotilla of carthaginian sudden attack in rear destruction of camp capture of whole of good slaughter defeat have befallen a dialect differed little from of gaul in carthaginian service malchus be enabled to understand greater part of conversation learned that only reason why be not put to death at once be that wished to keep until beyond risk of pursuit of carthaginian when must be sacrificed to god formally with usual ceremony time that be talking malchus listened anxiously for sudden outbreak must tell that nessus have be discovered that numidian have followed on trace be somewhere in neighbourhood malchus have doubt rescue in present position be impossible only hoped that follower must find that be so in time must wait for more favourable opportunity night passed off quietly in morning native continued march after proceeding for three four hour sudden exclamation from one of caused others to turn in distance black mass of horseman be seen approaching at rapid run native started off for shelter of wood half mile distant malchus be forced to accompany felt sure that horseman be party of hannibal cavalry wondered whether nessus be near enough to see for if so doubted not that must manage to join lead to rescue just before reached wood native suddenly stopped for coming from opposite direction be body of cavalry needed not joyous shout of native to tell malchus that be roman for be coming from south must only be party of scipio cavalry native halted at edge of wood to watch result of conflict for party evidently saw other continued to advance at full speed roman trumpet be sounding while wild yell came up on breeze told malchus that hannibal cavalry be party of numidian roman be somewhat most numerous have cavalry opposed to consisted of carthaginian horse malchus must have have little doubt a to result felt however by mean certain that light armed numidian be match for roman cavalry party have stopped quarter of mile from spot where rival band met crash of body driven violently against other clash of steel on armour must be plainly heard for few minute be wild confused melee party appearing to have advantage riderless steed galloped off from throng party seemed to give way foot whole mass seemed interlaced in conflict be moving struggling throng of body with arm waving high sword rising falling roman fought in silence wild yell of numidian rose shrill continuous at last there be movement malchus gave groan while native around shouted in triumph a numidian be seen to detach from throng to gallop off at full speed hotly followed by roman however in greatly diminished number for ground on conflict have taken place be thickly strewn with body nearly half of who have engaged in short desperate strife be lying there sooner have pursuer pursued disappeared in distance than native thronged down to spot such of numidian a be found to be alive be instantly slaughtered be despoiled of clothes arm ornament roman be left untouched among who be found to be only wounded be assisted by native who unbuckled armour helped into sitting position bound up wound gave water highly satisfied with booty obtained having no longer fear of pursuit native halted to await return of roman malchus learned from conversation that have little doubt whether roman must approve of appropriating spoil of dead numidian be finally decided to hand over malchus whose rich armour proclaimed to be prisoner of importance to roman commander main body of native with spoil have be collected moved away to wood while chief with four of companion malchus remained with wounded roman be late in evening before roman returned after having a have be said followed numidian right up to hannibal camp there be grumbling on part of roman soldier when found that ally have forestalled with spoil officer in command be well pleased at finding that wounded have be carefully attended to bade men be content that have rendered good service to public that scipio must be well satisfied with native chief now exhibited helmet armour of malchus who be led forward by two of men who be commander asked malchus in greek language be understood by educated of rome carthage be malchus command scout of hannibal army be young for such post officer said in carthage be interest not valour secures promotion doubtless be related to hannibal be cousin malchus said quietly ah roman said sarcastically that account for one who be mere lad being chosen for so important post however will take to scipio who will doubtless have question to ask of concerning army many of riderless horse on plain came in on hearing sound of roman trumpet rejoined troop malchus be placed on one of such of wounded roman a be able to ride mounted others small party being left behind to look after unable to move troop started on way be unable however to proceed far horse have be travelling since morning be now completely exhausted therefore after proceeding few mile troop halted strong guard be posted men lay down by horse ready to mount at moment notice for be possible that hannibal might have sent large body of horseman in pursuit a on night before malchus felt that even if nessus have so far followed must hing while so strong guard be kept up therefore followed example of roman soldier around be soon fast asleep at daybreak next morning troop mounted again proceeded to south late in afternoon cloud of dust be seen in distance party presently rode into midst of roman army who have made day march from ship be just halting for night commander of cavalry at once hastened to scipio tent to inform of surprising fact that hannibal have already in face of opposition of tribe forced passage of rhone that with exception of elephant have be seen still on opposite bank army be across scipio be greatly mortified at intelligence for have deemed next to impossible that hannibal must carry army across so wide rapid river in face of opposition have little doubt now that hannibal intention be to follow rhone down on left bank to mouth prepared at once for battle hearing that prisoner of importance have be captured ordered malchus to be brought before a lad escorted by roman soldier on side be led in scipio accustomed to estimate men must not admire calm haughty self possession of young prisoner eye fell with approval upon active sinewy figure knotted muscle of arm leg be malchus relation of hannibal commander of scout of army hear scipio began malchus bowed head in assent what force have with what be intention know nothing of intention malchus replied quietly a to force be better that inquired of ally who saw pas river one of be brought hither with can tell what saw know not scipio said that can order to instant execution if refuse to answer question of be perfectly well aware malchus replied nevertheless refuse absolutely to answer question will give until tomorrow morning to think matter over if by time have not made up mind to give information require die so saying waved hand to soldier who at once removed malchus from presence be taken to small tent short distance away food be given to at nightfall chain be attached to ankle from to leg of two roman soldier appointed to guard during night while sentry be placed at entrance chain be strong fitted so tightly round ankle that escape be altogether impossible even have possessed arm must noiselessly have slain two soldier must be nearer getting away for chain be fastened a securely round limb a round own malchus therefore at once abandoned idea of escape lying quietly down meditated on fate in morning chapter xii among pass be not until long after guard to whom be chained have fallen asleep that malchus followed example seemed to have be asleep long time when pressure by hand on shoulder woke at same moment hand be placed over mouth hush lord voice said be nessus arise let go there be time to be lost for be nigh morning have be whole night in discovering where be guard have killed nessus said in tone of indifference be chained to by ankle nessus gave little exclamation of impatience then in darkness felt iron to discover nature of fastening in minute there be sound of dull crashing blow then nessus moved to other side sound be repeated with two blow of short heavy sword arab have cut off foot of dead roman at ankle chain be free put on clothes of man lord take arm will take of other a soon a be done nessus wrapped fold of cloth round of chain to prevent clanking then passing band through end fastened to malchus ' waist quick lord said a finished work daylight be beginning to break stepped over dead sentry at door of tent be going on when malchus said best lift inside nessus may be little time before be noticed that be missing from post be quickly done then moved away quietly among tent till approached rear of camp be now light enough to enable to see dimly figure of roman sentry placed at short interval round camp can not get through unseen malchus said lord nessus replied have wasted too much time in finding then have best lie down quietly here malchus said in short time men will be moving about can then pas through sentry without remark a light spread over sky sound of movement be heard in camp soon figure be moving about beginning to make fire others to attend to horse two carthaginian moved about among tent a if similarly occupied secure attire a roman soldier must prevent observation being directed towards be anxious to be off for feared that at moment might hear alarm raised on discovery that sentry be missing be nearly broad daylight now when saw two three soldier pas out between sentry unquestioned started at once to follow morning be very cold soldier who be about be wearing military cloak malchus have pulled iron a high up a must possibly force did not show below cloak walking carelessly along passed through sentry whose duty now that morning have dawned related only to discovering enemy approaching camp soldier being now free to enter leave a pleased be of use to go far malchus said nearer hide to camp better be le likely to be looked for there than at distance be impossible for to travel at speed until get rid of heavy iron a soon a get over little brow ahead will be out of sight of sentry will take to first hiding place see little rise be short distance from camp country beyond be open be covered with low brushwood a soon a be over brow be assured that none of who have left camp before be in sight plunged into brushwood making way on hand knee for few hundred yard lay down in midst of be not likely to search on side of camp malchus said will not know at what hour escaped will naturally suppose that started at once to regain camp listen trumpet be blowing doubt be about to strike camp march by time escape must be known now tell nessus how did manage to follow discover be easy to follow lord nessus said when heard order lay still watched through bush meeting with gaul arrow be in string have attacked must have loosed among then rushed out to die with when saw take prisoner followed order have difficulty in keeping in sight until nightfall then crept up to wood made way until be within few yard of lay there till nearly morning a men around never went to sleep must hing stole away again before daylight broke then followed again until saw horseman approaching have started to run towards to lead to when saw roman horse again hid next night again roman kept too vigilant watch for to do anything followed yesterday until saw enter roman camp a soon a be dark entered getting into part of camp occupied by massilians whose gaulish talk must understand little gathered that carthaginian prisoner who have be brought in be to be executed in morning so set to work to find night be too dark to see where sentry be placed have to crawl round tent to see if one stood at entrance on guard for be sure that sentry must be placed over entered seven tent at whose door sentry be placed before found yours be of roman general person of importance entered time by cutting slit in back of tent at last when be beginning to despair found tent be smallest of have be guarded made think be right when crawled in found feeling cautiously about two roman soldier be asleep on ground that be lying between then went to entrance sentry be standing with back to struck blow on neck from behind died without knowing be hurt caught a struck lowered gently down for crash of arm a fell must have roused everyone near after that be easy to stab two guard sleeping by then woke have saved life nessus will never forget malchus said gratefully life be lord arab replied simply glad be indeed have be able to do service just a spoke saw through bush party of roman horse ride at gallop over brow between camp halted however on passing crest officer with gazed long searchingly over country for minute sat without speaking then gave order horseman rode back again over crest think will see more of malchus said order be doubt that if be in sight be to pursue if not must be clearly useless hunting over mile of brushwood in hope of finding especially a must deem likely that be far away in opposite direction hour later nessus crept cautiously forward among bush making considerable detour until reached spot whence must command view of roman camp have gone not soul remained behind at distance across plain must see heavy column marching north rose to foot returned to spot where have left malchus told that roman have gone first thing nessus be to get rid of chain be easy a to chain nessus said ring around leg must remain until rejoin camp will need file to free from soil be sandy nessus must find stone sufficiently large for purpose therefore started in direction roman have taken until after two hour slow walking came upon bed of stream in be boulder sufficiently large for purpose ring be now pushed down again to ankle nessus wound round strip of cloth until have formed pad between iron skin to lessen jar of blow then placed link of chain near to leg upon edge of boulder drawing sharp heavy sword struck with force upon iron deep notch be made again again repeated blow until link be cut through then with difficulty forced two end apart until shackle of ring must pas between operation be repeated on other chain then malchus be free save for two iron ring around ankle work have taken upwards of hour when be done started at rapid walk in direction taken by column have fear now of native for must come upon must take for two roman soldier who have strayed behind army scipio made long day march be not until nightfall that army halted malchus companion made long detour round camp continued way for hour then left track that army must follow after walking for about mile lay down among bush be soon asleep in morning agreed that before proceeding further be absolutely necessary to obtain food malchus have be fed when among roman nessus have have nothing from morning when have be upset in rhone four day before save manchet of bread have found in one of tent have entered surveying country round carefully keen eye of arab perceived light smoke curling up at foot of hill on right at once directed course towards hour walking brought within sight of native village a soon a perceived dropped on hand knee proceeded with caution until within short distance of be not long in discovering flock of goat browsing on verdure in broken ground few hundred yard from village be under charge of native boy who be seated on rock near made way round among brushwood until be close to spot will shoot nessus asked for have carried bow arrow concealed in attire a roman soldier malchus replied lad have done harm must have one of goat back be towards if wait one of be sure to come close to presently lay quiet among bush until after delay of quarter of hour goat browsing upon bush passed within yard two of nessus let fly arrow passed almost through animal right behind shoulder fell among bush in instant nessus be upon grasping mouth

lying at foot of hill must have barred way hannibal by medium of one of native ally bribed roman commander to abstain from interrupting march then pressed forward until on third day after crossing po came within sight of piacenza under whose wall roman army be ranged scipio after disastrous cavalry conflict have written to rome urging inability with force under command to give battle single handed to hannibal begging that might be at once reinforced by army under sempronius then lying at ariminum rimini united consular army represented must take up position on river trebia river rose in

colleague hannibal position be difficult one have traversed pyrenees alp that might attack rome between southern italy lay yet barrier apennines scipio have missed after have crossed pyrenees have be too late to attack when exhausted worn out army emerged from alp now united with sempronius hoped to crush at foot of apennines hannibal wished if possible to prevent junction of two roman army if must not be done determined to fight together scipio perceived danger of position in order to be able better to join sempronius left piacenza under cover of night took up strong position on bank of trebia here must maintain communication direct with rome if absolutely necessary fall back join colleague advancing towards hannibal when perceived scipio change of position broke up camp took post on

by bribe to surrender place to be of enormous advantage to hannibal corresponding blow to roman for clastidium be chief magazine north of apennines news of fall of important place filled energetic vigorous general with fury at once rode down from camp to of scipio proposed that hannibal must be attacked instantly scipio who be still suffering from wound have received in cavalry engagement urged that roman army must remain where be if necessary through coming winter pointed out that hannibal gaulish ally must lose heart at seeing inactive must cease to furnish with supply that must be obliged to attack at disadvantage to retire from position occupied sempronius be ambitious man time for consular election be approaching be unwilling to leave for successor glory of crushing fact too that scipio be wounded unable to take part in battle added to desire to force on since whole glory of victory must be therefore told colleague that although saw force of argument public opinion in rome be already so excited at hannibal having be allowed without battle to wrest so wide territory from rome that be absolutely necessary that action must be fought two army be now united on trebia opinion be among officer troop a between consul widely divided a to best course to be pursued spy among native kept acquainted with what be going on in roman camp determined to provoke roman to battle therefore despatched two thousand infantry thousand cavalry to ravage land of gaulish ally of roman sempronius sent off greater part of cavalry with thousand light infantry to drive back carthaginian in fight

position taken up by hannibal having thus prepared for battle hannibal proceeded to provoke at daybreak on twenty sixth despatched strong body of horseman across river crossing trebia partly by ford partly by swimming carthaginian horse rode up to palisade surrounding roman camp where with insulting shout hurling of javelin aroused roman soldier from slumber insult have desired effect sempronius rushed from tent furious at what deemed insolence of carthaginian called troop to arm with accustomed discipline roman fell into rank light cavalry first issued from palisade infantry followed heavy

carthaginian formation served in good stead moved like solid wall shield locked closely together pressed steadily forward in spite of desperate effort of roman centre in more open order to resist for roman soldier in battle be allowed space of man width between comrade on side to allow free use of weapon two carthaginian be therefore opposed to roman in addition to greater depth of african

to inspire with noblest sentiment since have reached spain have seen le of than before for hamilcar felt that be best for son to depend upon alone be proud of name malchus be already winning for knew

tribesman be celebrated by great rejoicing on orcus woman old men boy met mile from village raising loud cry of welcome triumph a returned from successful campaign against former oppressor among people be family tie held more precious than among gaul rough military order tribesman have preserved upon march be at once broken up when two party met wife rushed into arm of husband mother embraced son girl hung on neck of father brother there be nothing to mar joy of meeting for messenger have from time to time carried news from army to village woman who have lost dearest to in campaign remained behind in village so that mourning must not mar brightness of return of tribe brunilda wife of chief stood with daughter little apart from crowd on rising knoll of ground chief who be mounted

listened to song of harper to tale of war wandering of gaulish tribe told story of carthage tyre war of former with roman described life manner of great city hunting of lion in libyan desert while listener wondered at complex life strange art magnificence of carthage malchus be struck with simple existence warm family tie honest sincerity deep love of freedom of gaul when brunilda daughter sighed with envy at thought of luxury pleasure of great city told that must soon weary of so artificial existence carthage with corruption ever present dread of rising of one class against constant fear of revolt from people have enslaved secret tribunal oppression tyranny have little need be envied by free tribe of gaul grant said that must gain greater comfort by adopting something of civilization might improve dwelling hanging round wall must keep out bitter wind well made door be in winter very preferable to skin hang at entrance do think that carthaginian cook might with advantage give lesson to tribe a to preparation of food beyond think that have best of well built house speak of allobrigius said have advantage have drawback people who once settle down into permanent abode have taken first step towards losing freedom look at large town in plain until lately of held roman garrison in first place offer incentive to attack of covetous foe in second bind owner to inhabitant of town cling to house possession if conquered become mere slave to captor who live in dwelling cost few week of work whose worldly good be work of own hand product of chase must never be conquered may be beaten if so can retire before enemy live in freedom in forest mountain travel beyond reach of foe have not army come freed from rome be already meditating moving with tribe across great mountain to north settling among brunilda people in german forest far beyond reach of rome what though a tell winter be long severe people ignorant of many of comfort have adopted from neighbour at least must be free of blessing none be to compare with agree with malchus said thinking of plot conspiracy secret denunciation tyranny corruption of carthage be good to be great be better to be free however added more cheerfully trust that be going to free from future fear of rome that will be able to enjoy liberty here without having to remove to dark forest long winter of country north of alp so passed winter early in spring messenger arrived from hannibal bidding malchus rejoin calling upon allobrigius to prepare to take field against roman similar message have be sent to gaulish tribe friendly to carthage early in march hannibal prepared to cross apennines to advance against rome position occupied by two roman army barred only two road by be believed that hannibal must march upon rome a soon a spring commenced hannibal started by path hitherto untrodden by troop across apennines in march troop suffered even greater hardship than have undergone in passage of alp for during four day three night marched knee deep in water unable for single moment to lie down while ever moving backwards forward among men to encourage with presence word even iron frame of hannibal gave way under terrible hardship long continued strain want of sleep obnoxious miasma from marsh brought on fever cost sight of one of eye of elephant one survived march be with army a worn out exhausted a have issued from alp that descended into fertile plain of tuscany near fiesole army of flaminius strong be still lying at arezzo on direct road south be with only that hannibal have now to deal force of servilius being still far away at rimini own army be strong crossing upper arno near florence hannibal marched towards arezzo flaminius a soon a have heard that hannibal be ascending slope of apennines have sent to servilius to join latter alleging that feared invasion by gaulish tribe on north refused to move sent four thousand cavalry to flaminius brought army to nearly equal strength although hannibal marched troop within sight of arezzo flaminius must not issue from camp to attack knew that hannibal have defeated force of tried troop much exceeding own in number in north that must therefore probably be successful against one scarcely equalled own hoped too that hannibal must attack in intrenched position carthaginian general have intention of doing leaving camp behind marched on plundering ravaging country towards rome flaminius at once broke up camp followed on track preparing to take opportunity might occur to fall upon carthaginian knowing that senate must at once call up army of servilius to assist hannibal by mean of scout left in rear found that flaminius be marching on with troop in solid column taking precaution against surprise secure in belief that hannibal object be to march on rome without stop carthaginian general prepared at once to take advantage of enemy carelessness halted troop at cortona road by have passed wound along shore of lake trasimene at foot of range of steep hill approached closely to water way along hill stream run down valley into lake in valley completely hidden from sight of enemy approaching hannibal placed numidian cavalry gaulish infantry among wood clothing lower slope of hill facing lake placed light troop while spanish african infantry gaulish cavalry be similarly hidden on outer slope of hill in readiness to close in on rear of roman when have entered on road between hill lake better position must have be chosen for surprise when once roman have entered path between hill lake there be escape for be shut up between wood clad hill swarming with carthaginian light troop lake while heavy infantry cavalry of hannibal be ready to fall on front rear when flaminius arrived at cortona late at night heard of ravage execution committed by carthaginian a have passed through early in morning resolved to press forward at daybreak in hope of finding opportunity for falling upon punishing when day broke seemed favourable to design for thick mist be rising from lake marsh thought must conceal advance from carthaginian while a high ground ahead rose above mist must be enabled to see position pushed forward then rapidly thinking that must be able to overtake rear of carthaginian army a moved slowly along encumbered with plunder a neared entrance to pas caught sight of heavy armed carthaginian on distant hill above level of mist believing that own movement be hidden from enemy pushed forward a fast a infantry must march moment rear of column have entered narrow flat between foot of hill lake numidian quietly moved down closed pas behind while hannibal with heavy infantry descended from farther hill to confront when be ready gave signal at once in front on right flank on rear carthaginian fell upon light troop heralded attack by rolling vast quantity of rock down hill on long column then pressing down through wood poured arrow javelin into struggling mass taken wholly by surprise unable to advance retreat desperate at finding thus caught in trap roman fought bravely in vain earthquake shook ground on terrible fight be going on not for moment did interrupt struggle for three hour roman although suffering terribly still fought on then flaminius be killed from time thought only of escape be next to impossible six thousand only cut way out fifteen thousand fell nine thousand be taken prisoner a soon a battle be over hannibal despatched maharbal with division of army in pursuit of six thousand who have escaped overtaking next morning at perugia maharbal forced to surrender at same time detached strong force against four thousand horseman whom servilius have despatched from rimini to aid colleague whole of be surrounded taken prisoner thus of roman army thirty six thousand strong not single man escaped in history there be record of so great successful surprise hannibal retained a prisoner roman citizen latin released rest of captive telling that far from being enemy have invaded italy for purpose of liberating helpless people from tyranny of roman domination loss to carthaginian in battle of lake trasimene be only fifteen hundred men have be blamed for not advancing against rome after battle of lake trasimene knew that must not hope to subdue city so long a be surrounded by faithful ally army be numerically insufficient to undertake such siege be destitute of machine for battering wall rome be still defended by city legion besides man capable of bearing arm be soldier bitter hostility of latin must have rendered difficult in extreme for army to have obtained provision while carrying on siege while in rear waiting for opportunity to attack must have lain army of servilius thirty thousand strong growing daily more numerous a friend ally of rome flocked to banner hannibal saw that to undertake such enterprise at present must be ruin course be clear have to beat army rome must put into field to shake confidence of italian tribe in power of rome to subsist army upon territory so gradually to detach from alliance with rome hoped that by time work be finished carthage must send great army to assistance provided with siege material must then be able to undertake with confidence great task of striking vital blow at rome malchus hannibal said one day wish to ride north tribe at foot of hill promised to aid have so far done nothing if must pour down to plain now must occupy tribe friendly to roman must prevent from sending men store to sent message month ago saying that be still willing to help then replied that have be long waiting to hear that have risen urged to do so without loss of time have not heard since fear that roman agent have by promise of money privilege prevailed upon to keep quiet be service of danger for if have be bought over may seize send in token of goodwill a prisoner to rome know will not deter be ready to go malchus said will start today what force will take with of chief will first see have best go first to ostragarth be most powerful of chief on side of apennines can select from treasury such present a may choose for others can promise large grant of land of tribe aiding roman together with share in plunder of city leave quite free in respect will be guided by what see want promise may make will ratify a to men must not take large escort force will of course be of avail appearance of large number of troop might alarm at once twenty men will be sufficient for dignity a protection against small body of hostile tribesman may meet on way have fray if can avoid mission be important one success must not be risked merely to defeat body of tribesman go in handsomest armour make a brave show a can a ambassador kinsman take twenty of carthaginian horse will impose more upon barbarian than must libyan numidian take friend trebon a commander companion for in two hour malchus escort be ready to start a journey must be rapid carried store with save three day provision man carried at saddlebow bag containing few feed of corn for horse took with however two baggage horse laden with arm armour garment other present for chief passed rapidly across country meeting with hostile party for raid of hannibal light armed horse have so terrified people that village be for most part deserted inhabitant having sought refuge in fortified town after two day brisk riding arrived at foot of hill progress be now slower village of ostragarth lay far up among being ignorant of direction malchus broke troop up into party of four sent up different valley with order to capture first native came across oblige either by threat promise to act a guide to stronghold of chief sincerely trust that barbarian be friendly malchus for country look wild difficult in extreme forest clothe hill be thick tangled on plain can laugh at native however numerous with twenty men must charge thousand of among hill be different one can not find level spot for charge if come to running mountaineer be a fleet a horse on broken ground of hill agree with trebon that must go hard with that utmost must hope for must be visit to rome a captive still chief offered alliance to hannibal a went south success have attended must surely bind to interest be ever willing to join winning side so far fortune have be wholly with be so malchus then see that tribe of plain still hold aloof from pin faith on rome must know that be receiving reinforcement to fill gap made in battle may well fear to provoke anger of rome by taking part with before success be a consider absolutely secure on same ground then trebon will be equally unwilling to offend by hostility until scale be decidedly weighed down against hannibal anger might be a terrible a of roman there be something in malchus not so much a think if rome win rome will have ample time ample power with aid of native ally to punish who may have declared against on other hand must carthage triumph may consider probable that must sack burn rome then retire that if remain there will be so much to arrange so many tribe in plain to subjugate pacify that will be little likely to undertake expedition in mountain therefore see prudent men must decide for rome must have marched straight on after victory at lake trasimene have captured rome mountain tribe must have taken opportunity to pour down into plain to plunder slay under pretence of being ally be not until that five party returned to spot where have left leader three of have be entirely unsuccessful other two have brought in native men looked sullen obstinate be not until malchus have ordered halter to be placed round neck threatened with instant death that consented to act a guide vigilant watch be kept over night at daybreak next morning party started for mile rode along at foot of mountain then entered valley up little used track ran men upon being questioned intimated that be several hour journey to village of chief of whom be in search indeed proved to be case for be not till afternoon after many hour weary journey up gorge through mountain valley that arrived within sight of village of ostragarth be situated on one side of valley consisted of hut surrounded by rough stone wall of such height only top of circular roof be visible above loud shrill cry be heard a came in sight cow horn be blown in village instantly men must be seen running in others engaged in tending flock of goat high up on mountain side left charge began to hurry down chapter xv mountain tribe be petty place for chief of power trebon said yes malchus agreed fancy hill tribe be broken up into very large number of small village in isolated valley only uniting when order of chief call upon to defend mountain against invader to make simultaneous raid upon plain a neared village several person be seen to issue out from gate among be small elderly man evidently chief of party white hair descended to waist boy standing behind carried bow several javelin rest of men appeared to be unarmed be crafty looking old fellow malchus said a alighted advanced towards chief suppose have made up mind to receive a friend at rate for present come chief a ambassador from carthaginian general when passed south received messenger from saying that be ready to enter into alliance with to agreed sent present since then have done nothing although have sent to urging to aid by making attack on tribe allied to rome in battle have fought with roman have defeated with great slaughter owing to aid have received from tribe in alliance with be enabled continually to put fresh army in field therefore be that have sent to to other chief of tribe inhabiting mountain to urge to descend with force into plain so oblige tribe there to turn attention to own defence rather than to sending of assistance to rome have sent by hand many valuable present have authorized to promise in name such land a may wish to obtain beyond foot of hill promise also share in booty taken at sack of italian city will please to enter chief said speaking patois of latin malchus found difficult to understand will then discus matter concerning speak so saying led way through gate to hut somewhat larger than rest do enter with trebon let men remain in saddle hold horse in readiness for to mount speedily if there be need doubt friendliness of old fellow people upon entering hut malchus observed at once that wall be covered with hanging be new fresh detected costly armour half hidden in corner roman have be here before muttered to companion question be how high have bid for support chief took seat on roughly carved chair seat be brought in for visitor began by asking account of state of affair in plain malchus answered truthfully except that exaggerated little effect that carthaginian victory have produced among native chief asked many question be evidently by mean well informed on subject then expressed desire to see present have brought trebon went out returned with two soldier bearing like look of thing said in low voice number of men in village have trebled since arrived still keep coming in none of show arm at present doubt be hidden close at hand believe chief be only keeping in conversation till considers that sufficient force have arrived to make sure of ca break off now malchus said must take chance must not do to ensure failure by showing suspicion chief examined present with great care announced satisfaction at then entered upon question of land be to receive inquired whether town be to be captured by carthaginian handed over to be to be captured by force when point have be arranged a seemed satisfactorily entered upon question in dispute between other chief of mountain tribe malchus said have instruction a to point be new to that in question between chief tribe hostile to carthage full satisfaction must be given a to between other chief who might also join against roman if elected to submit to hannibal for decision must arbitrate between at moment horn be blown outside din of voice instantly arose be followed immediately afterwards by clashing of weapon malchus companion leaped to foot rushed from hut found that men be attacked by crowd of mountaineer in instant leaped on horse drawing sword joined in fray number of foe be large great many men having come in since trebon have last issued out attack be determined one next to horseman hewed at with ax further back hurled dart javelin while others crept in among horse stabbed from beneath with long knife must get out of be lost trebon exclaimed encouraging men with shout strove to hew way through crowd to gate while malchus faced of men round covered rear several of carthaginian be already dismounted owing to horse being slain of be despatched before must gain foot malchus shouted to others to leap up behind comrade by dint of desperate effort trebon soldier with cleared way to gate behind be so hampered by enemy that be unable to follow native clung to leg strove to pull off horse while storm of blow be hurled upon trebon seeing danger of behind have turned in vain tried to cut way back to number of native be too great malchus seeing shouted at top of voice fly trebon can not help save can seeing that must render friend assistance trebon turned round galloped off with nine of soldier who have made way with to gate five have already fallen malchus shouted to other six to throw down arm yield a prisoner did two of be killed before villager perceived have surrendered malchus others be dragged from horse bound hand foot thrown into one of hut native shouted in triumph yell of delight arose a package borne by baggage animal be examined variety of rich present intended for various chief divided among most of captive be more le severely wounded of native presently came into hut examined bound up wound keep up spirit malchus said cheerfully be evident intend to kill doubt be going to send prisoner to roman in case will be exchanged sooner later at rate roman must not dare ill treat for hannibal hold more than hundred prisoner in hand to one have taken three day passed food be brought to captive regularly bond be sufficiently relaxed for to feed at end of time be ordered to rise leave hut outside chief with forty of follower be waiting be armed prisoner being placed in midst party started proceeded by same road by malchus have ridden to village mile be passed without incident when a be passing through narrow valley great number of rock came bounding down hillside at different point along several carthaginian appeared in malchus recognized at once soldier of escort one of shouted out surrender be dead men strong force surround on side officer whom see will give order to men who will loose such avalanche of rock that will all be swept away be only men who escaped chief cried push forward at once instant movement began carthaginian shouted order great number of rock came bounding down proving that be obeyed by invisible army several of mountaineer be crushed by stone old chief struck by great rock in chest fell dead carthaginian standing next to malchus be also slain tribesman gave cry of terror hand to hand be ready to fight valiantly destruction by unseen foe terrified carthaginian leader raised hand descent of stone ceased now said see truth of word hesitate longer will be lost if throw down arm leaving captive behind retire by way came be free to do so hannibal have desire for blood of italian people have come to free from yoke of rome treacherous chief who after making alliance with sold to roman have be slain therefore have further ill will against tribesman dismayed by loss of chief uncertain a to strength of foe who surrounded at once threw down arm glad to escape with life fled at speed up pas towards village leaving captive behind carthaginian then descended trebon among did not show malchus latter said a joined friend for chief knew by sight wished to be uncertain whether be not fresh party who have arrived who be army malchus asked have astonished a much a barbarian there be trebon said laughing a fifty sixty woman dozen old men boy began to make way down hill fortunately tribesman be too much occupied with plunder to pursue got down safely with men be of course determined to try to rescue somehow did not see how be to be done then happy thought struck next morning rode down to plain till came to walled village at once summoned to surrender using threat of bringing up strong body to destroy place if refused opened gate sooner than have expected found village inhabited only by woman old men child whole of fighting men having be called away to join roman be a may imagine in terrible fright expected one of to be killed however told that must not only spare life also property if must obey order agreed willingly enough ordered who be strong enough to be of good to take sufficient provision for week to accompany astonished a be at order there be nothing for to do to obey accordingly set out found by questioning that road have travelled be regular one up to village that must be sure to be brought down by if chief intended to send to rome by reached valley next morning set to work cut number of strong lever then went up on hillside to where saw posted behind rock spent day loosing stone placing in readiness to roll down be then prepared for coming at assembled put guard over posted again at daybreak yesterday watched day in vain here must have remained for month if necessary a must have sent down of boy for more provision when brought be gone however be right glad when saw coming today for be dull work must have killed whole of treacherous savage if have not be afraid of injuring men a be be in terrible fright when stone went rushing down at one of men have be killed see there be help for whole party then proceeded down valley on emerging from hill trebon told improvised army that must return to village a have further need of service delighted at having escaped without damage injury at once proceeded on way have best halt here for night trebon said in morning will start off with mounted men get horse from one of village for rest of doubt be pretty well stripped of fighting men next day horse be obtained malchus seeing now have lost present intended for chief must be useless to pursue mission further especially a have learned that roman agent have already be at work among tribe returned with party to hannibal camp be sorry malchus carthaginian general said when related failure to carry out mission that have not succeeded be clear that failure be due to want of tact on part attack upon be evidently determined upon instant appeared in sight of village for men must have be sent out at once to summon tribe friend trebon behaved with great intelligence in matter of rescue will at once promote step in rank be ready to set out again try whether can succeed better with of other chief if like malchus said malchus will leave alone for present roman have be beforehand with a man be one of principal chief be probable that a have forsaken alliance with others have done same moreover news of death deserved a be at hand of party of carthaginian will not improve feeling towards nothing short of general movement among hill tribe must be of great advantage to be clear that general movement can be looked for now besides now that see spirit animates savage care to risk loss by sending among news of disaster of lake trasimene be met by rome in spirit worthy of one so much a breathed thought of negotiation with enemy not even soldier be recalled from army of spain quintus fabius maximus be chosen dictator with two newly raised legion marched to ariminum assumed command of army there raised by reinforcement brought with to fifty thousand men stringent order be issued to inhabitant of district through hannibal must march on way to rome to destroy crop drive off cattle take refuge in fortified town servilius be appointed to command of roman fleet ordered to oppose carthaginian at sea army of fabius be now greatly superior to of hannibal be inferior in cavalry have advantage of being in friendly country of being provisioned by people through whose country moved while hannibal be obliged to scatter army greatly to obtain provision fabius moved army until within six mile of of hannibal then took up position upon hill contenting with watching from distance movement of carthaginian hannibal marched unmolested through of richest province of italy till descended into plain of campania obtained large quantity of rich booty inhabitant in case held aloof from belief in star of rome being still unshaken in spite of revers have befallen fabius followed at safe distance avoiding attempt of hannibal to bring on battle roman soldier fretted with rage indignation at seeing enemy so inferior in strength to wasting plundering country at will minucius master of horse second in command fiery officer sympathized to full with anger of soldier continually urged upon fabius to march army to assault fabius be immovable terrible defeat hannibal have inflicted upon two roman army showed how vast must be danger of engaging such opponent unless at great advantage such advantage thought saw when hannibal descended into plain of campania plain be inclosed on south by river vulturnus must be passed only at bridge at casilinum defended by roman garrison at town while on other side be surrounded by unbroken barrier of steep wooded hill pass of be strongly guarded by roman after seeing that road over hill be strongly held by troop fabius sat down with army on mountain whence must watch doings of hannibal force on plain be amply supplied with provision from country in rear awaited patiently time when hannibal having exhausted resource of campania must be forced by starvation to attack roman in almost impregnable position in pass hannibal be perfectly aware of difficulty of position have be free unencumbered by baggage might have led army directly across wooded mountain avoiding pass guarded by roman with enormous trail of baggage be impossible unless abandoned rich plunder army have collected of two outlet from plain by appian latin road led to rome must be safely attempted for roman army must have followed in rear attacked while endeavouring to force passage in mountain same objection applied to crossing vulturnus only bridge be strongly held by roman river be far too deep rapid for passage to be attempted elsewhere with great roman army close at hand mountain range between vulturnus cades be difficult in extreme a pass be few very strongly guarded be here that hannibal resolved to make attempt to lead army from difficult position in be placed waited quietly in plain until supply of food be beginning to run low then prepared for enterprise immense number of cattle be among plunder two thousand of stoutest of be selected torch be fastened to horn shortly before midnight light troop drove ox to hill avoiding position of pass guarded by enemy torch be then lighted light troop drove ox straight up hill animal maddened by fear rushed tumultuously forward scattering in direction on hillside continually urged by troop behind mounting towards summit of hill roman defender of pass seeing great number of light moving upwards supposed that hannibal have abandoned baggage be leading army straight across hill idea be confirmed by light troop on gaining crest of hill commencing attack upon roman posted below in pas through hannibal intended to move roman troop thereupon quitted pas scaled height to interrupt harass retreating foe a soon a hannibal saw light moving on top of hill commenced march african infantry led way be followed by cavalry then came baggage booty rear be covered by spaniard gaul defile be found deserted by defender army marched through unopposed meanwhile fabius with main army have remained inactive roman general have seen with astonishment numerous light making way up mountain side feared that be device on part of hannibal to entrap into ambush a have entrapped flaminius on lake trasimene therefore held army in readiness for might occur until morning broke then saw that have be outwitted rear of carthaginian army be just entering defile in short time fabius saw gaul spaniard scaling height to assistance of comrade who be maintaining unequal fight with roman latter be soon driven with slaughter into plain carthaginian troop descended into defile followed retreating army hannibal now came down into fertile country of apulia determined to winter there took by storm town of geronium where stored supply placed sick in shelter while army occupied intrenched camp formed outside town chapter xvi in dungeon of carthage fabius after escape of hannibal from trap in believed have caught followed into apulia encamped on high ground in neighbourhood intending to continue same waiting tactic be however soon afterwards recalled to rome to consult with senate on matter connected with army left minucius in command with strict order that must on account suffer to be enticed into battle minucius moved forward to within five mile of geronium then encamped upon spur of hill hannibal aware that fabius have left hoped to be able to tempt impatient minucius to action accordingly drew nearer to roman encamped upon hill three mile from position hill lay about halfway between two army hannibal occupied during night with two thousand of light troop next day minucius attacked position drove off defender encamped there with whole army for day hannibal kept force united in intrenchment feeling sure that minucius must attack latter however strictly obeyed order of fabius remained inactive be important to carthaginian to collect ample supply of food before winter set in hannibal finding that roman must not attack be compelled to resume foraging expedition two third of army be despatched in various direction in strong body while rest remained to guard intrenchment be opportunity for minucius have be waiting at once despatched whole of cavalry to attack foraging party with infantry advanced to attack of weakly defended carthaginian camp for time hannibal have greatest difficulty in resisting assault of roman at last body of four thousand of forager who have beaten off roman cavalry made way into geronium came out to support roman retired hannibal seeing energy minucius have displayed fell back to old camp near geronium minucius at once occupied position have vacated partial success of minucius enabled party in rome who have long be discontented with waiting tactic of fabius to make fresh attack upon policy minucius be now raised to equal rank with fabius minucius elated with elevation proposed to fabius that must command whole army on alternate day must permanently command one half fabius chose latter alternative for felt certain that impetuosity of colleague must sooner later get into trouble with adversary a hannibal that be better to risk destruction of army than of whole minucius withdrew troop allotted to encamped in plain at distance of mile half from fabius hannibal resolved at once to take advantage of change to tempt roman to attack by occupying hill lay about halfway between camp of minucius geronium plain surrounded hill be level destitute of wood hannibal on careful examination found that there be several hollow in troop must be concealed in during night posted five thousand infantry five hundred cavalry position occupied by be such that must be able to take roman in flank rear must advance against hill having made disposition sent forward body of light troop in morning to occupy hill minucius immediately despatched light troop supported by cavalry to drive from hannibal reinforced carthaginian by small body of troop fight be obstinately maintained until minucius whose blood be now up marched towards hill with legion in order of battle hannibal on side advanced with remains of troop battle became fierce general until hannibal gave signal to troop in ambush who rushed out charged roman in rear flank destruction must have be a complete terrible a have befallen army of sempronius at trebia have not fabius moved forward with troop to save broken legion of minucius fabius now offered battle hannibal well content with heavy blow have struck great loss have inflicted upon command of minucius fell back to camp minucius acknowledged that fabius have saved army from total destruction at once resigned command into hand reverted to former position under army then went into winter quarter malchus have not be present at fighting near geronium two day after hannibal broke through roman position round plain of campania intrusted malchus with important commission commanding bodyguard of general being closely related to malchus be greatly in hannibal confidence be indeed on same footing with mago hannibal brother two three other of most trusted general gathered in general tent on previous evening have agreed with leader that final success must not be looked for in enterprise unless reinforcement be received from carthage be now year since have emerged from alp on to plain of northern italy have annihilated two roman army have marched almost unopposed through of

will rise above patriotic consideration rome will fall to piece unless find man strong vigourous enough to grasp whole power of state to silence chattering of politician to rule with rod of iron be wandering from subject will undertake mission will malchus replied firmly if think worthy of have eloquence a speaker know nothing of art of politician there will be plenty of friend there who will be able to harangue multitude hannibal replied be presence there a representative of army a kinsman a son of general who did such good service to state will profit cause be mission to tell carthage now

particular of need party of horse will accompany to coast with score of men used to navigation there will seize ship sail for corinth whence will have difficulty in obtaining passage to carthage after next day malchus started taking nessus with a attendant companion party travelled night in morning long line of sea be visible from summit of hill be crossing waited for hour to rest refresh horse then continuing journey came down in afternoon upon little port at mouth of river biferno so unexpected be approach that inhabitant have not time to shut gate troop entered town without resistance people flying to house malchus at once proclaimed that carthaginian came a friend must if unmolested injure one if armed attempt be made against must sack destroy town two three vessel be lying in port malchus took possession of largest putting party of seaman on board ordered crew to sail for corinth horseman be to remain in town until vessel returned when with party on board must at once rejoin hannibal wind be favourable next morning mountain of greece be in sight in afternoon entered port of corinth anchor be dropped at short distance from shore small boat be lowered malchus accompanied by nessus be rowed ashore by two of own men then returned on board ship at once weighed anchor set sail on return corinth be large busy port arrival departure of little vessel from italy passed altogether unnoticed without attracting particular attention malchus companion made way along wharf trade of corinth be large flourishing scene reminded malchus of with be so familiar in carthage ship of many nationality be ranged along quay galley from tyre cyprus from syria egypt from carthage italy be assembled in neutral port corinth be like carthage essentially trading community while power glory of rival city of peloponnesus be rapidly failing corinth be rising in rank be now first city of greece malchus have difficulty in finding carthaginian trading ship be amply supplied with money soon struck bargain that captain must without waiting to take in further cargo at once sail for carthage captain be much surprised at appearance in corinth of young carthaginian evidently of high rank be too well satisfied at bargain have made to ask question hour later mooring rope be cast off vessel spreading sail started on voyage weather be warm pleasant malchus stretched on couch spread on poop greatly enjoyed rest quiet after long month have be spent in almost incessant activity upon following day nessus approached lord malchus said there be on board ship who know have overheard men talking together seems that one of recognized a having be in habit of going out with fisherman who lived next door to at carthage matter not malchus said indifferently have particular motive in concealing name though must have be a well that must be able to meet friend in carthage consult with before arrival there be generally known however before leave ship can distribute money among crew tell that for certain reason of state wish to mention on shore have be passenger have malchus be aware that ship in have taken passage be one of great fleet of trader owned by hanno must have regarded discovery of personality by sailor in more serious light a be thought no more of matter change in manner of captain showed that be aware of name rank of passenger malchus a watched wide expanse of sea broken only by few distant sail be too intent upon mission with be charged to give matter moment thought wind fell light be not until evening of eighth day after leaving corinth that carthage with citadel of byrsa rising above must be distinguished ship be moving slowly through water captain said that unless change took place must not make port until late next morning malchus retired to couch feeling sorry that period of rest tranquillity be at end that be now about to embark in difficult struggle though felt importance be altogether alien to taste disposition have not even satisfaction that must see mother sister for news have come short time before sailed that position be so uncomfortable at carthage that have left for spain to take up abode there with adherbal anna mother be heard completely broken down in health by grief for loss of father be wakened in night by splash of anchor running out of cable through hawse hole supposed that breeze must have sprung up little that have anchored at entrance to harbour soon went off to sleep again be presently aroused by what seemed to sound of short struggle followed by splash dreamingly wondered what must be then went off to sleep again when awoke be daylight somewhat surprised at non appearance of nessus who usually came into cabin first thing in morning to call soon attired on going to door of cabin be surprised to find fastened without knocked loudly against to attract attention almost immediately found in darkness going to porthole to discover cause of sudden change found that sack have be stuffed into immediately afterwards sound of hammering told that plank be being nailed over outside to keep in place truth washed across be prisoner drawing sword flung with force against door have be so securely fastened without that did not yield in slightest to effort after several vain effort abandoned attempt sitting down endeavoured to realize position soon arrived at something like truth trading interest of carthage be wholly at disposal of hanno party doubted not that having be recognized captain have determined to detain a prisoner until communicated to hanno fact of arrival received instruction from a to whether malchus be to be allowed to land malchus recalled sound have heard in night uttered exclamation of grief anger a concluded that faithful follower have be attacked doubtless killed thrown overboard at present be powerless to do anything with sword grasped in hand lay on couch in readiness to start up fight way out a soon a heard without undoing fastening of door day passed slowly must hear voice without footstep on deck of poop overhead one came near after time watchfulness relaxed a made up mind that captor whatever intention might be must not attempt to carry out until after nightfall at last heard moving of heavy article have be piled against door sprang to foot door opened two three inch voice said in name of republic declare to be prisoner warn will resist malchus exclaimed be malchus son of hamilcar late general of republic come to carthage on mission from hannibal complaint state may have against be ready to answer at proper time will not fail to appear when called upon at present have hannibal mission to discharge who interfere with be traitor to republic whomsoever may be will defend until last open door seize voice exclaimed a door be opened malchus sprang forward light of several lantern showed dozen men with levelled spear standing in front of cabin surrender said seeing that against force a resistance must be vain in name of hannibal protest against interference with messenger whom have sent to explain in name to senate situation in italy so saying malchus laid down shield sword took off helmet walked quietly from cabin at order from superior four of men laid down weapon seized in minute be bound hand foot gag be forced into mouth cloak thrown over head be roughly thrown into large boat alongside ship short a be time have at liberty malchus have thrown glance over bulwark of side of ship perceived that resistance must have be useless for far away lay light of carthage be evident that vessel have made little progress since have retired to rest on previous evening have be inside harbour have intended to spring overboard at once to trust to escape by swimming person in command of party have seized malchus took place at helm of boat twelve agent seated at oar rowed away towards carthage town be nearly eight mile away be two hour before arrived there place where landed be at distance from busy part of port two men be waiting for there with stretcher upon malchus be laid four men lifted on shoulder others fell in round a guard party then proceeded through quiet street towards citadel hour be late few people be about who paused for moment to look at little procession shrank away hastily on hearing dreaded word in name of republic uttered by leader of party citizen of carthage be too well accustomed to midnight arrest to give matter further thought save momentary wonder a to who be last victim of tyrant of city to indulge perhaps in secret malediction upon malchus have from first doubt a to destination when felt sudden change in angle at stretcher be carried knew that be being taken up steep ascent to byrsa heard presently challenge of sentry then there be pause a gate be opened then be carried forward for awhile there be stop litter be lowered to ground cord be unfastened be commanded to rise needed glance upwards to tell where be above towered dark mass of temple of moloch facing be small door known to citizen of carthage a leading to dungeon under temple brave a be malchus must not resist shudder a entered portal accompanied by four of guard preceded by jailer question be asked by latter doubtless coming of prisoner have be expected prepared for way lay down long flight of step through several passage hewn in solid rock passed many closed door until at last turned into one stood open gag be then removed from malchus ' mouth door be closed behind heard bolt fastened then remained alone in perfect darkness malchus felt round wall of cell found that be about six foot square in one corner be bundle of straw spreading out threw upon bitterly meditated over position into have fallen own situation be desperate enough be helpless in hand of hanno friend partisan of hannibal be ignorant of coming must hope for help from have little doubt a to what fate must be must be put to death in cruel way hannibal relative friend must never know what have become of from moment when left italian vessel in port of corinth hopeless a be own situation malchus thought more of hannibal brave companion in arm than of manner in have be kidnapped by agent of hanno showed how determined be that demagogue to prevent true state of thing prevailed in italy from becoming known to people of carthage in order to secure own triumph party be willing to sacrifice hannibal army to involve carthage in most terrible disaster at last malchus slept when awoke faint light be streaming down into cell in centre of room be opening of about foot square above sort of chimney extended twenty foot up through solid rock to surface where be covered with iron grating malchus knew where be along side of great temple extended row of grating level with floor citizen knew that be through aperture light air reached prisoner in cell below sometimes groan cry be heard to rise who be near must hurry from spot for knew that spy of law be ever on watch to be suspected of entering into communication with prisoner must be sufficient to ensure condemnation death be sight of grating thought of dismal cell below have increased aversion malchus have felt a boy to enter bloodstained temple little a have dreamed that day must come when must be lying prisoner in one of knew that be useless for to attempt by shouting to inform friend in city of presence there narrowness of air passage closeness of grating above deadened confused voice unless to person standing immediately above opening a visitor to temple carefully avoided vicinity of grating must be waste of breath to attempt to call attention a to escape be out of question cell be cut in solid rock door be of enormous strength even must have be overcome there be many others must have to be passed before must arrive at entrance to dungeon in short time numidian entered bearing bread pitcher of water malchus addressed negro opened mouth malchus saw that tongue have be cut out perhaps in childhood perhaps a punishment for crime more probably man be slave captured in war who have be mutilated to render safe useful instrument of officer of law three hour later door again opened two men appeared ordered malchus to follow led through number of meandering passage until at last opening door ushered into large chamber be lighted by torch at table in centre of room be seated seven figure in one seated in chair very slightly above others malchus at once recognized hanno companion be leading men of faction malchus son of hamilcar hanno said what have to say why thus secretly come to carthage come not secretly malchus replied come hither a messenger of hannibal to senate be charged by to lay before exact situation in italy to tell how much have already accomplished what yet remains to be done to explain to need there be that reinforcement must be despatched to to carry out great design for annihilation of power of rome come not in secret passed in ship from italy to corinth there at once hired vessel to convey hither a be member of senate hanno said can deliver message to fear that will go further malchus replied fact have be thus secretly seized carried here show how far be wish that people of carthage must know message still a even in breast patriotism may not yet be dead a word may move yet to do something to enable hannibal to save republic will give message sent to deliver to senate murmur of angry surprise arose from seven men at bold word defiant bearing of prisoner how dare thus address judge hanno exclaimed judge malchus repeated scornfully executioner must say think know not that death be resolved on even if must dare not free noble of carthage son of general who have lost life in service cousin of great hannibal after have thus treacherously seized thrown into dungeon cowed a people of carthage be by tyranny corrupted a be by gold lawless act of oppression must rouse to resistance hanno be because know that doom be sealed thus fearlessly defy creature malchus then proceeded to deliver message of hannibal to senate showed exact situation of affair in italy urged that if reinforcement asked for be sent success of arm of carthage final defeat humiliation of rome be assured while on other hand if hannibal be left unaided army must in time dwindle away until too feeble to resist assault of roman ally warned hearer that if catastrophe must come about rome flushed with victory smarting under defeat humiliation hannibal have inflicted upon must in turn become aggressor must inflict upon carthage blow similar to with rome have be menaced by hannibal hanno companion listened in silence malchus for time forgot own position character of men addressed pleaded with earnestness passion such a must have used have be addressing whole senate when have finished hanno without word motioned to jailer placing one on side of malchus led back to cell chapter xvii escape for next two day malchus be visited only by numidian who brought food third night a be lying on straw wondering how long hanno must be before decided fate started to foot a heard apparently close at hand name whispered be repeated now perceived that came from above yes said in low tone looking upwards be malchus who speaks to be nessus voice replied thanks to god have found lord how did get here nessus feared that be drowned swam to shore arab said then watched outside gate here saw several prisoner brought in doubted not that be among be at port when ship came in found that brought no passenger then came up here again soon found friend among arab regiment in garrison obtained employment in stable of elephant night when have be still have crept here have whispered name down of grating tonight have heard now that know where be will set to work to contrive escape be passage from cell here wide enough to admit being drawn up yes malchus replied must be close fit with rope must get up through will set to work to loosen bar at once nessus said difficulty be not to get out from here to get beyond gate of citadel watch be extremely strict gate be not opened until nine o'clock before escape must be discovered will be impossible for to pas out undetected must find hiding place where can lie concealed until search be over vigilance of sentry be relaxed will be easy matter now let speak more be dangerous to breathe much le to speak here not word be spoken for hour malchus must hear low continuous scraping noise a nessus with dagger worked away upon stone into grating fitted at last nessus spoke again have nearly finished lord greater part of grating be loose in hour can complete work daylight will soon be breaking must go tomorrow night will return with rope hope today to find place where may be concealed malchus with renewed hope threw upon straw lay there until about noon when be again summoned to presence of judge be same whom have seen previously malchus son of hamilcar hanno said be now brought before to hear crime with be charged have here before written list of name of member of conspiracy headed by giscon have for aim murder of many of senate of carthage overthrow of constitution have also here confession of several of conspirator confirming list saying that be one of party deny malchus said firmly that did once visit place in speak of met that name be then entered on roll when went there be wholly ignorant of purpose of association a soon a learned aim object withdrew from did not again visit place of meeting must not well do hanno said since be writ down that sailed very shortly afterwards for spain own did so malchus replied told giscon on very day that accompanied to meeting must go there no more moreover commissioner with hannibal army have already inquired into circumstance in consideration of fact be then little more than sixteen year old that be led ignorantly into plot at once separated from absolved from blame commissioner have authority to do so hanno replied be ordered to send to carthage failed to carry out order only because hannibal then a always set above authority of republic a have confessed that be member of conspiracy further trial be needed court award to same punishment be meted to others concerned in conspiracy will tomorrow be put to death by usual punishment of press malchus abstained from reply for struck at once be to defy anger judge might order to be instantly executed therefore without word turned accompanied jailer to cell waited impatiently for night hour seemed long indeed before heard whisper of nessus above directly arab received reply assuring that malchus be still there again set to work in hour grating be removed rope lowered malchus fastened under arm knotting in front then whispered to nessus that be ready arab drew slowly steadily up until head be in entrance of narrow passage malchus have grasped rope a high a possible above head hung by hand thereby drawing shoulder upwards reducing width a much a possible then managed to swing so that body be diagonally across opening when thus placed found to joy that passage be large enough for to pas through without much difficulty slowly steadily nessus drew up until shoulder be above level of ground when malchus placing hand on pavement sprang noiselessly out grating be replaced without word being spoken glided from temple not word be said until have gone little distance have saved life again nessus malchus said laying hand upon shoulder twelve hour must have be too late be to have be put to death in morning nessus gave fierce exclamation placed hand on knife have slain lord said must have avenged must have dogged enemy night day till one by one knife must have found way to heart have found hiding place nessus there be one place of safety lord can think of have talked over with two three faithful friend agree that so rigid will be search that will be well nigh impossible for anyone within wall of citadel to escape detection spy of hanno be everywhere men fear within wall even to whisper what think at rate more secure hiding place must be found than have decided upon where be that nessus be in reservoir with four water skin plank have prepared raft two friend be waiting for at one of entrance will have fitted raft together will be in readiness be not likely to search for there idea be excellent nessus reservoir of carthage be of enormous extent of remain to day be wonder admiration of traveller be subterranean be cut from solid rock stone extracted from being used for wall of building of city pillar be left at interval to support roof be calculated that underground lake for be le contained sufficient water to supply want of great city for at least six month vast storing place for water be absolute necessity in climate like of northern africa where rain fall seldom without indeed carthage must have be at mercy of first army laid siege to greatest pain be devoted to maintenance of water supply rainfall from roof of temple house be conducted to reservoir store be never drawn upon on ordinary occasion town being supplied with water brought by aqueduct from long distance among hill here there opening be cut in rock formed roof of reservoir for admission of air at few point step from surface led down to water iron gate guarded entrance to nessus friend have evening before unfastened one of gate lock be old little used a gate be placed rather to prevent child others going down to water than for other purpose arab have found little difficulty in picking rough lock malchus followed down step until reached edge of water fifty foot below surface here stood two arab bearing torch at foot of step floated raft formed a nessus have said of four inflated sheepskin connected by framework of plank across bullock hide have be stretched forming platform on be rug skin of wine pile of flat cake fruit together with dozen torch thanks friend malchus said to arab day may be able to prove be grateful to friend of nessus be friend one of arab replied simply lord be master here be paddle lord nessus said propose that must paddle straight away a far a can see torch burning here then that must fasten raft to pillar other night will come with provision here show light if see light burn steadily be safe for to approach come only to bring food news if see torch wave to fro be warning that intend to search reservoir think likely will do so still be best to be prepared in case must paddle far away in recess might search for long time before find trust that imprisonment here will not be long that may hit upon plan of getting out of citadel must gladly go with to share solitude must remain outside to plan way of escape with short farewell to faithful follower malchus took place on raft having lit torch fastened upright upon then paddled slowly away keeping between line of heavy column rate of progress be slow for hour kept torch in sight by time felt sure that must be approaching boundary of reservoir therefore moored raft against pillar waved torch backwards forward signal be answered by similar movement of distant light then disappeared malchus now extinguished own torch placed mean of relighting with nessus have furnished close to hand then wrapping in rug lay down to sleep when awoke be day light be streaming down on to water from opening two three hundred yard away while far in distance must see faint light marked place of step at have embarked in neighbourhood of opening column stood up clear gray against dark background little further off outline be dim misty wherever else looked inky darkness met eye save one two faint band of misty light marked position of distant opening stillness reigned in vast cavern be almost oppressive sometimes faint rustling whisper echo of sound in citadel above passed among column plaintive squeak of bat be heard now then for number of creature be flitting noiselessly in darkness form visible for instant a passed repassed between malchus light wondered vaguely what must find to eat here then remembered that have heard that at nightfall number of bat must be seen flying up from opening to reservoir to seek food without returning to hiding place when morning approached malchus amused by thinking over fury astonishment of hanno colleague on hearing that prisoner have disappeared pictured to hot search be doubt going on throughout citadel thought improbable in extreme that search must be made in reservoir nessus must refasten gate after passing through again idea that must be floating on subterranean lake must hardly occur to then turned over in mind various device by might be possible to get beyond wall of citadel anxiety of hanno acting with to prevent manner in have kidnapped sentenced to death messenger kinsman of hannibal from becoming known in city must be so great that extraordinary vigilance must be used to prevent from leaving citadel guard on wall must be greatly increased none must be allowed to pas gate without most rigourous examination while nook corner of citadel temple barrack storehouse stable must be searched again again even must search be made in reservoir malchus have little fear of discovery for even must boat come towards spot where be lying must only have to pas raft round to opposite side of great pillar twelve foot square against be lying when light faded out again lay down to sleep a before slept soundly for however great heat above air in subterranean chamber be always fresh cool must well bear rug nessus have provided next day passed more slowly for have le to think about after daylight have again faded began to look forward expectantly for signal although knew that many hour must still elapse before nessus must be able to make way to place of meeting so slowly did hour pas indeed that began at last to fear that something must have happened perhaps that nessus have be in way recognized be now in dungeon below temple of moloch at last however to joy malchus saw distant light burned steadily at once set out to paddle towards did not light torch must have taken time knew that quietly a paddled sound must be borne along surface of water to nessus at last arrived at step nessus be there alone beside be basket of fresh provision well nessus what news be well lord hanno be moving heaven earth to find gate of citadel be kept closed day yesterday although today have again be opened examination of who pas out be so strict that disguise must avail to deceive scrutiny of searcher one other of men who attended in prison be always at gate barrack have be searched from end to end troop occupying being turned out while agent of law searched from top to bottom same have be done with stable be well that did not attempt to hide above ground for assuredly if have done so must have found however cunningly have stowed away of course name of prisoner who have escaped be known to none report that important prisoner have escaped from state prison beneath temple have created quite excitement in city for be said that event never took place before at present can hit on plan for getting free then must be content to wait for while nessus after time vigilance be sure to relax a will think that must have got beyond wall be there to whom must wish to bear news that be here be question malchus have debated with over over again appeared to however that hanno power be so great that must be dangerous for anyone to come forward accuse doubt one of leading men of barcine party be strictly watched did hanno suspect that of be in communication with escaped prisoner must take instant step against thought better therefore that none must be acquainted with secret until be free therefore replied in negative to question of nessus must wait till be free action now might bring down vengeance of hanno upon others must find difficulty in inventing excuse for dealing blow at think there be possibility of escape at present can think on plan lord so strict be search when elephant went down today to fountain for water howdah be examined to see that one be hidden within will be necessary also nessus if do hit upon plan for getting out to arrange hiding place in city will be easy enough nessus replied friend have many relation in arab quarter once free might be concealed there for time now will wait no longer for last night visit be made in barrack stable by agent of law to see man be asleep in place therefore will return without delay in two day will be here again must anything occur be needful to tell will be here tomorrow night malchus watched for light on following evening with faint hope of seeing at about same hour a before saw suddenly appear again wondering what have brought nessus before time paddled to stair well nessus what be news have hit upon plan of escape lord a told friend be in stable with elephant duty being to carry in forage for great beast to keep stable in order have taken one of indian mahout into confidence have promised aid elephant of be in charge be docile beast driver have taught many trick at signal will put up trunk scream rush here there a if in state be called must when be dangerous of approach mahout who be crafty fellow taught to act thus because when in state of temper elephant can not be worked with others remain in stable driver have easy time of on promise of handsome reward mahout have agreed that tomorrow morning before elephant be taken out will be concealed in bottom of howdah will manage that elephant be first in procession when get out into courtyard will slyly prick beast give signal to simulate rage will then so direct that after charging several time about court will make rush at gate may be sure that guard there will step aside quickly enough for furious elephant be not creature to be hindered when be once down to foot of hill driver will direct to quiet spot that will find easily enough for at approach there will be general stampede when reach place where one be in sight will halt elephant will at once drop off will be near at hand will join elephant will continue course for little distance mahout feigning to have at last recovered control over will direct back to citadel idea be capital one malchus said if carried out will surely succeed have often seen during campaign elephant in state know how one fly a come along screaming loudly with trunk high great ear out on side of head at rate be worth trying nessus if by chance must fail in getting through gate mahout must of course take elephant back to stable might slip out there conceal till night then make way back here again be what have arranged nessus said now lord will leave go back to stable in case must search again tonight if will push off lie short distance away from step will be here again hour before daybreak will bring garb like own will take direct to stable where animal be kept there will be one there save mahout two friend so that will be easy for to cover in howdah before elephant go out there be little chance of anyone coming into stable before for have be searched so frequently during last two day that hanno agent must by time be convinced that wherever be hidden be not there indeed today search have greatly relaxed although vigilance at gate on wall be a great a ever so think that despair of finding believe that must either have made escape already that if not will sooner later issue from hiding place fall into hand malchus slept little that night rejoiced when again saw nessus descending step few stroke of paddle sent raft alongside nessus fastened cord to to prevent from drifting away may need again said briefly malchus placed own clothes upon threw over shoulder bernous nessus have brought then mounted step with gate be closed bolt shot then made way across to stable be still perfectly dark though very faint light low in eastern sky showed that ere long day must break five minute walking arrived at stable of elephant like of horse ox drew cumbrous war machine be formed in vast thickness of wall be what be known in modern time a casemates a nessus have said indian mahout other two arab be only human occupant of casemate elephant at once showed that perceived newcomer to be stranger by uneasy movement mahout quieted while be waiting for morning nessus described more fully than have hitherto have opportunity of doing attack made upon on board ship be said a lord know uneasy when found that have recognized when be within day sail of carthage resolved to keep lookout therefore although wrapped in cloak lay down did not go to sleep after while thought sound of oar standing up went to bulwark to listen suddenly of sailor who must have be watching sprang upon from behind cloak be thrown over head rope be twisted round arm in moment be lifted flung overboard did not cry out because have already made up mind that be better not to arouse from sleep happened a have run out might have be killed thought likely that object must be if offered resistance to take prisoner in case trusted that might later on hope to free a lord know be good swimmer let sink when well below surface soon got rid of rope bound be indeed hastily twisted round arm came up to surface a noiselessly a possible after taking long breath dived swam under water a far a must when came up ship be so far away that there be little fear of seeing however dived again again until in perfect safety heard boat rowed by many oar approach vessel listened for time found that be quiet then laid out for long swim to shore reached without difficulty day kept eye on vessel remained at anchor a must not tell to landing place might be brought went up in evening took post on road leading up here when towards morning party entered carrying one with on stretcher have little doubt that be be sure to find friend among arab belonging to regiment stationed in byrsa employed in storehouse stable so next morning entered citadel soon met men who belonged to tribe village after way be plain only fear be that might kill before must discover place in be confined heart sank first night when found that though whispered down one of grating must obtain reply have many answer indeed not from there might be many cell besides with opening into temple be placed in one of might never hear of again have resolved that if next night passed without being able to find must inform of known to be friend of hannibal that be prisoner leave in hand to act a liked while still continued effort to communicate with may imagine with what joy heard reply on following night must have be asleep first night malchus said did not hear voice feared to speak above whisper lord there be priest night in sanctuary behind great image day have by time broken stir bustle commenced in front of long line of casemates elephant be brought out from stable stood rocking from side to side while keeper rubbed hide with pumice stone nessus be one of who be appointed to make great flat cake of coarse flour formed principal food of elephant other arab busied in bringing in fresh straw malchus scattered evenly over stall heap of freshly cut forage be placed before elephant in short time one of arab took place of nessus in preparing cake while nessus moved away presently went down into town to await coming of malchus by arrangement if superintendent of stable came round must find proper number of men at work be not likely to notice substitution of malchus for nessus with whose face must not yet have become familiar by time number of townsman be a usual coming up to citadel to worship in temple to visit friend dwelling there malchus learned that since escape have be known person on entrance received slip of brass with stamp on have to give up on leaving employed in citadel received similar voucher without none must pas gate time be now come when elephant be accustomed to be taken down to fountain in town below critical moment be at hand mahout have already begun to prepare elephant for part be to play have be trumpeting loudly showing sign of impatience anger animal be now made to kneel by door of stable where malchus have already lain down at bottom of howdah piece of sacking being thrown over by arab two arab mahout carried howdah out placed on elephant securely fastened in position howdah be of rough construction being in fact little more than large open crate for elephant after being watered went to forage yard where crate be filled with freshly cut grass young bough of tree carried up for own use to citadel mahout took position on neck elephant then rose to foot symptom of bad temper have already given be now redoubled gave vent to series of short vicious squeal trumpeted loudly angrily although mahout appeared to be doing best to pacify became more more demonstrative superintendent of elephant rode up have better dismount take brute back to stable said be not safe to take out morning a approached elephant threw up trunk opened mouth rushed suddenly at officer fled hastily shouting loudly to other mahout to bring animal in circle round elephant mahout gave sudden prod with pricker elephant set off with great stride ear out trunk in air with sign of access of fury at top of speed rushed across great courtyard people flying in direction with shout of terror made two three turn up down time getting somewhat nearer to gate a approached for third time mahout guided towards accustomed at hour to sally out elephant made sudden rush in direction officer on guard shouted to men to close gate before must attempt to carry out order elephant charged through at top of speed went down road chapter xviii cannae a elephant tore down road to town many be narrow escape that a thought coming up have of being crushed thrown into air by

to left avoiding busy street of town directed course towards more quiet road of opulent quarter of megara cry of people at approach of elephant preceded course took refuge in garden house latter became le le frequent until at distance of two mile from foot of citadel mahout on looking round perceived one in sight brought elephant suddenly to standstill quick lord exclaimed now be time malchus threw off sack climbed out of howdah slipped down by elephant tail usual plan for dismounting when elephant be on foot then sprang across road leaped into garden hid among bush mahout now turned elephant a if have succeeded at last in subduing slowly retraced step towards citadel minute two later malchus issued out quietly followed have gone distance when saw arab approaching soon recognized nessus turned off together from main road made way by bystreets until reached lower city at spot near port found one of arab from above awaiting at once led way to house inhabited by family scheme have be entirely successful malchus have escaped from citadel without possibility of suspicion arising that have issued from gate in arab garb must now traverse street unsuspected nessus be overjoyed at success of stratagem malchus must hardly believe that have escaped from terrible danger threatened nessus arab at once returned to citadel be agreed that former have better continue work a usual until evening then ask for discharge on plea that have received message requiring presence in native village for be thought that suspicion might be excited be to leave suddenly without drawing pay possibly search might be instituted in city to discover whereabouts at nightfall returned then went to house of one of leader of barcine party with message from malchus to tell where be event have occurred since landing at carthage asking to receive privately in two hour time in order that might consult a to best plan to be followed nessus returned saying that manon be at home be awaiting two at once set out for house manon who be distant relation of malchus received most warmly listened in astonishment to story of what have befallen malchus then explained mission with hannibal have charged asked advice a to best course to be adopted manon be silent for time hanno faction be powerful at present said be hannibal here doubt whether voice must stir senate into taking action such a be needed time have be hard hanno party have lavished money so freely among lower class that there be hope of stirring populace up to declare against think must be in highest degree dangerous be a propose to introduce suddenly to senate a hannibal ambassador to leave to plead cause must obtain hearing hanno must rise in place denounce a one already condemned by tribunal a enemy to republic must demand instant execution a have great majority of vote in senate demand must be complied with must be convinced throw away life for good purpose while presence mysterious escape from prison must be made pretense for fresh series of persecution of partisan understand a well a do urgency for reinforcement being sent to italy in order to do navy now rotting in harbour must be repaired command of sea must be regained fresh levy of troop made to ask carthage to make sacrifice in present mood be hopeless must await opportunity friend will prepare way will set agent to work among people when news of victory arrives people hope be aroused excited will strike while iron be hot call upon to make one great effort to bring struggle to conclusion to finish with rome forever such be in opinion only possible mode of proceeding to move now must be to ensure rejection of demand to bring fresh persecution upon so to weaken that must be powerless to turn to good account opportunity news of great victory must afford will write at once to hannibal explain circumstance of situation will tell why have counselled to avoid carrying out instruction seeing that to do so now must be to ensure own destruction greatly damage cause in meantime must for short time remain in concealment while arrange for ship to carry back to italy sooner better malchus said bitterly for carthage with hideous tyranny foul corruption forgetfulness of glory honour even safety be utterly hateful to trust never again will set foot within wall better thousand time to die in battlefield than to live in accursed city be natural that must be indignant manon said for young blood run hotly in vein rage at seeing fate be too certainly impending over carthage be powerless to prevent be in way to be blamed old men bow more resignedly to decree of god know saying 'those whom god must destroy first strike with madness carthage be such see unmoved heroic effort hannibal army be making to save will not stretch out hand to aid life contentedly under constant tyranny of hanno rule satisfied to be wealthy luxurious slothful to carry on trade to keep rich caring nothing for manly virtue indifferent to valour preparing slowly surely to fall easy prey to rome end probably will not come in time may come in yours come certainly surely will nation can place mere handful of own citizen in line of battle voluntarily doom to destruction whether come in time not malchus said will be sharer in fate of carthage have done with if fall in battlefield will when war be over seek refuge among gaul where if life be rough be at least free independent where courage manliness honour count for much where enervating influence of wealth be a yet unknown such be firm resolution say nothing to dissuade malchus old man replied such be natural sentiment of age methinks be own time to come over again too must choose life in preference to existence in polluted atmosphere of ungrateful carthage now will stop here with will return to place where be staying need not say how gladly must have here can not answer certainly for safety movement of belonging to party be watched by hanno doubt not that have spy among slave servant therefore deem not inhospitable if say that be better for to remain in hiding where be let follower come nightly to for instruction let enter gate remain in garden near will come down see visit be known must excite suspicion bid on return watch closely to see that be not followed tell to go by devious winding to mix in thickest crowd in order to throw one who may be following off track before rejoins trust to be able to arrange for ship in course of three four day come again see before leave here be bag of gold will need to reward who have assisted in escape malchus at once agreed that must be better for to return to abode among arab thanking manon for kindness returned with nessus who have be waiting without a walked along malchus briefly related to follower substance of interview with manon suddenly stopped listened then resumed walk think be followed lord said one of hanno spy in manon household be doubt seeking to discover who be arab who have paid master visit have thought once before heard footfall now l be sure of when get to next turning do walk on will turn down road if man behind be honest will go straight on if be spy will hesitate stop at corner to decide of will follow then will know what to do accordingly at next crossroad came to nessus turned down concealed few pace away while malchus without pausing walked straight on minute later nessus saw dark figure come stealthily along stopped at junction of road stood for few second in hesitation then followed malchus nessus issued from hiding place with step a silent stealthy a of tiger tracking prey followed man when within few pace of gave sudden spring flung upon burying knife between shoulder without sound man fell forward on face nessus coolly wiped knife upon garment of spy then proceeded at rapid pace until overtook malchus be spy said will carry more tale to hanno two day later nessus on return from visit to manon brought news that latter have arranged with captain of ship owned by friend to carry across to corinth whence must have difficulty in taking passage to italy be to go on board late following night ship must set sail at daybreak next evening malchus accompanied by nessus paid farewell visit to manon repeated to instruction of hannibal manon handed letter for general again assured that must with friend at once set to work to pave way for appeal to populace at first favourable opportunity after bidding farewell to old noble malchus returned to house of arab prepared for departure have already handsomely rewarded two men mahout for service have rendered in course of day have provided with garment of trader character be now about to assume at midnight when be quiet nessus set out made way down to port where at little frequented landing stage boat be awaiting be at once rowed to ship be lying at anchor mile from shore in readiness for early start in morning although seemed next to impossible that must have be traced malchus walked deck restlessly until morning listening to sound be not until anchor be weighed sail hoisted vessel began to draw away from carthage that went into cabin on sixth day after leaving carthage ship entered port of corinth there be several vessel there from italian port before proceeding to arrange for passage malchus went to shop bought for nessus such clothing arm a must enable to pas without difficulty a fighting men belonging to one of latin tribe then made inquiry on quay finding that small italian craft be to start afternoon for brundusium went on board accosted captain want to cross to italy said have reason for not wishing to land at brundusium must fain be put ashore at distance from town be ready of course to pay extra for trouble request did not seem strange to captain malchus have spoken in greek language with who traded on mediterranean be familiar supposed that have in way embroiled with authority at brundusium have fled for awhile until matter blew over that be now anxious to return to home without passing through town asked rather high price for putting ashore in boat a wished malchus haggled over sum for considerable time a readiness to pay exorbitant price might have given rise to doubt in captain mind a to quality of passenger once twice made a if must go ashore captain at last abated demand to reasonable sum when be settled malchus went more ashore remained on board until vessel sailed a feared that might again be recognized by of sailor of carthaginian vessel in port weather be fair wind light on second day after sailing vessel lay to in bay few mile from brundusium boat be lowered companion set on shore have before embarking laid in store of provision not only for voyage for journey across country a slight knowledge malchus have of latin tongue must have betrayed at once be obliged to enter town village to purchase food carrying provision in bundle made for mountain after three day journey reached without interruption adventure camp of hannibal be still lying in intrenched camp near geronium roman army be a before watching at short distance off malchus at once sought tent of general whose surprise at seeing enter be great for have not expected that must return until spring malchus gave account of have taken place since left hannibal be indignant in extreme at hanno having ventured to arrest condemn ambassador when learned result of interview with manon heard how completely hostile faction be master of carthage agreed that counsel of old nobleman be wise malchus must have done good whereas must have exposed to almost certain death by endeavouring further to carry out mission with have be charged manon know what be best doubt premature attempt to excite populace to force hanno into sending reinforcement so much need must have not only failed must have injured cause friend will doubtless work quietly to prepare public mind trust ere very long decisive victory will give opportunity for exciting great demonstration on behalf remainder of winter passed quietly malchus resumed post a commander of hannibal bodyguard duty be very light greater part of time be spent in accompanying hannibal in visit to camp of soldier where nothing be left undone must add to comfort contentment of troop there be stronger evidence of popularity of hannibal of influence exercised over troop than fact that army under composed a be of men of so many nationality for most part originally compelled against will to enter service of carthage maintained discipline unshaken not only by hardship sacrifice of campaign through long period of enforced idleness in winter quarter from first to last through long war there be grumbling discontent insubordination among troop served willingly cheerfully have absolute confidence in general be willing to undertake most tremendous labour to engage in most arduous conflict to please knowing that on part be unwearied in promoting comfort well being at other time a spring advanced great magazine hannibal have brought with became nearly exhausted provision must be obtained from surrounding country have be completely ruined by long presence of two army became therefore necessary to move from position have occupied during winter roman possessed great advantage over of having magazine in rear constantly replenished by ally move where might be sure of obtaining subsistence without difficulty thus upon march be unembarrassed by necessity of taking great baggage train with when halted general must keep army together in readiness to strike blow whenever opportunity offered while hannibal on other hand be forced to scatter considerable portion of army in search of provision annual election at rome have just taken place terentius varro emilius paulus have be chosen consul emilius belonged to aristocratic party have given proof of military ability three year before when have commanded a consul in illyrian war varro belonged to popular party be described by historian of period a coarse brutal demagogue son of butcher having be butcher be unquestionably able man possessed great quality praetor marcellus who have slain gaulish king with own hand in last gaulish war be at ostia with legion be destined to command fleet to guard southern coast of italy while praetor lucius postumius with one legion be in cisalpine gaul keeping down tribe friendly to carthage before new consul arrived to take command of army hannibal have moved from geronium great roman magazine of apulia be at cannae town near river aulidus important place be fifty mile by shortest route across plain from geronium roman be unable to follow directly across plain for at time carthaginian greatly outnumbered in cavalry must therefore have to take road round foot of mountain be nearly seventy mile long yet by unaccountable blunder neglected to place sufficient guard over great magazine at cannae to defend for even few day against sudden attack hannibal saw opportunity when spring be passing into summer broke up camp marched straight to cannae where vast magazine of roman at once fell into hand thus not only obtained possession of enemy supply interposed between roman low lying district of southern apulia where alone at early season of year corn be fully ripe roman have now choice to advance fight battle for recovery of magazine for have retired apulians who have already suffered terribly from war must in sheer despair have be forced to declare for carthage while must have be extremely difficult to continue longer waiting tactic of fabius a must now have be obliged to draw provision from distance while hannibal must victual army from country behind senate therefore having largely reinforced army ordered consul to advance give battle have under eight full legion eighty thousand infantry seven thousand two hundred cavalry to oppose hannibal have forty thousand infantry ten thousand excellent cavalry of whom two thousand be numidian on second day after leaving neighbourhood of geronium roman encamped at distance of six mile from carthaginian here usual difference of opinion at once arose between roman consul who commanded army on alternate day varro wished to march against enemy without delay while emilius be adverse to risking engagement in country being level open be favourable to action of hannibal superior cavalry on following day varro whose turn be to command marched towards hostile camp hannibal attacked roman advanced guard with cavalry light infantry varro have supported cavalry not only by light troop by strong body of heavy armed infantry after engagement lasted for several hour repulsed carthaginian with considerable loss that evening roman army encamped about three mile from cannae on right bank of aufidus next morning emilius who be in command detached third of force across river encamped there for purpose of supporting roman foraging party on side of interrupting of carthaginian next day passed quietly on following morning hannibal quitted camp formed army in order of battle to tempt roman to attack emilius sensible that ground be against must not move contented with further strengthening camp hannibal seeing that roman must not fight detached numidian cavalry across river to cut off roman foraging party to surround harass smaller camp on side of river on following morning hannibal knowing that varro must be in command feeling sure that with impetuous disposition consul must be burning to avenge insult offered by surrounding of camp by numidian moved army across river formed in order of battle leaving eight thousand of men to guard camp by thus doing obtained position must better hold with inferior force while roman deeming that intended to attack camp on side of river must be likely to move whole army across to give battle in fact varro proceeded to do leaving ten thousand men in own camp with order to march out attack of hannibal during engagement led rest of troop over river having united force with in camp on right bank marched down river until faced position hannibal have taken up have be skillfully chosen river whose general course be east west made loop across hannibal have drawn up army with wing resting upon river thus roman must not outflank effect of vastly superior number in infantry must to extent be neutralized following be disposition of troop spaniard gaul occupied centre of line of infantry african formed two wing on left flank between african river placed heavy african gaulish horse eight thousand strong while two thousand numidian be posted between infantry river on right flank hannibal commanded centre of army in person hanno right wing hasdrubal left wing maharbal commanded cavalry varro placed infantry in close heavy order so a to reduce front to of carthaginian roman cavalry numbering two thousand four hundred men be on right wing be thus opposed to hannibal heavy cavalry eight thousand strong cavalry of italian ally four thousand eight hundred strong be on left wing facing numidian emilius commanded roman right varro left carthaginian faced north so that wind be blowing strongly from south swept cloud of dust over head full into face of enemy battle be commenced by light troop on side who fought for time obstinately courageously without advantage to while contest be going on hannibal advanced centre so a to form salient angle projecting in front of line whole of gaul spaniard took part in movement while african remained stationary at same time launched heavy cavalry against roman horse latter be instantly overthrown be driven from field with great slaughter emilius be wounded managed to join infantry while carthaginian heavy horse be thus defeating roman cavalry numidian maneuvered near greatly superior cavalry of italian ally kept occupied until heavy horse after destroying roman cavalry swept round behind infantry fell upon rear of italian horse while numidian charged fiercely in front thus caught in trap italian horse be completely annihilated so before heavy infantry of two army met other not roman cavalry soldier remained alive unwounded on field roman infantry now advanced to charge from nature of hannibal formation centre first came in contact with head of salient angle formed by gaul spaniard resisted with great obstinacy principe who formed second line of roman infantry came forward joined spearmen even triarii pressed forward joined in fight fighting with extreme obstinacy carthaginian centre be forced gradually back until be again in line with african on flank roman have insensibly pressed in from flank upon point where have met with resistance now occupied face scarcely more than that with have begun battle still further gaul spaniard be driven back until now formed angle in rear of original line in angle whole of roman infantry in confused mass pressed upon be moment for hannibal have waited wheeled round flank african who have hitherto not struck blow now fell in perfect order upon flank of roman mass while hasdrubal with victorious cavalry charged down like torrent upon rear then followed slaughter unequalled in record of history unable to open out to fight to fly with quarter asked given roman latin ally fell before sword of enemy till of seventy thousand infantry have advanced to fight forty thousand have fallen on field three thousand be taken prisoner seven escaped to small camp ten thousand made way across river to large camp where joined force have be left there have in obedience to varro order attacked carthaginian camp have be repulsed with loss of two thousand men troop in camp be forced to surrender on following morning thus only fifteen thousand scattered fugitive escaped of eighty seven thousand two hundred infantry cavalry under command of roman consul be loss in battle of cannae amounted to about six thousand men chapter xix in mine exultation of carthaginian at total destruction of enemy be immense maharbal of other leader urged hannibal at once to march upon rome hannibal knew spirit of roman people felt that capture of rome even after annihilation of army must be greater task than must undertake history have shown how desperate defence may be made by population willing to die rather than surrender roman essentially martial people must defend city until last gasp have abundance of arm there be two city legion formed regular garrison of capital instant news of defeat reached rome levy of male over seventeen year of age be ordered produced ten thousand men thousand cavalry eight thousand slave who be willing to serve be enlisted armed four thousand criminal debtor be released from prison pardoned on condition of taking up arm praetor marcellus be at ostia with ten thousand men with be about to embark for sicily thus rome must be defended by forty three thousand men while hannibal have thirty three thousand infantry cavalry strongest arm of force must be useless from cannae to rome be twelve day march with army encumbered with booty must not therefore hope for surprise wall of rome be exceedingly strong have with none of great machine must have be necessary for siege must have carried with supply have accumulated for subsistence of force when be consumed must be destitute fresh roman levy must gather on rear before long whole army must be besieged in such undertaking must have wasted time lost prestige have acquired by astonishing victory varro who have escaped from battle have rallied ten thousand of fugitive at strong place of canusium must be nucleus round rest of who have escaped must rally must be joined by fresh levy of italian ally of rome roman showed confidence in power to resist siege by at once despatching marcellus with ten thousand men to canusium thus with strongly defended city in front army of twenty thousand roman soldier must speedily increase to double number in rear hannibal perceived be to undertake siege of rome must risk advantage have gained determined therefore to continue policy have laid down for namely to move army to fro among province of italy until ally of rome one by one fell away from joined until such reinforcement arrived from carthage a must justify in undertaking siege of rome rome herself be never grander than in hour of defeat not for moment be courage confidence of citizen shaken promptness with prepared for defence still more confidence showed by despatching marcellus with legion to canusium instead of retaining for defence of city show national spirit manliness worthy of highest admiration varro be ordered to hand over command to marcellus to return to rome to answer before senate for conduct varro doubted not that sentence must be death for roman like carthaginian have little mercy for defeated general colleague army have undoubtedly be sacrificed by rashness moreover senate be composed of bitter political enemy must not hope that lenient view must be taken of conduct nevertheless varro returned to rome appeared before senate body nobly responded to confidence manifested in party feeling be suspended political adversary defeated general be alike forgotten be only remembered how varro have rallied troop how have allayed panic prevailed among have at once restored order discipline courage too in thus appearing after so great disaster to submit to judgment of country counted in favour fault be condoned senate publicly thanked because have not despaired of commonwealth hannibal in pursuance of policy to detach ally of italy from rome dismissed italian prisoner without ransom roman prisoner offered to admit to ransom deputation of accompanied ambassador to offer term of peace senate however not only refused to discus term of peace absolutely forbade family friend of prisoner to ransom thinking politic to enrich adversary to show indulgence to soldier who have surrendered to enemy victory of cannae hannibal clemency began to bear effect hoped for apulia declared for at once town of arpi celapia opened gate to bruttium lucania samnium be ready to follow mago with one division of army be sent into bruttium to take possession of such town a might submit hanno be sent with division to do same in lucania hannibal marched into samnium making alliance with tribe there stored plunder proceeded into campania entered capua second city of italy concluded alliance with mago embarked at one of port of bruttium to carry news of hannibal success to carthage to demand reinforcement rome carthage have complete mastery of sea a disaster have befallen rome by land must greatly lessen power to maintain large fleet carthage must now have poured reinforcement in by port of bruttium without difficulty unfortunately hannibal bitterest enemy be to be found not in italy in senate of carthage where in spite of appeal of mago effort of patriotic party intrigue of hanno faction demand made by war in spain prevented reinforcement from being forwarded must have enabled to terminate struggle by conquest of rome hannibal after receiving submission of several other town capturing casilinum went into winter quarter at capua during winter rome made gigantic effort to place army upon war footing with such success that excluding army of scipio in spain have when spring began twelve legion hundred twenty thousand men again under arm a reinforcement save elephant small body of cavalry ever reached hannibal from carthage be during remaining thirteen year of war reduced to stand wholly on defensive protecting ally harassing enemy feeding own army at expense yet so great be dread genius have excited that in spite of superior number roman after cannae never ventured again to engage in pitched battle soon after winter set in hannibal ordered malchus to take number of officer hundred picked men to cross from capua to sardinia where inhabitant have revolted against rome be harassing praetor quintus mucius who commanded legion formed garrison of island malchus officer under be charged with duty of organizing wild peasantry of island of drilling in regular tactic for unless acting a body of regular troop however much might harass roman legion must not hope to expel from country nessus of course accompanied malchus party embarked in two of capuan galley have not be many hour at sea when weather have when started be fine changed suddenly ere long one of fierce gale be so frequent in mediterranean burst upon wind be behind there be nothing to do to let galley run before sea got up with great rapidity nothing high poop at stern prevented two galley being sunk by great wave followed oar be laid in for be impossible to use in sea a night came on gale increased rather than diminished carthaginian officer soldier remained calm quiet in storm capuan sailor gave up to despair men at helm be only kept at post by malchus threatening to have thrown overboard instantly if abandoned after nightfall assembled officer in cabin in poop prospect be bad said pilot tell that unless gale abates wind change will before morning be thrown upon coast of sardinia will be total destruction for upon side facing italy cliff for most part rise straight up from water only port on side being that at roman have chief castle garrison tell there be nothing to be done see nought be to try to bring galley round to wind must be swamped in moment while even if must carry out operation must be impossible to row in teeth of sea therefore friend there be nothing for to do save to keep up courage of men to bid hold in readiness to seize upon chance of getting to shore must vessel strike night galley swept on before storm light on other boat have disappeared soon after darkness have set in soldier crew by turn be kept at work baling out water found way over side several time so heavily did sea break into that thought that be lost however when morning broke be still afloat wind have hardly shifted point since have begun to blow pilot told malchus that must be very near to coast of sardinia a light brightened eye be fixed ahead over waste of angry foaming water presently pilot who be standing next to malchus grasped arm there be land cried dead before not until few minute later must malchus make out faint outline through driving mist be lofty pile of rock standing by be island exclaimed be caralis pilot replied know outline well be already in bay look to right can make out outline of cliff at mouth have passed already see shore ahead because rock on caralis stand rise from level plain to left lagoon extends for long way in be there that roman galley ride god have brought to only spot along coast where must approach with hope of safety there be not much to rejoice at malchus said may escape sea only to be made prisoner by roman nay malchus alternative be not so bad young officer who be standing next to said hannibal have thousand of roman prisoner in hand may well hope to be exchanged after last twelve hour place on shore even roman prison be elysium compared to sea outline of coast be now clearly visible great rock of caralis now known a cagliari rose dark threatening low shore of bay on side be marked by band of white foam while to left of rock be broad lagoon dotted with black hull of number of ship galley rolling tossing heavily for a wind blew straight into bay lagoon be covered with short angry wave pilot now ordered oar to be got out entrance to lagoon be wide be only in middle that channel be deep on side of long breakwater of stone be run out from shore to afford shelter to shipping within sea be so rough that be found impossible to use oar be again laid in small sail be hoisted enabled head to be laid towards entrance of lagoon for time be doubtful whether galley must make succeeded in doing so then ran straight on towards upper end of harbour be far enough pilot said presently water shoal fast beyond must anchor here sail be lowered oar got out on one side head of galley brought to wind anchor be then dropped a storm beaten galley ran right up lagoon have be viewed with curiosity interest by who be on board ship at anchor that be italian galley be clear also that be crowded with men suspicion be entertained that be carthaginian anchor once cast malchus held council with other officer be in midst of foe escape seemed altogether impossible long before gale abated sufficiently to permit to put to sea again must be visited by boat from other vessel to ask who be whence came a to fighting way out be out of question for there be score of trireme in bay one of must crush capuan galley whose far greater speed rendered idea of flight a hopeless a of resistance council therefore agreed unanimously that only thing to be done be to surrender without resistance storm continued for twenty four hour then wind died out almost a suddenly a began a soon a sea began to abate two galley be seen putting out from town rowed directly towards ship fact that have shown no flag have doubt excited suspicion in mind of garrison galley contained fifty soldier a rowed alongside roman officer on poop of one of galley hailed ship demanded whence came be from capua pilot answered gale have blown across thence have on board fifty carthaginian officer soldier who now surrender to a in day when vessel must with difficulty keep sea in storm in event of gale springing up be forced to run before be by mean unusual for galley to be blown into hostile port announcement excited great surprise who command party roman officer asked do malchus replied be malchus son of hamilcar who be killed at trebia cousin of hannibal captain of guard surrender with follower seeing resistance be hopeless be hopeless roman replied be right not to throw away life of men when there be possibility of resistance a spoke stepped on board ordered anchor to be weighed galley accompanied by two roman boat be rowed to landing place messenger be at once sent up to mucius to tell have happened praetor soon appeared upon spot officer acquainted with name rank of leader of carthaginian party said that there be with two officer of noble family of carthaginian be well praetor said be piece of good fortune carthaginian have so many of officer in hand that be well to have whom may exchange for let be landed a left ship carthaginian laid down arm armour by time large number of roman garrison among whom news have rapidly spread be assembled at port many of young soldier have never yet seen carthaginian looked with curiosity interest at men who have inflicted such terrible defeat upon army of roman be fine specimen of hannibal force for general have allowed malchus to choose own officer men knowing that strength agility endurance must be needed for campaign in so mountainous country a sardinia have picked officer men with great care second in command be friend trebon who have long since obtained separate command who on hearing from malchus of expedition on be bound have volunteered to accompany men be african accustomed to desert fighting trained in warfare in spain roman good judge of physical strength must not repress murmur of admiration at sight of sinewy figure le heavy than there be about spring elasticity resembling that of tiger long use have hardened muscle until stood up like cord through tawny skin most of bore numerous scar of wound received in battle roman a viewed acknowledged to what formidable opponent men must be strong guard formed up on side of captive be marched through town to citadel on upper part of rock here large chamber opening on to courtyard be assigned to officer while men who be viewed in light of slave be at once set to work to carry store up to citadel from ship have arrived just a storm broke fortnight later vessel arrived from rome with message from senate that must not exchange prisoner that carthaginian be at once to be employed a slave in mine governor acquainted malchus with decision be sorry said indeed that be so senate be determined that will exchange prisoner of course view of matter be that when roman lay down arm disgrace refusal to ransom allow to be exchanged be intended to act a deterrent to others may be fair enough in case where large number surrender to few where lay down arm when with courage determination might have cut way through enemy in case where further resistance must be hopeless in mind men be justified in surrendering however can only obey order have received tomorrow must send men to mine a malchus have seen iberian captive sent to labour a slave in mine in spain fate thus announced to did not appear surprising barbarous in day captive taken in war be always made slave when be not put to death in cold blood although hannibal have treated with marked humanity leniency roman italian captive who have fallen into hand have be result of policy be by mean in accordance with spirit in war be then conducted accordingly next day carthaginian be under strong guard marched away to mine lay on other side of island forty mile due west of port three mile from western sea coast of island road lay for distance across dead flat country be well cultivated thickly studded with village for rome drew heavy tribute in corn annually from island after twenty mile march halted for night pursuing way on following morning have now

not find if once escaped be true enough malchus said there must be at least five six thousand slave here how must find food among mountain might exist for time upon berry grain must in end be forced to go into valley for food must then be slaughtered by roman nevertheless small body of men must doubt subsist among hill strength of guard see on height show that attempt to escape be not rare must

pig villager in lower valley will send up to feed on acorn have fear will be able to obtain plenty of flesh a to corn have only to make raid down into plain when have found out something about general lay of country hill extent of forest will choose spot near centre erect hut there if be not for peasant might live here for year for roman force in sardinia must be insufficient to rout out of mountain unfortunately a will have to rob peasant will act a guide to roman will be obliged to keep sharp lookout against surprise if get too hot for must make night march across plain to mountain on eastern side heard at caralis that wild part there be very much larger than be on side of island extends without break from port right up to north of island safe a felt from pursuit malchus posted

peasant who appeared stupefied with alarm at sudden uproar on seeing men burst out with levelled spear from wood sard gave scream of terror threw upon face when carthaginian came up to malchus stirred with foot refused to move then pricked with roman spear held man leaped to foot with shout malchus told in italian that be free to go that swine must be confiscated for use of follower man did not understand word seeing by gesture that be free to go set off at top of speed hardly believing that must have escaped with life in way concerned at loss of herd be indeed property of various individual in one of village at foot of hill being then a now custom for several men owning swine to send together under charge of herdsman into mountain where for month together live in half wild state on acorn root villager going up occasionally with supply of food for swineherd sooner have peasant disappeared than shout from one of men fifty yard away called attention of malchus here be man fire lord

there must be many swine in forest beside herd have captured life will not be unpleasant one stopped wish to end day here malchus put in for do be pleasant enough day spend here be waste of life with hannibal comrade combating might of rome can not be content to live like member of savage tribe here have doubt that will excite such annoyance alarm by raid among village in plain that roman will ere long make great effort to capture doubtless will enlist native in search still may hope to escape there be abundant point among mountain where may make stand inflict such heavy loss upon that will be glad to come to term must ask be that will swear by god to treat well to convey a prisoner of war to rome there to remain until exchanged in rome must await course of event patiently hannibal may capture city senate urged by relative of many prisoner have taken may agree to make exchange may see chance of making escape at rate will be in world will know what be going on must not hold out make agree to give freedom think so malchus said must be too much for roman pride to allow handful of escaped prisoner to defy in way even if prefect of island be to agree to term believe that senate must ratify have better not ask too much for own to longing to see rome a carthage hold back will send aid to hannibal have very little hope of ever entering a conqueror rather than not see at must not mind entering a prisoner there be mine to work there roman with so vast number of own people in hand of hannibal must not dare to treat with cruelty severity here be different rumour of fate will ever reach hannibal have one of died in stifling mine must never have be wiser two officer agreed with malchus a for soldier be too well pleased with present liberty escape from bondage to give thought to

remain a prisoner of war until exchanged being sent nowhere else suffering pain penalty for what have taken place on island roman general be surprised pleased with moderation of demand have feared that malchus must have insisted upon being restored with companion to carthaginian army in italy proposition must have be unwilling to forward to rome for must have be confession that roman force in island be incapable of overcoming handful of desperate men did not think that demand if made must have be agreed to by senate present proposition be vastly more acceptable must report without

hand of native on march two day journey took to caralis in good order with proud bearing marched through roman soldier who assembled in street to view so strange spectacle arrived at port embarked on board ship prepared for there piled arm on deck roman officer received handed over in accordance with term of agreement whole of clothing armour of have be deprived guard of soldier then marched on board hour later sail be hoisted vessel started for destination anxiously malchus companion gazed round horizon in hope that galley of capua carthage might appear in sight although indeed have small hope of seeing for carthaginian ship must be likely to be found so near coast of italy except indeed if bound with arm for use of insurgent in northern mountain of sardinia however sail appeared in sight until ship entered mouth of tiber a ascended river wall tower of rome be seen in distance prisoner forgot own position in interest excited by appearance of great rival of carthage at time rome possessed little of magnificence distinguished building in day of emperor everything be massive plain with slight attempt at architectural adornment temple of god rose in stately majesty above mass of building even be far inferior in size beauty to of carthage while size of city be small indeed in comparison to wide spreading extent of african rival vessel anchored in stream until officer in command landed to report arrival with prisoner to receive instruction hour later returned prisoner be landed received by strong guard of spearmen at water gate news have spread rapidly through city crowd of people thronged street while at window on roof be gathered number of lady of upper class party of soldier led way pushing back crowd a advanced line of spearmen marched on side of captive strong guard brought up rear to prevent crowd from pressing in there malchus walked at head of prisoner followed by officer after whom came soldier walking two two there be air of dejection in bearing of captive faced regard of hostile crowd with air rather of conqueror than of prisoner remembered that be by accident that have fallen into hand of roman in battlefield have proved over over again more than match for soldier of rome that be wall of city alone have prevented marching through street a triumphant conqueror be novel sight in rome for carthaginian prisoner to march through street for in previous campaign large number of carthaginian have be captured since hannibal crossed alp carried victorious army through italy scarce prisoner have be brought to rome while ten of thousand of roman have fallen into hand of hannibal lower class of population of rome be at time rough brutal captive be assailed with shout of exultation with groan menace with bitter curse by whose friend relative have fallen in war better class at window from housetop abstained from demonstration watched captive a passed with critical eye with expression of admiration at fearless bearing haughty mien truly youth who march at head might pose for carthaginian apollo sempronius roman matron said a sat at balcony of large mansion at entrance to forum have seldom seen finer face see what strength limb show although walk a lightly a girl have fancy to have a slave must look well to walk behind carry mantle when go abroad see to sempronius a father be military praetor can manage for without trouble will do best lady flavia young roman said there may be difficulty what difficulty flavia demanded imperiously suppose carthaginian will a usual be handed over a slave who must have better right to choose one among than whose husband tiberius gracchus be consul of rome none assuredly sempronius replied be only because a hear that youth be cousin of hannibal young a be captain of bodyguard thought that father might intend to confine in prison for better security flavia waved hand imperiously when did ever hear of slave escaping from rome sempronius be not wall high strong sentry numerous even did pas must not badge of slavery betray at once to first who met without must be captured brought back have set mind upon having a slave will go well with gaulish maiden whom postumius sent from bank of po last autumn like slave to be a handsome a other surroundings see reason why must be baulked of fancy will do best to carry out wish lady flavia sempronius replied deferentially for wife of consul be important personage in rome family be one of most noble powerful in city wealthy luxurious strong willed be regarded a leader of society at rome sempronius deemed essential for future advancement to keep on good term with at same time be ill pleased at last fancy of hers in first place be suitor for hand of daughter julia in second greatly admired northern beauty of gaulish slave girl whom have spoken of have fully intended that when flavia became tired of fancy seldom lasted long must get mother to offer to exchange horse hawk something else upon flavia might set mind for slave girl in case must of course be in power did not therefore approve of flavia intention of introducing handsome young carthaginian a slave into household be true that be slave at present be carthaginian noble of rank a high a of flavia that be brave be certain must not be captain of hannibal bodyguard julia be fully a capricious a mother might take a warm fancy for malchus a flavia have done while now idea of setting gaulish girl carthaginian together have seized flavia must render more distant time when roman lady might be reasonably expected to tire of girl however felt that flavia wish must be carried out whatever danger might be be le serious than certainty of losing lady favour unless humoured whim family be far le distinguished than hers approval of suit with julia be unexpected piece of good fortune owed a knew principally to fact that gracchus wished to marry daughter to julius marcius who have deeply offended flavia by outspoken expression of opinion that roman lady mingled too much in public affair that ought to be content to stay at home rule household slave knew that must have difficulty with father praetor be most anxious that son must make alliance with house of gracchus be custom that such prisoner taken in war a be not sacrificed to god must be given a slave to noble a yet great contest in arena cost life of such vast number of prisoner taken in war be not instituted occasional combat indeed took place be on small scale be regarded rather a sacrifice to mar than a amusement for people sempronius accordingly took way moodily home praetor have just returned having seen malchus officer lodged in prison while men be set to work on fortification sempronius stated flavia request praetor looked doubtful have intended said to have kept officer in prison until senate decided what must be done with of course if flavia have set mind on must strain point after there be special reason why prisoner must be treated differently to others of course can not send leader of party to flavia let others remain in prison a there be two of will send a present to two of principal family in rome so that if question arises upon subject will at once have powerful defender at rate will not do to offend flavia malchus a be led through street of rome have be making comparison by mean to favour of carthage greater simplicity of dress absence of luxury be so unbridled at carthage plainness of architecture of house free manly bearing of citizen impressed rough a be crowd who jeered hooted companion there be power vigour among be altogether lacking at home under influence of excitement populace there be capable of rising asserting general demeanour be that of subservience to wealthy powerful tyranny of senate weighed on people numerous secret denunciation arrest inspired man with mistrust of neighbour for none must say that be safe from action of secret enemy roman on other hand be respecter of person free citizen deemed equal of best plebeian held own against patrician must always return one of consul generally selecting man who have most distinguished by hostility to patrician tribune whose power in rome be nearly equal to of consul be almost always representative champion of plebeian power balanced that of senate be entirely in interest of aristocracy malchus be reflecting over thing in prison when door of cell opened sempronius accompanied by two soldier entered former addressed in greek follow said have be appointed by father praetor caius to be domestic slave of lady flavia gracchus until such time a senate may determine upon fate a carthage also enslaved prisoner taken in war malchus showed surprise although must have preferred labouring upon fortification with men to domestic slavery however light latter might be without comment then rose accompanied sempronius from prison domestic slavery in rome be not a whole severe fate master indeed have power of life death over slave must flog ill use a chose a rule treated well kindly roman be essentially domestic people kind to wife affectionate although sometimes strict with child slave be treated a other servant indeed with scarce exception servant be slave rule be easy labour by mean hard favourite slave be raised to position of trust confidence frequently amassed considerable sum of money be often granted freedom after faithful service chapter xxi gaulish slave on arriving at mansion of gracchus sempronius led malchus to apartment occupied by flavia face lighted with satisfaction have done well sempronius said will not forget ready gratification of wish so be young carthaginian friend will envy at having so handsome youth to attend upon do speak tongue asked graciously few word only malchus answered speak greek be tiresome flavia said addressing sempronius know language julia have be taught tell sempronius that duty will be easy will accompany when walk abroad will stand behind at table will have charge of pet young lion cub that tiberius procured for be getting troublesome need firm hand over nearly killed one of slave yesterday sempronius translated flavia speech to malchus will dress flavia said in white gold will look charming in be hardly dress for slave sempronius ventured to object suppose can dress a please lesbia wife of emilius dress household slave in blue silver suppose have a much right a have to indulge fancy certainly lady flavia sempronius said reverentially only thought that such favour shown to carthaginian might make other slave jealous flavia made answer waved fan to sempronius in token of dismissal young roman inwardly cursing haughty air took leave at once flavia handed malchus over to charge of chief of household with strict direction a to dress be to be obtained for with order to give animal into charge malchus followed man congratulating that if must serve a slave at least must hardly have found easier situation pet consisted of bright bird from east persian greyhound several cat young bear half grown lion of lion alone be fastened up in consequence of attack upon slave on previous day malchus be fond of animal at once advanced boldly to lion animal crouched a if for spring steady gaze of malchus speedily changed intention advancing to full length of chain rubbed against like great cat malchus stroked side then going to fountain filled flat vessel with water placed before lion lapped water eagerly since assault upon slave who usually attended to none of others have ventured to approach have indeed thrown food have neglected to supply with water will get on well together old fellow malchus said be african captive ought to be friend finding from other slave until previous day animal have be accustomed to run about house freely to lie in flavia room malchus at once unfastened chain for time played with lion appeared gentle good tempered a master of household soon informed others of order have received respecting malchus slave saw that newcomer be likely for time at least to stand very high in favour of capricious mistress therefore strove in way to gain goodwill presently malchus be sent for again found julia sitting on couch by side of mother at once acknowledged to that have seldom seen fairer woman be tall figure be full well proportioned glossy hair be wound in coil at back of head neck arm be bare wore garment of light green silk embroidered with gold stripe along bottom reaching down to knee while beneath petticoat of tyrian purple reached nearly to ground be not good looking julia flavia asked there be not slave in rome like lesbia fulvia will be green with envy julia made reply sat examining face of malchus with a much composure a if have be statue have bowed on entering a must have done in presence of carthaginian lady

give to clotilde intended for lion under influence of mingled firmness kindness of malchus have now recovered docility followed about house like great dog sleeping stretched out on mat by side of couch sempronius continued visit malchus be seldom present when be with flavia clotilde be generally in room be now height of summer duty be to stand behind mistress with large fan with kept up gentle current of air over flavia head drove off troublesome fly sometimes have to continue doing so for hour while flavia chatted with friend sempronius be biding time two slave be still high in flavia favour be in hope that something might occur must render willing to part with watched julia narrowly whenever malchus entered room became more more convinced that have taken strong fancy for carthaginian slave idea occurred to that by exciting jealousy might succeed in obtaining object so careful be malchus clotilde that have idea whatever that understanding existed between however mattered little nothing be more likely than that two handsome slave must fall in love with other determined to suggest idea to julia accordingly one day when be sitting beside while flavia be talking with other visitor remarked carelessly mother two slave carthaginian gaul must make handsome couple saw flush of anger in julia face for moment did not reply then said in tone of indifference yes be well favoured in way methinks idea have occurred to sempronius said have seen glance at other doubt not that when beyond presence confine to look julia be silent sempronius saw in tightly compressed lip lowering brow with looked from one to other that shaft have told have wondered sometimes said in idle moment whether ever met before carthaginian be for time among cisalpine gaul girl be have told daughter of chief there may well have met julia made reply sempronius feeling that have said enough began to talk on other subject julia scarcely answered at last impatiently waved away sat silent abstracted until last of visitor have left then rose from seat walked quietly up to mother said abruptly to clotilde who be standing behind mistress did know slave malchus before met here suddenness of question sent blood up into cheek of gaulish maiden julia felt at once that hint of sempronius be fully justified yes clotilde answered quietly met when with hannibal came down from alp into country why did not say so before julia asked passionately mother slave have be deceiving julia flavia said in surprise why heat what matter to whether have met before julia did not pay attention stood with angry eye waiting for clotilde answer did not know lady julia girl said quietly that affair of slave be of interest to recognized other when first met long ago now when be in different

have be playing under nose send to whipping post dear julia flavia exclaimed more more surprised at anger what harm have be done astonish clotilde can retire what mean julia went on more severely when be alone why strange passion because two slave who by chance have met other before be lover what be gaulish girl what be carthaginian slave to love julia said passionately flavia exclaimed in angry surprise julia of house of gracchus love slave be mad girl shameless say so without shame julia replied why must not be noble of carthage though now prisoner of war what if father be consul malchus be cousin of hannibal who be greater man than rome have ever yet seen why must not wed in first place seems julia flavia said gravely because love someone else in second place because a hear be likely to be exchanged very shortly for praetor taken prisoner at cannae will soon be fighting against in third place because rome must be scandalized be roman maiden of patrician order of house of gracchus to marry one of invader of country go to julia blush for so be reason why of late have behaved so coldly to sempronius shame on daughter what must father say did on return from field hear of doings go to chamber let see again till can tell that have purged madness from vein without word julia turned left room parental discipline be strong in rome none dare disobey parent command although julia have far more liberty license than most unmarried roman girl did not dare to answer mother when spoke in such tone flavia sat for time in thought then sent for malchus have already exchanged few word with clotilde be therefore prepared for question malchus be true that love gaulish slave girl be true malchus replied quietly when met in gaul two year since be daughter of chief noble of carthage loved be

come to aught may rely upon that will go hence with with expression of deep gratitude malchus retired flavia in thus acceding to wish of malchus be influenced by several motif be sincerely shocked at julia conduct be most desirous of getting malchus clotilde away for knew that daughter be headstrong a be passionate presence of clotilde in house must even be malchus absent be source of strife bitterness between herself daughter in second place must be pretty story to tell friend must be able to take credit to herself for magnanimity in parting with favourite attendant lastly in present state of affair might possibly happen that must be of slight advantage to have friend possessed of great power influence in carthaginian camp husband might be captured in fight be not beyond bound of possibility that rome might fall into hand of carthaginian be therefore well worth while making friend of man who be near relation of hannibal for day julia kept own apartment household knew that something have gone wrong though none be aware of cause general feeling of uneasiness existed for julia have from child in fit of temper be harsh with slave venting temper by cruelly beating pinching many slave have be flogged by order at time for mother although easy mistress seldom interfered with caprice that did be good in eye of father at end of week flavia told malchus that negotiation for
