fashion government must not permit if be ours if professor must consent to allow to attempt experiment if must escape vigilance of american cruiser manage to convey marvel of marvel to scene of action must not join in enterprise carol must not aid in striking blow for freedom must certainly be most interesting to test little craft in actual service replied young american cautiously interesting say be of vital importance what have done be nothing who know what may accomplish when will there come such chance for trying in warfare where in world be there prize to be gained equal in value to of free cuba that father have sacrificed life for be proudest boast may soon fight by side fondest hope oh if cold blooded american must witness cruelty oppression despair horror of if can not win over dearest friend among how may hope to persuade others ah dios be hard be bitter be pitiful that for want of single helping hand must be lost at point young cuban feeling so overpowered that word failed to express a carl baldwin policy be to remain silent during outburst lad reached school building in lodged without further conversation since carlos moranza have left home affair of native land have come to sorry pas struggle for freedom have begun spanish army devastated fair island killing inhabitant laying waste field destroying home while spanish war ship patrolled coast to cut off outside

on ground that must still have ample opportunity for fighting after have become skilled engineer in meantime must do much for cause where be must remember that to perfect in chosen profession must be of greater value to cuba than winning of battle stimulant be what made young moranza one of most brilliant scholar in baldwin polytechnic for felt that problem solved be blow struck for country at time of mermaid successful trial trip in young cuban have be allowed to participate a distinguished reward of merit have received no word from father sister for many week so be filled with anxiety concerning a lad reached school separated carlos proceeding directly to room other going in search of professor river to report safe housing of mermaid professor be so buried in thought that for few moment apparently took notice of carl entrance suddenly lifting head looking squarely at lad exclaimed yes yes boy be well so far a have gone what will do in actual service how will behave in face of enemy be capable of single handed successful attack against fleet until question be answered how may know whether lifework be success failure to solve must willingly engage navy in single combat where may find one willing to accept challenge why not in cuba sir suggested carl with sudden inspiration cuba cuba repeated professor slowly a though bewildered by idea thus presented then plunged once more into abstracted thought after waiting few moment longer seeing that guardian be disinclined for further conversation just then carl baldwin departed to tell friend of seed have planted to dismay found carlos standing a though petrified staring with bloodshot eye at telegram evidently just received what be west what have happened inquired young baldwin anxiously read that replied other huskily with extended message be signed by president of cuban junta war committee whose headquarters be in new york city general moranza captured by treachery shot by order of weyler daughter seized imprisoned held for transportation to penal colony may god help in hour of affliction for father death grieve not cried young cuban died for cause loved may be avenged for sister own little catina in prison at mercy of brute consigned to living death of convict how may bear can do tell friend for be going mad cried carl baldwin will not go mad even yield to despair for will yet save professor will go with will take mermaid even now be inclined to consider such undertaking when read message will be a ready to set forth a oh yes dear fellow can rescue will instead of going to penal colony will come to country be a free a be at moment a spoke young american seized friend hand latter looking into brave blue eye now blazing with excitement believed that catina must be saved chapter ii

divided into three compartment of one farthest forward be fitted with air lock through person wearing diver suit might leave vessel while be under water return to at will hold be also pierced for bull eye through must be made to shine electric search light of intense power central compartment be living operating room also contained dynamo air compressor small condenser by mean of sea water must be made drinkable in after compartment be located compact powerful gasoline engine furnished motive power for running on surface also stored electricity by screw must be turned when surface air be no longer available beneath floor of central compartment be tank for water ballast must be filled emptied at will of operator in part of boat be hundred of tube wire cock valve other device of amazing ingenuity for ensuring safety of crew discomfiture of enemy be indeed a carlos moranza have said one of crowning scientific marvel of century on day succeeding that of trial trip young cuban be full of hope courage for professor river have be won to cause by enticing prospect of achieving rescue of young girl from dreadful fate at same time testing under most trying condition power of beloved boat have only stipulated that must not be used for destruction of life property thus happened that in le than week one of most powerful tug on delaware cleared for havana have in tow great dumping scow such a be used in new york harbour for conveying city garbage far out to sea scow be built with long central pocket bottom of be longitudinally divided into two part of be hung on massive hinge must be made to drop open outward thus allowing content of pocket to fall into sea then by mean of donkey engine great valve must be drawn up closed a before question of how to get mermaid to havana have proved most puzzling be too small to undertake such voyage by herself have be shipped on deck of vessel movement must have be watched heralded while success of proposed expedition depended upon secrecy thus at very outset must be rescuer seemed to be confronted by insurmountable difficulty then carl baldwin have thought of sea going dumping scow several of have be built in father shipyard where one recently completed even now awaited purchaser why must take mermaid to cuba in suggested after several other plan have be dismissed a impracticable very thing cried carlos moranza in way must carry right into havana harbour there offer scow for sale to spaniard a blind be noble idea carol will prove salvation might be done said professor thoughtfully let go take measurement did found that pocket of dumping scow be amply large to hold mermaid at same time allowing free egress exit must even float when closed half filled with water only few alteration readily suggested to professor be needed to exactly suit great craft to purpose while took charge of carlos took trip to new york for consultation with president of cuban junta carl baldwin arranged for charter of finest sea going tug on delaware through captain for purchase of dumping scow professor have long since placed practical direction of school in hand of able assistant so that be free to leave at moment notice for length of time thus when announced that be about to devote few week to testing of pet invention must need assistance of two ranking pupil departure be effected without arousing undue curiosity clearing of tug with novel tow for havana be however quite thing from moment destination be announced craft be watched by government official spanish spy to see that contraband cargo be taken aboard of course nothing of kind be found did not prevent revenue cutter from escorting tow down river across delaware bay until be clear of breakwater well out at sea finally cutter turned back even then commander continued to watch tow through glass in spite of seeming innocence regard that a one of most suspicious departure ever made from delaware remarked to lieutenant who stood beside pretence of trying to sell scow in havana be only baldest kind of bluff fool know that blooming spaniard be going to put to either expense trouble of carrying garbage out to sea so long a can dump in harbour hello what be look quick tell if see something between through glass thrust into hand lieutenant took long comprehensive survey of intervening water sir see anything reported at length do now said other after look must have sworn though saw something like raft moving towards scow commander have indeed caught glimpse of mermaid rising to surface to get bearing have instantly dived did again visit surface until safely within shadow of great scow have run down river night before have lain behind breakwater with only small portion of turret above surface until tow with accompanying cutter have passed out to sea then followed with eye just awash dove deep beneath revenue vessel when turned back upon next coming to surface have be allowed to rise little too far so be very nearly discovered be close shave admitted carl baldwin after mermaid be safely ensconced within closed pocket of great scow safe miss be a good a thousand mile now be right till get to havana be too sure of admonished captain of tug gruffly there be many cruiser between here there one of be sartin to board so proved at charleston where tug put in for coal leaving tow in lower bay scow be boarded by revenue officer who did not leave until be again at sea while poor little mermaid be dodging about under water only coming up now then for breath quick glance at surroundings like hunted sea fowl off

professor entire satisfaction how easily must if chose place fire torpedo must blow from water have be decided to touch at key west most southerly extremity of florida a well a of united state only eighty five mile across gulf stream from havana finally after many narrow escape from discovery adventurer reached port of quaint island city in safety here found several american men of war small

that have be object of suspicion way down coast so before came to anchor be boarded by united state officer guard be placed on tug scow with order to allow communication between shore except under strict surveillance in meantime little mermaid have sunk quietly out of sight did again rise to surface until safely beneath wharf covered with freight shed extended out to deep water here hidden in deepest shadow lay unobserved until when lad found difficulty in gaining street of town leaving professor in charge of beloved boat a carlos moranza have visited key west before led way without hesitation amid throng of promenaders among whom white be rarest colour to be seen coal black negro from jamaica sallow complexioned spaniard swarthy cuban mulatto quadroon octoroon creole with face tinted in shade of brown yellow jostled other on side walk talking singing laughing with eager gesticulation electric light gleamed among softly nestling leaf of tall cocoa palm open carriage bearing

guard stationed at main entrance forbade admission except to such person a be of well attested patriotism halt may not pas cried one of a lad having forced way through crowd sought to enter for answer carlos moranza spoke few word in so low tone only might hear illustration strange tow slowly making way up harbour instantly man stood aside touched cap respectfully motioned to enter a did so third person attempted to pas guard in company be seized on threshold be hombre of party senor asked guard certainly not replied carlos never saw before so intruder who be evidently of spanish blood be ignominiously thrust back a slunk away muttered word boded good to carlos moranza in case must again meet in meantime young cuban accompanied by carl baldwin made way to balcony where agent of junta have just finished reading of garcia victory a carlos touched on shoulder turned quickly frowned at sight of stranger again lad whispered magic formula in moment agent be embracing with fervour of life long friendship then led guest to private room where for hour engaged carlos in earnest conversation of young baldwin must only understand occasional word when lad finally left building regained street latter asked curiously what be about old man said replied carlos that spanish cruiser now in port be here for express purpose of escorting to havana that a soon a be outside key west harbour will place guard on tug scow hm remarked carl baldwin reflectively ca allow must say not agreed carlos moranza only 'd like to know how be to prevent just leave to will show trick rejoined young american chapter iii so intent be lad upon conversation that mistook freight shed for one beneath mermaid be hidden walked few pace beside before discovering error when did so at once began to retrace step in turning corner of building came plump upon cloaked figure evidently on trail hello what do mean sir by following cried carl baldwin seizing stranger arm a spoke with muttered oath man wrenched free darted away not before gleam of street light have revealed feature to carlos very fellow who tried to force way into quarter of junta exclaimed more than likely spanish spy be narrow escape carol for if blunder have not forced to turn back must have discovered mermaid in case must indeed have met with trouble let hasten then before return will dare do that be too badly scared spy did return

idly concerning stream of phosphorescent light tailing out from under counter thought of only a natural phenomenon have known that be caused by motion of mermaid propeller necessary to hold in position against stream while hovered like gigantic fish directly above screw of ship how easily must have won promotion for longed suspected nothing a carl baldwin working from diving chamber of submarine craft have succeeded in fastening one end of short length of stout wire rope to propeller blade shackling other to ring bolt in massive rudder officer turned with sigh walked away on following morning spanish spy weary cramped with long vigil be amazed to see utter stranger emerge cautiously from beneath wharf have be watching walk quickly away for moment spy be undecided a to whether must follow person seek to discover where have come from then choosing former course followed professor river at respectful distance until have vast satisfaction of seeing meet near custom

hastily urged boat in direction to amazement disgust when reached spot where have disappeared must discover trace of be there boat hiding place into must have gone man be furious at being thus baffled uttered many fierce spanish oath finally convinced that further search in direction be fruitless pulled out into harbour to watch mysterious tow still lay at anchor a drew near to saw captain come off from shore alone then guard from one of revenue cutter be withdrawn anchor be lifted tow began to move slowly down channel be certain that one save captain have gone aboard have cargo be taken in except few ton of carefully examined coal never in life have spy be so puzzled disappointed be slight consolation to know spain vigilant cruiser must accompany gringo to havana even now be black

reseated with back turned squarely toward young american latter have suspected nature of insulting epithet applied to in street have be unable to reply to on account of limited knowledge of spanish with enforced silence anger have smouldered until now when broke into sudden fierce heat acting upon impulse of moment lifted own chair planted in front of spaniard deliberately reoccupied stared enemy full in face without uttering word a carlos moranza realised companion intention started towards be detained by fourth man who have be seated at table who whispered hurriedly fly for life amigo while there be yet time for moranza to be arrested in havana mean sure speedy death can not leave friend gasped young cuban bewildered at being thus promptly recognised where believed to be unknown will only suffer imprisonment dare not kill government be too powerful for moment carlos moranza hesitated then resolution be taken can not desert cried gaining place where carl baldwin sat grasped

seize cuban emblem numbed a though by stroke of lightning boat crew be thrown into state of wildest panic by explosion close under bow of giant fire cracker be great fun cried carl baldwin who be in charge of diving room ventilation explosive be bewildering answered professor without taking eye from pressure gauge indicated exact distance below surface at moment three be demonstrating worthlessness a fighting machine of world navy from time on nation of earth will be compelled by fear to live at peace with other wish must sink just one spanish ship said carlos moranza from engine room of course must do replied professor river in fact must within one hour time destroy warship in harbour must be wicked cowardly act boy will not harm single human being in glorious experiment at same time be perfectly willing to inspire with wholesome fear just scare stiff laughed carl baldwin by time darkness have settled over scene entire spanish fleet be fully aroused news of mysterious happening in harbour have even spread to part of city general moranza realised that powerful friend be already at work illustration alfonso xix lay in glow of diffused light seemed to come from beneath very keel two hour later while officer crew of alfonso xix be still discussing with bated breath recent supernatural appearance of cuban emblem be startled by again seeing floating on surface short distance from time instead of being simple silken flag be outlined in flame of red white blue there be confused shouting of order then rattling fire of machine gun began to tear through water just beyond blazing emblem with first sound of firing vanished minute later alfonso xix lay in glow of diffused light seemed to come from beneath very keel so did for be point from mermaid be just then operating candle power search light a spaniard waited in breathless terror for what must happen next fully expecting to be hurled into eternity by tremendous explosion dense volume of sickening smoke rose slowly from water on side of ship until be completely enveloped in suffocating fold in vain effort to escape terror against must not fight spaniard slipped mooring with idea of steaming out to sea to dismay great screw must have driven through water at speed of twenty mile hour refused to move vast bulk of alfonso xix only drifted helplessly now fiery emblem of free cuba be again seen moving swiftly from point to point fired at by ship after ship disappearing with shot only to flash out again moment later in unexpected quarter erratic course be marked by eddying cloud of pungent smoke burst of flame loud explosion threw whole harbour into uproar of terror panic stricken ship of spain dropped mooring made desperate effort to escape from enemy that must neither see fight seemed to hold at mercy of must not move others must not be steered drifted helplessly colliding with one running aground blinding other with flashing search light incessantly swept black water in direction filled with terrified men who implored saint to save illustration threw whole harbour into uproar of terror be alarm confined to spread to city where in quarter church bell rang madly drum sounded quick call to arm trumpet blared mass of people poured through avenue leading to water front havana be dominated by such reign of terror a history have never known while confusion be at height heavy firing from south announced insurgent attack with general call for troop followed even military guard of prison be temporarily pressed into service at five minute before midnight a marked by carlos moranza watch cause of turmoil slipped unnoticed into dock of fishmarket lay motionless with only low turret rising above surface at exactly midnight young cuban closed watch with snap listened eagerly to rapidly approaching rattle of wheel then carriage dashed through crowd lining water front staring like so many bewildered moth at flashing search light of warship a drew up sharply at head of dock man in uniform of spanish general leaped from be quickly followed by slender youth apparently mere boy also in uniform at moment whole scene be suddenly illumined by glare of light seemed to

dumping scow ten day later clumsy tow with real object of long voyage still unsuspected moved slowly up delaware river came to anchor off baldwin shipyard in answer to chaff of such acquaintance a rallied on folly of trying to sell dumping scow to spaniard of havana captain of tug be wont to say yes be true failed to sell scow made five thousand dollar out of trip same professor river be equally satisfied with success of venture so of course be carlos moranza a for carl baldwin made home voyage in state of delightful bewilderment why did tell west that sister instead of being mere child a be led to suppose be very loveliest most beautiful girl in world asked of friend after introduction to catina because answered carlos moranza who have heretofore only seen young lady in

ensued in quick course of older man be pinned against bulwark while vessel rolled deeply tremendous wave washed into waist furiously then one knew how captain overbalanced dropped overboard disappeared in raging sea mate have hardly saved a wave have nearly swamped bertha rushed in cascade along deck finally escaped impetuously by scupper illustration captain overbalanced dropped overboard disappeared in raging sea man overboard be cry a mate fell back on deck down helm make ready quarter boat in moment be confusion hand be almost paralysed by occurrence mr halbrake who have be below with two youthful passenger came hurriedly upon deck for moment bertha be left to herself plunged rolled deeply wave dashed wildly over a high cross sea invaded deck fore aft for minute appeared settling down stability asserted rolled back again when men steadied by helm on course thought of saving unfortunate master be by time abandoned must have sunk immediately men went about avocation in silence doctor assisted mate who have fallen cut head rather badly interrogated closely mr halbrake found powerless in matter of discipline though so closely connected with one of owner

calmer sea lad took opportunity to examine ship inspected oil tank harpoon chest store cabin penetrated to forecastle made friend with men learned many thing about sealing whaling be much surprised at strength of ship strong hull thick bulwark clamped bow arm chest store ammunition food be also inspected sampled later voyage proceeded without marked incident then yet storm attacked bertha put into port proceeded southward with ever varying weather novel experience for passenger so parallel be traversed to trade line be approached ii day after day passed last storm from north west have at length subsided weather be becoming very warm sailor donned straw hat other light head gear thin garment deck be scorching wind fell entirely one day late in october when in sailing barque people must have be whistling for wind bertha fell in with north east trade sail shifting ceased engine be at rest time there be much dissatisfaction in mind of three passenger esau cordell manner be not in favour boy disliked heartily even young surgeon be prejudiced against new commander three friend kept together frequently compared note on experience feeling can not understand why step father sent fellow aboard ship remarked doctor be lying on hot deck beneath shade of quarter boat suspended in board why must have sent arthur to mediterranean if be delicate though admit that for money reason replied reginald 'boss be a stingy a tom cat get jaunt gratis stingy believe said arthur declares be a poor a church mouse mouse must be poor indeed if depended upon offertory ah then perhaps have other motive murmured doctor however continued aloud will both go home well fit reggie may still go to cambridge arthur may go a please perhaps try bar a have private mean will see said arthur quietly say doctor somehow ca forget that letter about 'traitors on board what be about wonder poor old captain be enraged have something to go upon think what became of paper asked reginald have mate got know suspect have be picked up somewhere replied doctor there be nothing suspicious now at rate be there said arthur nodding significantly at last speaker mate came into berth last night very quietly when saw be awake mumbled something went out why did tell asked reginald thought have fastened door perhaps heard one in passage close by said mr halbrake perhaps dreamt saw man plainly in dim light must have be early in morning expect that beast esau meaning young sir go on mind feeling continued mate sarcastically be only beast know three chum be perfectly dumfounded man have come upon so silently so cautiously what have heard be sorry that happened to hear young friend opinion said mr halbrake after pause seems however to have objection to of course understand understand that accredited surgeon of vessel partner believe of owner be inciting passenger to insult commander late skipper found out what meant when attacked if cub be not careful may find yourselves in limbo illustration hullo young spitfire so want lesson do cub exclaimed reginald what do mean by such insolence be mean cad think drove old captain overboard hullo hullo young spitfire so want lesson do well then take advice hold tongue in future else of will be put in iron below will have mutiny here doctor have best just keep to yourself else will find thing raspy for with hint significant nod to three seated in shade of boat commander walked away advent have struck party dumb departure have similar effect upon at length after cautious look around reginald remarked must have be listening after took matter fairly well to be called beast to be spoken of a possible murderer be fair test of temper so be 'cubs ' said arthur be beast anyway must like to find paper then must know what to believe be afraid will find mean to 'pay out ' said surgeon reflectively let keep quiet perhaps have be too hard on though can not understand what object have in setting captain against that did so be evident what object have 'dear papa ' in sending arthur in ship yet did knowing must go also be surprised doctor must be planned thing do think oh impossible exclaimed surgeon rising from desk must be careful be lad acted on advice nothing occurred to alarm bertha approached line one day after heart breaking doldrums have be passed under steam equinoctial be reached about end of october one must draw line somewhere suppose remarked arthur to jackson here be can see asked with great assumption of innocence certainly replied man calmly be just ahead if ascend to cross tree may see dipping like gold silver rope in wave take glass have squint thanks replied arthur somewhat abashed will see presently be uncertain what prank might be played upon when high jinks be rule of road at sea near line so waited approach of neptune patiently sea king came over bow in due course accompanied by spouse secretary be attended by number of policeman follower who seized questioned intended victim be shaved with hoop compelled to swallow grease pill then soused in water sail while queerly dressed animal seal such like assisted in ducking doctor did not escape owing to what people thought be accident young man having be roughly shaved soused jumped upon in bath be hunted down companion way here came into violent collision with commander who be at moment ascending surgeon be thrown down backwards rendered insensible by fall mr halbrake be carried below attended by young friend mate festivity of occasion be not greatly interrupted arthur sat with reginald in doctor berth conversing in whisper with grave face artie said latter be getting into fix seems to that be doomed somehow bertha be under ban be afraid there be something bad here reggie cordell be at bottom of wish be at bottom of sea yes seems inclined to remove one by one whose turn next wonder do think that be pirate exclaimed arthur surely dear step father must not have put in situation must perhaps might have have reason whispered strange voice boy started looked fearfully around who have spoken be alone with sleeping man what must know how must talk thus in sleep wounded a be reginald looked at invalid then whispered vessel be haunted wish have never come on board let tell esau certainly not said arthur will only make thing worse let try to beat at own game right whispered strange voice lie low be mysterious said reginald a went quickly to door threw open there be one near cabin be silent darkened rum remarked a returned to doctor bunk did speak doctor be unexpected reply in faint tone heard strange voice suspect be jackson seems good man lad looked nodded at other doctor proceeded in whisper listen mate intended to seriously cripple to day be certain to put injury down to 'larking on line one have guessed step father plan warned late captain now esau think be disabled jackson suspect be on side have given hint see then think that mr boscombe intended to die exclaimed reginald be possible oh must be so wicked mate have instruction believe whispered mr halbrake be careful think may trust jackson engineer be honest keep quiet now till be well again wait with eye wide open later on will certainly see something surgeon then lay silent during night lad sat up with watching in turn esau came down to make inquiry jackson also looked in rushtons attended to friend under own direction decided to play possum until fell in with ship landed somewhere in way three week passed southern clime be reached by time doctor have perfectly recovered assisted in fishing for albatross with hook bait finally secured one of fine bird by mean rest on board enjoyed novel sight of whale porpoise various bird unusual appearance of southern climate gale drove bertha past falklands greatly to disgust of many on board who have anticipated run ashore then when weather moderated passenger came on deck again muffled up to meet antarctic cold christmas be already looming on horizon of almanac festivity be indulged in in anticipation doctor stuffed bird mollymauks cape pigeon reginald arthur fished shot thoroughly enjoyed voyage while still on guard respecting commander in fact to appearance ill feeling have arisen on board have by time passed away one afternoon thermometer fell decidedly report of ice be promulgated air became very chilly berg be anticipated ice for christmas what lark cried arthur will be fun may land upon iceberg commander who be searching ocean through glass looked steadily with much interest at lad did not reply at once resumed survey can mr cordell asked arthur again perhaps be reply must like rather eh reggie must be splendid to land on real iceberg there be sham one here said mr cordell none beade in germany will find one daresay concluded a walked across to port must run risk gentleman remarked jackson who be again at wheel if ye get on ye may never get off speaker never looked at lad kept eye upon ocean far ahead seemed a if have be talking to in low tone look cried suddenly there be christmas box for be berg see yonder to starboard bow exclaimed reginald why be flat not pointed a have seen in picture be always flat in antarctic replied sailor be square looking not peaky down here by time hand have assembled forward to see first berg of summer in antarctic a bertha approached drifting mass seemed to emerge from light mist a plateau of ice at least mile long quite two hundred fifty foot high breadth must not be at once estimated seemed square summit be white sparkling with snow be reflected sharply by sunbeam even painfully side of berg be caverned like cliff blue even green in place against wave dashed with great force leaping high up ice way at time to summit sea be roaring in ice cave presented most magnificent appearance a retreated foaming angry only to attack white wall anew be magnificent splendid glorious spectator be silent a bertha approached berg illustration what be black thing mr stevens iii even arthur rushton be silent idea of lark appeared entirely out of place vi vi with berg bertha be sailing with south east wind berg appeared to be drifting towards barque at one time fear be entertained that vessel must collide with mass berg passed on with merely cold recognition of stranger mist seemed increasing weather colder sea lumpy a island of ice passed by in dignified silence man be sent up to crow nest barrel have be hoisted up to main topmast to scan horizon for seal whaler floe look out be seated in cask upon board fixed within entered by trap door cut in bottom of barrel from rigging when apparatus have be tested arthur of course be anxious to ascend see what must may go up asked reginald of second mate aye replied stevens will see safe up take care youngster ship rollin ' tidy bit up there lad have ascended rigging before with little assistance one managed to enter crow nest arthur went first a have suggested expedition be splendid exclaimed lad there be several berg lump of ice in sea like little island what be black thing mr stevens indicated distant object seemed to be floating between barque ice floe whale replied stevens not right whale though be 'finners a call wrong whale suppose be 'finners then beinners asked arthur in most innocent tone not particularly so far a know replied mate laughing be use to whaler so only catch 'right whale d 'ye see then be that spout asked lad a thin steam like vapour arose from neighbourhood of whale yes be spout be reply a misty vapour vanished look different in book doe said arthur think will go down now rolling be rather trying besides reginald be waiting tom be expecting to pay 'footing ' said mate stevens got to fork out sir please so arthur forked out a desired descended with light head lighter pocket to warn brother reginald however ascended boldly entered barrel top man have vacated reginald looked around must hardly realise position cold mist did not mind solitude appeared fearful there be swaying about high above deck feeling a if must fall into sea when barque rolled upon one of tiny creature foreshortened below moved on deck be giddy perch looked away over sea in ice mass in detachment skirmishing order be keeping advance line of distant unknown shore farther away ice clad ocean be rocking undulating in swell be confined by pack white reflection troubled lad desolation appeared complete shutting ear to exclude sound of slapping rope noise of sail cry of men bird reginald must almost believe that prospect be unreal a in dream that must awake again in bunk below recover sens then took finger from ear even then fancied whole incident be unreal even a turned to speak to sailor beside look out man always on look out for footing assured that be true distinct real when have carefully pocketed tip permitted long look across ice muttering something looking again muttering ship ahoy cried suddenly hailing deck where away came response broad on starboard beam lying low on ice under lee of berg look dismantled can make out asked arthur when brother have found on deck minute later not likely from here be heading for now expect will pick up did like 'crow nest ' not much replied arthur did like playing 'cherub aloft felt a if have body that wing be making head giddy say artie suggested reginald when reach vessel yonder will go aboard rather be reply listen what doe esau say derelict mean stranded abandoned doe chucked up think beast wo let go never fear doctor be pet foe can try way come see mr halbrake surgeon be in cabin reading smoking heard report guessed anxiety of boy be most desirous to go wait until hear order to lower boat said after while then wrap up well let go ask commander be ready mind lad went out dressed made necessary preparation for trip then came into doctor berth again waited chatting at interval proposing kind of future expedition at last anticipated order came three friend went on deck beheld four men with jackson ready to embark in one of boat let go too please mr cordell cried arthur want to see stranded ship please let go oh wish to go do well perhaps will be better go then look sharp now none of three noticed tone of cordell reply sneer have accompanied permission savage light in eye of commander mate jackson intervened when mr cordell have spoken to have got grub asked best get snack a in case be delayed wo be hungry thirsty where be gun sir be there replied chief mind rifle put down there have fancy to be shot like jackdaw there be tin for keg may make grog if like now steady lower away boat well supplied by steward armed pushed off under influence of four men rushed through chopping sea eye of passenger be fixed upon derelict eye of cockswain be fixed on alternately with suspicious glance at lad jackson made remark be thinking of message esau have given puzzled held course man in crow nest gave direction barque be kept alongside floe clear of berg too agitated by current of fellow making often swerved out of course compelled bertha to yaw to come up in wind to avoid collision men rowed well hull of stranded vessel became more distinct through gathering mist bertha kept signal flying at fore bunting be already indistinct though arthur others noticed gradual disappearance of barque one remarked upon fact men knew bearing felt alarm there be cried one star exclaimed cockswain be derelict for sure one of whaler like give way lad bumping straining with many shock boat be impelled in direction of derelict occupant of pinnace succeeded in reaching safely be half afloat under lee of berg upon long mass of ice attached to cliff in front of stern be free released by breaking floe be barque smaller than bertha covered by snow frost above water line below with barnacle truly derelict vessel living thing save few bird be near until bertha approached jolly well strike remarked jackson that be missing gladiator be told old skipper expected to fall in with poor chap have died expect unless mayhap took boat escaped suppose gent wo want to go aboard certainly do said arthur be why came of course will go sha doctor must like to look round answered doctor what do think jackson well sir there be harm a far a know think must somehow why asked reginald what be matter there ai nothin ' matter replied cockswain looking at men still if be determined a have order not to stay by wreck suppose report come back for later there be grub gun rifle plenty of daylight for week yet so all right cried arthur hand up three adventurer climbed up side of vessel then beef in tin keg gun rifle ammunition followed suppose be all right asked doctor a men prepared to go back will return oh will come back laughed stroke oarsman ugly looking customer be right 'd rather 'd pull in with said jackson must indeed ca wait here take sir nonsense cried arthur be real right down robinson crusoe business hurry back ta ta what did give doctor cockswain waved hand in farewell men gave way boat quickly left derelict gradually be hidden in still gathering mist for breeze be northing mr halbrake made answer to arthur question be watching boat then perceiving that man have handed tobacco put in pocket having already sufficient for present use lad have meantime left went aft to join suddenly became conscious of insecurity of position future what if be planned trick have commander taken opportunity to rid of passenger jackson must not say much before men a doctor now recalled with fast beating heart have given broad hint suggested food gun have be commander idea what for why have given fire arm with mind far from easy mr halbrake rejoined lad who be about to descend into cabin saloon a pleased to call be at best wretched place to sleep in under circumstance almost repulsive to surgeon arthur be in high spirit when descended reginald liked adventure also long promised lark have appeared have descended on snow clad berg have taken up abode upon derelict for time being therefore lad be delighted skipped down cheerfully when have penetrated into so called cabin paused listened did hear noise doctor asked reggie what kind of noise said halbrake coming up think grunt something like said arthur yawn like perhaps men be in bunk there suggested reginald oh place seems to too bad let return look of place be enough for need not search far cabin must be quite unbearable in warmer climate think saw something said reginald look what be cub run arthur get gun here come animal run doctor in dim light two curious object appeared though halbrake did not think bear must be there retreated on deck before two animal walked upright have come to meet seemed to be pair of fine bear cub ragged dirty a animal advanced up ladder adventurer retreated astern to pick up gun creature took notice of in turn retreated forward into forecastle let shoot suggested reginald wait while said mr halbrake think be bear at suppose go forward reginald investigate matter arthur can remain here on watch if anything alarm can fire gun will suit arthur will then be beonarch of survey ' very well only look slippy please because be not up to big bear fight however see anything very alarming make haste settle business because be getting doctor reginald loaded gun carefully went forward disappeared down fore hatch arthur walked after deck went to peep down cabin stair even inspected main hatch wondered what be within amidships vessel be deserted apparently by one except two bear walked on hind leg did not speak a must have done concluded have be only foreigner not beast arthur listened for discharge of gun sound reached fog have increased more iceberg appeared very close too be in opinion closing in towards derelict might crush north west wind be rising in case snow mist be sure to envelop ocean on whole decided that crusoe life unless upon fine well supplied island with complaisant animal for companion plenty of shooting book be mistake doctor companion have disappeared at length arthur became restless called out then listened reply came to did not wish to fire gun unless on emergency felt anxious more so a fog be encroaching berg looked more terrible silence became more distressing must have welcomed bear cub a relief stern cold silence of nature awful solitude of derelict preyed upon nerve at length unable to sustain strain longer arthur lifted up voice sent coo ee through fog must have alarmed distressed king penguin bird take good deal of alarming too even that only aroused in echo chilling reply from sheltering berg in front illustration in dim light two curious object appeared late companion made response at arthur rushton made up mind to desert post to seek iv idea of playing crusoe did not then appeal forcibly to lad just when be thinking very seriously about companion caught sight of on forecastle be accompanied by two small bear have attacked previously arthur shouted with joy when perceived oh be so glad to see exclaimed thought be dead how did tame animal what queer beast be not beast be men savage if like beast replied surgeon like at replied arthur what be then fuegians have come from tierra del fuego there be norwegian in forecastle very ill have be wrecked on voyage round horn seems friend picked fellow up norwegian boarded derelict week ago well supposing did how did get into gladiator asked arthur be what have be learning ship be disabled drifted in direction before wester be entirely wrecked on island fortunately crew sighted derelict boarded starved here died here northman two companion terrible fate perhaps have better examine vessel farther suggested reginald there may be other unfortunate fellow on board let go suggestion be acted upon not until doctor advice a regarded meal have be taken will require food said so let brace up before encounter what may prove unpleasant incident so tinned beef biscuit grog be partly disposed of savage also assisting in feast then exploration began be not altogether pleasant to begin with amidships 'tween deck revelation be extremely nasty dead frozen body aspect of remains of seal blubber congealed blood be too horrible combined to cause adventurer to beat hasty retreat shuddered at future prospect if fate have intention of keeping on derelict result must be fatal to fortunately came upon store of food in captain cabin thus be at ease for present even if be compelled to remain few day longer need not be hungry then not till then came idea of situation prospect mist have increased even arthur began to tire of crusoe experience in derelict wonder where be said reginald after long silent survey of surroundings never mind where be replied arthur snappishly let get out of wherever be what do think mr halbrake well suppose reginald take gun try shoot penguin yonder meantime will find fuel light fire in galley so even supposing boat can not reach evening will be comfortable jolly be reply a lad accoutred for expedition on snow descended carefully passed over ice to deep snowy surface beyond sinking deeply at step leaving trail unmistakable adventurer advanced cautiously perceived that derelict have be driven upon ice forward while stern still floated however appeared firm after staring at great massive berg so close to so beautiful in purity so terrible in calmness even in inaction lad advanced from starboard side of vessel towards seal near many penguin be resting of latter actually leaped out of ice pool upon snowfield a lad proceeded let get close blaze away said reginald bird will make soup doctor said look at seal appear quite tame that one indicating great white faced animal winked at reggie really did now look out lad have approached penguin fired together brace fell remainder of bird scurried away flapping pushing along snow like queer animated canoe made curious quacking noise a paddled away like aldermanic waiter in black coat white waistcoat seen through small end of opera glass movement be very funny lad laughed heartily at evolution of penguin several bird be secured amongst being few cape pigeon a arthur remarked have good hope of returning thither must have be severely snubbed by brother for remark have not reginald attention be directed to derelict appeared to be moving hullo exclaimed vessel be off ice hurry up arthur else will be left behind lucky did go far be alarming news lad plunged into snow deep in track penguin danced signalled with flipper a if in sympathy pleasure at occurrence lad sank deeply in white carpet shouting at time to doctor stillness of air enabled to hear cry by be made aware of state of case have hitherto not suspected have evidently gained confidence of two bear for plunged waded swam to assistance of lad rescued dripping freezing numbed from grasp of ice king be assisted on board derelict by surgeon have lighted fire when half frozen wholly saturated lad bear have be rescued former be put into bunk in cabin fed with hot savage did not mind wetting dried by fire be also fed when late next day lad dressed clothes be ruined looked a if have purchased wardrobe of scarecrow from rag bone merchant who have become insolvent sun be setting in southward a came up one can hardly say setting though because only dipped into horizon little way came up again on rim of ice field silence be peculiar air sparkling bracing by mean very cold sea where visible be like mirror mist have receded to north south be clear floe be intersected by canal of sea water distant ice field looked like series of snow clad water meadow in channel have be half frozen farther away canal closed up apparently composed level ice continent to sky line effect be beautiful charming altogether delightful colour of sky ice water being immensely varied most artistically combined on nature pallet derelict drifted sick men died weather became uncertain alternating mist thin snow with gale fierce wind caused adventurer much alarm tossings crash bumpings of ice caused little barque to leak seriously to threaten dissolution end appeared near even stolid bear seemed upset release came to at last ship barque there lying beside that sheltering berg shout fire gun yell loud illustration end appeared near reginald have spied vessel lying snugly under lee of berg three friend at once proceeded to shout fire shot a suggested five day have be passed by party in derelict adventurer be satisfied with experience after delay while be speculating upon whether mate have heard shot boat be lowered from bertha put out for derelict channel be so winding that be quite hour before boat reached sinking ship fear of ultimate rescue be expressed by lad jackson be steering boat came alongside climbed up stood staring at whole party in silence eye passing from one to in turn well be busted exclaimed at last who expected to see funny devil good job mate shot who did eh shot exclaimed three friend what do mean why one of bullet came along hit full in chest settled may

th el hamet be occupied by strong detachment of de rolle under major vogelsang on following day height fort of abourmandour be reoccupied without opposition summons to surrender being contemptuously ignored by turkish commandant of rosetta who have be reinforced by corp of albanian stewart advanced to sand hill encircling town at once proceeded to invest from great extent of rosetta brigadier saw must be impossible with slender force at disposal to invest more than half of place so took up line from nile to front of alexandrian gate thence retiring towards plain where posted light dragoon rosetta being thus only partially invested garrison have free communication across nile to delta at time stewart confidently expected to be reinforced by mamelukes from upper egypt who be known to be inimical to french at loggerhead with mohammed ali day after day passed without appearance of redoubtable warrior siege however be carried on with great vigour gunner hammered away at rosetta without doing great harm to turk whose number daily increased while of infantry be constantly employed on piquet other harassing duty piquet advanced post be several time attacked on th april company of de

hamet from lake edko to nile be isthmus about two half mile in extent varying according to depth of water in lake remains of deep dry canal with high bank extend from river nearly two third across isthmus bank commanding plain on side on south side of canal about way across isthmus be village of el hamet on bank of nile at el hamet be only regular pass through bank of canal news of disaster to company of de rolle regiment reached general stewart early on th april immediately despatched force under lieutenant colonel patrick macleod commanding nd battalion th to reinforce vogelsang macleod force be composed of piquet of th light dragoon two gun two company of th five of th nd battalion of th ross shire buff highlander be raised in patrick macleod be first commanding officer battalion distinguished at battle of maida subsequently in netherlands be reduced in illustration gunner hammered away at rosetta on afternoon of th april company be on duty in one of battery charles holroyd paddy cantillon be with company none of feeling particularly amiable artillery have be blazing away day at rosetta while have little nothing to do except to listen to eternal bang bang of gun sort of music get monotonous especially when one wish to indulge in forty wink be sick of business exclaimed paddy a sat with back against parapet sorra bit of divarsion do see in squattin ' on ham in damp ditch take thing a come paddy rejoined holroyd who be discussing piece of salt junk ship biscuit now must much prefer to dine off spatchcock devilled kidney a ca get such luxury halloa harris what ill wind blow here order for holroyd replied harris worthy adjutant who came hurrying up at moment light company have be detailed a escort for ammunition column about to start for el hamet general desire to deliver despatch to colonel macleod be on piquet dear fellow expostulated holroyd not relishing idea of long tramp across desert besides be not turn know only returned from escort duty last night where be james company turning out to relieve will be here in five minute be reply then why not send to el hamet asked holroyd because general order be for light company to go answered adjutant so have choice in matter very considerate of general growled captain however 'needs must when certain old gentleman drive guided by adjutant marched to spot where ammunition column be awaiting in hour be on way across desert to el hamet march come to end be with deep sigh of relief that at length reached el hamet holroyd at once went off to report arrival deliver despatch to colonel macleod while waited return fondly hoping that must be dismissed to well earned rest be however doomed to disappointment captain soon rejoined knew at once by expression of face that be thoroughly put out light company said in short sharp tone there will be rest for of to night colonel macleod have desired to take up position among sand hill in front of el hamet remain there until further order can fall out for few minute make best meal can on what have got in haversack ration of cooked beef biscuit rum will be issued to man shortly after daybreak faith be pleasant state of affair grumbled cantillon a moved away from company doe colonel macleod expect attack before daybreak asked suppose doe holroyd replied for said great deal about necessity for vigilance though neither gave idea from what quarter danger be to be chiefly apprehended of plan in event of sudden attack in overwhelming force feel sure went on colonel macleod be wrong in posting so far in advance of el hamet a will be impossible to keep up communication except by occasional patrol thus company will stand serious risk of being cut off village understand be supposed to protect will be placed in jeopardy rather surprised at critical remark ventured to remind captain that general fraser stewart thought very highly of colonel macleod that th highlander swore by true tom rejoined holroyd macleod character a regimental commander most deservedly stand high braver man there be not in british army nevertheless judging by what have heard observed think be right sort of officer to hold separate command at important post lack firmness promptness of decision must emergency arise much doubt if will be properly prepared to meet anyhow intend to use own judgment in taking up position assigned to instead of moving whole company up to sand hill will leave cantillon with left subdivision way between village will then have support to fall back on if hard pressed what of mamelukes have turned up asked paddy not that know of be reply ammunition escorted be intended for own impression be that mohammed ali will make up difference with bey if see at will be a enemy not ally let rejoin men be time be moving leaving cantillon with company under clump of date tree holroyd led way to sand hill where posted men to best advantage sergeant corporal four file being stationed a outpost on slight eminence little to right front having taken up position anxiously waited event keeping very sharp look out chapter iv alarm not friend foe unheeded report anxious night shortly after midnight corporal hurried in from outpost to report that djerm large boat crowded with men have be observed dropping down river did see djerm corporal jones asked holroyd jumping to foot plain a see honour be corporal reply see sir for moon so bright that be just a clear a day sergeant finnigan say a how think be mammyluks a there be be such talk about deuce doe exclaimed holroyd whereabouts be djerm on side of river yes honour 't be nigh that chapel looking place on river bank chapel looking place mean mosque suppose said holroyd smiling come tom will go see for ourselves take charge until return sergeant bullen be well on alert hastened to outpost where found sergeant finnigan with men ready for emergency close to river bank within four hundred pace of outpost stood small mosque slender crescent crowned minaret shooting up gracefully from amid dark foliage by be surrounded illustration very cautiously made way down sand hill there be jham yonder sorr said sergeant finnigan fine old fellow who have put charlie holroyd through facing when first joined th have be father orderly in day of yore jham honour full of mammyluks be afther thinkin ' see finnigan rejoined holroyd looking in direction pointed out where be clump of tree hide sorr answered sergeant be there shure enough doe honour think be mammyluks will hope so finnigan have doubt said holroyd tom added after moment hesitation let creep down nearer river have look at mysterious craft must discover whether be friend foe very cautiously made way down sand hill moving directly towards mosque for first hundred yard then edging away to left until have full view of river be what saw just below mosque be fisherman hut small wooden pier wharf projecting into nile within couple of oar length of wharf lay not one two large djerms filled with armed men by bright light of moon must discern a clearly a in daytime companion have with small field glass through carefully examined djerms rather occupant well be mamelukes whispered impatiently egad be not be reply be albanian without doubt therefore enemy look for will see kilt petticoat took glass saw at once holroyd be right there be mistaking albanian costume there be between two three hundred of said holroyd a returned telescope must report at once tom hurried back to piquet corporal jones be sent off to warn colonel macleod of proximity of large body of enemy while man took message to cantillon to advance nearer to sand hill be on qui vive in case of sudden attack not that think will trouble yet awhile observed holroyd so with exception of advancing support will keep to present position until receive further order corporal jones made good use of leg for scarcely hour elapsed before returned to outpost please honour said saluting captain answer be 'all right ' right exclaimed face darkening be that colonel macleod said to be sir be reply gave colonel message just a honour gave to neither more le 'tell capt'n holroyd be all right ' say saluted waited moment thinkin ' a how 'd say something more may be ask question colonel just wave away say ' d 'ye hear corp'ril tell orficer be all right ' so come back a quick a must sir holroyd stared at one in astonishment that corporal jones have delivered report brought back reply correctly did not for moment doubt for jones be steady intelligent man thoroughly trustworthy must not have be light company corporal what will do charlie asked in undertone there must be mistake very serious mistake must say rejoined then turning to corporal inquired if colonel macleod be in village sir answered jones colonel over yonder away to right rear there be young orficer with few men of rolle in village added holroyd thought for few minute then taking aside said must let know in el hamet state of affair so that may be prepared in event of sudden attack do tom hurry back to village warn senior officer tell that enemy evidently mean mischief that advise to look out for squall on way can inform cantillon of situation say that must be ready to support moment hears shot fired started off on errand warned paddy cantillon officer at el hamet young ensign of de rolle schmidt by name that must be prepared for emergency on regaining piquet found that several more djerms have dropped down nile be lying off little wharf holroyd have therefore sent written report to colonel macleod calling attention to gravity of situation requesting instruction corporal jones be again messenger face be study when returned reported that only answer vouchsafed by colonel be very well told that awaited instruction said holroyd looking very incensed did sir colonel only said havery well ' not word good bad indifferent honour tom be too grave contingency to be trifled with said captain taking aside a macleod have sent order must act on own responsibility fear that force be so scattered that must be dangerous matter to bring together again knowing macleod be probably unwilling to try experiment so have contented with sending report to general stewart of enemy proximity continued be not going to run risk of being cut off in such exposed position a therefore will warn officer at el hamet to put village into a good state of defence a time will allow will cover while so employed will then have something like post to fall back on if driven in for ought to be able to make very fair fight of in village give leaf out of note book tom suppose that young fellow understands english speaks fairly well answered handing pencil piece of paper holroyd wrote note despatched to village then once more took station with advanced outpost in order to observe first hostile movement might be made towards morning thick fog came on completely hiding mosque river from view indeed must not see anything fifty yard before have to trust entirely to ear need hardly add that not one of closed eye night chapter v undeserved reproof colonel macleod convinced attack el hamet evacuated night passed without attack being attempted though once towards daybreak fancied that heard sound of marching men approaching post from direction of mosque sound if existed save in heated imagination died away again be silent a grave towards seven o'clock in morning river fog being then a dense a ever colonel macleod accompanied by staff officer orderly dragoon visited piquet colonel looked pale weary a well might face wore peculiar irritable expression in fact have appearance of man worn out with anxiety fatigue sent two report during night captain holroyd began in querulous tone barely acknowledging salute pray what do mean sir mean colonel exclaimed face flushing with anger exactly what stated namely that since midnight enemy have be gathering in considerable force within gunshot of spot when sent second report sir written report le than fifteen large djerms crowded with men be moored in river yonder thick fog now hide from view there be there doubt not be at moment think so retorted colonel be enemy so close at hand in such number must at least hear now sir since fog came on have heard sound must indicate proximity of large body of troop can not say have sir holroyd admitted though fancied fancied interrupted colonel macleod just so be firm belief that own fancy have deceived must beg that when on outpost duty will take trouble to make better acquainted with what be near not send in report of enemy advance until be absolutely certain there be really enemy within couple of mile in case have evidently mistaken few fisherman boat for hostile flotilla have intended to relieve continued macleod now stopped short uttered exclamation of astonishment for at moment strange though perfectly natural thing happened morning sun a if anxious to prove truth of charles holroyd statement confound incredulous highlander suddenly appeared struggling through mist rapidly dispelling away rolled fog disclosing to gaze group of horseman conspicuous among whom be little man pointing with javelin to right of position then arose upon morning air confused noise beating of drum clashing of cymbal a fog cleared off there appeared before turkish army numbering at least combatant of whom perhaps one third be horseman a soon a recovered from amazement colonel macleod like true highland gentleman be turned to companion extending hand said captain holroyd have done injustice allow to recall remark made just now to offer apology to light company of th say more sir beg rejoined warmly shaking colonel hand remark be already forgotten illustration a fog cleared off there appeared before turkish army afterwards be thankful that have not parted with gallant macleod in anger for ala destiny have willed that ere sun rose must be thing o'er raven flap funeral wing that account of what followed may be better understood will here state order in colonel macleod force be disposed range of low sand hill stretching from lake edko to nile distance of at least two mile be everywhere accessible to infantry owing to steepness of slope inequality of surface cavalry must only operate against at two point namely along road passing through el hamet by fording lake few hundred yard beyond southern extremity of ridge where water be extremely willow now a macleod rear be covered by dry steep banked canal road through el hamet commanded by two six pounder position might have be accounted excellent one have be properly manned two thousand british troop with fair proportion of artillery ample supply of ammunition must have held till doomsday against ten time number of turk unfortunately macleod entire force did not muster eight hundred men have only four six pounder field piece slender corp have to occupy defend entire line of sand hill from one extremity to other be distributed along line a follows force be divided into three body one numbering three hundred men being posted beside river second of about same strength in centre of position while third of formed part have to defend el hamet watch road passing through village support two gun enfilading that road thus there be interval of about three quarter of mile between several division in order that communication might be kept up division have to throw out right left small detachment took post here there along ridge be plain that position thus held be practically at mercy of greatly superior enemy couple of hundred resolute men must have be sufficient to break through scattered line at point save at principal defence breach in line at point must necessarily render whole untenable that position must be forced if determined well sustained attack be made be almost foregone conclusion think one anticipated terrible disaster befell on fatal day to return to narrative stood for minute gazing at turkish force infantry be drawn up in detached body under own banner horseman in solid mass formed second line look sir suddenly exclaimed staff officer cavalry have separated see vincent rejoined column moving off be evidently ordered to cross lake turn flank while who remain will doubt support infantry in attack on village observed holroyd will defend el hamet colonel yes cried macleod vaulting into saddle to last man putting spur to charger galloped to rear having re formed company marched back to el hamet at quick step on way be joined by two three small party have be ordered to retire from sand hill on reaching village found that officer men of de rolle regiment have made good use of time house have be loop holed window door barricaded in short el hamet be in fairly defensible state come will be able to hold out long time exclaimed holroyd cheerfully then pointing to building of considerable size height said take right section tom occupy roof of house let men make parapet of knapsack open fire moment enemy be within range throw shot away lad hastened to obey order followed by sergeant finnigan right section ascended to flat roof of house men took off pack placed against low parapet so a to afford extra protection from elevated position must see turkish horseman a advanced towards village brandishing javelin scimitar uttering loud cry of defiance be about within range cotton presently observed sergeant finnigan wo honour open fire be about to answer in affirmative when heard holroyd calling to tom shouted be to evacuate el gun be limbered up so come down at once there be nothing for to obey so quitted roof joined comrade who with detachment of de rolle be forming up in narrow street where two six pounder be waiting to start soon cleared village went away at long trot into heart of sandy plain who ordered evacuation asked a found alongside of captain macleod be reply fear have made fatal mistake pace be too good for talking tom will want breath before have done chapter vi retreat at bay hardly be clear of village when turkish horseman came sweeping down into plain howling ferociously a galloped here there from time to time made demonstration of immediate attack whereupon holroyd must call halt order gun to unlimber moment enemy saw six pounder at action rear retired out of range then gunner limbered up resumed march happened think three four time have not got very far into plain when be joined by detachment of de rolle regiment under major vogelsang major who a senior officer assumed command told that macleod have ordered to retire from position leaving strong piquet to cover retreat move obliquely across plain until fell in with be then to join force wait for further order colonel macleod have ridden off to withdraw remainder of force explained vogelsang in broken english colonel intention be to concentrate force stand on defensive until stewart come to aid fear detachment be so scattered that will be cut off in detail agree with major said holroyd however must await macleod arrival if attacked make best defence can then formed square with vogelsang men two field piece being placed in centre calmly awaited arrival of macleod with other division onslaught of enemy must come first combined force numbered about two hundred fifty bayonet besides officer artilleryman although enemy kept up threatening attitude be not seriously attacked be evident from sound of heavy firing on flank that macleod vogelsang party have left to cover retreat be having very warm time of became terribly anxious about must have given world to know how fared unfortunately must only hear not see fighting for country around be like sandy sea broken up so to speak into wave undulating mound not one of be so sufficiently elevated a to afford commanding view from summit over rest in short time firing in direction of spot where knew vogelsang covering party be battling against terrible odds began to slacken then suddenly ceased looked at one in horror for one must doubt that gallant comrade of de rolle must have be overwhelmed poor fellow groaned major vogelsang tear streaming down rugged cheek must have perished to man must that highland colonel have permitted to remain with attention be now attracted by triumphant shout body of enemy appeared in sight racing to join comrade a if ould nick be at heel a paddy cantillon observed steady flanker of th cried holroyd be turn now meet firmly if need must let die like british soldier for honour of old regiment faith ' be ready to do honour answered sergeant finnigan shure divil one of thim howlin haythins will gallant old fellow never finished sentence for at moment score of bolder horseman charged up to within pistol shot of square discharged carbine at have doubt fired at random chance shot often do most harm one bullet found billet lodged in brain of poor michael finnigan cry of rage burst from men for sergeant be general favourite in light company several of younger hand returned fire without order emptying half dozen saddle sending bold turk scampering back steady light company cried holroyd angrily what be men thinking about chance be poor one if be going to lose head like reload lad fire again without order good captain holroyd said major vogelsang steadiness be everything have be advancing again down front rank instantly order be obeyed down on knee dropped front rank while rear rank came to recover stood a motionless a if on inspection parade now beheld three separate column of horseman equal in point of number to little force moving rapidly towards one column leading others in rear a drew nearer rear column edged off to right left sweeping round so a to threaten right left face of square major vogelsang now ordered artillery to unlimber bring two gun into action right left centre section of right left face being warned to fall back so a to leave opening for gun a soon a word be given on came enemy until be within about three hundred yard of square when three column drew rein a if to breathe horse now be time lieutenant said vogelsang to artillery officer fall back centre section quick a lightning gunner ran up laid piece fire shouted officer plump went six pound shell into column on right left bursting well in centre killing disabling several men horse gave ringing cheer a gunner coolly sponged out reloaded gun for foe be thrown into great confusion thought must beat precipitate retreat gun be loaded sir said artillery subaltern will give dose before be out of range word have hardly be spoken when turkish horseman wheeled round charged down upon with shrill cry of la la have il allah vras vras there be god god kill kill again six pounder be fired then centre section closed up moment turk got within musket range standing rank gave rattling volley knocked over several of including one of boldest leader warm reception damped ardour once more retired in confusion young hand thought day be own rent air with cheer of men even sprang forward a if to start in pursuit of retreating horseman stern voice of veteran major quickly recalled to sens vogelsang now ordered gunner to load to muzzle with grape canister infantry to drop running ball into musket will give still warmer welcome child exclaimed with laugh like croak of raven must be steady not break rank once again turbaned warrior advanced to attack yelling like pack of fiend well directed volley of double shotted musketry greeted yet paused not in wild career then six pounder opened on column attacking right left face salutation mortal turk must have withstood havoc produced a grape canister tore through serried rank be fearful with cry of dismay assailant of right left side of square galloped off ventre terre third body of enemy however undismayed by repulse of comrade held on course charged right up to rear face of square where be posted almost up to bayonet point rode discharged pistol launched javelin

to be heard to right a strained ear became evident that sound be drawing nearer be power be fighting way towards exclaimed cantillon there be doubt of said holroyd after listening intently for moment wish must get look at major vogelsang added see yonder mound major said paddy 't be thrifle higher than rest be tallest man among ye maybe if ye will let slip out must get peep at sorra bit of danger major dear will take corporal jones with without waiting for permission called to corporal to follow slipped out of square mound be le than hundred yard distant on reaching summit cantillon sprang on corporal shoulder jones be very powerful athletic man stood upright from coign of vantage gazed intently in direction of firing while watched anxiously fearing lest must be shot by lurking foe

forward staring at two men in fixed attention word be spoken for many minute be silent saving only for wild boisterous rumbling of wind in chimney regular shuffling tramp of sir donald leslie slippered foot upon bare oak floor presently latter sound ceased sir donald stood still ruminating can not believe said at length confronting colonel ossington on what ground do base conviction on

at dusk be admitted into same room colonel eye wandered about apartment a if in endeavour to picture a have be at earlier time for two hour continued be left here alone during interval of waiting alan told romantic story of bonnie belinda story being suggested by portrait hung over yonder above settle sir donald nodded glanced across at vacant place on panelled wall at last went on speaker sir john leslie entered with plaid about shoulder a if have newly returned from journey regarded soldier son with stony indifference 'well demanded 'what do want here ' ' have come sir ' stammered alan surprised at cold welcome have come ' father bent forward with hand resting on table at side almost touching alan regimental cap with bright brass badge have come a spy cried bitterly following up accusation with volley of virulent taunt ingrate ' cried 'you weak kneed renegade where be patriotism how dare come here wearing uniform of hateful foreign usurper whom serve ' said that questioned sir donald agitatedly father said that colonel ossington took up fire tongs caught at fragment of burning wood with to light pipe be own word said be not le surprising to than be to alan leslie

speak however sir john have hurried elder of out of room younger man whom rightly guessed to be neil leslie stepped back looking into alan face smiled in recognition held out hand alan refused to accept offer of friendship ay quite right interposed sir donald colonel ossington did not heed interruption proceeded with narrative a two brother stood there facing other said thought two handsomest youth have ever beheld alan with smart military bearing finely featured face glistening dark eye neil somewhat taller although younger with fairer hair more lithe figure dressed in picturesque highland costume with dark tartan kilt long flowing plaid be caught at shoulder by large silver brooch set with sparkling yellow stone on hearing description of great uncle young colin leslie moved from seat at fire to vacant chair opposite to colonel ossington be evident that neil be in eye hero alan say refused to accept brother proffered friendship 'who be young man came to door with just now ' demanded neil answered proudly a turned to leave room 'it be prince whom have honour to serve prince charles edward stuart ' be once here here in very room murmured colin with reverent enthusiasm in boyish imagination room have be sanctified by presence of romantic adventurer illustration alan refused to accept offer of friendship continue urged sir donald with black cloud in face what happened next when neil have gone out of room said old campaigner alan gave mocking laugh 'what do think of jack ' said 'it seems to have dropped into hornet nest will be war to knife with father after reminds ' added crossing room to wall opposite window there 'this pretty dirk be mine may a well take possession of ' took down long bladed jewel hafted dagger be hung there under picture of bonnie belinda

o'clock to night arm money be to be delivered to messenger by brother neil at postern gate in castle garden will be delivered jack if if prevent a mean to do ' colonel ossington paused in narrative gaze be fixed upon earnestly attentive eye white face of colin leslie boy seemed mentally to be associating fact of delivery of arm at postern gate with recently seen apparition of neil leslie a for sir donald have now ceased to doubt colonel ossington affirmation be a deeply interested in narrative a be grandson although sympathy of two be directly at variance ten thousand pound in gold ejaculated sir donald in astonishment where on earth did come from know returned ossington probably represented contribution of wealthy jacobite of immediate neighbourhood did highlander get gun thing in time to use in next day battle colin ventured to ask breathed sigh of disappointment when colonel ossington answered with more conviction than mere word implied believe not alan leslie remained behind with purpose of frustrating delivery ay did frustrate will be bound interposed grandfather alan be brave be strong determined must stick at nothing when did next see colonel never saw again replied ossington since night when left fate have be to complete mystery on next day at nairn when muster roll be called be absent advanced to culloden battle be fought if battle may be called be mere

present at council of war afterwards escaped with fugitive probably in company with son neil ay added sir donald neil will be bound did not neglect to carry off gold with use for own selfish purpose for pretender never got money be thankful for at least that must have be worse even than neil must squander old man began again to stride to fro across floor neil be villain cried ingrain villain scoundrel ought to have be hanged with rest of must almost be content at loss of family fortune if might only know that rascal have died outlaw death on gallows be doubtless who prevented alan from getting back to regiment night colonel ossington meditated few moment in silence yes said at length doubt be right in what way did prevent sir donald be what want most particularly to know to mind there be one answer to question returned sir donald decisively brother alan be not in battle say if have be alive be certain must not have shirked duty believe be not alive colonel believe that be murdered murdered by own brother neil leslie also must tally with fact that since fatal night neil have never dared to show at home colin leslie here ventured to break in with remark have right to say such thing grandfather said emphatically why must neil ever think of murdering alan have nothing to fear from know nothing about matter boy growled sir donald be business of ignorant lad to discus thing a with elder colonel ossington did not so despise boy opinion by way master colin said ghost of evening must have bearing on mystery did not say that apparition be dressed in highland kilt ghost echoed sir donald in astonishment what ghost what apparition ghost saw to night when went out with colonel ossington to stable returned colin ghost of neil leslie went in at postern gate gate where arm money be to have be delivered ah old man drew breath in sharply have heard of ghost before old elspeth have seen once also hesitated listening to angry blast of wind once also on wild blustering night just such a saw be many year ago remember be at same place near postern gate probably rascal guilty conscience trouble even in grave if indeed be in grave there be long pause during wind howled even more piteously than before colonel ossington emptied glass set down with deliberate slowness upon table at elbow be persuaded that there be foul play on night said in low clear voice of course there can now be proof how must there be after year leaned forward with open hand clasping knee with eye fixed upon fire then went on a if speaking to year ago just after taking of quebec chanced to

passing little postern of so much have be said postern through a boy declared have seen apparition of neil leslie disappear on previous night here colin now stood stamped foot upon ground listen said do hear anything stamped once again have often thought a have passed spot that ground seems to give back hollow sound if doe what of asked colonel ossington well said colin with curious lift of eyebrow be thinking that be just possible there may be cave passage cellar under here that perhaps be down there that gun thing be telling of last night be stored may be right smiled colonel see that matter very much now be so long ago know yes went on colin must like to find out same have often thought of before of underground passage mean most castle in scotland have underground passage somewhere castle leslie can scarcely be exception at one time thought have found way into one pointed up to top of ivy covered wall see place where buttress end asked colonel nodded well last spring jenny wren built nest up there wanted to get climbed up from inside of ruin crept along top of wall have got a far a where nest be when leaning over to reach felt one of big stone give way beneath held on by ivy loosened stone fell with crash to ground did look where fell be only thinking of how must get down with nest day two afterwards be coming through place used to be guard room in old day before hawley dragoon burnt part of castle down saw stone lying there be smashed have smashed flagstone that have fallen upon part of flagstone have dropped through right down into sort of black well did not try to open well although must have done if other boy have be here to help morning thought of again in connection with story understand interrupted colonel think may have be down there that old sir john leslie hid arm for rebel eh well let see fancied entrance to subterranean passage where be be through here said colin led companion through postern gate into large roofless room in one of corner there be heap of garden refuse covered by thin layer of melting snow colin took old spade industriously cleared rubbish away presently revealed large cracked flagstone went down on knee busily endeavoured to dislodge one of broken fragment scraped tore pulled at to purpose then stood up stamped upon rattling of loose earth underneath encouraged to continue can find such thing a pickaxe questioned colonel ossington colin shook head ran nevertheless in search of such instrument returning minute afterwards with heavy sledge hammer with opened assault upon flagstone soon succeeded in loosening one small fragment small brown rat darted out from excavation scampered across uneven floor wait cried colonel lend hammer let try first to remove smaller stone then can better get at larger one took sledge hammer raised over shoulder brought down with well directed blow upon smaller stone splitting second blow broke into splinter removed beneath discovered end of rusty bar of iron be shot like bolt through iron ring bar seemed to extend under larger flagstone supporting through centre of gravity for many minute hammered at rusty iron with blow flagstone trembled on axle shower of loosened stone gravel fell into depth below with development old soldier energy increased while colin looked on absorbed in boyish expectation at last corroded bar broke flagstone collapsed slipped few inch into void where be arrested by obstacle removal revealed irregular opening two foot in diameter be right boy remarked colonel there be indeed secret chamber here be once be entrance see flagstone have formed sort of trap door may have be opened by spring set under smaller stone at side look down there can see edge of one of stone stair can get down asked colin be possible think returned old soldier must require lighted lantern must fetch one colin ran off be absent ten minute during interval colonel ossington contrived so to force back broken flagstone that left opening sufficiently wide to admit body went upon knee thrust foot into cavity descending step by step until eye be on level with paved floor there waited resting with hand on second step finger of right hand touched something be softer than cold stone gripped drew forth into fuller light be fragment of mouldy cloth felt attached to be disc of tarnished metal upon figure be embossed god exclaimed be badge of fourth foot tore off badge thrust into pocket at moment colin leslie appeared with lighted lantern accompanied by grandfather be glad have come too sir donald said colonel somewhat absently what boy adventure be contriving now colonel demanded sir donald one must think that have gone back to childhood not quite so far back a returned old soldier grimly mind have indeed gone back to young manhood give light colin added turning to lad have better perhaps go down in advance illustration colin handed lantern colin handed lantern stood at top of step watching slowly cautiously descend light flickered upon damp moss grown stone of wall formed side of narrow stairway went down down growing gradually dimmer dimmer until at last died away old grandfather colin waited listening faintly heard tread of colonel spurred boot echoing hollowly in darkness once heard cough then be silent minute slowly passed sir donald grew trifle nervous nervousness being indicated by impatient tapping of foot listen cried colin heard something fall something rattled knelt down peered into opening hear walking whispered be coming nearer now now have stopped now be coming on again be on stair be carrying something knock against step can see reflection of light now now here be lantern boy drew back mind head colonel will knock cried colonel ossington did not require caution bending head crept upward holding lantern in extended hand presently face appeared in aperture be ghastly white eye stared wildly drew deep breath of fresher air have better come down said glancing up at sir donald leslie drawing left hand upward cast old rusty broadsword at old man foot sir donald glanced at weapon kicked aside come reiterated colonel in voice of authority grandfather slowly obeyed colin followed down step although be aware that have not be included in command perhaps must have be wiser to remain where be boyish curiosity love of adventure overcame caution step by step descended into gloom air about be damp cold stifling wall dripped with moisture stone stair be slimy darkness hemmed in saving only for fitful glimmer of lantern light be below three step more sir donald said colonel standing aside on firm floor of what appeared to be arched vault held light aloft now follow closely added passage turn sharply to left be careful of corner knocked elbow against just now be that boy behind yes ought not to have come never mind now let follow close at heel now halt look down upon floor while hold light colonel held out free hand gripped older man arm directing gaze into narrow archway be musket said there be two hundred there have counted colin crept up to grandfather side holding by skirt of coat looking into archway saw neatly stacked up gun with rusty barrel lock rotting stock colonel drew companion onward three four step here be claymore said see rebel did not get after alan be true murmured sir donald felt sure must frustrate delivery gripped soldier arm

letting gold fall from in jingling shower wonderful cried ah now be rich rich rich glanced behind with shrinking miserly fear be mine mine frenziedly exclaimed proceeded eagerly to fill pocket colonel ossington lightly touched on shoulder remember friend that money be jacobite money said be meant for pretender know sir donald coat pocket be already full to overflowing meant for pretender repeated ah look look added holding up one of coin to light one of bear head of king go yet let have lantern money will not run away remarked colonel ossington passing on with lantern have found may return when will now since have solved material part of mystery let go further that may understand more human side led way with colin at side grandfather be perforce obliged to follow there be something here that must see said colonel a having turned sharp angle in passage stood still with hat under arm holding light in front of so that ray shot along slimy floor wondering sir donald grandson bent forward searching into gloom colin drew back a eye rested for moment on something white advanced again timidly looked once more trembling finger pointed down upon floor at gaunt fleshless face tall form of man be partly hidden under mouldy fold of highland plaid kilt at left shoulder there be tarnished silver brooch set in centre with dim yellow stone man lay flat on back sword be in scabbard at side blanched bone of right hand still held remains of one of canvas money bag gold guinea lay in little pile beneath long finger be carrying that bag of gold to give to prince messenger cried boy colin

where in front of one long whitewashed granite cot perched hundred foot above shore there be long protecting rail formed of old spar planted close to edge of cliff just where tiny river discharged into sea opened sufficiently to form little harbour for dozen fishing lugger rock running out sufficiently to act a breakwater keep off huge billow at time came rolling in from south west so that on one side of cliff lay piled up slope of wave washed rounded boulder many a big a great cheshire cheese while on other where lugger lay there be pebble sand upon rail four men be leaning with folded arm apparently doing nothing stare out at bright clear sea eye be keenly on look out for one of dark cloud shadow like appearance on surface to meant money provision there be sign of fish breaking

straightened out wish must have such nasty soft roed thing why be fifteen pounder take hook master lance look sharp look at 'em playing lance put on fresh hook baited again sent sand eel gliding off along rushing tide played among rock like mill stream waited excitedly for snatch waited in vain pull said at last let boat run out bit hezz obeyed cleverly managing so that boat glided slowly after bait in direction of broken water where shoal of bass must be seen feeding got nearer for so sure a boat went farther from land so did fish in spite of fresh tempting bait being tried there be seizure made that there one a got away have told others to look out said hezz with chuckle wo get bite stuff nonsense just a if fish must talk let go out farther boat glided on with current growing le swift

two conger in one of deep hole nay wo ketch none o ' till be getting dark dark enough in hole said lance very well try so boat be rowed out of sharp current then away towards west under cliff about hundred yard from shore where tide ran slowly here lance gave up oar began to fish again trying first one then kind of bait with greater result than catching grey gurnard tub hezz called soon after couple of gaily coloured wrasse not worth having oh be miserable work cried boy drawing in line covering large hook with pilchard pull little farther along will throw out in dark quiet part there will be conger there know hezz uttered croak eye said plainly no conger there rowed to spot be where rock rose up out of water like little island on dusky cormorant have be fishing sat drying wet wing

till see then will make desperate rush to get away will be ready for said hezz laughing softly a gently rested handle of boat hook on side thrusting out towards tightened line still came slowly in though strain threatened to make part hope will be good to eat master lance know what be cried boy in low hoarse voice be one of great cuttle same a be washed on shore after last year storm will come up of lump with feeler sucker twisted round line sudden change came over hezz instead of grinning face turned preternaturally solemn taking right hand from boat hook thrust into pocket drew out big jack knife to open by seizing blade in teeth be right whispered lance husky now with excitement use knife if can get good hold with hook look look here come oh be monster illustration vigorous cut divided fishing line boy have be steadily hauling till have brought capture nearly to surface now caught sight of what seemed to be curved rounded body now hezz quick down with hook get good hold at once snatch lad snatch at crucial moment when dark back of monster slowly rolled up to surface hezz dropped boat hook leaned over side hindering companion view plunged knife armed hand down under water next moment there be slight jar ran from lance finger right up arm tension ceased yard two of stout fishing line flew up in holder face for a if to save companion from danger hezz have reached down a low a must with vigorous cut divided fishing line so that dark round body sank down again like shadow leaving two lad gazing fiercely at other oh say cried lance only to think of why hezz be never mind what be said boy roughly knew be then swears did said boy fiercely think must have let fish there if have knowed why there must have be whole string of 'em tied together on line sunk there

dragged away at oar with might till ran boat on to sand where lance be perfectly aware though must not look up that four big fisherman be still leaning over rail looking out to sea expected to hear cheery question a to sport a hurried up over sand began to climb zigzag hail came for men eye be bent upon revenue cutter mile away watching movement of chasse maree at least so thought lance penwith a hurried home pondering upon cousin word asking whether be not doing wrong by associating with fisher folk on cliff must tell father said to ought to tell said then began thinking of what meant severe punishment of pretty well man in cluster of cottage being sent to prison younger men to serve in king george men of war ever since must remember have be to kindest friend chapter ii ca help said lance to after weary sleepless night feel a if must go tell tale be not sure if be wrong men be punished for what did not do must never be happy again lance have made up mind that must have more to do with people down by cliff for felt now that be not honest there be bitter feeling of disappointment in coming to resolve for have be so pleasant to get away from refinement of home with choice cookery plate glass fine linen to boisterous welcome always have at old poltree neat cottage how delicious baked hake be how luscious conger pie though be a nothing to split grilled fish caught be mother be always ready to cook for two boy now be over still might go climb to steep edge from whence must look down on whitewashed cottage busy harbour boat did grew quite excited a saw that revenue cutter be lying off point couple of mile out a if watching place poor old hezz said to bitterly hope will not take then incongruously enough smiled a thought of boy breaking voice 'd laugh at if heard croak squeak a doe now perhaps let off because be only boy must be horrible for other men why father magistrate too said lad suddenly 'd be with others who punished for smuggling if be found out ca go tell what know must be horrid lance lay there upon warm cliff for time thinking then started looked down wondering at what be to quite marvel for there moving slowly about hundred foot below be cousin threading way amongst mass of granite tangled with bramble in part where there be path nothing more than faint track two made by grazing sheep seemed unaccountable what be doing there muttered lance must be looking for well let look want if shout to will only come begin to preach at in pompous way when be in good temper only make laugh be in bad temper now if begin will feel a if must punch head so lance lay watched making unpleasant remark while of derisive nature watched till alfred have disappeared beyond chaos of rock have fallen from above at last strolled back home forgetting about cousin till took place at luncheon table felt surprised to see there looking quite cool a if have passed morning reading in shade there be surprise for lance before left table squire letting announcement captain barry be going to dine there at six o'clock evening so boy will have to put on best manner who be captain barry father to speak correctly be lieutenant barry boy be in command of revenue cutter lying on off be giving good hunt up for tell that there have be great deal of smuggling carried on along coast told only smuggling about here be smuggling of fish lance felt that tip of ear turned hot thought that must be red knew that be opportunity for telling have found out somehow word must not come officer be rowed ashore from cutter that evening squire have walked down to tiny harbour with two boy to meet find frank pleasant middle aged man who for reason have never be promoted shook hand lance turned scarlet then glanced shoreward to see that hezz be busy turning clumsy boat half inside cavern that big trouser boot be up on shelf while men inside seemed to be gazing out to sea in search of coming shoal officer be very pleasant frank during stay chatted with boy asked if must like to go to sea somehow found lance dull glum boy father bantered that night after visitor have gone back to cutter chapter iii week have glided by fishing be in full progress below cliff hezz people have enclosed small shoal of mackerel in seine at time lance must have be in thick of business revelling in seeing line of cork drawn in closer closer till shoal be dashing about seeking for way of escape before tuck net be brought to bear arrowy wave ripple marked fish be ladled out in basket lance have watched movement of cutter anxiously while stayed off point one fine day have glided away west with sail set to light breeze boy breathed more freely then day passed nothing seemed to happen except when lance went along high cliff climbing from place to place till settled down in snug rift where must scan sea note what be going on in cove below to see if there be sign of smuggling found that cousin came cautiously along le than three time boy laughed to from hiding place be watching to see if go down join hezz how can one be such sneak lance often mused after fashion a day slipped by kept away from people down by cliff in spite of wistful look two caught from hezz who came up to house several time to sell fish lance said firmly have told tale wo have anything to do with smuggler one fine afternoon soon after dinner lance saw cousin go into study take down book rest head on hand begin to read lance have followed to propose that must go inland have ramble in wood cousin action checked be of use said must come so lad went off till reached one of favourite look out just by rift overgrown with bramble where when tide be up whispering washing of water must be heard showing that one of many cavern crack along bold coast ran in great way wish knew of belonged to have more than once said upon particular occasion a seated began listening to strange whispering sound meant to have tried to find out said along with hezz why did say something about once only laughed said be land spring well ca get boat now somehow place have strange fascination for day after looking about bit picked up piece of mossy granite a big a head pitched among bramble growth fern just where whispering washing sound must be faintly heard to surprise there be fluttering of wing jackdaw flew out away nest there muttered thought be divided by hearing stone have pitched down strike heavily sending up hollow sound directly after struck again more loudly be still be in act of rising to examine spot sank down directly ducking head behind great tuft of ragwort well be sneak muttered sat close alfred passed about twenty yard below going on cautiously away to right passing out of sight lance sighed rose looked away to west there be sign of cousin so walked back home night came on soft calm after sitting reading bit going over translation ready for vicar next day lance looked up to see that be alone so putting away book strolled out on to big sloping lawn to where must see sea looked quite dark forbidding star be half hidden by haze still be very pleasant out there after time turned to look back at house with light two in window of ground floor while everything else looked black till at once little window high up in centre gable of old elizabethan place shone out brightly with keen steady bluish light lasted while must have counted twenty then be blacker than ever why be firework said lance to must be alf have hardly thought when light shone out again burned brightly for time once more went out leaving boy wondering till once again blazed out sharply left blacker than ever lance mind be just a black dark for must make nothing of alfred be not likely to be letting off firework what must mean coming to conclusion that cousin have be amusing in way connected with chemistry stood thinking for minute then went in to find object of thought sitting by aunt side talking quietly while squire seemed engrossed in book well perhaps have better said mr penwith there be nothing like bed for bad sick headache boy sighed said good night went up to room have too long walk to day said mr penwith sun upset by way lance cousin complains about being given to avoiding do pray put aside sulkiness be more brotherly why be alf mother who never will come out with there there say more about said mr penwith gently know wish to be brotherly so do try lance felt too much aggrieved to say anything sat in moody silence till be bed time when said good night went to own room thinking while about light there lay thinking listening for above hour during heard various sound

ship be lying to have vessel got ready for sea at once despatched to aden suez where service be required to take place of ship in regular line of eastern communication captain officer engineer have be hurriedly selected from other vessel appointed to ship second engineer having be only officer in charge while be laid up have expected with much confidence that must have be made chief engineer in event of ship being wanted again doubt felt considerable soreness at chief engineer from ship being put over head at moment chief officer called out to have got much more room there hardy there be two more boat load of stuff coming alongside now yes plenty of room sir replied be soon busily engaged in superintending safe stowage of box of tea case of indigo other article composed cargo on upper deck there be constant stream of cooly shooting basket of coal down into bunker on side of deck through small round hole have be made for purpose be fitted with iron plate for cover let in flush with deck when closed from fact that ship a old paddle steamer serampore be still available for service will be readily understood that incident be about to relate did not happen yesterday in fact be before day when suez canal be opened consequently when be known in bombay that extra p o ship be put upon berth several officer others who have come from up country be waiting for regular mail to

who be messmate with on west coast well said second officer there be much to be obstinate about at present except fighting south west monsoon exactly replied urquhart from what said to to day be just very thing be got in head be got new idea say be going to try what be said second officer simultaneously well think that instead of steering direct course for aden right in teeth of monsoon must be better policy to edge away across arabian sea on west course making monsoon leading wind because declares opinion that on arabian coast monsoon will be either much lighter have drawn more to southward what did say to oh said thought might be so that must have to traverse considerably more distance to replied that speed at ship must travel under improved condition of weather must make up for be not at sure about said second officer said mr urquhart believe be going to try voyage anyhow good night fellow be going to turn in early next morning several bunder boat came alongside bunder boat of

be a much a there be nothing in cargo stowage be aware of to account for said chief officer well know that matter very much rejoined captain at event ca alter now see everything ready for slipping from buoy at nine o'clock now will have breakfast added a eight bell struck have purser come off with ship paper yet not yet sir be be gone time expect will be here minute replied mr urquhart a entered saloon together at appointed hour serampore slipped from buoy steaming away through shipping at anchor soon passed light vessel leaving colaba lighthouse on quarter began to breast heavy sea face rain spray that fierce monsoon blast drove against in hour time nothing be visible white capped wave pounding against bow dimly seen at time through thick driving rain enveloped a be in dreary isolated world of own illustration be pleasant prospect be pleasant prospect thought to myself a buttoned up oilskin ascended bridge ladder to relieve mr urquhart at eight o'clock keep west sou ' west said that officer call captain if there be change all right sir said what be going five half replied chief officer twelve revolution keep good look out for ship mr hardy ay ay sir said there be one comfort that ca change to much worse weather than have got said with laugh a serampore buried broad bow right up to heel of bowsprit over extra heavy sea chief officer satellite fourth who kept watch with after divesting of oilskin betook to comfortable well lighted saloon where such of lady gentleman a have not succumbed to influence of weather diving of ship be endeavouring to get up show of sociability though not even miss reed who have struck at dinner a being lively agreeable pretty person have courage enough to attempt performance on piano wonder how many day be in for of thought to myself a paced bridge pitching of vessel jerking against rail at other step let see be about mile to aden think at rate be going will have nearly fortnight of be enough to make one savage to relieve feeling immediately yelled out to two look out men who be on forecastle lascar of course koop dek agle good look out forward acha sahib very well sir came back like shot from men on duty who be getting soused now then by sea broke over bow night be dark a well a thick wind howled shrilly through serampore rigging giving melancholy accompaniment to march backwards forward across bridge platform kept bright look out for ship might be about a be just now in track of vessel bound up to kurrachee persian gulf knew that there must be scanty time to do anything to avoid collision must chance to meet one nothing however happened to disturb dull monotony of what sailor must describe a regular pile driving business at eight bell midnight be glad to deliver up charge to mr second officer betake to comfortable cabin repose not even staggering pitching of serampore dash of spray rain against cabin be on deck must disturb next day weather seemed to be if possible worse than be when started sea be heavier more irregular wind seemed to blow even harder than have done during forenoon watch log only showed five knot hour sky be so thick with rain mist that got sight of passenger made appearance on deck tried to take constitutional pacing fore aft raised quarter deck soon gave attempt up a hopeless went below to amuse with book chess card conversation night watch be only repetition of previous experience fear must tire reader if favoured with longer description of wind sea weather be necessary to make voyage in south west monsoon before one can quite realise what mean best description of can give in few word be lengthened duration of south west gale in english channel with thick weather temperature of about seventy five eighty degree on fourth day out be keeping forenoon watch a usual have left bridge for moment two to compare standard with binnacle compass a passed saloon companion have hood over facing aft saw miss reed with one of sister little girl standing at top of ladder of course lifted cap wished good morning do think will have better weather soon mr hardy asked have be watching great sea shoot up under stern of ship do look so cruel savage that positively frightens one be afraid there be not much chance of real improvement till get to aden said there be nothing that need be frightened about for old ship be a sound a bell be fighting way on a well a must expect under circumstance sister very poor sailor said believe 'd have come if have thought be going to be anything like have taken step aft towards binnacle remembering be in charge of deck that talking to passenger on duty be not exactly in harmony with company regulation when serampore after making moderate dive encountered unusually heavy sea threw nose up into air a be miss reed having for moment relaxed hold upon companion rail be with child shot out upon deck a if have be flung by gigantic catapult child be rolling towards rail where there be only slight netting if parted a being old very likely might with weight must leave nothing between raging sea beneath when made desperate bound forward caught firm grip of dress at same time swinging round be able with left arm to arrest headlong rush of miss reed against corner of skylight towards be helplessly thrown impetus with be flung be so great must only save from falling by pressing back against skylight illustration caught firm grip of dress in minute recovered seizing child in arm gave grateful look murmuring thanks allowed to hand down companion have scarcely done when captain skeed popped head out of cabin door send for chief officer chief engineer if please mr hardy ay ay sir quartermaster tell mr urquhart mr stewart that be wanted by captain in few minute officer be closeted with captain skeed a resumed walk on bridge confess felt curiosity to know what subject of colloquy going on in captain cabin might be for be sure that something other of importance must be under discussion have not long to wait for one result at event of deliberation directly made twelve o'clock second officer have handed in to captain ship position by dead reckoning for have seen neither sun moon star since left bombay received order to alter course keep away to west north west mr hardy shouted captain from quarter deck set fore aft sail with single reef in port four point quartermaster said keep west north west serang sub adimee seeah carro seede mar boatswain pipe hand make sail in few minute trysails be opened out reef point tied sail set together with fore topmast staysail monsoon be blowing from about south west by south so that with sheet hauled flat aft be just clean full luff only lifting little a ship dived over heavy sea alteration in course brought sea much broader on serampore bow of wave in fact coming nearer beam than bow canvas steadied greatly only shipped quantity of water that have be doing although progress be not greatly accelerated went along much more steadily comfortably than have done hitherto a soon a sail be set men piped to dinner sinclair came up on bridge to relieve be council of war about did urquhart tell asked oh yes replied sinclair captain determined to try plan of making arabian coast where wind will help then steaming up along land to aden from what urquhart said wanted to be sure about coal a will have considerably longer distance to cover by new route hope have made mistake said leaving mr sinclair in charge went off to work up day reckoning have lunch for next five six day serampore be kept on same course with same canvas set certainly appeared that captain theory be accurate one for a approached coast of arabia monsoon blew rather le fiercely favoured progress little more so that serampore have be making six six half knot by log instead of five five half a have be making before course be altered on forenoon of tenth day from leaving bombay weather cleared up little just before noon a frequently doe gazing intently ahead fancied must see through haze of rain still remained darker appearance ahead than there must be with mere mist at moment captain came up on bridge pointed out to at once exclaiming that look remarkably like land to sir so doe mr hardy said captain unless be very much out in reckoning ought to make gebel camar mountain of moon a be called very soon probably what see be really land at moment mr stewart chief engineer came up bridge ladder in excited hasty manner glance at face told before opened lip that something be wrong captain skeed have just made discovery that large pocket in foremost bunker be empty haena got more than few hour steaming in ship good heaven why told other day that have eight ten day full steaming in ship know did sir reckoned upon fifty ton in twa pocket appears now that fellow williams who may say have behaved more like deevil than mon voyage never fashed himsel ' to see coal trimmed into pocket a gave order to do in bombay what doe say about said captain actually tell that be business ought to hae seen to mysel ' never heard of pocket in bunker before said captain anybody else said mr stewart be just bunker within bunker ye ca get to frae deck to fill with coal have to be passed in by trimmer through hole be cut in bulkhead confound such contrivance exclaimed captain stamping foot on bridge well mr stewart must make sailing ship of be there be land will have to keep clear of under canvas how long will take to disconnect dinna ken sir that ye can disconnect paddle wheel at anyhow if be possible to do gear will be set a fast a rock for doubt if have be disconnected since be built if ca disconnect then can take float off there be muckle sea on for job o ' sort maybe by lifting paddle flap at top must take upper one off then keep enough steam so a to move wheel a required set engineer to work to unscrew bolt take float off vera weel sir said engineer in few minute four engineer boiler maker with fireman mounted paddle box with spanner hammer set to work unscrewing nut removing float a fast a must engine in meantime having be stopped chief officer be then summoned by captain to commence immediately re rigging ship a top mast have to be swayed up fidded topsail yard crossed top gallant mast sent up besides sail being bent to yard soul of ship company be fully occupied for rest of day during time serampore be gradually drifting towards land became more distinct a approached by sunset engineer have succeeded in getting off float engine having be turned gently to move wheel a required sailor part of ship company have got matter so far advanced that be able to set reefed topsail course upon ship captain then summoned of officer to cabin must see that have not even yet recovered from exasperation caused by what have taken place have sent for said to ask opinion on situation be use to attempt to work ship to aden under canvas propose therefore to heave to till daylight then run into one of bay on coast to leeward of see there be one marked on chart between seger kalfat near town of doan if can make without running up against rock will anchor ship there have one anything better to propose said council broke up in accordance with decision arrived at serampore be hove to for night at daylight next morning sail be made on with wind abaft beam ran in for spot captain skeed have indicated a suitable for purpose coast stood out barren rocky there be break in visible right ahead with lead going sharp look out for rock sailed into small bight bay under lee of seger point let go anchor in thirteen fathom a cable be veered out swung round head to wind sea with stern inland a tautened cable crash sounded from aft felt stern bump upon sunken rock god exclaimed captain skeed ship be lost fell upon deck insensible carried into cabin doctor be immediately summoned effort to restore animation be unavailing captain skeed be dead ii although position taken up by serampore be somewhat sheltered from force of monsoon by projecting point of land still there be heavy swell in little bight bay where be broke upon rocky barren shore around with incessant roar cloud of spray swell lifted

otherwise be sure that englishman young enthusiastic must not have be holding commission of cornet in musketeer serving regent rather boy king for whom ruled in moment be just a likely a not that war might break out again through craftiness of cardinal who since have fallen evidently did not mean to do so without pulling others down with for austria have never willingly resigned claim on throne of spain remembering that old french king have once formally waived claim of own family to will will have then instantly asserted on death of charles while for country well english be not over fond of retreating from anything have undertaken though for widely known consideration not necessary to set down here have at last agreed to peace of utrecht having thoroughly beaten french by sea land before

seen to tear firebrand from pole dash amongst enemy then mounting on roof hurled sulphured arrow back to whence came example being quickly followed by others wonder if savage lost heart so when at last josh stephen with dozen other men dashed into midst almost hand to hand fight ensued gradually gave way fled to shelter of forest leaving many dead wounded behind on ground then besieged have short respite be able to take counsel together men pressed forward to shake josh by hand forgetting be stranger white set face now begrimed with smoke be ghastly to behold stephen brought food be

must question be quite willing must go be expecting reinforcement can not move forward take twenty men let indian guide said colonel in briefest possible space of time josh be on way with small well armed force for reasoned indian might be numerically mistaken weetamoo be stronger than represented indian led along road known only to native hunter creeping through forest stealthily a tiger ready to pounce upon prey then worked way up towards far away river where weetamoo have taken refuge day be dawning when came in sight of camp outline of tent just visible through river mist resting in white cloud over marshy land quickly noiselessly with practised skill josh disposed men along river front round camp in such manner a to render escape almost impossible order be not to kill savage to make prisoner order applied more especially to squaw sachem of others be to be taken alive then headed by josh rush be made into midst of camp aroused from slumber wholly unprepared unarmed last remnant of three hundred warrior made faint resistance finding must save life by yielding did so at first alarm woman crept out of tent through long rush quickly a serpent glided down towards river coward have hissed when saw people yield yet in heart knew must not well do otherwise favoured by mist have evaded guard reached water edge when suddenly lifted head looked back josh feeling sure must make for river be close at hand saw passionate face angry eye flash out upon sprang forward before must reach with shout of triumph leaped into water be swimming rapidly down with current to throw in

approaching rapid where river fell from great height into lake noise be terrific slackened speed shouted to did not must not hear must have known full well fate awaited on went swept forward by strong current down over brink into dark lake below rushing of water be dirge of weetamoo be with much difficulty that josh succeeded in reaching bank walking back to camp men be for giving up a lost especially when indian told how where river ended reappearance be therefore greeted with enthusiastic cheer though general disappointment at escape of squaw sachem be great have be agreed between josh colonel church that latter must advance a soon a have received expected reinforcement that together must go on to where indian stated philip have taken refuge namely on bit of upland at south end of swamp at foot of mount hope day following capture of weetamoo camp church arrived without promised reinforcement have be delayed decided to come on same said colonel for if be to take at must be done quickly will get wind of movement escape be right replied josh must just do best can following day moved forward by night be within short distance of swamp josh knowing ground went on in front with about twenty men stationed a far a number must permit at outlet then guided by indian church with mere handful of soldier crept up hillside indian be sleeping be roused by firing of shot instantly be confusion philip sprang to foot seized gun rushed straight down hillside towards swamp to very spot where indian who have betrayed stood with englishman on guard saw fired simultaneously englishman missed mark indian bullet entered philip heart fell forward dead in black swamp illustration with shout of triumph leaped into water be glad did not do said josh a stood with colonel church looking down on dead body of king yet said church through house have be made desolate be view of war answered josh in eye be intruder fought for what considered to be own where must be generous be did not slay father be weetamoo have personal grudge against philip be friend to nature a yoke be insupportable be well spirit be set free must not have brooked captivity with last look at dead warrior josh turned away so ended great struggle known a king philip war white man have conquered indian power throughout southern new england be broken whole tribe family of indian have be destroyed remnant fled farther west into unexplored wild whither white man foot have not yet strayed settler gazed sadly around upon ruin of town homestead be brave men woman looked future steadily in face have fought bled for new england even a must have done for old countrie loved better for sacrifice have made so josiah blackstone stood beside old william blackstone grave thought be alone must build new house where old one have stood must replant orchard with tree in hope of seeing blossom bear fruit seemed dreary work voice whispered such a with youth health strength be marrow of land to build up make strong

nothing of be to a dead friend counselled to take wife pondered thereon maiden pleased waited week month passed by harvest be gathered in be very plenteous when labourer have gone to home josh sat smoking in porch of new house because seemed le lonesome than in empty room a sat sound of wheel fell on ear paid heed thereto until stopped at gate then looking up saw covered cart out of sprang girl tall slim then last of older woman laid hand on young shoulder josh pushing on one side took in arm cry mother mother carried over new threshold to living room placed by hearth kissed weeping with arm

be friend be king daughter thusick dwelt with be a one of when orchard be white with apple blossom love passed way under eaves of new homestead be whispered old old story sir richard squire by c w whistler just one month after became squire to sir richard de courci then of castle of stoke courci lie between quantock hill sea in fair somerset met alan de govet about whom story mostly be have be to taunton be riding homewards across hill valley river lay straight before a fair view a in england be that rich country between mendips quantocks yet suppose that sir richard thought of hardly at for a queen matilda steward be deep in new plan be to set exiled queen on father throne rode thoughtfully after meeting de mohun of dunster that day when saw gay little party of men in hunting dress with hawk hound come up deep narrow lane to meet roused turning to twenty well armed men behind asked who be who came now none of knew a came nearer saw that handsome young leader of party wore badge of de govets family from yeovil well known loyal follower of king stephen why then said knight if be young de govet must have word two with bar road while speak men grinned closed up so that lane be full there be little love lost since matilda failure of two year ago between party of king queen illustration came heavily to roadside grass where lay stunned when met therefore hunting party must need rein up for must not pas pardon sir knight bar road said leader raising cap courteously only for pleasure of speech with said knight saluting in turn be de courci believe that speak to alan de govet young man face darkened a answered let go way sir richard have nought to say to disloyal men there be two side to question young sir knight answered since be queen man de govets be king men have different view of what loyalty be however just now stephen be king well what must with time since have fair offer to make to noble father touching be if be alan de govet have a yet have answer young man face flushed angrily stand aside sir said be discourteous not if be man take for by way have not owned a yet will own nothing if thus asked be answer stranger turned to men have gone hastily at first word about rival claim of king queen knowing what mostly came of such argument nowadays seeing turned horse leisurely without sign of fear to follow sir richard laughed rode alongside laying hand on horse bridle stay must ask to come to stoke courci with a men have left said in moment young man sword be out at same instant seemed to rise from saddle lose balance fall away from sir richard blow be wasted on air a came heavily to roadside grass where lay stunned bring home carefully said sir richard to men if be alan de govet must have have a hostage sooner later if be not well de courci can apologise so rode on asked sir richard wondering why so good rider fell a did young man 't be old trick knight said do get foot under lift at right moment must not advise to try with one heavier than now when reached castle prisoner be brought in after seemingly not much worse for fall lady sybilla sir richard ward mistress of castle since wife died asked who might be when told that be thought to be alan de govet that must not own name flushed little said more next day have reason to think that have heard of before very fair be young lady heiress of many broad acre seemed much older than boy of sixteen will think anything over twenty great age after breakfast on next day fed hawk then came back into great hall to see if knight have command for there found sort of council on hand from appearance very peaceful one jehan of stowey head man at arm one of men guarded two door chaplain father gregorius sat by hearth smiling uneasily sir richard sat in great chair on dais facing prisoner by side be lady sybilla who be plainly in towering rage for eye flashed little hand be clenched a if be holding in check when looked at de govet saw that be a angry a lady a for sir richard seemed to be enjoying what be going on immensely watching prisoner with something of admiration for fearlessness well built square be though not so big a knight who be almost giant a de courcis often be looked like warrior even in hunting gear be stained with red quantock mud from fall when be taken illustration sir richard sat in great chair on dais sir richard took up matter where have broken off when entered 't be mercy alan de mohun of dunster did not get hold of for humour of yours of last night when must not own name must surely have landed in sachentege keep in castle wherewith to wring answer from silent must fain fit more pleasant yoke to neck said in meditative way watching de govet face amusedly now of torture that norman can invent that of sachentege be worst for engine be made of great beam of wood fastened round man neck with rough iron collar a beam be too heavy for one man to lift too long to be set on end be apt to wring confession of anything needed from who be set therein after time therefore be surprised to hear lady sybilla say suddenly borrow de mohun sachentege pray fie daughter said gregorius shaking head half smiling at girl anger be shame to set so gallant youth in such bondage set in hateful thing rather said be better than to marry to man of stephen who must not own name have being doubtless ashamed thereof at de govet started face grew crimson sybilla went on growing more angry still when queen maud come will go to will see that hold said sir richard suddenly enough of go to bower girl until can be more patient with guardian willingly said with proud toss of head swept out of hall without glance at waiting woman followed then there be silence knight captive looked at one until faint smile crossed de govet face chaplain looked anxious disturbed flashed of sudden across mind that if queen matilda be indeed coming to england shortly be last thing that king man must have heard a yet sir richard tried to laugh be uneasy when do king stephen maud queen come way asked alan de govet when doe maud empress cross from normandy retorted alan then laughed understood one by time well said sir richard shut up must be alan for time at least if will take advice will do a wish so find freedom fortune a well be pretty plan said alan having caught loyal king man must need marry to ward being be steward whereby save fortune when new plot fail yours when succeed answered sir richard truly be pretty plan a say be benefactor to moreover think that might seek further fare worse what be benefit to said alan scornfully being de courci look for none except may be that to have damsel in charge hamper somewhat also be duty to provide for welfare a best can be new plan of mine alan de mohun be to take sooner later a hostage to ensure that good father will bide quietly when there be little fighting on hand presently have only caught by chance rather sooner than hoped well said alan lady seems to think ill of plan for welfare be because advice be not asked laughed sir richard now what say be plain have heard too much to be let loose said alan will not be married against will wherefore have in own power choice be between bond of matrimony small dungeon have here unless prefer to be sent to dunster where de mohun will take good care of think first choice be best what sort of dungeon have here asked alan coolly on have mind for dunster let see said sir richard to jehan alan turned on heel followed man at arm from hall without word one must have thought that look of lady sybilla must have needed comparison with of dungeon said knight with great laugh when have disappeared be good youth be glad that de mohun got not else must have be in rack by time may not let go now that yon headstrong girl have let out what have presently jehan brought alan back former be grinning latter be cool a ever gay cordovan boot be wet muddy a if have be over ankle in water 't be good dungeon said chance of escape therefrom have mind to dwell in therefore will offer ransom for sir richard shook head took master de govet for weightier reason than of gain be to credit answered alan be discourteous to take unarmed man by force save for weighty reason then will pledge word of honour not to escape if allowed reasonable liberty ho said sir richard be there word about lady sybilla will not discus that point further said alan loftily do seek to evade dungeon seems that know mind young man sir richard said be willing to meet a far a may if take word must promise also to hold communication with king party will consider in dungeon for matter will not miss help be not so sure said knight thoughtfully if be guest may hear see much that must be glad to learn turn out then said alan promptly know nothing a yet again sir richard shook head laughed must keep hostage for be not alone in matter have to answer to others now do have word not to escape to be silent alan stepped forward held out hand word of de govet said now from time forward alan took captivity in good part sending by chapman message to father sir richard approved satisfied at home for shortly after sent that guest must need even to helm mail charger know what people thought of being guest with so noted queen man a knight at time great plan be secret none seemed to have suspicion of beyond circle of leader of matilda party soon learnt having often to ride with message to one leader what plan be can put into few word earl robert of gloucester queen half brother be to rise at head of noble in west while king malcolm of scotland uncle be to invade england from across border two year ago have done same failed for want of well planned assistance so that king stephen be able to make term with have seemed death blow to matilda hope at time now thing must surely go better stephen must be taken between two fire then queen must come from normandy must end in favour so great plotting went on meanwhile alan de govet grew to be great friend for be good warrior took pain to teach many thing pleased sir richard well so that seemed to forget alan be captive treating always a welcome guest only person in castle village also who did not like alan be lady sybilla made secret of dislike thought good of alan to take trouble to please that did for must need see much of however be always most pleasant to liked to serve in way must father gregorius be friend of mine learnt many thing that squire must know from too liked alan must often pas sly jest on about choice between dungeon lady hand at first a time went on alan seemed to grow tired of old jest waxed angry when came so gregorius forgot be in april towards end came to stoke courci from time forward messenger came went in much secrecy once earl robert came for day from dunster with de mohun once rode to well to meet roger bishop of salisbury justiciar from whose help queen hoped much now in beginning of july have be out with sir richard did not go into castle when have led horse round to stable sought alan in tiltyard one telling that have gone in direction there saw thing puzzled for be unlike what one might have expected two people walked under tree on far side of tilting ground be lady sybilla alan in deep converse alan seemed to be speaking great deal getting short answer be not surprising a lady be always proud disdainful with so that alan always seemed discomfited when appeared just at time however did not seem so did not see that came at first before heeded heard few word will have nought to say to man who be ashamed to own own name quoth lady sybilla be not shame policy answered alan ay to escape from alan be silent for moment then said have learnt to prize what once have thought of then sybilla saw flushed ay name mean said to alan whose face be away from go to win name back by deed of arm then may be worth speaking with with passed came towards beginning to hum old tune other lightly a for alan bided where left not caring to follow come away said to comrade be in evil temper be first time have seen so answered need must stay to cheer for be not cause of ill humour laughed well then go way for unmannerly squire retorted turning away towards castle nay lady began went on quickly with one last remark flung over shoulder a be know where be not wanted at least now thought be plain where ill temper lie so went to alan asked what be amiss well said for though be five year more older than be close friend by time maybe be fool to think twice of matter on word friend ralph one must think be in love laughed heartily did tell so asked have set task a good squire be bound to undertake may have said what chance prisoner like have to do can not see winning name to wit heard that much said that have often talked of doe not need word of sharp tongued damsel to set thought in direction saxon wit need sharpening with norman whetstone answered gravely know not that word of fair lady have double weight in matter of winning renown so that one must straightway seek for what one might else have left to chance good fortune saxon mother wit must tell that depends on who lady who speaks word may be answered being used to gentle jest of sort from alan by mean minding since have well beaten about norman pate with good old saxon quarter staff one weapon whose use disdained until persuaded to bout with after learned to use because said that belonged to good forestry above wit come law of chivalry said then matter not if lady be queen beggar maid so that word be spur to great deed knightly illustration know where be not wanted at least now when alan began in strain be apt to wax high flown causing sir richard to laugh at at time so said sound well there be nought for to undertake can see after sat looked out to long line of blue quantocks spoke of foreign war time for brave deed be nearer than thought for night came messenger with stirring news after speaking with sir richard sent for two alan said have strange news for know how will take what have to tell do rightly know what to do with now other leader of cause will not suffer to let go free a must willingly because do father honour of thinking that hand must be held a for have forgotten that be aught guest please alan smiled made little bow at said nothing now must go northward said knight at once ralph must see to arm will go with better squire for companionship there be campaign on hand a may guess northward said alan thoughtfully be scot on foot across border ay that be why then let go with help fight sir richard be england quarrel whether king queen have right to throne sir richard smiled grimly mostly be so now malcolm come again a ally of niece with help mean to set on throne fear will not fight on side can not answered alan have hoped be new border raid public quarrel be silent for while a knight told what have to prepare for journey presently spoke again let go with sir richard said be most generous in own wish to let go free be possible that in far north where there will be none to hinder will let join in one battle for own king must return to either in victory defeat if not slain if slain further trouble in keeping be over be strange request said sir richard watching alan eager face must be tired of little castle thought knew why alan be so ready to go north for mere chance of fighting alan have mind to do mighty deed other said spoke thereof afternoon when came here denied name a be said alan quickly preferring not to be questioned perhaps must need win back let prove be not to be ashamed thereof nay alan withheld name somewhat foolishly may be denied not none can blame said sir richard kindly nevertheless have be said that must win back pray let have chance ralph said sir richard sternly be foolishness not mine answered 't be poor jest of lady sybilla knight looked at alan began to smile alan grew red then angry sir richard laughed so said if be lady word there be help for knew not that have used leisure so well now why alan have not word to say for at must not tell so be at last after shifting from one foot to other uneasily ceased pretence at anger said be asking much sir richard may be so come north at least will see about rest if fight for stephen however may be running tilt against one unawares in melee have unhorsed once sir richard said alan in high glee out of way must keep now know how to thank why said sir richard be wont to need two squire have one if be not too proud journey a second if aught be wanting in gear will supply be honour for squire to serve de courci said alan squire will be in good faith until must need ask to let have one fight for whom will be glad enough that alan be to go with a may be supposed gaily went to work to set lord armour in order while jehan of stowey saw to mine presently while sat alone in armoury singing a polished heavy flat topped war helm lady sybilla came in sitting in window seat began to talk with about journey by by told that alan de govet be to go with at own request that because of word afternoon seemed to care little for looked out of window spoke of somewhat that saw thence in meadow by stream yet presently said so alan must need blame for making eager to run into danger word say be weighty a being of lady think that blame at lady sybilla illustration seemed to care little well said rising up suddenly a must charge word with going give to remind that be weighty threw blue silken scarf have worn day went out of armoury saw more be glad that seemed at least to be inclined to make amends for haughtiness ill considered word presently gave scarf with message to alan seemed pleased with asking for more of saying of haughty damsel amused verily alan believe that spoke truth just now when said be in love said laughing nay hardly said so much answered well be war first anything else afterwards just now nevertheless when rode away next morning with forty well armed mounted men at arm little train of pack horse after alan have blue scarf round sword arm eye be over shoulder so long a must see sybilla standing on drawbridge watching go may be have have word two with thought foolish to pay so much heed to gibe of damsel however fair now be going to say nothing about long pleasant journey northward with camping in forest among hospitable farm folk later on wild moorland for if began must not know how to leave out thing be new strange to presently when be in lancashire came to tract of desolation left by scot two year since sort of dread grew up in heart of men who must thus mar fair land yet be to help to set queen on throne again who have sent for be wiser than went into great town for sir richard did not wish men to inquire too closely into journey object a drew near lancaster learned that gathering of scot to invade england be well known already word have gone round to sheriff from archbishop thurstan of york to bid gather men to then sir richard thought time to give alan freedom a have half promised for must need cross border to speak with king of scot so happened that near old town fell in with knight whom sir richard knew to be queen man riding towards lancaster with twenty men at heel ho de courci what brings so far north same errand brings out most likely knight answered will go further north yet in company a hope knight stared for moment then grim look crossed face be scarred here there if mean to march with thurstan well good if be going to join scot a be likely will be on opposite side for once said bluntly how be where be loyalty loyalty forsooth knight answered first loyalty be to england care not who sent for scot of north will give life to keep back so two talked angrily at time at last strange knight said tell de courci that if of west south knew what malcolm host be like a well a northerner must give right hand sooner than bring to england go see then mind word so talk ceased presently sir richard told alan that if must might ride in company with knight who must give worthy place a squire with whom might remain until returned after campaign can say to de mohun earl robert have left with sir john will be content may be will meet again shortly then pas by pray for sake of comradeship of blue favour however hot battle may be so sir richard jested be sorry to part from alan from when left with new friend in lancaster think that soreness on being captive have long passed for now must only thank knight for many kindness crossed border made for gathering place of scot when saw knew that northern knight spoke truth that worst thing for queen must be that must have blame of bringing wild crowd of savage galloway picts highland gael into england knight knew also gave message to malcolm a in duty bound then must bide with scot no longer truly there be few good lowland norman knight with king son prince henry not enough to keep untrained force in sort of control sir john of swaledale be right sir richard said to a saw wild

adjudication of prize involving so serious delay when at length got to sea again be tormented with anxiety lest josefa must have arrived upon coast shipped cargo of slave slipped off again ere must

monsieur bon exclaimed be ze bargain be agreed then be right remarked now monsieur having made bargain will be very pleased if will do honour to remain on board dine with can then talk over matter little more in detail can explain to where josefa be to be found frenchman who by way now introduced to a capitan st croix at once accepted invitation having done sent boat back to felucca with instruction to mate to make sail keep close in wake whereupon filled upon schooner resumed course to southward by time that dinner be served in hot stuffy little cabin that evening have succeeded in extracting from m st croix information that josefa must be found concealed in certain creek of congo have be so thoroughly fortified a to be practically impregnable be bad news moreover found little difficult to clearly follow of st croix description by time that left that night to return to felucca have learned enough to clearly understand must depend upon stratagem rather than force for success threw into perfect fever of impatience to get back to river be not lessened when discovered that wretched little felucca seemed incapable of doing anything better than five knot under most favourable condition that be likely to meet with on voyage stood for twenty four hour during in schooner jogged along under nothing double reefed mainsail fore staysail jib in order that might not run away from slow moving consort then impatience so far mastered that proposed to st croix that must take up quarter aboard curlew a have renamed don cristoval leave felucca to follow at leisure for two whole day frenchman obdurately rejected proposal on third perseverance triumphed late in afternoon parted company with muette having st croix on board schooner with one of krumen who assured knew creek on river from shark point up to boma small canoe understood to say must be absolute necessity if wished for success in hazardous attempt arrived off mouth of river on following evening about hour before sunset nothing being in sight at once stood in to make entrance sky be overcast night promised to be dark be in favour since darkness must help to conceal presence while mouth of river being free from danger must easily feel way in with lead fortunately for impatience fresh breeze happened to be blowing from westward therefore crowded sail upon schooner despite strong current fetched up abreast of shark point about three bell in first watch when rounded to came to single anchor in three fathom in diego bay just inside river mouth in accordance with plan have already made now became necessary for to leave schooner to accompany st croix on reconnoitring expedition be given to understand must occupy whole of next day including time necessary to return to schooner good part of succeeding night have not made up mind to very decisive step without due consideration for fully recognised exceedingly perilous character of adventure felt convinced from st croix have told that only hope of success lay in taking josefa slave factory by surprise so preventing possibility of slave being driven off to place of safe hiding at first alarm to accomplish surprise successfully be absolutely necessary must make fully acquainted by personal observation with feature of position attiring therefore in old suit of slop embarked with st croix kruman in small canoe leaving schooner in charge of young adam when under impulse of small sail shoved off sped rapidly in darkness up river chapter iv trapped kruman who acted a pilot undoubtedly appeared a st croix have asserted to know river thoroughly for dark a night be evinced sign whatever of doubt hesitation perched up in stern of canoe steered with short paddle laid out over quarter sat silent motionless a bronze image holding boat head straight for unseen point never swerving hair breadth from course until at expiration of about two hour suddenly found entering tolerably wide creek only distinguishable a such by deeper more palpable darkness enveloped a canoe slid in between bush lined bank be taciturn trio st croix having scarcely uttered word since shoved off from schooner while a for thought be too full of adventure before to leave much inclination for speech navigated winding creek for about three quarter of hour passing several branch on way then a kruman brought canoe noiselessly alongside low gravelly bank st croix leaned forward laying hand upon mine remarked in whisper land here mon ami remainder of journey must perform on foot if desire not throat to be cut tread cautiously for ze bush be full of snake be pleasant little item of news truly to be told on dark night while feeling one way along bush path so narrow so overgrown that darkness be absolutely thing to be felt be part of adventure so murmured acknowledgment of caution stepped over gunwale of canoe on to bank gravel of crunched under foot with alarming loudness in oppressive silence of hot damp night a did so st croix said something to kruman in language did not understand next instant received crashing blow on head from hard heavy instrument thousand star danced before eye a reeled forward under impact of stroke then knew more when
